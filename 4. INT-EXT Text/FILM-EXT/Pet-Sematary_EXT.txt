A GRAVE MARKER
SUMMER DAY
It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in
black paint which has faded: SMUCKY
HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters
are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a
child.
MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER
A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating:
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER
1971-1974.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
TWO MARKERS
I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers
themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers
there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut
butter jars, etc.
These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1,
1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL
1958 (another board).
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
FIVE OR SIX MARKERS
We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the
"gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that
this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated --
animal graveyard.
We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER
LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood,
painstakingly hammered flat.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.
ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY
From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by
forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are
arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard
clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which
hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the
words on the arch face those arriving along the path.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU
MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is
the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.
THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY
DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking
across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead
branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet
from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.
AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the
deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible
snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence?
Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA
HOLDS ON IT and then we
DISSOLVE TO:
BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.
A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
EVENING
SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...
To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the
woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.
The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a
shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN
REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a
bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.
GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts
between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver
body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it
comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the
driveway of the house we've been looking at.
REAR OF THE WAGON
As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the
license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED
YOUR M.D. TODAY?)
The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:
ELLIE CREED (voice)
Is this our new house, daddy?
LOUIS CREED (voice)
This is it.
THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE
The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32,
gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out
from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a
girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.
They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon,
still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.
LOUIS
So...what do you think?
RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.
RACHEL
It's gorgeous!
ELLIE
Am I really gonna have my own room?
LOUIS
Yes.
ELLIE
Yaay!
She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging
down from the bough of a tree.
ELLIE (to RACHEL)
Is that a swing?
RACHEL
Yes, but the rope might be--
ELLIE
Yaay!
She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.
LOUIS
Let her go. It's cool.
RACHEL
Louis, the house is beautiful.
They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws
her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the
car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.
RACHEL
The Master of Disaster awakes.
This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.
LOUIS
And Buckaroo Banzai.
RACHEL
Come on--let's parole 'em.
They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors,
LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.
THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS
He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big
tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.
ELLIE (voice)
Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!
LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:
ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING
She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.
THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV
We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up
its flank and into the dark woods.
THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.
RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)
RACHEL (irritated)
Not so high, Ellie! You don't know
how strong that rope is.
She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then
stands there, looking at his sister.
THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU
The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping
through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is
fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is
going to have a great fall.
LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)
He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.
ELLIE (raptuous voice)
Wheee!
LOUIS
Ellie, you heard your m---
His eyes widen.
ELLIE
ELLIE
Wh--
SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with
ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams
and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.
LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.
LOUIS				RACHEL
Ellie! Are you all right?	Honey? Are you okay?
ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old
girl.
ELLIE
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
LOUIS
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't
ready for intensive care just yet--
looks like she just skinned her knee.
Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from
the tire. RACHEL helps.
GAGE
He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly
forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a
bit; the boy needs a change.
He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses
interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station
wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a
moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never
got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the
mesh.
GAGE
Hi-Durch!
CHURCH
Waow!
GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap.
Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the
strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.
SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.
THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)
A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in
blue letters--blasts by.
GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his
forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by
GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.
GAGE
Druck!
He starts down the driveway toward the road.
LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)
ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the
wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much
from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine
her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.
LOUIS (to RACHEL)
Would you get the first aid kit?
ELLIE (screaming)
Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the
stingy stuff, daddy!
RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:
THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)
No one there.
RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING
RACHEL
Gage's gone!
LOUIS
Jesus, the road!
They get up together.
GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD
A truck is coming. A great big one.
ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU
The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.
GAGE
He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab
him.
GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is
used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers
are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.
GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL
The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old
blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears
a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply
wrinkled and kindly.
JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
No you don't, my friend--not in
that road.
But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.
GAGE
Drucks!
JUD (low)
No shit, Sherlock.
JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's
joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE
brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.
RACHEL
Gage!
JUD (hands him to her)
He was headed for the road, looked
like. I corralled him for you, missus.
RACHEL
Thank you. Thank you so much.
LOUIS
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no
crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as
if he might have arthritis.
JUD
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
RACHEL
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving
the wandering minstrel boy, here.
JUD
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch
out for that road. Those damn trucks go
back and forth all day and most of the
night.
He leans over toward ELLIE.
JUD
Who might you be, little Miss?
ELLIE
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642
Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)
At least, I used to.
JUD
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,
and your dad's gonna be the new doctor
up to the college, I hear, and I think
you're going to be just as happy as a
clam here, Ellen Creed.
ELLIE (to LOUIS)
Are clams really happy?
They all laugh--even GAGE.
RACHEL
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to
change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
JUD
Same here. Come over and visit when
you get the chance.
As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:
ELLIE (worries)
Daddy, do I really have to have the
stingy stuff?
LOUIS
No-I guess not.
ELLIE
Yayyy!
She goes belting off.
JUD (amused)
I guess your daughter there ain't
going to die after all.
LOUIS (also amused)
I guess not.
JUD
House has stood empty for too long.
It's damn good to see people in it again.
SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.
A MOVING VAN
It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.
LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS
Hey--they actually found the place!
JUD
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I
usually sit out on my porch of an evening
and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.
Come on over and join me, if you want.
LOUIS
Well, maybe I----
RACHEL (voice)
Louis, what's this?
RACHEL AND GAGE
GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores
the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to
the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path
ELLIE has already glimpsed.
LOUIS AND JUD
They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just
climbing out of the van.
FIRST MOVER
You Mr. Creed?
LOUIS
Yes. Just a second.
RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at
that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the
deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.
LOUIS
The movers--
RACHEL
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does
it go?
LOUIS
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw
the house, this field was under four feet
of snow.
RACHEL (smiling)
I bet Mr. Crandall knows!
JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that
he is serious.
JUD
Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and
a good walk, too. I'll take you up there
sometime, and tell you the story, too--
after you get settled in.
He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of
understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference
between the CREEDS and JUD.
THE CREED HOUSE
NIGHT
SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree...
There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the
path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being
mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.
THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
NIGHT
Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly
up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.
JUD (voice)
That you, doc?
THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of
JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman
earphones.
LOUIS
LOUIS
It's me.
THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)
One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are
little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too--
sweeps by in a blast of air.
ROUTE 9
NIGHT
LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA
FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He
pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new
house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his
attention the other way...toward the path.
He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in
a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.
A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS
recoils with a startled, muffled cry.
CHURCH
The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!
LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
LOUIS
Church! God, you scared the life
out of me!
CHURCH
Waow!
LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND
comes again and he looks toward:
THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV
Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.
LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS (to the cat)
I know one thing that will keep you
home, good buddy.
He starts toward the house.
BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD
SPEAK.
AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD
They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them
catch up.
JUD
Take a look behind you.
They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.
LOUIS
My God!
RACHEL
It's beautiful!
THE VIEW
It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9
just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning
along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river
valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.
AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS
JUD
You folks ready to go on?
LOUIS
Sure.
ELLIE
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
JUD
You'll see soon enough, hon.
They go into the woods, still following the path.
FOREST
DAY
These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight
shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his
mark here.
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is
carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.
JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there
are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps
are.
LOUIS
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
companies?
JUD
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up
ahead is all that's left of their
tribal lands.
ELLIE (giggling)
Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.
JUD (smiles)
Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?
You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
LOUIS
Not yet...how much further is it?
JUD
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him.
LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then
they press on.
THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY
JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH
JUD (stopping)
This is the place, honey.
ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch
but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.
ELLIE
What's it say, mommy?
A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like
this. Not a bit.
RACHEL
It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's
misspelled, but...that's what it
says.
She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.
RACHEL
Ellen--!
ELLIE
She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.
RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
RACHEL (a bit lame)
Be careful.
ELLIE
She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.
RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.
JUD
I told you it was a bad road,
Louis--it's killed a lot of pets
and made a lot of kids unhappy.
But at least something good come
of it. This place.
ELLIE (excited voice)
Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!
ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY
She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs
toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as
she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.
RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is
extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and
clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.
RACHEL
How can you call it a good thing?
A graveyard for pets killed in the
road! Built and maintained by broken-
hearted children!
JUD
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't
quite that way, deah!
LOUIS
I think it's rather extraordinary.
RACHEL
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.
JUD
Well...they have to learn about death
somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?
The little ones?
RACHEL (coldly)
Why?
JUD
Well...well, because--
ELLIE (voice)
Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!
ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL
She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely
dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her
life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches
nimbly to the next one up.
THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH
JUD (alarmed)
No, honey! You don't want to go
climbing on that! Come on down!
He hurries in.
ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL
She looks back at JUD.
ELLIE
It's okay, Mr. Crandall--
ELLIE'S FOOT, CU
The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down
suddenly.
ELLIE AND JUD
She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as
she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.
LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.
LOUIS
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
ELLIE
Well, I thought it was safe--
JUD
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns
like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
ELLIE
Bite?
JUD
Ayuh.
RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to
come in.
RACHEL (calls)
Is she all right, Louis?
LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE
LOUIS (calls back)
Fine! Come and see!
RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
RACHEL (calling)
I think I'll sit this one out, doc.
LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL
ELLIE
I want to look around, daddy--
may I?
LOUIS
For a little while.
JUD looks toward:
RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)
RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of
the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.
LOUIS AND JUD
JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS
looks away.
ELLIE (voice)
Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!
ELLIE
She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a
kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at
SMUCKY'S.
LOUIS AND JUD
They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the
tombstones.
LOUIS
I can hardly read these.
JUD
Ayuh--they get older as you go
toward the middle. (Points) Pete
LaVasseur's dog is buried there...
(points) the Stoppard boys' racing
pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat
got...and I think that's the cat
himself right there, although it's
been so many years I can't tell for
sure.
(calling)
Missy Ellen! Come over here just a
minute!
ELLEN
She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to
the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the
adults.
JUD
I see you're quite a reader for such
a little girl. Can you read that?
He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.
ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER
It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the
words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.
ELLEN
"Spot a good fellow we love you boy."
(Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."
Gee, I can't read the rest.
JUD AND LOUIS
JUD
Last name's Crandall, little missy.
LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.
JUD
That's where I buried my dog Spot
when he died of old age in 19 and
14. Dug it good and deep. By the
time I finished, I had blisters all
over my hands and a hell of a crick
in my back. Soil's stony up here.
ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.
JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is
still looking at ELLEN.
JUD
Do you know what this place is,
Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a
boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing
and even a whole pile of 'em don't
amount to much. Do you know what a
graveyard really is?
ELLIE
Well...I guess not.
JUD
It's a place where the dead speak,
Missy.
He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her
hair reassuringly.
JUD
No--not right out loud. Their stones
speak...or their markers. Even if the
marker ain't nothing but a tin can
someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,
it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
LOUIS
I think it is so, Ellie.
ELLIE
What if you can't read what's
written on there anymore?
JUD
Well, it still says some animal got
laid down here after, don't it?
ELLIE
Yes--
LOUIS
And that someone cared enough about
that animal to mark the spot.
ELLIE
To remember.
JUD (smiles)
Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary
place, Ellie. It's a place of rest
and speaking. Can you remember that?
ELLIE (a little awed)
Yes, sir.
They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.
RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH
It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.
RACHEL (calls)
Louis, can we go? I'm tired!
LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
ELLIE
Mommy! This is a place where dead
animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!
RACHEL AND ELLIE
But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.
RACHEL (soft)
Did he.
LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries
of any kind. As you may have noticed.
JUD
Me neither. But I believe in knowing
your enemy.
LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He
laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.
THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE
The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.
LOUIS (voice)
Did we take too long?
RACHEL (curt)
Well, if supper's burned, I'm not
the one going out for pizza.
They move away.
THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH
The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when
the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.
ROUTE 9
NIGHT
Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.
THE CREED HOUSE
MORNING
The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it
across the lawn, with her lunch-box.
LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY
RACHEL
Have a great day!
LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.
GAGE
Bye-bye!
THE BUS
ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls
away.
THE CREED DRIVEWAY
MORNING
The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy
briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens
the wagon's doorgate.
A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS.
A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the
front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She
looks at the cat-carrier.
MISSY
Gonna get his--
LOUIS
--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,
for introducing that colorful phrase
into my daughter's vocabulary.
MISSY
Don't mention it.
She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat
pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an
attack of indigestion.
LOUIS (sees this)
How's that belly-ache of yours?
MISSY (gets the sheets)
No better and no worse.
LOUIS
You ought to see a doctor about it.
MISSY
It'll pass. They always do.
She starts toward the house with the sheets.
THE SIDE YARD
MORNING
RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into
the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the
wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.
RACHEL (anxious)
Still friends, doc?
LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then
he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.
RACHEL
Thank God. I was a little worried
there. Have a great first day at
school, doc. No broken bones.
LOUIS (smiles)
Not so much as a sprain.
VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS
MORNING
PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one
girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to
drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the
bearers.
PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead
of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has
been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male
of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red
jogging shorts.
THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to
mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on
break to either side. The infirmary doors open.
She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.
CHARLTON
Holy Jesus.
(turns)
Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,
we've got a mess here! Stat!
The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of
blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.
A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON
It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here
comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels
to TRACK.
RADIO (voice-over)
Tragedy struck on the first day of the
University of Maine's fall semester
when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old
sophomore--
THE STATION WAGON
IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.
THE CREED HOUSE
NIGHT
All lights are off. It's late.
THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG
NIGHT
We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW
and, behind him, LOUIS.
THE PET SEMATARY ARCH
CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.
LOUIS, CLOSE
He looks around, obviously afraid.
THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV
We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.
LOUIS
He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to
terror.
THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV
The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.
LOUIS
He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls
on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.
PASCOW, CLOSE
He really is a dreadful mangled mess.
PASCOW
This is the place where the dead speak.
LOUIS
He closes his eyes.
LOUIS
I want to wake up. I want to wake up,
that's all. I--
LOUIS AND PASCOW
PASCOW
The door must not be opened. The
barrier must not be crossed. Don't
go on, doc. No matter how much you
feel you have to. There's more
power here than you know.
He points at:
THE DEADFALL
That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as
well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting
through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.
After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind
the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before.
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree
like a toothpick.
PASCOW AND LOUIS
LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly
shut.
LOUIS
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me
alone. It's not my fault you died; you
were as good as dead when they brought
you in--
PASCOW
The power of this place is old and
always restless. Sometimes the dead
do more than speak. Remember, doc.
CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.
LOUIS
Leave me alone!
PASCOW
Remember.
CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.
RADIO (voice)
--another beautiful day in Maine!
This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that
the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.
Temps are going all the way up to 70...
We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's
"Sheena."
As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":
THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG
We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of
those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and
windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.
LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.
JUD (voice)
Well?
THE CAT'S BODY
It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--
LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's
head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into
THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.
LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN
LOUIS
It's Church.
JUD
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like
he suffered.
LOUIS
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and
hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground
while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:
JUD
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
LOUIS
Yes.
LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on
it. Then he holds it up.
LOUIS
Bagged cat. What a mess.
JUD
You going to bury him in the Pet
Sematary?
LOUIS (a little bitter)
I guess that's what it's there for, huh?
During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.
JUD
Going to tell Ellie?
LOUIS
I don't know.
JUD
Seems like you told me about a promise
you made--
THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS
LOUIS (defensive)
That was a mistake. But Rachel...
she doesn't like to talk about
death, or even think of it. Her
younger sister died of spinal
meningitis when Rachel was eight.
Rachel was there when it happened.
Alone. I guess you could say it
made a complex.
JUD
Cat's just as dead, Louis.
LOUIS (snaps)
Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm
sorry, Jud.
JUD
No need to apologize.
LOUIS
Maybe when they call I'll just tell
Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat
around. You know?
JUD (after a long pause)
Maybe there's a better way.
THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG
EVENING
LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the
other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of
his own in the other.
Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.
JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.
LOUIS AND JUD
JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones
slung around his neck.
LOUIS
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to
be almost dark before we get back.
JUD
It's going to be dark before we even
get where we're going, Louis. But
we can do it...and we're going to.
LOUIS
But--
JUD
Does she love the cat?
LOUIS
Yes, but--
JUD
Then come on.
He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further
argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear
Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a
moment, LOUIS follows.
THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH
LATE EVENING
The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...
The SOUND of footfalls.
Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working
For A Living."
It's now almost twilight.
JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around
curiously.
LOUIS
Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
Creed Dreamland.
JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck
again.
JUD
What say, Louis?
LOUIS
Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on
the outer circle or start a new one?
JUD
We're still not where we're going.
He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.
LOUIS
What do you mean?
JUD
The place we're going is on the
other side of that.
He points at the deadfall.
LOUIS
We can't climb over that. We'll break
our necks!
JUD
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time
or two before, and I know all the places
to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't
look down...and don't stop. If you stop,
you'll crash through for sure.
LOUIS
I'm not climbing that.
JUD
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it
myself.
He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as
he says. After a moment he says:
LOUIS
Let's go.
JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its
snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of
stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.
LOUIS (low)
Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.
THEIR FEET
First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the
swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.
LOUIS
He's grinning, exhilarated.
LOUIS
God, this is amazing!
JUD
There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both
stern and a little scared.
JUD
Just don't stop and--
LOUIS
He looks down.
LOUIS'S FEET
A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot
plunges down maybe six inches.
LOUIS
He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.
LOUIS
And don't look down. Right.
He continues.
THE DEADFALL, REVERSE
TWILIGHT
JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches
the top.
LOUIS
LOUIS (amazed)
Holy...!
BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-
inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines
and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias.
The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an
old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path
goes on.
LOUIS
He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with
frank amazement.
JUD
JUD (turns to look)
Come on, Louis--don't stop!
LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL
LOUIS (grinning)
I'm all right! I'm f--
LOUIS'S FEET
One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.
LOUIS, JUD'S POV
We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.
LOUIS, CLOSER
He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his
back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight
also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.
JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL
LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.
JUD
Louis! You all right?
LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is
torn. His ankle is bleeding.
LOUIS (dazed)
Sure. I guess I just lost my happy
thoughts for a second there.
LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather
shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.
LOUIS (continues)
I shouldn't have stopped...and it
does bite.
He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the
light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.
JUD
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But
you got away with it. Important thing
is are you sure you're all right?
LOUIS
Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?
JUD
You'll see before long. Let's go.
He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying
the bag.
LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL
Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go
tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient
firs.
SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...
DISSOLVE TO:
LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP
TWILIGHT
Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND
OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS,
THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.
LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.
JUD
This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--
you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow
me and don't look down.
LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV
DEEP TWILIGHT
Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like
twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks
covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking
underbrush.
All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.
LOUIS AND JUD
JUD
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
LOUIS
Is there quicksand?
JUD
Ayuh.
LOUIS (nervous; joking)
Are there ghosts?
JUD looks at him expressionlessly.
JUD
Ayuh.
JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment,
LOUIS follows.
JUD, CU
His face is set, strange.
JUD
There's a lot of funny things down
this way, Louis.
LOUIS, BEHIND JUD
LOUIS
You're telling me.
JUD
JUD (still walking)
The air's heavier...more electrical...
something. You might see St. Elmo's
Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'
It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.
LOUIS
HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:
ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV
A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of
the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it
looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.
As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.
LOUIS
He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being
scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the
surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades
into the thick mist.
LOUIS
It's funny, all right.
JUD
JUD
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't
ever want to stop down here in
Little God. (Pause) And you don't
ever want to look behind you,
whatever you hear.
JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE
NIGHT
We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his
digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The
whole swamp is glowing dimly.
THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP
NIGHT
In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a
thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it
and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head
into the woods on the far side.
A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL
In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see
steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling
up them.
JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse
shape.
JUD
Almost there, Louis.
LOUIS
You keep saying that.
JUD
This time I mean it.
He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars,
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments
later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.
THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV
The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a
number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see,
there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst
apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the
Pet Sematary: concentric circles.
SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.
LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND
LOUIS (awed)
What is this place?
JUD
This was their burying ground, Louis.
LOUIS
Whose burying ground?
JUD
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here
to bury Ellen's cat.
LOUIS
Why? For God's sake, why?
JUD
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.
All right?
LOUIS
I guess so...but...
JUD
You want to rest a bit before you start?
LOUIS
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to
dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
JUD
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
He hands him the pick and shovel.
JUD
I'm going to sit over yonder and have a
smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to
do it yourself. Each buries his own.
That's how it was done then.
JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand
and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out
into the burying ground.
LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE
NIGHT
SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.
The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude
from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom,
and flashes fire.
LOUIS
He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside
him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.
JUD (voice)
Should be deep enough.
He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.
LOUIS
You think so?
He notices the rocks.
LOUIS
What are those for?
JUD
Your cairn.
THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV
Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.
LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE
LOUIS
Doesn't look like they last long.
JUD
Don't worry about that.
LOUIS
Jud, why am I doing all this?
JUD
Because it's right.
He walks off again.
LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.
LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG
He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.
LOUIS
Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You
were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if
you were worth all this aggravation,
but you were a hell of a good cat.
He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.
THE CAIRN, CU
NIGHT
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three
stones.
LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN
He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.
JUD
That's fine. You did real good.
LOUIS looks at him.
THE CREED HOUSE
NIGHT
There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence
at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.
LOUIS'S FIELD
NIGHT
LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their
lights. They are both clearly fagged out.
SOUND, FAINT: The telephone.
LOUIS
Oh, shit! Rachel!
He drops the tools and sprints.
THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING
LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.
THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS
He runs to the door and inside.
THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD
He stands there, eyes inscrutable.
THE ROAD, WITH JUD
SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:
DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
Goldman residence.
LOUIS
Hi, Dory...it's Louis--
During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck.
As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear
on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for
tonight's piece of work.
A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA
and JUD.
THE CREED HOUSE
MORNING
LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the
tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake
against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.
THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS
It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates
to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat
HISS. He turns.
THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV
Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.
LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU
THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS
He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.
LOUIS
Food, Church...food!
SOUND: Miaow.
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV
CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward
THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.
LOUIS
LOUIS
Come on, Church! Chow down!
CHURCH
He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.
LOUIS (to himself)
Christ. I don't believe this.
He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.
LOUIS (wincing)
God, you stink, Church.
CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.
LOUIS
In a second.
He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S
neck.
CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)
There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A
line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all
grows.
LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP
LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes
something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.
LOUIS'S HAND, ECU
It's a shred of green plastic.
LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS
Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded
Christ, he ch--
CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.
LOUIS
Ow!
He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS
slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek,
welling blood. He looks at the cat.
JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD
The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling
slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several
pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a
Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear
the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along
and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you
can dig it.
He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.
He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is
right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking
totally stunned.
JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the
phones off JUD'S ears.
LOUIS
What did we do?
JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE
DAY
The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's
crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to
keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.
JUD (voice)
I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot
died, I thought I was gonna die.
JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives
in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt
rather than tar.
Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The
wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap.
Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING
SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.
STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he
draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost
falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and
approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.
THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE
DAY
JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line.
The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them,
quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with
graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the
sheets with the muck of his passage.
JUD (voice)
My mother was with me.
She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming,
horrified.
SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA
JUD (voice)
He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.
You could still see the marks on him.
And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head.
These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on
CHURCH.
SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams
heard in a dream.
THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA
The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.
JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)
She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT
stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.
JUD'S MOM (dim; far)
Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the
ground you buried him in! Come here
and get your dog!
She is in utter terror.
THE BOY JUD/SEPIA
Horrified...ashamed.
JUD'S MOM/SEPIA
JUD'S MOM (terror)
COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!
THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
We see them crossing.
LOUIS (voice)
You still haven't told me why you
did it.
JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN
JUD
A man doesn't always know why he does
things, Louis. I think I did it because
your daughter ain't ready for her
favorite pet to die.
LOUIS
What?
JUD
Ellie's a little scared of death. And
the main reason Ellie's that way is
because your wife is a lot scared of
death. Now you just go ahead and tell
me I'm wrong.
But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has
hit the nail right on the head.
A DELTA 727
Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor
International Airport.
THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT
One light on...a cellar light.
SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...then...
SOUND: Kick! THUMP!
SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...
IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH
DAY
People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on
the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.
In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a
coffin into it.
LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS
ELLIE
They're all turning on their lights!
Daddy, why are they all turning on
their lights in the middle of the day?
JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out
and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.
JUD
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
ELLIE
Is that right, dad?
LOUIS
Yes. To honor the dead.
THE CHURCH PARKING AREA
More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the
hearse swing closed.
LUDLOW CEMETARY
DAY
[NOTE: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night
because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such
problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and
the public road.]
The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY
DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.
MINISTER (voice)
May the Lord bless you and keep you;
may the Lord make his face to shine
upon you, and comfort you, and lift
you up, and give you peace. Amen.
LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward
LOUIS'S car.
JUD
Rachel not feeling well?
LOUIS
Well...a touch of the flu...
ELLIE
She's in bed. She was throwing up.
Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said
Missy--
LOUIS
That's enough, Ellen.
They've reached the CREED station wagon.
JUD
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
LOUIS
This babe has said enough.
He opens the front passenger door.
LOUIS
Hop in, Ellie.
She does, and LOUIS closes the door.
JUD
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to
hear. I remember when she was
no older'n Ellen there, walking down
to the store with her Raggedy Anne
doll draggin' behind her in the dust.
I don't know why God takes someone
like her, who should have a bunch of
years still in front of them, and lets
an old shit like me just go on and on.
LOUIS
My father used to have a saying, Jud--
"God sees the truth, but waits."
JUD
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
LOUIS
It's Ellie's cat.
JUD
Nope. He's your cat now.
JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the
driver's side.
THE STATION WAGON, DAY
Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall
foliage.
THE GRILLE OF A TRUCK
DAY
It looks monstrous...as high as a mountain.
THE TRUCK, A NEW ANGLE
It's an Orinco tanker. The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues
and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab. He slams the door and
jams the truck into gear.
IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
I knew something like this would happen.
THE ORINCO SHIPPING YARD
DAY
The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate...stops so the
driver can look both ways...and then pulls slowly out onto ROUTE
9.
IRWIN (voice continues)
I told her when you were first married.
'You'll have all the grief you can stand,
and more,' I said.
ROUTE 9, W/TRUCK
DAY
Getting up to speed.
A KITE, CU
There's a hand holding it--LOUIS'S. The kite begins to move and
THE CAMERA TRACKS IT. It flaps and flutters.
THE FIELD BESIDE THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS
He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat
clouds move like airy ocean liners.
ELLIE (voice)
Go, daddy!
A PICNIC TABLE
DAY
The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here. Looks like everyone
ate well. In attendance: RACHEL, ELLIE, GAGE, and JUD CRANDALL.
GAGE
Go, dayee!
They all laugh--JUD ruffles the kid's hair.
LOUIS, RUNNING WITH THE KITE
He's paying out string--and the kite is going up.
LOUIS (voice)
Where's Rachel?
ROUTE 9, TRUCKER'S POV
Unrolling before us at a good clip--too good, maybe.
THE ONCOMING TRUCK
Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE.
THE SKY, WITH THE KITE
LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay.
LOUIS, IN THE FIELD
He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back
at the picnic table.
LOUIS
Hey, Gage!
THE PICNIC TABLE
GAGE gets down and runs toward his father.
ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER
Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones.
THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE
GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and
LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands.
GAGE
Dat?
LOUIS
String! You're flying it,
Gage--you got the hammer, my man!
GAGE
Gage fline it?
LOUIS
Bet your boots. Look--
LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.
THE KITE
It dips in the sky.
LOUIS AND GAGE
LOUIS
See?
GAGE
Gage fline it!!
LOUIS (tenderly)
Bet your ass, little hero.
He kisses his son. They look up at:
THE KITE
Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky.
IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
Where were you while he was playing in
the road? Thinking about your stupid
medical articles? You stinking shit!
You killer of children!
LOUIS AND GAGE WITH THE KITE, IN THE FIELD
We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them
have moved quite close to the road.
LOUIS AND GAGE, A NEW ANGLE (KITE'S POV)
We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the AMPLIFIED
RATTLING SOUND of the kite itself.
THE CAMERA PANS TO THE LEFT--to the road. And we can see the
truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer.
THE PICNIC TABLE, WITH RACHEL, ELLIE, AND JUD
JUD'S lighting a cigarette. His Walkman 'phones are around his
neck.
ELLIE
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,
mommy!
RACHEL
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his
turn.
LOUIS AND GAGE
This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's
make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite:
IRWIN (voice)
Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry--
LOUIS AND GAGE, IN THE FIELD
There's a strong gust of wind. The ball of string falls out of
GAGE'S hand.
THE KITE, BLOWING AWAY
THE PICNIC TABLE
ELLIE
It got away from him! That numb shit!
RACHEL (outraged)
Ellen Creed!
THE BALL OF KITE TWINE
It is bouncing and unraveling. More importantly, it is being
carried directly toward the highway.
GAGE
He takes off after the ball of twine.
GAGE
Kite fline too fast!
SOUND: The oncoming truck.
THE TRUCK
Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels.
LOUIS
He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table.
LOUIS (shrugs, good-humored)
What can you d-
TRUCK SOUND CONTINUES.
THE PICNIC TABLE
TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.
Alarm hits JUD'S face. He rises.
JUD
Don't let him go in the road, Louis!
RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm.
RACHEL (screams)
Get him, Louis!
GAGE
He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which
has now almost reached the road.
TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.
LOUIS
The SOUND is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing.
LOUIS (cups his ear)
What?
THE PICNIC TABLE
RACHEL (shrieks)
GET THE BABY!!
JUD is running toward the road, although he'll never get to GAGE
in time; only LOUIS has a chance.
LOUIS
Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and
sees:
GAGE, LOUIS'S POV
The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it.
RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK.
THE ONCOMING TRUCK
GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD
GAGE (cheerful)
Geddit-geddit-geddit!
EVERYONE, KITE'S POV
GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the
corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the
side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table.
JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him.
GAGE, IN THE ROAD
As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string.
SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK.
GAGE turns his head.
GAGE (not afraid)
Druck!
THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV
Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror.
He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN.
LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD
LOUIS (shrieks)
NO!!
GAGE
BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an
audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen-
dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a
ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face.
PHOTO MONTAGE
a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a
wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does
LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed
bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.
b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a
baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.
c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of
present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS
and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a
drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm.
d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood.
e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up
in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap.
GAGE looks c. but c.
f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE
is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair.
He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing.
g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9.
h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's
wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single
candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the
other.
i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn,
blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky
and screaming.
j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at
us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while:
JUD (voice)
Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep.
ON THE STAIRS WITH LOUIS, WIDER
For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of
falling. He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across
the dining room toward the kitchen.
LOUIS regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down.
A COUNTRY RAILROAD STATION/SEPIA
DAY
The time is the late summer of 1944, although I don't believe we
need to know that specifically. The sign on the station reads
LUDLOW. There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they
have gas-ration coupons on the windshields. And a hearse.
A train is coming.
THE HEARSE, WITH UNDERTAKER AND BILL BATERMAN/SEPIA
We can see the UNDERTAKER is trying to talk to BILL BATERMAN, a
man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana.
BILL walks away. He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort.
He's a grief-stricken, bitter man.
JUD (voice over)
Timmy Baterman was on his way home
from the war with his Purple Heart
when he got killed in some stupid
car accident down in Georgia.
THE TRAIN, IN FRONT OF THE DEPOT/SEPIA
The door of the mail-car is open. The UNDERTAKER and three
trainmen are unloading TIMMY BATERMAN'S coffin, which is draped in
a 48-star flag. BILL BATERMAN stands by, watching balefully as
they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and
load it in.
JUD (v-o continues)
Bill was bitter--his son had been in
the thick of it two years and then got
shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound.
He was supposed to be coming home safe
and sound. Instead, he come home in a
box after all.
THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA
The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL
BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his
brow.
JUD (v-o continues)
He wasn't able to get to the bottom
of the truth, Louis.
THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA
DUSK
We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck,
showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives
slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at
the grave and then goes to the back of his truck.
JUD (voice-over)
Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as
I remember.
BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA
DUSK
He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel.
DISSOLVE TO:
MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA
DAY
She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got
a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the
sun. She's staring at something, horrified.
JUD (v-o continues)
It was four or five days later when...
A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA
DAY
A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the
road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is
sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of
healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of
his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident.
JUD (v-o continues)
...Margie Washburn seen him walking
up the road toward Yorkie's Livery.
MARGIE/SEPIA
She's screaming--we hear her faintly.
TIMMY/SEPIA
He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's
fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins
at MARGIE.
IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA
She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the
door.
JUD (v.o.)
Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman
walking back and forth between the
home place and the town line. But
it was Margie...
THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA
SUNSET
It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate
of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill.
An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out.
SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS.
They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime
honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer.
SOUND: Crazy laughter.
BILL BATERMAN (voice)
Stop that, Timmy!
The four men look at each other.
JUD
Come on.
They start around to the back.
THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA
TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes
glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane.
BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the
sun.
THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA
The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when
they see BILL and TIMMY.
ALAN
Oh holy Jesus lookit that.
BILL whirls around and sees them.
BILL
You men get out of here!
JUD
I heard your boy was killed down
Georgia.
BILL (agitated)
That was a mistake!
HANNIBAL
Was it?
BILL
You see him standing there,
don't you? Now get out! Get the
Christ off my land!
Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward.
TIMMY (laughing)
Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an!
GEORGE (revolted)
Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can
smell him!
BILL
He ain't dead! Give him a day or two
and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!
JUD
Bill, this ain't right--you can see
that yourself--
BILL (screaming)
GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!!
TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA
TIMMY (laughing)
Dead! We love dead! Hate living!
Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his
cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh. Blood flows sluggishly
out. Very weird blood.
THE ENTIRE GROUP/SEPIA
BILL grabs TIMMY, who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned
around. TIMMY shambles back to where he was originally standing.
BILL goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained
baboon. A stupid trained baboon.
BILL (over his shoulder)
You want to get out of here before I get
my shotgun! You boys are trespassing!
THE FOUR MEN/SEPIA
JUD
God help you, Bill.
BILL AND TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA
BILL (snarls)
God never helped me. I helped
myself.
TIMMY BATERMAN, CU/SEPIA
Staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly,
mindlessly.
THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE
NIGHT
a.) A car pulls up with its lights off and stops.
JUD (v.o.)
There was a fire.
b.) We see legs as people get out of the car, and hands holding
tin cans of gasoline.
c.) Hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the
house.
THE BATERMAN PORCH
NIGHT
JUD (as a young man) rings the bell--an old-fashioned twist type.
BILL (voice)
Who's there?
TIMMY (laughing, screeching voice)
Ooo air? Ooo air?
JUD
Get out, Billy--the place is
going up.
He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks
out the window.
BILL
I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!
THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE
NIGHT
a.) A match is struck...and applied to wet boards. Whoosh!
b.) The other side of the house: The same.
c.) In the back yard, JUD lights a torch and heaves it through the
kitchen windows. Ka-PLOOM!
d.) The men draw away toward the front, their faces grim and
judgmental.
THE BATERMAN PLACE
NIGHT
Burning. Going up fast.
THE MEN
ALAN
You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud?
JUD (stony)
If he don't, he don't.
THE FRONT DOOR
It bursts open. We see two men struggling at the forefront of an
inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster. TIMMY is
giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the
flames.
BILL (struggling)
No! No, Timmy! Let me go!
TIMME (laughing)
Love dead! Hate living!
He sinks his teeth into his father's arm. BILL screams.
A beam falls on TIMMY, lighting him afire. BILL breaks free and
runs down the porch steps.
THE FRONT YARD
NIGHT
BILL BATERMAN is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around
him, his face hidden against his thighs, weeping.
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the four men, who are grouped at the end
of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at:
THE BLAZING FARMHOUSE
NIGHT
DISSOLVE TO:
BANGOR INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL
DAY
A jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building.
GATE AGENT'S VOICE
This is the final call for United's
flight 61 to Chicago...
THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV
From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks
away.
LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT
Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away.
ROUTE 15 IN BREWER
The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware
and LOUIS crosses to it.
LUDLOW CEMETARY
DAY
The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops
and LOUIS gets out.
LOUIS
He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already
starting to wilt. He sits down and takes a flower. He plucks it,
looking at the grave steadily. He says nothing for a long time.
LOUIS
It's wrong. (Pause) What happened
to you is wrong.
GAGE, IN THE FIELD
He runs toward THE CAMERA, happy and laughing, in SLOW MOTION.
LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
LOUIS is now weeping, but he seems calm just the same.
PASCOW (voice)
Remember, doc.
LOUIS looks at:
A TOMB, LOUIS'S POV
PASCOW, bloody and mutilated, is standing by it.
PASCOW
The barrier was not meant to be
crossed. The ground is sour.
LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by PASCOW'S
appearance; he probably knows PASCOW is just a figment of his
conscience or imagination, and so do we.
LOUIS
I'll tell you where the ground
is sour--the ground in my heart
is sour. Let me tell you something
else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
PASCOW
PASCOW
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
LOUIS
Don't talk like an asshole even if
you are just a bit of underdone
potato or a blot of mustard.
PASCOW, BY THE TOMB
He stands mute, just looking.
LOUIS
LOUIS (weeping)
He was my son! He wasn't even two
and he was run down in the fucking
road and he was almost in pieces,
and if you don't think I'm going
to try...
THE TOMB, SANS PASCOW
VIC has put on his boogie shoes.
LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
He's crying harder. Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes
and knocks a bunch of them over.
LOUIS
If it doesn't work--if he comes
back like Timmy Baterman--I'll
put him to sleep. But I'm going
to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't
work...they don't ever need to know.
THE GOLDMAN HOUSE IN LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS
NIGHT
THE CREED HOME IN LUDLOW
NIGHT
SOUND: A car starting up.
The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway. As it
passes THE CAMERA, we see LOUIS driving. The wagon turns onto
Route 9 and heads off.
CAMERA HOLDS ON THE HOUSE. A beat of silence. Then: the telephone
starts ringing.
THE CRANDALL HOUSE
NIGHT
SOUND: Phone starts to ring.
LUDLOW CEMETERY
NIGHT
SOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off.
CAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the
road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon.
LOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then
tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.
LOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the
scene.
LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV
A quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree-
ree...
LOUIS
He heads for GAGE'S grave.
O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR
IRWIN'S car heads for it.
THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED
LOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing
equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then
opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave
for a long second.
LOUIS (low)
Gonna bust you out, son.
He starts to shovel.
THE SHOVEL, CU
Digging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the
excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is
new and fresh.
JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS
GAGE'S GRAVE
NIGHT
Now it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it.
We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.
LOUIS
NIGHT
He's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile.
Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND.
He tosses the shovel aside and squats.
IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS
There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of
GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt,
uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the
coffin with his hands.
THE CRANDALL PORCH
JUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones
are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at:
THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV
It's dark.
THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD
He sits down.
JUD
You done it, you stupid old man...
now you got to undo it.
He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette.
Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash
buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah."
JUD begins to watch.
LOUIS
He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to
pull out the pick.
SOUND of an approaching car.
LOUIS freezes.
THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY
A police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the
driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall.
LOUIS
Watching. Waiting. Hardly breathing.
THE POLICE CAR
It reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The
spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up.
LOUIS
He relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the
grave.
THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU
LOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and
levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the
lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in
the hinges.
LOUIS, CU
Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness.
JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE
LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
He's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt
grating in hinges again.
LOUIS, CU
We're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be
it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.
LOUIS
Oh, Gage--oh, honey.
JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH
His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his
'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a
long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty
beer cans on the table beside him.
A truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his
head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.
THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS
He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in
his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small
limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply.
LOUIS
It's going to be all right...I
swear it's going to be all right...
The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to
lay his son down on it.
THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU
It's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among
them.
LOUIS
He closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll. He then produces rope
from the duffle bag. He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece
around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his
son.
JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY
PILOT (voice)
Good evening again, ladies and
gentlemen...
THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS
He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the
tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the
SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall.
THE ROAD
Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the
wall.
LOUIS
Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating.
THE POLICE CAR
It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.
LOUIS
Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks
down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back.
LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.
Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.
THE COP
Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the
cemetery for a moment.
COP
I ain't afraid of no ghost.
He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.
LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL
He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously
over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down
on the other side of the road.
He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the
canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults
over.
THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS
He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by
the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy
territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.
THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS
He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No
keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The
other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt
feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.
SOUND: An approaching car.
PASSING CAR
A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.
LOUIS
He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing.
Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the
driver's side of the car and looks in at:
LOUIS
He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses
the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then
the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of
the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.
LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes
back to the front, gets in, and drives away.
THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS
It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.
THE JETWAY
NIGHT
RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it.
AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES.
RACHEL (screams)
COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!!
THE JET, RACHEL'S POV
It starts to swing back to pick her up.
RACHEL
PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.
PASCOW
You're doing just fine.
JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH
He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out
of his Walkman 'phones.
SOUND: An approaching car.
THE CREED HOUSE
The station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the
back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with
tools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge
of the path. He looks at:
THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV
Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.
LOUIS
He holds the corpse of his little boy to him.
LOUIS
Please God--let this work.
He sets off.
JUD, ON HIS PORCH
Zonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud.
OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS
Louis passes under like a ghost.
THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall.
LOUIS
Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't
gonna look down.
He begins to mount the deadfall.
LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE
He reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him,
facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face.
LOUIS descends the other side.
THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE
LOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at:
THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows
slightly.
LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH
LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP
That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of
CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick
up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts
through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart
man. I wouldn't either.
But he does.
LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP
He comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the
duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The
landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact
there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds
almost prehistoric.
SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER
LOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:
MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV
A demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD
THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.
Its eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the
sockets.
LOUIS
He closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.
LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV
Nothing there.
LOUIS
LOUIS
See? Just imagination. Just--
LOUIS'S FEET
We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is
standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick
tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers
around his ankle.
LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN
LOUIS
Nothing...there.
He turns around and begins to walk again.
LOUIS'S FEET
The tentacle falls away.
LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP
MYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls,
screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of
escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless.
WOODS
LOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he
keeps moving along.
SOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something
is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus
Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS
looks plenty scared.
SOUND: A falling tree.
WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
Those SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--
we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.
LOUIS
He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.
THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV
It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We
don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's
flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it
turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow
eyes the size of lighthouse lamps.
It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.
LOUIS
The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.
LOUIS
It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I
think the Wendigo just passed
within sixty feet of me.
Slowly he begins to walk again.
LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE
In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no
small tree, either, but a great big old fir.
LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:
THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS
could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen
before. Three big claws at the end of it.
LOUIS
Looks up again. His face is set and hard.
LOUIS
It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.
He starts to walk again.
THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND
SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening.
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over
those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart.
SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting.
LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the
top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles
over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and
gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks
at:
A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV
We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.
LOUIS
He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and
slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is
clearly a man approaching total exhaustion.
A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K
It tracks past THE CAMERA.
THE ARIES K
It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half
off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree.
RACHEL
She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it
than just a scratch up the side.
RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been
through a lot tonight.
RACHEL
Now what?
PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road,
looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.
PASCOW
It's trying to stop you. Do you
hear me? It's trying to stop you.
RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans
the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.
RACHEL
Is anyone there?
After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights
appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the
shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for
the first time in her life.
The car sweeps by her without slowing.
GAGE'S CAIRN, CU
LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is
the canvas tarp, now open and empty.
Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his
tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One
hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.
LOUIS
Come back to me, Gage. Come back
to us.
He turns away toward the stairs.
RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9
She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand.
Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts
by.
RACHEL (shouts)
MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP
IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE!
She starts walking again.
THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE
LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he
pushes it, setting it in motion.
THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN
THE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:
A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring
the living shit out of us.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes
one of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.
The SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There
is nothing human here.
Rocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.
RACHEL
My babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.
THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY
THE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.
SOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.
Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the
deadfall.
RACHEL
Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert,
pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.
Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck
stops.
RACHEL AND THE TRUCK
The driver leans over and opens the door.
DRIVER
Hop in, baby.
RACHEL
Thank you.
She does.
THE ORINCO TRUCK, ON ROUTE 9
NIGHT
It sweeps past THE CAMERA
JUD, ON HIS PORCH
More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the
sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the
stereo, and boy, is it cranked.
JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His
hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is
that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.
CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.
THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV
ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES
Headlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.
RACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.
ANGLE ON THE CAB
We can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just
was.
RACHEL
Thank you so much.
TRUCKER
I didn't get a ticket, so you're
welcome, lady.
(And, more seriously)
Whatever your problems are, I hope
they work out.
PASCOW
It's the end of the line for me,
too--I'm not allowed any further.
RACHEL (to the trucker)
I'm sure things will be fine.
PASCOW
I'm not.
She closes the door and steps down.
The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it
pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:
GAGE (soft voice)
Mummy!
She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?"
expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.
GAGE (soft voice)
Mummy!
RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:
JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV
The one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.
RACHEL
She goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been
travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her
initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and
opens the porch door.
She looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning,
and someone else's house. But...that voice...
GAGE (voice)
Mummy, I need you!
RACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.
RACHEL
Who--
The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes
into the doorway and sits down.
CHURCH
Miaow!
RACHEL
Church!
GAGE (voice)
Mummy, I need you!
She crosses to the open door.
RACHEL
Gage? Gage?
No answer. RACHEL steps in.
THE CREED HOUSE
MORNING
THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE
LOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In
the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks
to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then
he crosses.
THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS
He walks most of the way to the house, then stops.
CHURCH, LOUIS"S POV
He gets up, humping his back warily.
LOUIS
LOUIS
Hi, Church. Want some grub?
He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.
CHURCH
He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts
to chow up. He looks up at:
LOUIS
He is pulling on the rubber gloves.
LOUIS
Don't mind me. Eat it while you can.
Eat all you want.
CHURCH
He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack.
ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS
Eat all you can...all you want...
that's right...today's Thanksgiving
day for cats, but only if they came
back from the dead...
He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out
of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip,
then moves toward CHURCH.
CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again,
and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he
talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs
him.
CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries
to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.
LOUIS
No, you don't!
CHURCH, CU
The syringe plunges into his haunch.
CHURCH AND LOUIS
The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks
dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to
get up...and then falls over again.
LOUIS
Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.
He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.
THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV
Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is
erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.
LOUIS
Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted.
He looks back at:
LOUIS
He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.
He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table
beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside.
THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
Time has passed. It's late afternoon. LOUIS comes out with a
sheet-wrapped form in his arms. RACHEL, of course.
He sets the body down and goes back inside.
THE BACK LAWN, WITH LOUIS
He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around
the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows.
THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE, FROM ACROSS THE ROAD
LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road.

THE SMOULDERING RUINS OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
NIGHT
CAMERA HOLDS FOR A MOMENT, then rises and looks toward the CREED
house. There's one light on--in the kitchen.
TOLLING CONTINUES: Three...four...five...
