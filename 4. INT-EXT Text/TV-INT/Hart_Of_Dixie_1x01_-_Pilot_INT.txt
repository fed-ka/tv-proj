      Not quite so exquisite.  We re in an UNSEEN PERSON S POV as 
      we watch TWO 12-YEAR OLDS fight over a Gameboy, AN OLD MAN 
      spit chew into a Dr. Pepper can, and A FAT FISHERMAN sleep 
      with his mouth wide open, as he DROOLS INTO FRAME...  and 
      REVERSE TO REVEAL we are in the POV of ZOE HART, 28, an 
      adorable, spoiled New Yorker, who at that moment would rather 
      be anywhere but on this particular bus.

                    See the girl in the $2200 Chanel 
                    jacket now covered in Mountain Dew 
                    and Disease? That s me, Zoe Hart.

      As Zoe pushes her seat-mate off her shoulder, we PUSH TOWARD 
      the BACK OF THE BUS, where A LARGE TEENAGER IN A CRIMSON TIDE 
      SHIRT exits the bathroom, passing an OLD LADY on her way in.

                                  LARGE TEENAGER
                    Wouldn t go in there for a while if I 
                    was you, Ma am.  Had a bucket of 
                    Popeyes for breakfast.

      The old lady sits back down.  Zoe, disgusted, looks out the 
      window, as scenes of Coastal Alabama peak through the trees.  
      A ROADHOUSE advertises GULF S BEST PO BOYS AND COLDEST BEER. 
      OLD MEN sit on a front porch, shooting the breeze and shooing 
      flies.  A sign out front of a CHURCH reads  SAVING ISN T JUST 
      FOR WALMART.   Over this--

                    Yesterday I woke up on West 24th 
                    street, bought a tall skinny latte, 
                    took a cab to my job at the most 
                      prestigious hospital in the country.  

      A HUNTER hoists a deer carcass into the cab of his PICKUP.

                    But I guess I should start at the 
                      beginning...                                                                                            2



      Back on the Alabama bus.  Zoe s seat-mate is now feasting on 
      cheese curls, kicking up a tiny cloud of orange dust. 

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Well, it's four years later and you 
                    know I wouldn't be in the middle of 
                    nowhere, sitting next to a guy who 
                    smells like Cheetos and chum, if it 
                    had turned out like I hoped.


      The LIVING ROOM of her stylish apartment has been taken over 
      by medical stuff -- TEXT BOOKS and ANATOMICAL CHARTS.  A 
      CLOSE-UP on a FRUIT BOWL reveals a weird assortment of 
        FRANKENSTEIN FRUIT that Zoe has been using to practice her 
      sutures.

      In the DINING ROOM, Zoe and her BOYFRIEND sit at a beautiful 
      CANDLELIT DINNER.  He gives her a long MOS SPEECH.  As we 
      watch Zoe go from annoyed to surprised to heartbroken--                                                                                          5

                    Last Valentines Day, my boyfriend 
                    dumped me.  And it wasn't just 
                    because I practiced mattress sutures 
                    on the Chicken Cordon Bleu he spent 
                    all day making  me.  He said that all 
                    I cared about was being the best.  
                    That I was too busy, too cutthroat, 
                    too self-involved for him.  Which 
                    maybe I was, cause it seemed I was 
                    the last to know he replaced me with&  


      Zoe s NOW-EX BOYFRIEND walks through the hospital arm in arm 
      with Zoe's NOW-FORMER BEST FRIEND.  ANGLE Zoe, watching--

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Sure, it hurt.   It more than hurt--


      Zoe SOBS to her mother.

                                  ZOE
                    -- it feels like someone pulled out 
                    my intestines and tied them around my 
                    throat!   

                                    CANDACE
                    Honey, go and compose yourself.

      Candace looks around, hoping no one witnessed Zoe s public 
      spectacle.


      A more composed Zoe blows her nose as Candace enters.

                                    CANDACE
                    I'll give you the same advice I gave 
                    Jennifer Aniston.  Even if it feels 
                    like smiling will take every ounce of 
                    effort you have, you put on your 
                    makeup, you show those pearly whites 
                    and you get through the day.

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    So I did. 


      Zoe walks purposefully through the hall, reading charts, 
      delegating to interns.                                                                                            6


      She passes a GROUP SURROUNDING HER EX-BOYFRIEND AND FORMER 
      BEST FRIEND.  Wondering what they're seeing, she looks and is 
      blinded by AN ENORMOUS DIAMOND on her ex best friend's 
      finger& 

      Zoe looks away, determined not to let it get to her.

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    I kept strong.  Held it together.  I 
                    could, because I was about to leave 
                    those lovebird losers in the dust - I 
                    was a shoo in for... 

                                  CHIEF OF SURGERY (PRELAP)
                    ...the Reuther fellowship in 
                      Cardiothoracic Surgery.


      A beaming, confident Zoe standing amidst a group of doctors 
      as the chief of Surgery announces... 

                                  CHIEF OF SURGERY
                    We thought long and hard over this 
                    decision, but I am proud to say the 
                    new fellow is... Eve Coburn!

      As Zoe s EX-BEST FRIEND claps with delight, we CLOSE IN ON 
      Zoe's mouth, as she let's out a PRIMAL SCREAM.


      An indignant Zoe pleads with a placid Chief of Surgery.

                                  ZOE
                    But I m the best surgical resident in 
                    this hospital. I run the fastest 
                      whipstitch, already did a solo 
                      angioplasty.  Plus, I m legacy, my 
                    dad was a Reuther fellow before he 
                    went on to the be the most renowned 
                    heart surgeon in Europe.  

      The chief offers her some homemade cookies.

                    seen in thirty years.  But if you 
                    want to be a heart surgeon, you need 
                    to work on your own.                                                                                          7

                    You know what I m talking about.  
                    Last week, you ignored Mrs. Zuker 
                    when she asked you to sing with her.

                    Chief, I need to be a cardiothoracic

                    in private practice without a 
                      specialty.  There isn t a single GP

                    That may be true, Dr. Hart, but there 
                    are other places besides New York.

      As furious Zoe storms out...


      Sleeping Zoe sits bolt upright in her bed, screaming--

      Zoe, in her pajamas, scratching, unable to sleep, looks at 
      her mail...

                    And then I saw it...

      Zoe picks up a POSTCARD of idyllic BlueBell, Alabama.

                    Another postcard from that southern 
                    guy Harley, he'd been sending me them 
                    for the last four years, ever since 
                      graduation - my speech really must've 
                    inspired him.

      She turns it over and finds a note which she reads aloud.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, if you consider purgatory to be 
                    a place where neighbors take care of 
                    each other, every third Tuesday 
                    demands a parade, and the people 
                    spend their evenings dangling their 
                    feet in the water while sipping mint 
                    juleps... then call it what you want.  
                    But I call it home.

      As they park... George helps Zoe out of the car.

      A cross between a road house and clam shack, jutting right 
      out over the water.  Picnic tables outside.  A bar, pool 
      table and dance floor inside.  It's lunchtime, and it's 
      crowded with a mix of upper crust Dixie and working-class 
      South.  As Mrs. H and Zoe find a table, they re barraged by a

                                  DASH DEWITT
                    Zoe, I do a theater trip every April.  
                    Fela! rocked my world.  I have the 
                      soundtrack if you d like to pop by.

                                    SHELLEY
                    New Yorker, huh?  Perhaps you d like 
                    to try our souvee d lamb shank with a 
                    yuzu-mint gellee?  
                          (off Zoe s excitement)
                    Oh, whoops.  We just ran out.   We 
                    got catfish.  It s fried.  

                                  TOM LONG
                          (with pride)
                    Gutted it myself.

                                  ZOE
                    You know?  I m good.  I ll sample the 
                    local delicacies later.
                          (stands, an announcement)
                    But if any of you people need medical 
                    care, you can come see me in Harley 
                    Wilkes old office.

      And now, the crowd SILENCES.  Finally, Tom bravely speaks up.

                                  TOM
                    That s okay.  We all got a doctor.  

      And, as everyone moves away from their table. 

                                  ZOE
                    What s he talking about?  

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                      Technically, Harley left you half the 
                    practice.  He shared it with Dr. 
                    Breeland.  And Brick waited a long 
                    time to have BlueBell to himself...


      We SEE A QUICK MONTAGE of Zoe killing time 

      - giving herself the eye test

      - constructing a house with Q-tips

      - testing her reflexes.  

      Finally, she calls for Mrs. H.

                                  ZOE
                    Mrs H!  I m starting to fatigue.  
                    Usually, at this time of day, a nurse 
                    brings me a vente soy latte.   

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Nearest Starbucks is 11 miles away.                                                                                        17

                          (oblivious)
                    Thanks!  That s so nice of you!  

      Annoyed, Mrs. H leaves.


      Zoe s PHONE RINGS, she looks at the Caller ID, takes a deep 
      breath, braces herself.

                                  ZOE
                    Mom?  Hey.  Hi!  I know I haven t 
                    been answering.  Actually, there s 
                    something I need to tell you... 
                          (no good way to say it)
                    I moved to Alabama.  
                          (then)
                    Mom?  Mom?  Are you there?  

      As Old Man Jackson enters.  Zoe HANGS UP.

                                  OLD MAN JACKSON
                    Is Dr. Breeland around?

                                  ZOE
                    He s hunting.  
                          (her PHONE RINGS again)
                    My mother.  Just told her I moved 
                    here, she s kind of freaking out. 
                          (then)
                    Anyway, what s up?  You sick?  

                                  OLD MAN JACKSON
                    Oh I m feeling as good as anyone my 
                    age would.  Just, there s been a 
                    little mix-up at the DMV.  Don t 
                    s pose you d just sign this form for 
                    me?

                                  ZOE
                    Yeah, lemme give you an eye test 
                    first.

                                  OLD MAN JACKSON
                    Don t blame you...                                                                                         18


      She covers his eye as her PHONE RINGS again. She looks at it, 
      torn, finally gives Old Man Jackson the  one second  sign.

                        ZOEOLD MAN JACKSON
      Mom, no, I am not having a E. F.P.TOZ.LPED.PECFD. EDFZP.
      nervous breakdown! 

      Zoe distractedly gives him a THUMBS UP and SIGNS HIS FORM, we 
      can hear her mother SCREAMING over the phone.

                                  OLD MAN JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Thank you very much.

      And he walks out...


      Zoe is asleep on the exam table as --

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER (O.S.)
                    Sorry to wake you.  Perhaps a latte 
                    would ve perked you up, too bad I 
                    drank it.  But, we have a patient.

      Zoe s eyes pop open to see Mrs. H escort in COLLEEN, a forty-
      five year old shrimper with a HUGE HOOK in her arm and her 
      obese daughter, MABEL, 25, in tow.  Zoe hops into gear.

      CLOSE ON Zoe s hand, EXPERTLY REMOVING THE HOOK.


      Colleen sits on the exam table. Zoe stitches her up, boasts-.

                                  ZOE
                    I m using subcuticular sutures.  
                    There will barely be a scar.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Lady, I m a shrimper, that s my sixth 
                    hook this year.  Not like I m gonna 
                    catch a fella now.  Bet someone like 
                    you has to fight  em off, you re so 
                    thin.  Maybe you could give some tips 
                    to my daughter?  You know that thing 
                    about the potato chips, can t eat 
                    just one?  Big Mabel feels that way 
                    about lunch. 

      Big Mabel sits there in pained silence, Colleen continues, as 
      an uncomfortable Zoe stitches her up--                                                                                        19

                    She was always chubby but she's put 
                    on another half ton ever since her 
                    boyfriend dumped her.  Maybe she 
                    thinks the Oreos will fix the hole in 
                    her heart.

      Zoe notices a DARK SKIN DISCOLORATION on Mabel s face...

                                  ZOE
                    Mabel, the dark patches on your 
                    cheek?  How long have you had those?

      Mabel blushes as--

                                    COLLEEN
                    Told her to wear sunblock.

      Zoe s decides not to press, it s none of her business, and 
      cuts off the thread as--

                                  ZOE

                    After ten years in the NFL, I was a 
                    little lost.  Who wouldn t be after

                    over and making more money than I

                    for the Crimson Tide made me very

                    waiting's ringing.  Call me! Bye!

      Zoe switches over to find an irate Mrs. H on the other line.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Did you sign Old Man Jackson s eye 
                    test for the DMV today?!  

                                  ZOE
                    Yes.  Why?                                                                                        25


                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Cause he just ran someone over!

      Off Zoe, oh no...


                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                        26


                                      ACT THREE


      Zoe enters and finds Mrs. H, who s apoplectic-

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Can t you tell a blind man when he s 
                    right in front of your face?  
                    Everyone knows Old Man Jackson has 
                    memorized the eye chart! 

                                  ZOE
                    Oh my God, I feel so bad.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    You should!  He nearly killed George 
                    Tucker!

      George?!?!  Zoe races into--


      And finds a very battered looking George.  Black eye, huge 
      cuts on his face and arms.  He GROANS, in tremendous pain.  
      Zoe examines him, trying to make light--

                                  ZOE
                    If you wanted to see me again, you 
                    could ve just asked.

                                  GEORGE
                          (then, with a groan)
                    My shoulder...

                                  ZOE
                    It s dislocated.  I need to put it 
                    back in place.  No big deal.

      Zoe prepares a morphine shot as she guiltily explains--

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    So, George, look, eventually you re 
                    gonna find out that this whole 
                    getting run over by a car thing, was 
                    kinda -

      She INJECTS him with the shot.                                                                                        27


                                  GEORGE
                    WHAT THE HELL?!  

                                  ZOE
                          (awww cute)
                    Baby.  The morphine should take 
                    effect any minute.
                          (rolls him on his side as)
                    Anyway, see Old Man Jackson came in 
                    and I gave him a test.  I didn t 
                    realize that -

      Then, without warning, Zoe pops George s shoulder back in.  
      He SCREAMS LOUDLY-

                                  GEORGE
                      OWWWWWWWWWWWWW.  You just did it 
                    again!  Have you ever heard of 
                    bedside manner?

      That stings, coming from George. Trying not show it:

                                  ZOE
                    Why is everyone so obsessed with 
                    that?  

                                  GEORGE
                    Because sometimes it s nice to have a 
                    little warning before intense, 
                      excruciating PAIN! 

      And, then he PASSES OUT.  Zoe looks down at him, upset.

                                  ZOE
                    George?  George?

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    OMG!  It s true!

      Zoe turns to see Mrs H s daughter, ROSE (14, cute, glasses) 
      standing in her pajamas.  Mrs. H follows her in.

                                  MRS. H
                    Rose!  You should be in bed. 

                                  ROSE
                    Mama, this is breaking news.

      She whips out a digital recorder and holds it up to Zoe.

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    Rose Hattenbarger, BlueBell Beat

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    So, how does it feel to be 
                      responsible for maiming George 
                    Tucker, town golden boy? 

                                  ZOE
                    He s not maimed!

                                  ROSE
                      O-kaaaaay.  So, how does it feel to 
                    move to a town, and instantly become 
                    its most unpopular citizen?   
                          (off Zoe s look)
                    Yeah, well, I m unpopular too, and it 
                    sucks. 

                      MRS. HZOE
      I ll go find a sling for Listen, kid, I m not talking 
      George.to you about this... 

      Mrs. H crosses off as--

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    But now, the real question - why 
                    would anyone ever leave New York!? 
                    New York is everything!  And I know. 
                    Read the DailyIntel, own all the SATC 
                    DVD s.  I bet you re a Carrie.  I m a 
                      Charlotte, but I wish I was a Carrie.

      A beat, Zoe looks at Rose, warming to her.

                                  ZOE
                    You people really like your classic 
                    HBO, huh?   But... I m a Miranda.  
                    Who also wishes she was a Carrie.

                                  ROSE
                    Knew you and I were gonna be friends!  

                                  ZOE
                          (with a grin)
                    What are you, like twelve?

                                  ROSE
                    I m fourteen.  But a lifetime as an 
                    outsider has given me an ancient 
                    soul.  

                                  ZOE
                          (beat, then a grin)
                    Well, I could use a friend.

      As Mrs. H reenters, a  you re in trouble now  look to Zoe.                                                                                        29


                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Yea, and a lawyer.  Sheriff s here.

                                  ROSE
                          (oh shit, to Zoe)
                    I ll see you later.

      Rose leaves.  Off Zoe, also oh shit.


      Zoe, Mrs. H and the SHERIFF (50s, bald, quiet, closet 
      knitter) sit.  Outside, we can see Old Man Jackson in the 
      backseat of a squad car.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Merle Jackson has dementia, Lucas, he 
                    didn t know what he was doing!  If 
                    you need to arrest someone, arrest 
                    her.

      The sheriff looks at Zoe.

                                  ZOE
                    She s right.  It is my fault.  I 
                    never should ve signed his form.  
                    Please, don t arrest him.  You know, 
                    or me.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Y all, come on, Jackson came when he 
                    saw the new doc was alone.  That s 
                    not dementia. That s pre-meditation. 
                    I m taking him in.  

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Then we ll just see who s getting any 
                    of my chicken fried steak tomorrow.  
                    Or ever, Lucas Hattenbarger!

                                  ZOE
                    You re married?!
                          (then, back to business)
                    Look, officer...sheriff, please... 
                    There must be something we can do...

                                    SHERIFF
                    That s up to the judge now...

      As he gets up to leave, BRICK BREELAND, 56, a Big Daddy type, 
      walks in.  Every bit as imposing as advertised.

                                  MRS. H
                    Dr. Breeland!  Thank God.  You heard?                                                                                        30


      Brick nods to Mrs. H, and pats the sheriff on the back.

                                  BRICK
                    Lucas,  Old Man Jackson comes in 
                    every day looking to get me to sign 
                    that form.  I always say no.  Had no 
                    idea this little New York doctorette 
                    would come here and break my rules.  

                                    SHERIFF
                    Brick, he s a danger. 

                                  BRICK
                    Not if he s not gonna drive again. 
                    You have my word.  You can release 
                    him to my custody till I get his 
                    daughter down here from Tuscaloosa.
                          (then)
                    We on for fishing Sunday?

      The Sheriff can t say no to this powerful man.  He nods and 
      leaves...  Mrs. H follows him out.

      Zoe turns to Brick, trying to make a good first impression.

                                  ZOE
                    Wow, that was impressive.  We haven t 
                    met. I m Dr. Zoe Hart.  

      And now he begins to unleash his full bear-like temper.

                                  BRICK
                    Far as I m concerned, you re just the 
                    girl who nearly killed two of my 
                    patients and ruined my hunting trip.  
                    How dare you see my patients? 

                                  ZOE
                    Well, technically, Harley left his 
                    half of the practice to me.  So half 
                    were mine.
                          (selling it)
                    But... the good news is, I m only 
                    staying for a year!

                                  BRICK
                    Miss Hart, I m not going to share 
                    this office for one minute.  

      He walks into Harley s exam room, Zoe follows.


      Brick gestures to the unconscious George.                                                                                        31


                                  BRICK
                    I see you ve met my lawyer.  When 
                    he s conscious, the man doesn t lose.  
                    We ll be contesting the will. Harley 
                    wasn t in his right mind.  We figured 
                    Dr. Zoe Hart was his imaginary 
                    friend, that s how nuts he was. 

                                  ZOE
                    I don t think George will agree, he 
                    knows me.

                                  BRICK
                    He ll probably throw in a malpractice 
                    suit when he comes to!

                                  ZOE
                    I made an honest mistake.  But I 
                    graduated Johns Hopkins top of my 
                    class, did my surgical residency at 
                    New York/Cornell.  I could do some 
                    good here.  

                                  BRICK
                    Things have been running just fine in 
                    BlueBell without any patronizing New 
                    Yorkers coming to do  Good.   We 
                    survived Katrina, we survived BP - 
                    you know how?  We boarded up the 
                    windows, we piled up the sandbags and 
                    we kept the rot from coming in from 
                    outside and fouling our community.
                          (in a fierce glare)
                    It may take an hour, it may take a 
                    week, but believe me, Zoe Hart, we 
                    are gonna chase you away from our 
                    waters.  

      Zoe, humiliated, retreats out the door.


      Zoe rushes into an old school grocery store.

                                  ZOE
                    Please tell me you have a nice dry

                    Bad day?

      Zoe turns and sees Wade Kinsella walking out with his 
      girlfriends and a case of beer.  She ignores him.

                                  WADE
                    Everyone knows Old Man Jackson 
                    memorized the eye chart.  

                                  ZOE
                    Why don t you go back to the rodeo or 
                    wherever you came from?

                                  WADE
                    I see. Southern boy?  Must be out 
                    ropin  steer.  Doc, seems you re the 
                    one up on a high horse.  But maybe if 
                    you came down, get to know people, 
                    listen a bit, you might keep yourself 
                    outta the kind of trouble you had 
                    tonight.  You might find there s more 
                    to this place than you think.  

      With that Wade and his girls leave.  His words sting as Zoe 
      grabs her wine, in a box, and marches up to the REGISTER, 
      surprised to find the girl behind the counter is Big Mabel.  
      She smiles shyly at Zoe, looks at the wine. 

                                  BIG MABEL
                    I m having a bad day myself.  
                    Actually, most of my days are.

      Zoe looks at Mabel, feels guilty for not sticking up for her 
      earlier.  Wade s words in her ear...

                                  ZOE
                    Listen, um, Mabel, it s not really my 
                    business, but... you have Melasma, 
                    darkened patches on your forehead and 
                    face... It s a classic sign of... 
                          (just coming out with it)
                    Are you pregnant?                                                                                          33


      Mabel, blushes, humiliated, then, after a long pause... 

                                  BIG MABEL
                    Don t know.  Never took a test.

                                  ZOE
                    Bet you can buy one, right here.  
                    Over by the slim-jims and duck calls.
                          (then, hearing her tone)
                    Bad day.  Sorry.  It s okay...

      Big Mabel hesitates. Then tears up, relieved she can unload.

                                  MABEL
                    I didn t think.... We only had sex 
                    once.  He told me he wouldn t do it 
                    with me if he had to use a condom.  
                    And I didn t want to lose him.  And 
                    then, well, he left anyway...

      And Zoe s heart melts just a little bit.

                                  ZOE
                      I recently had my heart broken too.  
                    It s hard to believe there are good 
                    guys out there after that. But you 
                    know what?  Sometimes they turn up 
                    where you least expect them. 
                          (scribbling her number)
                    You need a doctor.  Apparently, I 
                    have terrible bedside manner, but if 
                    you want, you can give me a call.  
                    Any time.  I m here for you, okay?

      And, as Mabel nods, thankful, Zoe exits the Piggly Wiggly --


      Zoe enters her carriage house to find...  

                                    CANDACE
                    What the hell are you thinking?  

      Off Zoe, they just did...

                                        ACT FOUR


      Candace and Zoe are mid-conversation at the Rammer Jammer. 

                                  ZOE
                    ...And then I saw one of Harley s 
                      postcards.  And it felt like a sign.  
                    So I came to BlueBell.

                                    CANDACE
                    No offense, honey, your speech was 
                    great, but really why would this 
                    Harley try so hard to get you down 
                    here?

                                  ZOE
                    I m not sure.  It s possible he was 
                    nutballs. That s what everyone else 
                    seems to think.  Anyway, when I got 
                    here, I found out he died.  So, I 
                    guess I ll never know.

      Candace blanches, clearly rattled.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Mom?  You alright?  You look pale.

                                    CANDACE
                    Of course I m not okay.  I won t be 
                    until you re out of this place.  The 
                    town smells like fishsticks drenched 
                    in Tween perfume.  I don t care what 
                    the chief said, nothing is worth you 
                    spending a year here..

                    Wait, what?  You talked to Dad?

                                    CANDACE
                    He called as soon as he heard that 
                    message you left last night.  How do 
                    you think I found you?

                                  ZOE
                          (hurt)
                    He called you instead of me?

                                    CANDACE
                    You know him, he can t deal with 
                      complications.  But, honey...                                                                                        36


      Candace hands her A FIRST CLASS PLANE TICKET.

      JUST THEN, THREE OF THE BLUE BELLES, dressed up for Lemon and 
      George s engagement soiree enter LOUDLY--

                                  BLUE BELLE #1
                    Y all, Lemon wants us at the party 
                    early to work the door...
                          (spying Zoe)
                    Look, it s Dr. NewYorkian.

      As they notice her notice them, they smile fakely and wave.

                                  BLUE BELLE #3
                    I love your haircut, it s so brave. 
                    You see so few non-lesbians with it.

      They cross off, giggling.  Zoe confesses to her mother.

                                  ZOE
                    So, you know how after I didn t get 
                    the fellowship I thought things 
                    couldn t get worse?  Wrong. I m the 
                    joke of this town, I ve lost my 
                    ability to make witty retorts, and 
                    that belle s right about my hair!  
                    The humidity makes me look like 1999 
                    Melissa Etheridge.

                                    CANDACE
                    Hence, Paris.  You can regroup among 
                    Dior and Degas. I ll have Odile 
                    Gilbert to give you a blowout.

                    Maybe you re right...  

      Candace gives Zoe an uncharacteristic hug...

                                    CANDACE
                    I knew you d come to your senses.  We 
                    can leave immediately.                                                                                          37

                    Just need to take care of a couple of 
                    things first.  Give me a few hours.

      Candace is conflicted, clearly wants her out of here right 
      away, but she ll take what she can get.

                                    CANDACE
                    I ll go give Rihanna some face time, 
                    she s in Mobile.  Why don t we meet 
                    there at 5?  I have Sir Elton s jet.

      Zoe nods.  Candace smiles, happy.  CLOSE ON Zoe s hand 
      tentatively knocking on--


      -- George s door.  He s still pretty banged up.  As he lets 
      her in, the conversation is stilted, though Zoe s hurt, she 
      tries to be upbeat, professional and cool. 

                                  ZOE
                    Thanks for seeing me on a Saturday.

                    run in with Lemon last night.  I m 
                    sorry.  I should ve told you...

                    the alligator and getting hit by a

                    You should ve known Lemon when we 
                    were younger. She was amazing.  
                    Funny, irreverent... Everyone wanted 
                    her light to shine on them, I was so 
                    honored when she chose me.
                          (then, with a sigh)
                    But after law school, I needed... 
                    change.  I decided to go to New York.  

      George walks over to the window, looks out on the water.

                                  GEORGE
                    I loved it in the city.  The 
                      excitement, the electricity.  I 
                    nearly stayed.  But a few months ago, 
                    I woke up dreaming of the sunset, the 
                    sand beneath my feet, and I realized  
                      - BlueBell, Lemon are... who I am.  I 
                    can t be my best self without them...

      Zoe just wants out of this room as quickly as possible.

                                  ZOE
                    Wow, you re a lucky guy.

                    A girl you feel the same way about as 
                    a town.  Anyway, the papers?

      Formal, George opens a file cabinet and produces a file.  He 
      points to a dotted line.  Zoe SIGNS.

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    I cant file til Monday.  But I ll let 
                    Brick know.

      Zoe nods, terse, and heads out the door.


      Zoe is packing up the carriage house when Rose barges in.

                    Jessica s place.

      And now, Rose changes her tune.  Flops on the bed.                                                                                        40

      Zoe laughs as her PHONE RINGS.  We INTERCUT with: 


      MABEL, in a catering outfit in the very busy kitchen of the 
      Breeland estate, where the engagement party s underway.  She 
      speaks in HUSHED TONES...

                                  BIG MABEL 
                    Dr. Hart?  It s Mabel, I don t feel.. 
                    well.  But I'm working at the 
                      Breelands, and my mama s here, I 
                    can t leave.  Can you come?  Please?

      Zoe looks at her watch, oy, as Rose opens her closet and 
      tries on some of her clothes. 

                                  ZOE
                    Look, Mabel, I have to meet my mother 
                    in Mobile in an hour.  If you re at 
                    the Breelands, talk to --

                                  BIG MABEL
                    Brick the dick?  No way!  He s more 
                      judgemental than my mother.  
                          (then, pleading)
                    You said you d be my doctor if I 
                    needed you.  Didn't you sign an oath 
                    or something?

      Zoe SIGHS, what choice does she have?

                                  ZOE
                    Crap.  I ll be there as soon as I 
                    can.

      She hangs up her phone and looks at Rose, who s wearing one 
      of her cocktail dresses.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Good, you re dressed.  We have a 
                    party to crash.

      And we, HARD CUT to:


      A modest, lived-in apartment cluttered with mementos.  Mrs. H 
      and Candace sip tea uncomfortably.  Mrs. H slices the last of 
      the cobbler. 

                                    CANDACE
                    No more for me or I ll need an extra 
                    plane seat for my thighs!  
                          (Mrs. H doesn t laugh)
                    ... But I wanted to thank you for all 
                    you ve done for my daughter.  

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Wasn t me.  Was Harley.  

                                    CANDACE
                    Yes.  Harley.  Tell me about him.  
                    What s your take on the whole  leave 
                    my practice to a girl I only met once 
                    thing.   Don t you find it... odd? 

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                          (inscrutable)
                    Harley did what Harley wanted.  I 
                    gave up trying to figure that man out 
                    a long time ago.  

                                    CANDACE
                    It s just surprising that he didn t 
                    leave it to a child, a relative.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                          (a beat, pointed)
                    Harley never married.

                                    CANDACE
                    Never?

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                          (pointed)
                    Guess he never met anyone worthy. 

      A long strange moment between them, Candace rises-

                                    CANDACE
                    Of course.  So, I guess we ll chalk 
                    up the gesture to my daughter s 
                      astounding gift at first impressions?  
                    So sorry to pull her away from your 
                    little town.  But... Ta ta.

      And as Candace leaves this mysterious conversation...                                                                                        45



      Zoe has found Mabel, who s now sweating, in terrible pain.

                                  BIG MABEL
                    Thank you so much for coming.  I m 
                    having these bad pains.  Oh my God, 
                    there s another one... They re 
                    getting worse.

      Mabel GROANS... Zoe seems confused.  This can t be happening.  

                                  ZOE
                    Mabel, exactly how long has it been 
                    since you had your period?

                                  MABEL
                    Not sure.  Awhile...

      And suddenly SPLATT... Mabel s water breaks.

                                  ZOE
                    Your water just broke.  You re not 
                    just pregnant.  You re in labor.   We 
                    need to get you to the hospital.

      And as Mabel doubles over in pain, Zoe realizes--

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Another contraction?  Oh my God.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Zoe has moved Mabel to a huge guest room covered floor to 
      ceiling in taxidermic animals...  She examines her under a 
      sheet as Brick Breeland rushes in...

                                  BRICK
                    What s going on here?

                                  ZOE
                    Brick, thank God.  She s ten cms, 
                    ready to push...  We have to deliver 
                    this baby!

                                  BRICK
                    You mean I have to deliver this baby.  
                    Go get some towels.  And have 
                    Emmeline bring my medical kit.

      As Zoe gets up, Brick heads toward Mabel--

                                  BIG MABEL
                    Oh no!  Don t come near me!  Dr. Hart 
                    is my doctor.

      Brick stops, confused as Zoe shrugs, the tables turned.

                                  ZOE
                    You can tell Mrs. H my medical kit s

      As Brick leaves, Zoe kneels down in front of Mabel.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Alright, Mabel, are you ready?  I m 
                    gonna need you to start pushing...

      And as Mabel nods, and grunts--


      Lemon finds Lavon regaling some GUESTS with a story.  

                                  LEMON
                    Mr. and Mrs. Grayson, how lovely of 
                    you to come.  May I just grab the 
                    mayor a moment?  Obliged.

      Lemon hooks her arm around Lavon s and they step away.  As 
      Lemon SMILES around at her guests, she casually asks-

                                  LEMON (CONT D)
                    So, Mr. Mayor?  Is it true?  Are you 
                    here on a date with that... Dr Hart?

      Lavon stops, hurt, annoyed--

                                  LAVON HAYES
                    How is that any of your business?  As 
                    I recall this is your engagement 
                    party, is it not?

      Suddenly, Lemon seems vulnerable for the first time.  She 
      busies herself at the buffet, so no one can see her face, or 
      the serious nature of this conversation.

                                  LEMON
                    Lavon, come on... you know how 
                    difficult this is.

                                  LAVON HAYES
                    Difficult never stopped me.

      Lavon walks away.  And off Lemon Breeland s face, hurt and 
      confused, we realize that these two used to be in love. 


      Mrs. H has arrived, and dabs Mabel with a damp towel.  On the 
      couch, Brick reads a magazine, annoyed.  As Zoe prepares to 
      deliver a baby...                                                                                        48

                    Wait, stop!

      And Brick leaps into action.

                                  BRICK
                    Breach?  At this stage?  My God.  Can

                    I don t know.  Mabel, I need you to

      As Mrs. H puts her hands on Mabel s shoulders to steady her, 
      Zoe s hands disappear underneath the sheet.  They wait, 
      until... Mabel SCREAMS.  In pain.  Zoe turns to Brick, ashen.

                                  BRICK
                    Yes.

      Zoe and Brick exchange a look, Mabel and the baby aren t 
      going to make it.  And Zoe makes a decision.

                                  ZOE
                    Mabel, it s going to be okay.  Mrs.

      As Mrs. H and Brick hold Mabel s legs down, as Zoe begins to 
      bravely cut -

      Mrs. H and Brick are sweaty, nervous messes, looking at each 
      other, holding Mabel s legs down. But Zoe is all steely 
      focus. Mabel cries, in unbearable pain, but fighting to stay

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Look at her, she can t.  

      Zoe looks down at Mabel.  She s pale, done fighting. Too much 
      pain and blood loss.  

                                  MABEL
                    Just... save my baby.  Okay?

                                  ZOE
                    Mabel, no!  Don t you pass out on me!  
                    Do you hear me?  I need you to push.  
                    I know you re tired, I know you re in 
                    pain.  But I need you to be strong.  
                    Stronger than you ve ever been in 
                    your life.   For me, for your baby, 
                    for yourself, okay?  You can do this. 

      And, as Mabel weakly nods. 

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Okay, push.... 
                          (Mabel can t)
                    Did you hear me?  You CAN DO THIS!  
                    Push, Mabel.  Push.  PUSH...

      Mabel does... She s weak... but suddenly Zoe pulls the baby 
      all the way out and up and we hear the sound of an INFANT 
      CRYING. Zoe s stunned and, just as quickly, CRYING herself...

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Oh my God.  She s... here.  You did 
                    it!  Oh my God...

      She hands the baby to Brick, who s all sweat and emotion.  
      Mrs. H openly bawls.  Zoe, wiping away a tear, clamps the 
      umbilical cord and starts to sew Mabel up. 


      Dr. Breeland checks over the baby... 

                                  MABEL
                    Is she... okay?

                                  BRICK
                    Ten fingers, ten toes, lungs to make 
                    Carrie Underwood jealous.  You ve got 
                    yourself a healthy baby girl.

      He hands the baby over to her weak but beaming mother.  As 
      Zoe smiles, happy.  Brick approaches her.

                                  BRICK (CONT D)
                    Nice job.  Maybe Harley wasn t as 
                    daft as I thought.  Too bad you won t 
                    be staying.  George told me you 
                    signed the papers... 
                          (with a hint of triumph)
                    I ll go tell the paramedics where to 
                    find us.

      Brick exits.  Zoe moves over to Mabel, looks at the baby... 

                                  ZOE
                    She s beautiful. What you did for 
                    your daughter... You were amazing... 
                    Don t ever forget how much strength 
                    you have.  

      Just then, Colleen rushes into the bedroom.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Mabel!  Where s my daughter...? 

                                  ZOE
                          (blocking her)
                    I ve got a patient recovering here.  

                                  MABEL
                    Dr. Hart, it s okay.

      Zoe lets Colleen through, Mabel speaks, strong.                                                                                        52


                                  MABEL (CONT D)
                    Mama.  Look. I ve created a 
                      beautiful, perfect person.  How she 
                    grows up, how she looks at herself... 
                    that s on me now.  I ve tried so hard 
                    to please you.  But it was never 
                    enough.  And I m not gonna expose my 
                    baby to that.  So, please, get out.

      Colleen staggers back, just as PARAMEDICS rush in to Mabel s 
      side.  Zoe watches, HEARS HER WORDS...


      Mabel and baby are all strapped in as--

                                  ZOE
                    You call me anytime, okay?  I ve got 
                    an international plan.  

      Mabel waves goodbye, and the AMBULANCE DOOR CLOSES.  As it 
      drives away, Mrs. H comes up behind Zoe..

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    I ve been around doctors thirty 
                    years, don t know if I ve ever seen 
                    any of them do that...  You can t 
                    leave now.

                                  ZOE
                    That s surgery.  Adrenaline, skill, 
                    power, it's what I excel at.  And I 
                    came here because I'd do anything to 
                    not have to stop being one.  The 
                    question is why.
                          (finally vulnerable)
                    I called my dad last night, opened my 
                    heart to him... he didn't even 
                    respond.  I've spent my life trying 
                    to impress a man who could care less 
                    about me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                        53

                                  ZOE (CONT'D)
                    But maybe I can learn something from 
                    Mabel, maybe... the cycle can end.  
                    It s time to admit, I ve wanted this 
                    for the wrong reasons... I don t 
                    belong here.

      As Zoe walks away, Off Mrs. H, struggling with something.  

      ANGLE ON GEORGE, standing with Lemon, as he spies Zoe 
      leaving, clearly conflicted, wondering... 


      Zoe rides through town, looking out the window, clearly torn 
      about leaving.  Suddenly, the driver SLAMS on the brakes.  
      And we see Mrs. H standing on the road, blocking it.  Zoe 
      rolls down her window.

                                  ZOE
                    Mrs. H?  What are you doing?                                                                                        54


                                  MRS. H
                    There's something you need to see.


      Zoe sits as Mrs. Hattenbarger gathers herself for a difficult 
      speech.  

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    What you did with Mabel, that was 
                    more than surgery.  That was being a 
                    doc.  You asked me before why Harley 
                    left you this practice, well I didn t 
                    tell you the whole truth.

      Mrs. H opens her desk and hands Zoe a LARGE FILE.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER (CONT D)
                    I found this in Harley s stuff.

      Zoe flips through the file.  It s filled with her REPORT 
      CARDS, RECITAL PROGRAMS, and PICTURES.  

                                  ZOE
                          (confused and freaked)
                    I don t get it.  Harley was stalking 
                    me?

      And then, she flips to a PICTURE at the back of the pile.  
      Standing on the deck of a CRUISE SHIP is a YOUNG HARLEY with 
      his arm around a woman who appears to be ZOE S MOTHER, 
      CANDACE.  There s a scribbled date, April, 1982.  

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    That s my... mother.
                          (as it dawns on her)
                    Are you saying... that the reason 
                    Harley sent me all those postcards, 
                    came to my graduation...?

                                  MRS. H
                    Yes, Zoe.  I believe Harley Wilkes 
                    was your father.  

      Off Zoe, stunned.

                                        ACT SIX


      Candace looks at her watch, annoyed.  She spots Zoe walking 
      toward her.  Candace is overly relieved.

                                    CANDACE
                    You re here!  Ready?  There s a great 
                    Sancerre chilling on board.

      But instead of walking to the plane, Zoe whips out the 
      picture of Candace and Harley.

                                  ZOE
                    We need to talk.

                                    CANDACE
                    Oh.  Oh my God.  Zoe, I can explain.

                                  ZOE
                    What s there to explain?  That my 
                    entire life is a lie?!
                          (Candace is silent)
                    This is the answer to everything, 
                    isn t it?!  Why Harley left me the 
                    practice, why dad... stopped loving 
                    me...
                          (as it dawns on her)
                    Because I wasn t his to love, and he 
                    knew, didn t he?

      Candace looks away, can t bear to have this talk.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    When?!  When did he find out?  TALK 
                    DAMMIT!

                                    CANDACE
                    You were ten. You fell off the 
                    swings, they thought you might need a 
                      transfusion.  But.. When he donated 
                    blood...  He tried to stay in your 
                    life.  But I guess, it hurt too much.

                                  ZOE
                    That s why he left?

      Candace nods once.  Zoe takes a moment to try and untangle 
      everything going through her mind.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    And why not tell me about Harley?  
                    Was he a psycho?  A pedophile?                                                                                        56


                                    CANDACE
                    He was a...  mistake.  We met on a 
                    cruise.  
                          (as she remembers)
                    It was Greece, he was gorgeous, 
                    smart, a gentleman.  A fantasy.  But 
                    I was engaged. To someone real.  

                                  ZOE
                    Did you... love him?

                                    CANDACE
                          (yes, but)
                    That doesn t matter.  Because I 
                    didn t belong with him anymore than 
                    my child belongs in a place like 
                    this.  I gave you a father from our 
                    world.  I was protecting you.

                                  ZOE
                    That should ve been my choice. My 
                    real father is dead - I'll never know 
                    him now.   I'll never know what it 
                    would've been like to hold him, or 
                    have him read me a bedtime story.  
                    I'll never know what it would've been 
                    like to have a father who... loved me 
                    no matter what.

                                    CANDACE
                    Zoe, I m sorry.  Okay?  I am deeply, 
                    truly sorry.  But, please, let s get 
                    on the plane.  We can go home, or go 
                    to Paris, and discuss this in therapy 
                    like normal people. 

      But Zoe walks away.

                                  ZOE (PRELAP)
                    So, I decided to stay in BlueBell.


      Lavon gives Zoe a ride to town.

                                  ZOE
                    Not because I m having a nervous 
                      breakdown.  But because I ve gotten 
                    off track.  And maybe following in 
                    the footsteps of my real father for a 
                    while will help me find my way.                                                                                        57


                                  LAVON HAYES
                    Well I m glad to hear it.  As a 
                    matter of fact, Don Johnson has 
                    something going on with his tail that 
                    I m hoping you could take a look at.

                    Are you TRYING to get me to change my 
                    mind.

                                  LAVON HAYES
                    Well, if you re staying, you should 
                    probably get a car.  And a license.   
                    And maybe learn to appreciate some of 
                      BlueBell s customs.  It just so 
                    happens it's a full moon, which means 
                    a moon jam at the Rammer Jammer.  You 
                    up for it?

                                  ZOE
                          (a beat, then)
                    Sure.  But can you drop me somewhere 
                    first?

                                  LAVON HAYES
                    Long as we don t miss the crab

                    And that s how I ended up in 
                    Bluebell. 


      The RJ's in full party mode for the moon jammer celebration.   
      Twinkle lights are on.  People dance, drink and play darts. 

      Zoe enters with Mrs. H. As Mrs. H finds some friends, Zoe 
      spots Brick having a drink with George and Lemon.  George 
      nearly chokes on his drink when he sees her...

                                  LEMON
                    Um...?  This departure has lasted 
                    longer than our last hurricane. 

                                  ZOE
                          (with attitude)
                    I m staying.  Turns out, I m Harley s 
                    daughter.  Think that's the reason he 
                    left me his half of the practice. 
                    Probably, the judge will agree.  Good 
                    luck contesting his will now.    

                                  BRICK
                    You already signed the papers!

      There s a long silence, as Zoe absorbs that, then..

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    Actually, I didn t notarize them.  
                    Must have been all those drugs she 
                    had me on.  I can t file.

      As Zoe gives George a look of confused thanks.  Lemon and 
      Brick turn to him, wtf?!  


      Zoe sips a mint julep at the bar as Rose comes up to her.                                                                                        59


                                  ROSE
                    OMGMD. My mom told me you re staying.  
                    This is the greatest news, like ever.  
                    I need your advice on a million 
                    things.  Like Frederick - what does 
                    it mean that he said,  See you 
                    later?   WWCBD?  
                          (off Zoe s look)
                    What would Carrie Bradshaw do?

                                  ZOE
                    Rose, believe me, I m the last person 
                    in this town to give you advice on 
                    guys.  As a matter of fact, all I 
                    know for sure right now is that 
                      everything I thought I knew about 
                      everything... is probably wrong.  

      She gets up... winks at Rose, points to some boys wrestling 
      in the bushes.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Besides, should probably get some 
                    sleep.  The Tark twins are wrestling 
                    in some poison oak, tomorrow s gonna 
                    be a long day.

      JUST THEN, Wade s band takes the stage.  He looks into the 
      audience, sees Zoe, SMILES - surprised.  

                                  WADE
                    Well, we got a special guest here 
                    tonight.  A girl, I hope, is staying. 
                          (he nods to the band)
                    This one s for the doc.

      And as he begins to play the PERFECT, HAPPY, MAGICAL SOUTHERN 
      SONG, (possibly  If Heaven Ain t A Lot like Dixie... )  Zoe 
      SMILES at him, moved, intrigued.

      ANGLE on George, who isn't thrilled by this exchange.  Lemon 
      comes to his side and pulls him to the dance floor by his 
      good arm.   ANGLE on Lavon as he watches them.  Mrs. H pulls 
      him to the dance floor.   And Rose grabs Zoe.   

      And as our whole little community moves onto the dance floor. 
      Dancing, and singing along.  Zoe, at long last, home.  We -- 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
