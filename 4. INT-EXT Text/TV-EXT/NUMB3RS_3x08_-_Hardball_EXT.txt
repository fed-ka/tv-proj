  MONTAGE / VARIOUS ANGLES: 

  Minor league baseball practice game.  95mph fastballs, 
  backdoor curves, sliders and splitters, whiffed on, hit for 
    grounders, diving infield catches, mid-air throws to first, 
  line drives to the outfield, snagged with basket catches.

  (MUSIC:  Centerfield by John Fogerty or Glory Days by 
    Springsteen)

  VICK JOHNSTON steps up to the plate.  Big, muscular hitter.   *
  WHACKS the first pitch a hundred miles -- but foul.  

  Watching from the sidelines, eating sunflower seeds: COACH 
  GRADY.  Turns to old-hand, TRAINER WEAVER.

                              GRADY
                  Johnston s looking strong. *

                                WEAVER
                Says it s some new conditioning 
                program. 

                              GRADY
                Keeps it up, he ll be batting clean-
                up again for the big club in April.

  Johnston smashes a long line drive against the outfield wall,  *
  SLIDES head first into second, inches ahead of the tag--

  The Second Baseman throws the ball in.  Looks back to see 
  Vick still splayed out in the dirt.  Pats him on the back. *

                                SECOND BASEMAN
                Taking a nap, Vick? *

  But Vick doesn t move.  Eyes wide open.  Not blinking. *

                Being in a locker room -- reminds 
                me of my field hockey days.  When 
                all I needed to take on life was a 
                  kick-pleated skirt and a big stick.

                              DON

  David and Colby question GRADY as he watches practice.

                We don t give them steroids, we 
                don t tell them what drugs to take. 

                              COLBY
                But if they use, you benefit. 

                              GRADY
                These are grown men.  They make 
                their own choices. 

                              DAVID
                And if they don t get caught and 
                  suspended, you turn a blind eye?

                              GRADY
                We test players when the league 
                says we have reason to.  Otherwise, 
                we try not to get into

  Angle on a Fire Tower--

  Young Asian  punk  women enter an open-air mall.  


  David and Colby walk through the bustle and color. 

                              COLBY
                You know what this kinda reminds me  *

                Let me guess -- Blade Runner.     

                              COLBY 
                Exactly.  Now, how did Ridley Scott 
                know what the future would look 
                like?

                              DAVID
                No idea, I just remember Daryl 
                Hannah was one kick-ass cyborg.

  Colby looks ahead, sees something -- 

                              COLBY 
                Hey, look who just showed up. 

  COLBY S POV -- a open-air Cyber Cafe.  OSWALD KITTNER walks 
  to a table.  He s carrying a skateboard, wearing a small  *
  backpack (sized for a small laptop computer).  *

  David and Colby approach.  Kittner sees them coming. 

                              DAVID 
                Oswald Kittner.  FBI.

  Kittner bolts, David and Colby run after him. *    NUMB3RS   #308/45   "Hardball"   YELLOW Draft   10-03-06    21.




  Kittner throws down his skateboard, jumps on and sails off.  *

                              COLBY *
                Great, when they don t run, they  *
                  skateboard. *

  People scatter as Kittner streaks away. *


  Kittner races toward a staircase, and desperate to escape he 
  hits the siderail, bounces off, just barely nailing the 
  landing.  And he s off again--

  David pushes off Colby to split up -- they do.  Colby staying 
  on Kittner. 


  Colby sprints as hard as he can -- but he can t keep up with 
  Kittner who zooms down a ramp into the UNDERGROUND MALL.


  Follow Kittner as he rushes headlong through the underground 
  mall -- barely avoiding obstacles and crashing through a 
  Japanese kite stand.  Colby still in pursuit -- barely.


    A PROCESSION of Japanese women in traditional dress holding 
  colorful lanterns -- a Flower Festival -- heading right in 
  the direction of -- Kittner -- who emerges back out into the 
  open air mall at high velocity.

  The WOMEN scatter like fireflies as Kittner rips through the 
  procession.

  PAST THE PROCESSION -- Kittner looks over his shoulder.  He s 
  lost Colby.  Kittner smiles.


  Kittner arrives at the end of the mall -- approaching a huge 
  Fire Tower when -- 

  David steps out from the entrance to a shop -- holding a five-
  foot long STALK OF BAMBOO --  *

  He throws it at the wheels of Kittner s skateboard -- the  *
  board goes flying, Kittner tumbles across the cement-- *

  David comes down on top of him.  Colby comes running up. *

                It is when you run.

  Colby puts the cuffs on him.  David grabs the skateboard.

                              KITTNER 
                You really FBI?  

  David pulls out a badge --

                Yeah, for real.  

                              KITTNER 
                At the risk of getting beat up, can 
                I ask what you re arresting me for?

                              DAVID
                In your case, skateboarding is a  *

                I think you should know -- a search 
                warrant is being executed for your 
                office, automobile and home. 

  Off Sheveransky s stunned look --  

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                Looks like you got a good idea what 
                we re going to find.


  A busy, crowded cafe, filled with young people in hip dress. 
  At a table, Charlie sits with Oswald Kittner. 

                              KITTNER
                I can t stop thinking -- if I 
                hadn t done the doping analysis, 
                Chris would still be alive.   

                              CHARLIE
                It s not your fault.  Actions can  *
                have unintended consequences.  
                  Scientists struggle with that all 
                the time.

                              KITTNER
                Charlie, scientific breakthroughs 
                have benefits.  I play fantasy 
                  baseball.    

                              CHARLIE
                The ability to conceptualize the  *
                solution to a problem ... that s 
                what applied mathematics is all 
                about.  You have that ability and 
                you could apply it to other 
                  problems. 

                              KITTNER
                You re Good Will Hunting.  Not me. 
                I m just a slacker who loves  *
                baseball way too much.  

                              CHARLIE
                Whether you want to admit it or 
                not, you also love math.  Think  *
                about it, okay?   *


  Charlie and Kittner leaving.

                              CHARLIE
                You re still welcome to the garage.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)    NUMB3RS   #308/45   "Hardball"   YELLOW Draft   10-03-06    48.

                              KITTNER
                Don t worry about me.  I ll be 
                okay. 

                              CHARLIE 
                Stay in touch.

  Oswald raises a hand in farewell, gets on his skateboard, 
  shoves off down the street. 

  Charlie walks to his car, beeps it open.  Turns, looks back-- 

  Oswald s figure glides away down the sidewalk.  Charlie turns 
  to his car, opens the driver s door --

  BANG! BANG BANG!

  Charlie looks up, startled by gunshots--  TIRES SQUEAL, 
  somebody SCREAMS.  Charlie runs toward the sounds--


  Charlie runs up, people gathered around.  Charlie pushes 
  forward, sees Oswald on the ground.  Charlie keeps his cool, 
  speaks firmly, calmly.  Concerned but not panicked. *

                              CHARLIE
                  Everybody, please, stand back.    *

  Oswald s moving, sitting up.  Charlie bends over him.  *

                              CHARLIE (CONT D) *
                Stay still, don t try to get up --   *

                              OSWALD
                It s okay, I don t think I m hit --     *

  He pulls at his jacket, BIG HOLE in it.

                              OSWALD (CONT D) *
                Whoa, look at that. *

  Oswald pulls up his shirt -- A WELT where a bullet scraped  *
  his left side.    

                              OSWALD (CONT D) *
                I guess -- they missed.

                              CHARLIE
                But not by much.

  Richard Clast watches the players take batting practice.

                              CLAST
                Nice shot, Bobby.  Keep that up and 
                we ll have you in a bidding war 
                between the Yankees and Sox. 

  Don and Megan suddenly appear walking up to Clast.  His face 
  going blank.

                              DON
                Richard Clast.  We went over a list 
                of your baseball clients.  

                              MEGAN
                In fact, we ran all their stats 
                through Oswald Kittner s analysis.  
                Which I think you re familiar with.

  Megan hands him a copy of Kittner s math.  Clast looks, then 
  shakes his head dismissively.

                              CLAST
                Not a clue what this is -- I m not 
                  a mathematician.

                              MEGAN
                Which is why you took it to Frank 
                Auster, at BRX.  He s a scientist --  *
                and he told you what this math 
                could do.

                                CLAST *
                I don t know any Frank Auster-- *

                                MEGAN *
                Sorry, but his company s number s  *
                all over your phone records.   *

                              DON
                Nearly all your baseball clients 
                are juicing.  You stood to lose  *
                millions in commissions.

                              CLAST
                Like a lot of other agents.

                              MEGAN
                But you re the only one who knew 
                about this math application.  
                Because your client and best friend 
                showed it to you.

  Clast stiffens--

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                Vick Johnston trusted very few  *
                people.  But he trusted you.   

                              DON
                You were in the team locker room 
                with him the day before he died.

                              MEGAN
                Is that when you put the vial with 
                the lethal dose in his bag?    

  Clast fights to stay blank, but her words eat at him.  

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                And Chris Bronmiller -- we found 
                blood on his clothes that didn t 
                match his DNA. 

                              DON
                It ll match yours.

  Clast looks up, the blood draining out of his face.  Megan is 
  already behind him, putting on the cuffs.

  Megan puts a hand on Clast to lead him away.  But he resists 
  a moment -- looking out at the beautiful green infield.  
  Regret and recrimination crashing inside of him.

                              CLAST
                I love this game.  Just like Vick  *
                did.

  They walk Clast off the field, the players noticing.
