We're seeing the most private of Max's rituals, the one he
doesn't share with anybody.
Now, he starts hustling for calls by posting himself in a nearby

MAX (CONT'D)
I think he's dead.
VINCENT

Max stares at Vincent. It's sinking in. Vincent, meanwhile,

another, or...
MAX
You - you killed him?
VINCENT
No. I - I shot him.
The bullets and
the fall killed him.
A frozen beat. Everything's out in the open. Max realizes he's
in trouble. He backs away, thinking escape...

about his intent...
He heads towards the entry gate, rings a buzzer. Waits a

kick your ass if he wanted to.
He pulls a thin plastic card from an inner pocket of his jacket,

REVEAL Vincent looking at his PC. Vincent pulls from his

a .45 Cal Para-Ordnance back up. He moves the slide, checking
there's a round in the chamber. Max hears metal on metal, looks
up. As Vincent holsters it in the small of his back...

turn the corner.
White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it...

He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and
walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the

Vincent's left slams aside #1's .380. Draws and FIRES from the
hip, putting TWO ROUNDS into #1. HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the
sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds.
White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the
ground. #1 never saw it coming. Vincent picks up his case,
retrieves something from #1's pocket, puts one more into the

head of #1 on the way back to the cab...

Frozen in horror.
Astonished.
The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back
seat. He gets into the front.
Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max.
Maybe ready to kill him.

Weidner and Fanning glance up. A PLAINCLOTHES COP is leaning

out of Ramone's broken window, dangling a clear plastic baggy.
He drops it. It comes sailing down...

He glances down at it, shows it
to Weidner...
TIGHT ON WEIDNER
...revealing two spent .45 cal. shell casings in the bag.
WEIDNER

So, who's got what? Any witnesses?

COP #1
Old guy across the street, lives above
the deli? Says he saw a cab parked
here earlier tonight. There were two
guys working under the hood.
WEIDNER
Description. What did he see?
COP #1
"Kinda" saw...guy's got glasses like
coke bottles.
FANNING
Did he "see" it or did his seeing eye
dog see it?
COP #1
Late-model four-door Ford.
Yellow or

(off Fanning's look)
Maybe it was a taxi cab.
WEIDNER

FANNING
Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area

deal? Oakland. Cabbie drove around

all night. Killed three people...
WEIDNER
Then he flipped out, put the gun to
his head. So what?
*
FANNING
So the Oakland PD detective,
*
whatshisname, never bought it.
WEIDNER
Why?
FANNING
The Cabbie had no criminal record. No
history of mental illness. Pops three
people, then himself? And the victims
weren't random. Two were involved in
some pharmaceuticals scam...
(off Weidner's look)
Anyway, the detective always thought
there was somebody else in that cab.
35

...and they exit the club.
Vincent heads for the cab, turns and
sees Max standing there.
VINCENT
Let's go.
MAX
No.
VINCENT
What you mean, no?
MAX
I'm done.
Find another cab.
Max turns, walking away.

Vincent grabs the back of his collar, slams him against the

VINCENT

I'm not playing.
MAX
You played him, man.

He got the answer right, would you

The question hangs in the air.
Before Vincent can answer, the
DISPATCH RADIO CRACKLES:
LENNY (FILTERED)
Max?
Maaax. Pick up, you dipshit.
VINCENT
What is it with this guy?
LENNY (FILTERED)
Maaaaaax!
Vincent spins Max, controls him, as he propels him to the cab,
slams him against the fender.
Vincent releases him, points at him. Don't move. He reaches
into the cab, pulls out the radio mike, clicks it on.

Max takes the hand mike, clicks it on.

LENNY (FILTERED)
Your mother's calling every ten

VINCENT

Show for what?
MAX

Tell her I can't make it tonight,

by a truck and the tablet PC is de-constructed into useless
pieces of plastic and silicone. Vincent approaches.

Max is suddenly on the ground, not knowing how he got there,
about to die.
