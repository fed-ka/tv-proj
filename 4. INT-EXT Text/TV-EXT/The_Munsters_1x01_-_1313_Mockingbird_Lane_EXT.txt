CAMERA DRIFTS OVER THE MOONLIT TREE TOPS to find the warm 
glow of a CAMP FIRE below where A SCOUT MASTER (40) addresses 
a DOZEN BOY SCOUTS (10-15) on a serious problem, as evidenced 
by the myriad crumpled food boxes and wrappers on display.

SCOUT MASTER
Would anybody like to say anything 
before we discuss community, 
responsibility and Scout honor?

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the Boy Scouts' faces until FINDING a 
thin, fastidious Scout named HUEY (11), who speaks up:

HUEY
We all know who it was.  Wallace's 
had a serious eating disorder since 
Webleos and you've all ignored it.

SCOUT MASTER
No one is ignoring anything, Huey.

HUEY
Well, someone gave him a merit 
badge in personal fitness.

There's an EH-HEM clearing of throat just outside the circle 
of Scouts from someone sitting on a log in the dark.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Oh.  I didn't see you there.

A heftier child named WALLACE (11) steps up, PUNCHES HUEY IN 
THE SHOULDER then returns to the dark log he was sitting on.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Ow.

SCOUT MASTER
Wallace.

HUEY
(undeterred)
I could hear whatever snack 
wrappers you have in your pockets 
crinkling when you hit me.



(CONTINUED)2.

CONTINUED:

Wallace stops moving, shooting Huey a tight-mouthed stare.

HUEY (CONT'D)
See.  He can't even deny it because 
his mouth is full.

Wallace slow chews, almost imperceptively so, nostrils 
flaring, as he tries to disguise what he's doing.  He 
swallows, then:

WALLACE
The crinkle is stay dry lining.  
Also, we're in the woods.  So maybe 
what got into the foods was a wild 
animal.  Like a baby bear.

Huey drops his bomb:

HUEY
I saw you hiding in the tall grass 
eating a box of Cap'n Crunch.

A few Scouts gasp, one we will call MARTIN turns to Wallace:

MARTIN
He called you out.

Another Scout who we will call BILLY interjects:

BILLY
That was my Cap'n Crunch.

WALLACE
Wasn't me.  I'm allergic to grass.

HUEY
First, we're surrounded by grass.  
So I guess your grass allergy makes 
you hungry.  Second...

Huey produces his iThing and shows everyone the covert 
picture of Wallace eating Capt'n Crunch in the tall grass.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Third, did you really think you 
could convince us there was some 
mysterious, wild, baby bear animal 
out there in the forest eating all 
our sugar cereals --

WOMPF!  A MYSTERIOUS WILD ANIMAL tackles Huey OUT OF FRAME. 
The Scouts SCATTER as they SCREAM IN HIGH-PITCHED TERROR.  




(CONTINUED)3.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Scout Master jumps to Huey's defense and the ANIMAL LEAPS 
ONTO HIS FACE AND CHEST, taking him down in one fell swoop.

Billy scrambles into his tent, zipping himself into his 
sleeping bag just as the ANIMAL slashes through the nylon 
wall and YANKS him outside.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Billy's sleeping 
bag dragged at high, galloping speeds through the forest.

Wallace leaps on a tree, climbing branch after branch up the 
trunk, earning every stitch of his personal fitness badge.  
But IT can climb faster, slashing and clawing at his heels.

A big, dramatic, iconic horror movie shot as shrieking SCOUTS 
dash along a hillside SILHOUETTED against the FULL MOON 
followed shortly thereafter by the ANIMAL in lunatic pursuit.

As chaos reigns in the forest, CAMERA DRIFTS TO THE MOON...

...WHICH BECOMES THE SUN.

CAMERA SNAPS BACK DOWN TO EARTH, SPECIFICALLY:


The camp site has been ravaged.  Tents are slashed.  The fire 
pit still smokes, but the fire wood was scattered.  There's a 
haze of early morning fog in the air.  A sleeping bag hangs 
high in a tree, unzipping itself REVEALING a terrified Billy 
still inside.  The Scout Master (scratched but not bitten) 
and other exhausted Scouts survived the evening crushed like 
sardines into the cab of the Scout Master's PICK-UP TRUCK.

CAMERA PULLS BACK from the Pick-Up Truck, across the forest 
floor and through some dense ground vegetation until A SWEET-
FACED BOY (10) sits up INTO FRAME as if from a deep sleep.  
He blinks and glances around, yawning and stretching, with 
absolutely no memory of the night before.  More blinks.

Meet EDDIE MUNSTER.

CUT TO BLACK.


END OF TEASER4.


ACT ONE


A DECREPIT MANSION in the suburb of Mockingbird Heights.  

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the home is surrounded by 
BULLDOZERS AND HYDRAULIC EXCAVATORS (the modern descendant of 
the wrecking ball).  Beyond the perimeter of DEMOLITION 
EQUIPMENT and their HARD-HATTED HANDLERS, A CROWD OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD FOLK has gathered to watch 1313 go down.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS and a REAL ESTATE AGENT (40s) escorts a 
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN named MARILYN (25) out of the house.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
You can see, it's a very emotional 
property for the neighborhood.  The 
previous owner was a notorious 
serial killer who poisoned hobos.

MARILYN
I'll take it.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
They're about to tear it down.

MARILYN
But they haven't yet.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
This is a horrible place.  Horrible 
things happened here.  They found 
dozens of graves in the back yard.

MARILYN
Mmm-hmm.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
Miss, there may be dead homeless 
people in the walls.

MARILYN
If we find any, I'll let you know.

SMASH CUT TO:


A lone DELIVERY TRUCK makes its way along a winding road.  
HEADLIGHTS wash over a sign that reads MOCKINGBIRD HEIGHTS.


The Delivery Truck has pulled over to the side of the road.  

Mr. Perez and Mr. Garcia open the cargo container doors and 
flick a switch.  A dim bulb provides barely enough light, but 
enough to see patches of icy frost on the two wooden crates.  
Mr. Garcia feels the crate with his bare hand, jumping at how 
sharp the cold is against his palm.

MR. PEREZ

MR. GARCIA
 not ice cream.It s

Mr. Garcia turns to see, standing in the road about twenty 
feet from the back of the delivery truck, A LARGE BLACK WOLF.  
He nudges Mr. Perez and by the time he turns to look, there 
are FIVE LARGE BLACK WOLVES standing in the road behind them.

Both gentlemen grab a crow bar and calmly climb out of the 
back of the truck, closing and locking the doors.  The FIVE 
LARGE BLACK WOLVES watch inscrutably silent.  Then they all 
take a calculated step forward, herding Mr. Garcia and Mr. 
Perez back to the cab of the truck.  As they scramble into:


The Delivery Truck pushes its way through the DRIVEWAY GATES 
and backs up to LARGE CELLAR DOORS.  Brake lights brighten 
and Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez hop out of the truck.  The 
headlights of the Delivery Truck shine across the expansive 
backyard, illuminating dozens of open graves.  

MR. GARCIA
I want those things off my truck.



(CONTINUED)9.

CONTINUED:

Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez open the back doors of the Delivery 
Truck and push the first crate onto the loading platform and 
unload it, quickly moving the second one into position.  Mr. 
 a faint Perez leans closer, listening intently.  There s
SCRITCHY-SCRATCHY scurrying sort of noise coming from inside.  

MR. PEREZ

Mr. Garcia listens, too.  

It sounds as if something big is shifting.  They try to 
steady the crate, but it TOPPLES from the platform, landing 
hard enough to SPLINTER THE CORNER.  A rich, earthy soil 
spills... followed by 100 RATS THAT TEEM OUT OF THE CRACKED 
CRATE.  As the RATS FLOOD THE GROUND IN A HAIRY STREAM...

...Mr. Garcia has already thrown the truck into gear.  Mr. 
Perez runs along side of the moving Delivery Truck before 
pulling himself up and into the cab.

As the terrified Delivery Men flee, THE RATS CLIMB ONTO EACH 
OTHER S BACKS AND ASSEMBLE INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY OLD MAN with a 
rosy twinkle in his milky eyes.  MEET GRANDPA (580).  

He stands there a moment, naked and sagging before Marilyn 
finally approaches with a luxurious red silk robe.  She 
 shoulders as HERMAN ENTERS.drapes the robe over Grandpa s

MARILYN
Oh, Grandpa, cover yourself.  What 
will the neighbors think.

A LIGHT MIST seeps out of the cracks in the other crate, 
collecting into a CLOUD that APPARATES into a STILL SMOKY 
PRETERNATURALLY BEAUTIFUL, PALE WOMAN.  MEET LILY MUNSTER. 

The moment the SMOKY CLOUD coalesces into Lily's naked form, 
HUNDREDS OF SPIDERS descend from above, cascading over the 
 body, weaving a beautiful dress from Munster matriarch s
their silk.  Herman takes in his striking beauty with:

HERMAN
Hello, Lily.10.



Grandpa, in his luxurious red silk robe, glides toward the 
gates, peering out at the neighborhood, Marilyn by his side.

GRANDPA
I preferred it when the village was 
further away.  And we had a moat.

MARILYN
Best moats are made of good manners 
and filled with congeniality.

Grandpa gives Marilyn an annoyed, side-long glance, then:

GRANDPA
I'll make cookies.

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

A TRAY OF DELICIOUS FROSTED BUTTER COOKIES.  

GRANDPA'S WITHERED PALE CREPE-PAPER SKIN COVERED FINGER.


Marilyn (holding the tray of cookies) strolls arm-in-arm with 
Grandpa (dressed as an adorable older gentlemen, fedora, and 
the such), who glides along a neighbor s walkway, HIS SHADOW 
already stretching across the lawn and ringing the doorbell.  

GRANDPA
Look at these homes.  Each an 
impenetrable stronghold to a 
vampire without invitation.

The door OPENS as Grandpa and Marilyn climb the stairs to the 
porch.  NEIGHBOR TIM (50s) stands to greet them.

MARILYN
 Marilyn Munster.  This Hello, I m
is my grandpa, Grandpa. 




(CONTINUED)11.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
You can also call me Grandpa.

MARILYN
We just moved in across the street.

Neighbor Tim smiles and opens the door a little wider.

NEIGHBOR TIM
Welcome to the hood.  I'm Tim.

GRANDPA
Just a second, Tim.

 face, Grandpa waves his hand in front of Neighbor Tim s
putting him in a DEEP TRANCE, his eyelids dropping to half-
mast as he more or less stops moving exactly where he is.  
Grandpa turns to Marilyn, reading her like a book:

GRANDPA (CONT D)
   we.  said You  in?  moved just  We
Were you planning on staying?

MARILYN
I was hoping on staying.  Were you 
planning on me not staying?

GRANDPA
Yes.  I was going to miss you when 
you were gone, but I would also be 
quite pleased you weren't here.

MARILYN
I'm touched that you'd miss me, but 
I didn't like that other part.

GRANDPA
Aren't you in higher learning on 
the other side of the country?

MARILYN
I transferred my class credits.

GRANDPA
They don't have campus housing?

MARILYN
It's a community college.

GRANDPA
I adore you, Marilyn.  I'm the one 
who talked your mother out of 
eating you, but you can't stay.



(CONTINUED)12.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
Why not?

GRANDPA
I'm going to start eating people.

MARILYN
I've seen you eat people before.

FLASHBACK TO:


Grandpa and Marilyn, as before, with DEEP TRANCE Tim.

GRANDPA
I haven't had a sip for the better 
part of a decade as to not terrify 
the boy.  But now that Eddie is in 
the family way, not eating people 
might send the wrong message.

MARILYN
Like eating people is bad?

GRANDPA
As one example.

MARILYN
Eating people is bad.

GRANDPA
Precisely why you shouldn't stay.  
Nobody wants to eat anybody with 
that standing over their shoulder.

Before Marilyn can continue to pursue that, Grandpa waves his 
hand over Neighbor Tim s face, lifting him out of the trance.




(CONTINUED)13.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA (CONT D)
May I say you have a stunning home.

NEIGHBOR TIM
Would you like to come in?

GRANDPA
Can you re-phrase that as a 
statement?

NEIGHBOR TIM
Please come in...?

GRANDPA
Don't mind if I do.

Neighbor Tim opens the door wider, allowing first Marilyn and 
then a gliding Grandpa to ENTER.  OFF the DOOR CLOSING...

A FOGGY CLOUD

It roils and shifts like a time-lapse storm front.  We are -


A STORM FRONT rolls in, unfurling over Mockingbird Heights.  
Eddie climbs up onto the roof and walks along its highest 
pitch to the chimney, where he affixes a LIGHTNING ROD.

EDDIE
(calling down)
Ready!

Almost in direct response to Eddie's call, the dramatic STORM 
FRONT RUMBLES as air molecules split in anticipation of...

CRRRZZZAK!

A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY summoned from the cloud strikes the 
LIGHTNING ROD and briefly dances across it in an arc.

CAMERA LAUNCHES INTO THE CHIMNEY following the LIGHTNING ARC 
down the metal conducting rod into the darkness.

CAMERA EMERGES from the darkness and HERMAN'S OPEN CHEST 
CAVITY as the ELECTRICITY ARCS across a series of wires and 
alligator clips into a CUMBERSOME FIST-SIZED STEAM-PUNK 
BATTERY PUMP sitting where his heart should be.  

Herman abruptly sits up INTO FRAME REVEALING we are --


Herman leans on his shovel surrounded by open graves.  He's 
speaking to someone not visually present, presumably Grandpa.  

HERMAN
If I can't have my own heart, I 
need one that beats to the same 
drum of fidelity and domesticity.

A TEAM OF RATS crawls up and out of the soil and into the 
CRUMPLED CLOTHES lying on the ground, simultaneously dressing 
themselves as they assemble into GRANDPA.

GRANDPA
There's a whole bunch under there.  
Think it might be a swimming pool.




(CONTINUED)21.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
We have a swimming pool?

Herman flips a switch on a vine-covered pedestal.  There's a 
HUM and WHIR as the GROUND OPENS UP.  An AUTOMATIC POOL COVER 
buried under a foot of lawn RETRACTS REVEALING inside the 
drained pool are dozens of DEAD HOBOS packed like sardines.

Grandpa begins plucking hearts out of the chests of the top 
layer of DEAD HOBOS like turnips out of the ground.

GRANDPA
Too fatty.  Too small.  Thin walls.

HERMAN
I don't want some vagabond's hooch-
addled sump pump.  Hobos are hobos 
for a reason.  They are free 
spirits with fleeting connections.  

GRANDPA
Now you're adverse to hobo parts?

HERMAN
I need a heart predispositioned to 
feel how I feel about Eddie and 
Lily.  To a lesser extent Marilyn.  
And to a much lesser extent you.

Grandpa tosses that last heart over his shoulder and shakes 
the muck from his hand before throwing down the following:

GRANDPA
I'll get your heart for you.  Like 
you ordered it out of a catalog.  
And the moment it is beating in your 
chest you will tell Eddie you are 
the proud father of a werewolf.

SMASH CUT TO:


CAMERA GLIDES across the surface of the water to REVEAL:


Marilyn and Lily are perched on one of the massive supporting 
pylons under the bridge, taking in the night.

LILY
Gotten so used to drinking alone.  




(CONTINUED)22.

CONTINUED:

MARILYN
I brought hot cocoa. 

LILY
Drinking isn't a pretty time for 
me.  I don't want to scar you any 
more than my sister already has.  

MARILYN
Grandpa's going to start eating 
people and I need to get used to it 
so he'll stop packing up my room.

LILY
Your mother's post-partem craving for 
baby meat was... embarrassing for 
Grandpa.  I know it had a profound 
effect on my relationship with Eddie.

MARILYN
It was embarrassing for me, too.  Came 
out one end went back in the other.

LILY
I was so ashamed of what she tried 
to do.  And when Eddie was born, I 
was so ashamed of what I might do...   

MARILYN
You developed an eating disorder.

LILY
It clearly affected my self-esteem.  
Look at me.  I'm lurking under 
bridges like a common troll.

There's a THWUSH and a FLAPPING of loose clothing as a 
SUICIDE plummets past them, followed by a distant SPLASH.

LILY (CONT D)
I'll get the next one.

MARILYN
I'm sure Eddie would appreciate how 
wasteful suicide is and how you're 
trying to give it a small purpose.

She is uncomfortable with the words as they leave her mouth.

LILY
Eddie is not going to appreciate 
his mother eating anybody.




(CONTINUED)23.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
He just has to make it the same in 
his mind as a coyote eating a 
squirrel who doesn't want to live.

LILY
Eddie is his mother's son and I 
can't even be proud.  The more I 
see of myself in him, the more I 
know he's going to hate me for it.

She s interrupted by the SCREAM! of a SUICIDE leaping to his 
death off the bridge above.  Startlingly before Marilyn's 
very eyes LILY'S BEAUTY SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO SOMETHING 
WITH A LARGE FANG-RIDDLED MOUTH.  She leaps off the support 
pylon with lightning-like reflexes, snatching the suicide in 
her maw and riding him toward the water until they disappear 
in the dense fog.  Marilyn takes a sip from her thermos. 

SMASH CUT TO:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE

Healthy, handsome, confident, athletic, warm, and friendly.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Know what I love about Scouting?
(wait for it)
Everything.  We get to be nice to 
people all day.  It's our job.  
Being pleasant is our super power. 

CAMERA REVEALS we are --


Beautiful.  Still.  A DEER ENTERS FRAME quietly and 
cautiously sniffing at the grass before taking a bite.

The wonder of nature.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --


Grandpa sits in a lawn chair beneath a parasol, glass of 
lemonade, a fresh batch of heart cookies beside him.  
Neighbor Tim stands on a ladder leaning against the house, 
sweating furiously as he paints the eaves. 



(CONTINUED)30.

CONTINUED:

Herman stomps out the front door, barely noticing laboring 
Tim, and charges across the lawn toward Grandpa.  

QUICK POP TO:

HERMAN'S HEART

His stapled, stitched and steam-punked HEART PUMPS and BEATS 
LABORIOUSLY in fits and starts, already over-excited.

RIGHT BACK TO:

HERMAN   

He stops and winces at his chest pain, then takes a deep 
breath and continues across the lawn very, very calmly.  

HERMAN
Why is that man painting the house?

GRANDPA
What people will do for a cookie.

HERMAN
What did you put in that cookie?

GRANDPA
I may have cut myself while baking.

HERMAN
Please don't turn the neighbors 
into your blood slaves.

CAMERA SWIVELS OFF Herman and Grandpa, RACES ACROSS THE YARD, 
UP THE HOUSE, PAST Eddie's eyes peeking over the lip of a 
second story window ledge, watching Herman and Grandpa argue, 
FINDING Neighbor Tim is high on a ladder happily painting.  

ON HERMAN AND GRANDPA

Herman speaks to Grandpa in a steady manner as to not upset 
himself.  His tone is pleasant, like a warm "how do you do:"

HERMAN (CONT D)
What I'm about to say I will say 
calmly with even-tempered civility.  
However, you should interpret my 
politeness as severe disapproval.

Herman takes a long, soothing breath as Tim climbs down the 
ladder and collects a BUCKET OF PAINT, then climbs back up.




(CONTINUED)31.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
You disapprove of an open, honest 
dialogue with my grandson about the 
changes his body is going through?  

HERMAN
I disapprove of you freaking him out.

GRANDPA
Only one I see freaking out is you.  
Frankly, your heart can't take it.

Another deep, cleansing breath for Herman.

HERMAN
Eddie is a sensitive little boy.

GRANDPA
Don't be too hard on yourself for 
raising him that way.  You didn't 
know.  How could you?  After 
Marilyn, we all assumed the worst.  

HERMAN
Eddie was born pink and chubby and 
was raised accordingly.

GRANDPA
Not so pink anymore.  He finally 
has the genetic license he needs to 
be the Munster he was meant to be.

HERMAN
I issued his genetic license.

GRANDPA
You weren't a Munster until I made 
you a Munster.  Eddie was born one 
and not a thing you've done or can 
do as a parent will change that.

Herman is momentarily stunned by the blunt trauma of that 
statement.  He searches for a response, but instead finds:

GRANDPA (CONT D)
Careful.  You're one popped stitch 
from a full coronary.  And since 
that heart and I have a difference 
of opinion, I wouldn't count on me 
putting it back together again when 
fresher options are available.




(CONTINUED)32.

CONTINUED: (2)

HERMAN
What would you tell Eddie?  

GRANDPA
The truth.

HERMAN
That you exsanguinated his Scout 
Master and I took his heart?

GRANDPA
Yes.  I'm curious what he'd have to 
say on the subject.  I honestly 
don't know what you're waiting for.  
Hearts don't just fall off trees.

PLUNK.  A PAINT CAN falls in the dirt.

ON THE SECOND STORY WINDOW

Neighbor Tim falls from atop the ladder, a FRESH STREAK OF 
PAINT across the Second Story Window and down the exterior 
wall charts his descent.  He lands with a heavy WOMPF.

TIME CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER

Herman has a comforting arm around Eddie's shoulder as they 
watch PARAMEDICS pull a sheet over Neighbor Tim's dead body 
then load him into the back of their AMBULANCE.  CAMERA FINDS 
Grandpa comforting Tim's SHRILL, SOBBING WIFE, DOT.

DOT
I don't understand any of this.  I 
couldn't get him to sweep the front 
porch and he works himself to death 
painting the neighbor's house.

Dot nibbles on a cookie as Grandpa comforts her.

GRANDPA
It's a testament to his character.

Her sobs begin to thin as she falls under Grandpa's spell.

DOT
These cookies are really good.

GRANDPA
It may be presumptuous of me to 
say, but you don't seem quite as 
upset as you thought you were.



(CONTINUED)33.

CONTINUED:

Considering that, Dot realizes she isn't terribly upset.

DOT
No, I'm not.  Not anymore.

GRANDPA
The strangest thing about grieving 
is realizing your loved one's death 
isn't all that big of a deal.

DOT
It does seem like a silly thing to 
get upset about, doesn't it?

GRANDPA
Have another cookie.

CAMERA FINDS Eddie and Herman as Eddie asks a Paramedic:

EDDIE
How did he die?

PARAMEDIC
Heart attack.

Herman turns to see Grandpa now standing next to him.

GRANDPA
Your options are dwindling.

Herman's eyes narrow.

CLOSE ON - DOORBELL

A FINGER ENTERS FRAME and rings the bell.  BINGBONG.  

We are --


Scout Master Steve stands on the well-worn door mat, testing 
an odd creek in the floorboards, as Grandpa OPENS THE DOOR.  

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Hi!

GRANDPA
(over his shoulder)
Herman.  It's for you.
CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT THREE34.


ACT FOUR

CLOSE ON - A COVERED SILVER FOOD PLATTER

The hauntingly distorted image of the Munster house against 
the misty, starry night is reflected on the silver dome as 
CAMERA REVEALS Dot, wearing an apron, carrying the platter.

Then CAMERA REVEALS a SMALL PARADE OF NEIGHBORS, six in 
total, following immediately behind Dot, all carrying dishes.

DOT0
I hope you like it bloody!

This serves as Dot's enthusiastic greeting as she approaches:


Grandpa and Scout Master Steve sit on the porch swing, gently 
rocking back and forth.  Grandpa's old-fashioned 
sensibilities combine with the Victorian house to give a very 
classic "Meet Me in St. Louis" feeling to the scene.  

GRANDPA
Dot recently lost her husband.

Dot climbs the stairs and stops briefly before going inside, 
causing a few drops of blood to spill off the platter.  

DOT
Very recently.  But I'm feeling 
better about it by the minute.  I'm 
gonna put this beef on the table.

The Small Parade of Neighbors continues into the house with 
trays of food, smiling and nodding to a pleasant Grandpa.

VARIOUS NEIGHBORSGRANDPA
Evening.  Evening!  Evening.Evening.

The last of the parading neighbors passes through the front 
door as Grandpa turns back to Scout Master Steve.

GRANDPA
Marriage and mortality.  "'Till 
death us do part."

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Death wasn't strong enough to part 
the sea of love I swam with my wife.





(CONTINUED)35.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
I've had countless brides.  They're 
all dead now, but we keep in touch.

Steve feels a kinship with Grandpa, who seems to understand.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I feel Wendie Jo with me every day.

GRANDPA
As lovely a sentiment as that is, 
and it really is just so nice, have 
you thought about opening your 
heart to new possibilities?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Oh, no.  I couldn't.

GRANDPA
Wendie Jo isn't going to claw her 
way out of the grave to stop you 
from loving and being loved.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
She was cremated.  And entombed.

GRANDPA
Steve, I've not been entirely 
honest with you.  I had an ulterior 
motive for inviting you to dinner.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(good-natured)
Uh-oh!

GRANDPA
Of all my scores of children, my 
daughter Lily is the only one who 
actually loves me.  And I fear she 
may be without love herself. 

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
What about Herman?

GRANDPA
Herman's dying.  It's his heart.  
He's inconsolable at the thought of 
leaving Lily and Eddie without a 
husband and father, respectively.  
He's enlisted me to find a man with 
a good heart his family can love.  




(CONTINUED)36.

CONTINUED: (2)

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Poor Herman.  

GRANDPA
Yes, but we're talking about Lily.  
You're a widower and she's soon to 
be a widow.  Please don't hate me 
for being so wicked and conniving.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Seems awfully sudden.  Since her 
husband is still alive.

GRANDPA
He could go at any moment.  I'm 
simply asking you to open your 
heart to a kindred spirit.  Give a 
dying man and his tormented family 
a little hope for the future.

Scout Master Steve considers that, then:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I look forward to meeting your 
daughter, sir.

Grandpa waves his hand in front of Scout Master Steve's face 
planting the seeds of suggestion in his mind:

GRANDPA
You're going to love Lily.

As the underlying charm of Grandpa's words sinks in, Dot and 
the Parade of Neighbors file out of the house with a simple:

DOT
Bon appetite!

SMASH CUT TO:

HERMAN'S HEART

BDUM-FFFFF-BDUM-FFFFF-BDUM-FFFFF.  The steam-punked tissue 
RACES in fits and starts, straining against the mechanics 
holding it together.  CAMERA PULLS OUT to find Herman is --


The door SHUTS CURTLY on Scout Master Steve's heels.  The 
floor boards under the welcome mat creeks peculiarly.

Scout Master Steve takes a deep breath and sighs, smitten:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Lily.

Then THE WELCOME MAT DROPS OUT BENEATH HIM.  Scout Master 
Steve PLUNGES INTO THE BOWELS OF 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE.


CAMERA FINDS Herman and Eddie sitting side by side on the 
highest pitch near the chimney, under the lightning rod.

EDDIE
Grandpa is not a gentleman.

HERMAN
I know he isn't.  And I know you 
spent the last 10 years growing 
into a perfect little gentleman but 
the sad truth of it is, your 
hormones are going to throw that 
little gentleman under a bus.

EDDIE
Are you talking about puberty?

HERMAN
And then some.  

EDDIE
I know about embarrassing dreams 
and growing hair in strange places.

HERMAN
What about growing hair everywhere.

EDDIE
Where else does it grow?

Herman's mind reels, looking for somewhere to go that isn't 
the conversation he's about to have.  He takes the leap:

HERMAN
There was no baby bear.

EDDIE
What was it?

HERMAN
You.

EDDIE
What?

HERMAN
You're the baby bear.

It hangs there a moment as Eddie's world drops out under him.




(CONTINUED)46.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
I thought I was ravaged and tossed 
naked into the shrubs.

HERMAN
That wasn't you.  You ravaged and 
ran naked through the shrubs.  

Eddie starts to breath hard, trying to keep from passing out.

HERMAN (CONT D)
You are a Munster.  You are not a 
monster.  Eddie.  Look at me.

Eddie finally, reluctantly raises his head, eyes near tears.

EDDIE
Did I hurt anybody?

HERMAN
There were a few scratches.  Worth 
the price of the camp fire 
anecdote.  You didn't do anything 
worse than turn into a werewolf.

EDDIE
There isn't anything worse.

HERMAN
I love you, Eddie.  You have 
nothing to be ashamed of.  You have 
something to be careful of.  You 
also have me and your mom.

EDDIE
Mom says Munsters eat meat.  I 
don't want to eat meat.  

HERMAN
You don't have to be like any 
Munster there is.  Except Eddie 
Munster, who doesn't eat meat.

EDDIE
I can't be a vegetarian werewolf.

HERMAN
You can be a vegetarian when you 
can help it, and when you can't, 
that problem we'll solve together.

Eddie nods his head solemnly, not convinced.  Unfortunately, 
his father Herman isn't any more convinced.  



(CONTINUED)47.

CONTINUED: (2)

HERMAN (CONT D)
Go get ready for bed.

Eddie allows his father to kiss him on the forehead, then 
walks balance-beam style OUT OF FRAME, leaving Herman alone.

A moment as Herman looks out at the foggy night and considers 
the road ahead and raising a teenage werewolf.  Then...

HERMAN'S HEART

PLUPT!  Herman's weathered, worn, stapled, stitched and steam-
punked heart EXPLODES IN HIS CHEST.

THE ROOF

Herman's face goes slack and he tumbles backward, sliding 
down the cobbled slope of tiles and off the roof.

ON HERMAN

He soars past the rain gutter in SLOW MOTION and over the 
edge.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Herman's descent on his sad, bewildered 
expression of a man whose life was suddenly stolen away.

The ground rushes up at Herman and as he's about to hit...

CUT TO BLACK.


Herman and Eddie are both wearing age-appropriate Boy Scouts 
of America uniforms, Lily dressed in a spider-silk dress.

LILY
What's the Boy Scout motto?

EDDIE
"Be prepared."

HERMAN
Consider yourself prepared.

EDDIE
For what?

HERMAN
Vegetarianism.  

LILY
You don't have to worry about 
eating anything or anyone ever 
again.  Not "ever again" because 
"again" means it happened before.

HERMAN
And it didn't.

EDDIE
Are you going to kennel me?

HERMAN
We got you something from a kennel.

LILY
Think of it like that dog at your 
last school who could smell seizures.

EDDIE
That kid had a condition.

LILY
You have a condition.

EDDIE
A dog with a vest tells everybody I 
have a condition.





(CONTINUED)49.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
Nobody has a dog like this.  You'll 
be the envy of all your everyone.

EDDIE
That's like telling a disabled 
person their wheelchair looks fun.

LILY
You have a disability.  Next time 
you have an episode, before you even 
sprout one hair, you've got a friend 
who can get you to a place you won't 
hurt yourself or anybody else.

EDDIE
A dog can't stop a werewolf from 
eating somebody.

HERMAN
No, but a dragon can.

He WHISTLES and calls as though calling a dog from the sky:

HERMAN (CONT D)
Spot!  

He directs Eddie's attention to the sky, where:  A SHADOW 
GROWS DARKER as whatever LARGE WINGED THING casting it is 
 a WHOOSH about to descend out of the MORNING FOG.  There s
from above as a FLEETING BEAST emerges.  We get only a 
 SCALES SHIFT TEXTURE AND glimpse of the DRAGON before it s
COLOR IRIDESCENTLY like an oil slick before it becomes 99.9% 
INVISIBLE.  The tissue of its scales are bending light but we 
still FEEL the WOMPF as it lands in the backyard.

ON EDDIE

He is appropriately awestruck at the massive beast.  Eddie 
reaches up and strokes Spot's snout as it disappears.

Although the rest of Spot is 99.9% invisible, its EYES 
affectionately FLICKER as TWIN FLAMES erupt from its snout, 
spraying out safely above Eddie's head, illuminating rows of 
JAGGED DEADLY TEETH with reflective light.

Eddie turns to his parents:

EDDIE
Do I get to keep him?
