                        I still don't understand why they
                        wanted you to see them commit a
                        murder.  Are they stupid or crazy?

          Across from the house is a giant clock tower.

                        I heard a clock in my vision.

                        party going on.

          Walt and Johnny are approaching the house.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (on phone)
                        Don't lose them, we're coming in.



          Johnny and Bruce walk up to the door.  As they do, a
          COLLEGE KID passes in a hazy, smoke-filled car with his
          buddies.

                                        COLLEGE KID
                        Catch any killers, Johnny?

          They LAUGH as they drive past.

                                        BRUCE
                        Higher education, huh?

          And they KNOCK on the front door.  George answers.

                                        GEORGE
                        Mr. Smith?  What a surprise.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got a minute?

                                        GEORGE
                        Sure.  C'mon in.  I've been
                          expecting you.



          Johnny sits idling in his car outside of Fernanda's house. 
          He finishes a cup of coffee, crumples and tosses it on
          the floor, joining a few other cups. 

          A light turns on in the house.  The blinds open just a
          bit.  Nicole, the roommate, looks outside.  Then quickly
          shuts the blinds.

          A moment later, Fernanda emerges at the door, marches
          towards the car.  Johnny steps out.

                                        FERNANDA
                        Come up and ring the doorbell, do
                        something, but quit watching us,
                        it's freaking out my roommate. 
                        What are you doing out here? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not here to freak you out.

                                        FERNANDA
                        I'm calling the cops unless you
                        leave.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, this is going to sound crazy,
                        but you're in danger.  You need
                        to stay away from George Todd.

                        Why?

                        Please.  I wouldn't be out here
                        if I didn't believe it.

          Fernanda scrutinizes.  Smiles.

                          something to justify whatever's
                        going on in your head.  It was

          She starts to walk away.  Johnny watches as his chance
          fades, and grabs her arm -



          Fernanda breaks away from Johnny's grip.

                        of her holding you as a child. 
                        She'll give it to you in your
                        casket.  And then she'll fix your
                        collar.  Even in death she wants
                        you to look beautiful.

          Fernanda stares at Johnny, a bit surprised, scared.

          Fernanda rushes into her house and shuts the door.



          Johnny still sits in the car, watching Fernanda's house. 
          Keeping vigil.  A Sheriff's cruiser pulls up next to him.

                          complaint against you.  You can't
                        just sit in front of someone's

                        I saw her die.

          Walt sighs, a little annoyed.  Been through this already.

                                        WALT
                        Next time, just call me rather
                        than stalking someone for the
                        night.
                              (a beat)
                        Look, if it'll help, I'll go talk
                        to her.



          Walt rings the doorbell, Johnny at his side.  No answer.

                                        WALT
                          Fernanda Lauer, it's Sheriff
                        Bannerman.

          No response.  They notice the lights are all OUT.

                                        WALT
                        Lights are off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been watching the door the
                        whole night.  Unless...

          Johnny and Walt walk around the house to the backyward
          where they notice the back window is OPEN.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She left!  I can't believe it.

                                        WALT
                        Calm down.  Let's not assume
                          anything just 'cause she's gone.

          BWOOP BWOOP.  Two campus cop cars FLY by them on the
          street.  Racing towards something.  They hear SIRENS in
          the distance, coming closer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Something's wrong.

          Walt's radio crackles.  A Dispatcher is directing Sheriff's
          deputies to join the campus police.  They look at each
          other.  They already know what the call is...



          The Todd house SWARMS with activity - Sheriff's Deputies,
            including ROSCOE  campus police, medical examiners, and
          bystanders.  Walt and Johnny head inside.          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT THREE - 2/24/04 - YELLOW   42.



          Johnny watches as George and Lennie walk out the front
          door.  Met by a media circus.  A REPORTER shoves a
          microphone towards them -

                                        GEORGE
                        I want the man who did this brought
                        to justice.

                                        LENNIE
                        We both do.  We're very sorry
                        that our thoughtless prank has
                        led to the death of a dear friend. 
                        We'll miss her very much.  Our
                        hearts go out to her family.

          They turn and get into a cab, ignoring questions from the
          press.  Cameras FLASH, confusing us as to which twin
          brother is which.

          Before the cab pulls away, Johnny catches the faintest
          glance of one of the brothers glaring back at him - one
          of them smirks at him.  But which one? 

          Off Johnny's look, determined he's not gonna let them get
          away with it.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          Walt escorts Johnny away from the bathroom.

                                        WALT
                        You better hope they don't press
                          charges.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guy is gonna have a nice shiner
                        after a hit like that.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Exactly.  Now I can tell them
                        apart.



          Johnny walks out with Walt and Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, the press is going to have a
                        field day with this story.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I guess.

                                        WALT
                        At least your reputation will be
                        set straight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My reputation got us into this
                        mess in the first place.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT FOUR - 2/23/04 - PINK   63.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't you want people to know you
                        were right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        People believe what they want to
                          believe.  Lennie believed Fernanda
                        would take away his brother...
                        and in the end.  He didn't know
                        how right he was.

          And Johnny pulls up the collar of his dark coat, and walks
          off into the night.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
