      EXT. KUNUNURRA, AUSTRALIA - DAY

      Wild and unforgiving.  Can almost see the fossilizing 
      carcasses of dinosaurs scattered across the red dirt.  

      FLOAT toward a breathtaking waterfall.  Long, white sheets of 
      water plunging into a languid blue green pool below... all 
      surrounded by red craggy cliffs.  Reaching for the sky like 
      they re trying to escape.  

      CLOSER... you see three little specks clinging to those 
      cliffs... people... three women in their late 20's, wearing 
      cut off shorts, bikini tops and hiking boots.  

      CLOSE ENOUGH now to see the dirt under their fingernails, the 
      strands of hair clinging to their faces in sweat.... No sound 
      but water pounding water and the girls  labored breath as 
      they climb...

      Finally they reach the top.  The wind swirls with mist.  For 
    a moment, they just stand on the cliff s edge looking out at 
      the jaw-dropping view.  Then they look at each other -- a 
      mixture of awe, pride and conspiracy.  

      They grab hands and JUMP --

                                                                          SMASH TO:

      INT. TAXI - MANHATTAN, USA - ONE WEEK EARLIER

      KAT (28).  Typing furiously on an old laptop as the cab jerks 
      its way through traffic.   Stealing a glimpse of the computer 
      screen, we see the title of the important document she s 
      working on: The Best Butt Jeans.

      Kat is the good girl.  The kind who visits her Grandfather 
      every week at the retirement home and won't fart in front of 
      her boyfriend.  She apologizes when someone bumps into her.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    I broke my wrist in college.  Not 
                    really an exciting story.  My whole 
                    dorm floor was down in Hayden 
                    Lange s room -- the mind-boggling 
                    hot RA who wasn t much for 
                    enforcing rules.  Hayden was 
                    hosting a beer pong tournament 
                    (case in point) and I was in my 
                    room, studying for a huge test the 
                    next morning.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I had a glass of V-8 in one hand 
                    and I was trying to open a freshly-
                    popped bag of microwave popcorn 
                    with the other.  When I finally 
                    managed to rip it open with my 
                    teeth, my entire face was flash 
                    fried by the hot steam.  I dropped 
                    the V-8, slipped in it and slammed 
                    my wrist against my desk.  

      The taxi lurches to a stop.  Kat slides off the seat and 
      smashes into the plastic partition.  Laptop and all.  

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Should ve just gone to the party.  

      They ve hit traffic.  Kat checks her watch, gathers her 
      stuff, throws money at the driver, jumps out and tears down a 
      crowded avenue...

      INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

      Chaos.  Everyone s yelling, fingers flying... except REBECCA  
      (29).  She s the tough one.  Calm, cool and ballsy in a 
      playful way.  Rebecca's got no edit button.  If you re lucky 
      enough to gain her trust, this woman will kill for you... if 
      not, she might kill you.  

      Rebecca stands in the middle of the mayhem watching the 
      screen... playing with an earring like she's bored in church.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Rebecca, my dorm mate at the time, 
                    came home and immediately wrote a 
                    scathing letter to the popcorn 
                    company.  Ten huge boxes of 
                    microwave popcorn arrived the next 
                    week.  Each with a brand new 
                    warning label: CAUTION. MIGHT FRY 
                    FACE.  I m paraphrasing, but you 
                    get the point...

      Then when the trading clock has less than a minute on it --

                                    REBECCA
                    Ten-fifty best one-hundred K!

      The place erupts.  Everyone jumps on her.  Papers fly.  Bell 
      rings.  Time's up.  As she organizes her bids AN ATTRACTIVE 
      TRADER approaches.

                                  ATTRACTIVE TRADER
                    Well, thanks...  For completely 
                    screwing me.                                                                                      3.


                                    REBECCA
                    I know, I m sorry.  I m just so 
                    good at it...
                          (steps a closer)
                    Speaking of, you still want to  
                    meet later?

                                  ATTRACTIVE TRADER
                    Know what?  I don t think so.  Bye, 
                    Rebecca.

      We see the slightest glimpse of vulnerability creep over 
      Rebecca's face as she watches him go.  Almost a perfect poker 
      face.  Almost.

      EXT. NEW YORK STREET 

      Kat weaves her way through the crowd, juggling all her crap.  
      The heel breaks off her shoe and she stumbles.  Screw it.  
      She takes off the shoe and keeps running... 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    The night of the face-frying, wrist-
                    breaking incident, my other best 
                    friend Zoey had the same test to 
                    study for.  But unlike me, she went 
                    to the party...

      INT. SOUNDSTAGE - THE LOVE BUGGY SHOW 

      CLOSE ON: ZOEY (29) as she sings and plays guitar in front of 
    a group of smiling kids.  She s dressed like a giant worm.  

      Zoey s quirky, imaginative and free-spirited.  Fun personified.

                                  ZOEY
                          (singing)
                     With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, 
                    hey, I think it s time to play and 
                    say: A ha, ha, ha and a hoo, hoo, 
                    hoo.  You love me and I love you. 

      PULL BACK to see an entire TV crew and a few other adults 
      dressed like giant insects.  Seems she s on a kid s show a la 
      Barney.  Zoey puts down her guitar and starts doing the 
      running man alongside a couple kids.

                                  ZOEY AND KIDS
                          (singing)
                     We love each other like peanut and 
                    butter! 

      She gets a little close to an OBNOXIOUS BOY, who shoves her.  
      They whisper back and forth:                                                                                        4.


                                  OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BOY
                    Stop stepping on me, bug.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m trying to dance.

                                  OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BOY
                    Yeah well, you suck.

                                  ZOEY
                    Least I m not gonna end up in rehab.

      Zoey shoots him a big smile.  The kid shoves her again -- 
      harder, this time -- and she falls over.  She flips him the 
      bird with her giant gloved hand.   

      ON A MONITOR SCREEN: the glove is pixilated.  Her smile s 
      even bigger.

                                  DIRECTOR 
                    Cut!  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    The girl barely drinks but somehow, 
                    she won that beer-pong 
                      tournament... and slept with the 
                      mind-boggling Hayden... 

      EXT./INT. MAGAZINE PUBLISHING COMPANY

      Kat limps/runs up the steps and through the lobby.  Hits the 
      elevator button a few hundred times till it opens and she 
      steps inside...  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Oh, and the next morning?  She aced 
                    the test.  I, however, got a B minus. 

      As the doors slide closed...

      INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

      Fish tank.  Bad hotel art.  Up, Up and Away, in My Beautiful 
      Balloon tinkling away on Musak.  Zoey fills out a form, 
      headed: NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE.  Definitely not the 
      dentist s office.  A RECEPTIONIST pokes her head out a door.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    The doctor will be with you in just 
                    a minute.

      Zoey nods.  Her face says she s five years-old and about to 
      get a tooth pulled.                                                                                        5.


      A woman in a wheel chair exits the patient door, smiles 
      weakly at Zoey as she leaves.  The fish tank gurgles.  
      Patient door opens again.  

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Okay, Miss Cruz, we re ready for-- 
                    Miss Cruz?

      Exit door swings closed.  Zoey's gone.

      EXT. MEDICAL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

      Zoey pushes outside like she s being chased.  Her carefree 
      attitude suddenly wiped clean.  She leans against the 
      building and closes her eyes, fighting against tears...  

      Opens them to see all the people walking by.  So much life...  
      She pulls out her phone.

                                  ZOEY (ON PHONE)
                    Yeah, I d like to know if it s 
                    possible to change the departure 
                    date on a plane ticket.

      INT. MAGAZINE PUBLISHING BUILDING

      Kat stands beside a printer -- willing it to go faster -- as 
      it spits out her finished article.  She grabs it then rushes 
      through a busy office, comes to a door, knocks, barrels in.  
        A sophisticated BOSS LADY sits behind a desk.  

                                  KAT
                    Made it!  Hi!  I was picking up my 
                    wedding dress, and then traffic, 
                    and my shoe and I thought I was 
                    gonna be late.  But I m good, 
                      everything s good.  Anyway, I have 
                    the article.

                                  BOSS LADY
                          (grave)
                    Kat, it s okay.  Sit down.

                                  KAT
                    You re not happy with the art work.  
                    That s okay, there are a lot of 
                    other butts to pick-- 

                                  BOSS LADY
                    No, Kat, that s not it--  I respect 
                    you, so I m gonna get right to it...  
                    You know the magazine circulation 
                    isn t what it used to be... 
                          (sighs)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      6.

                                  BOSS LADY (CONT'D)
                    Kat, there s no nice way to say 
                    this -- we re eliminating your 
                    position.  Your duties are being... 
                    absorbed.  I m so sorry.

      Off Kat, blind-sided.  Devastated.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                      Sometimes, no matter what I do.  
                    How right I play it.  The popcorn 
                    still blows up in my face. 

      SMASH TO TITLE CARD:  Roam  by the B-52 s plays.

      INT. SUMMIT BAR - EARLY EVENING

      Kat sits between Rebecca and Zoey, head in hands on the bar.  
      Empty cocktail glasses abound.  

                                    REBECCA
                    You re getting wasabi peas in your 
                    hair, honey.  Sit up.

                                  KAT
                    I worked so hard, compromised so 
                    much.  For what?  How the hell am I 
                    gonna get another job in this market?
                          (waves at Bartender)
                    Can I get another martini and 
                    something sharp, please?

                                  ZOEY
                    I say you don t get another job.  I 
                    say you take this as a sign to go 
                    on my trip with me.

                                    REBECCA
                    What trip?

                                  ZOEY
                    Funny.

                                  KAT
                    You re insane.  You re going away 
                    for a year.  I can t take a 
                    vacation for a year.

                                  ZOEY
                    We re talking backpacking through 
                    South America, Asia, Africa, 
                      Australia...  It s not a vacation, 
                    it s an experience.                                                                                        7.


                                  KAT
                    An experience you ve been planning 
                    for, what?  Nine years?  And you 
                    expect me to just take off in a week?

                                  ZOEY
                    Actually, I m leaving tomorrow.

                        KATREBECCA
      You re what?  Why?

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    I moved up my flight.   

                                  KAT
                    You couldn t wait one more week?

                                  ZOEY
                    No.  Everything s out there.  Here?  
                    Nada.  And I could say the same for 
                    you, my unemployed friend.

                                  KAT
                    Okay, a.) Thanks for the reminder 
                    that I m FIRED and b.) I am, oh I 
                    don t know, getting married in two

                    Ulch, thanks for reminding me.  Last 
                    night I dreamt I was getting water 
                    boarded by Justin Beiber wearing an 
                    orange chiffon strapless. 

                                  KAT
                    They re not orange, they re 
                      cantaloupe and everyone else loves 
                    those bridesmaid dresses.

                                    REBECCA
                    They re lying.

                                  KAT
                          (back to Zoey)
                    Wait, you really are leaving 
                    tomorrow?  This is the last night 
                    we re gonna see you?  

                                  ZOEY
                    Not if you come with.
                          (off Kat, rolling her eyes)
                    And don t roll your eyes at me.  
                    Marriage is supposed to be for the 
                    rest of your life, right?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      8.

                                  ZOEY (CONT'D)
                    So it can wait a year.  Life is 
                    short, Kat.  Let s go have 
                      adventures...  And if you postpone 
                    it, I can even be in the wedding.

                                    REBECCA
                    What s wrong with you?  You have a 
                    perfect excuse to avoid the melon 
                    dress.

                                  ZOEY
                          (leans closer to Kat)
                    Come on, I ve told you about my 
                    dream list, you can make one, too.  
                      Sand-surfing off the coast of Peru. 
                    Dancing in the sun at Rio s 
                    Carnival.  Think of a dream -- 
                    something you ve always wanted to 
                    do and we ll go do it.  Anything. 

                                  KAT
                    God... I don t know...

                                  ZOEY
                    Yes, you do.  Think.

                                  KAT
                    Um... well, I always wanted to walk 
                    though a cherry blossom tree 
                    orchard in Japan after I read 
                    Memoirs of a Geisha.

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay, why?

                                  KAT
                      Because... it seems like the 
                    perfect physical manifestation for 
                    what it feels like to be in love. 

                                    REBECCA
                    Wow.  I just threw up in my mouth 
                    more than a little.  Like Exorcist 
                    amounts.

                                  KAT
                    Gross.

                                  ZOEY
                    Your turn, Happy Pants.  One dream.                                                                                      9.


                                    REBECCA
                    Well, I wouldn t mind chucking 
                    tomatoes at people at that festival 
                    thing in Spain.

                                  ZOEY
                    Something meaningful.

                                    REBECCA
                    That is meaningful.  The only thing 
                    my mom knew how to cook growing up 
                    was spaghetti and Ragu -- wait, 
                    that s not fair, she could open a 
                    beer bottle...  So hurling tomatoes 
                    at strangers would release years of 
                      resentment.

                                  KAT
                    I support that.  What about you, 
                    Zo?  One we haven t heard.

                                  ZOEY
                    The Inca Trail.  I want to stand on 
                    the Temple of the Sun at Macchu 
                    Pichu.  Mom and Dad were never 
                    legally married but... she told 
                    me... right before she died... that 
                    they exchanged vows there, so...

      Kat reaches out.  Squeezes Zoey's hand.

                                  KAT
                    Your mom would be so proud that 
                    you re taking this trip.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Maybe Zoey's right, Kat.  You stay 
                    here and you get another job.  
                    Pretty soon that job s a career.  
                    And once you re married, there s  
                      offspring.  I say do it now.  While 
                    you can.

                                  KAT
                    Then why don t you go?

                                    REBECCA
                    Me?  No way.  I have a job.

                                  KAT
                    Reminder number two.  Thanks, girls.
                          (swigs her martini)
                    Well, there s no way I can go 
                    either.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                  KAT (CONT'D)
                    Even if I wanted to, I m broke -- I 
                    mean, I just paid off my student 
                    loans.  And I m definitely not 
                    leaving Brian.  He s the only good 
                    thing I have left right now.  In 
                    fact, if you guys don't mind, I 
                    think I'll skip dinner and go home.
                          (stands)
                    Zo, I can t believe you re leaving.  
                    But have an amazing, debaucherous, 
                      life-changing, safe time.  I m gonna 
                    miss you so much.  I love you. 

      Kisses, hugs Zoey.  Turns to Rebecca.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    And I ll see you, later.
                          (off Rebecca's lewd gesture)
                    Why do the good ones always leave?

      And Kat s out.

                                  ZOEY
                          (getting up)
                    I should go, too.  Big day tomorrow.  
                          (squishing Rebecca's face)
                    I know sentimental moments make you 
                    writhe, so I ll make it quick.  I m 
                    gonna miss you too, you little bitch.

                                    REBECCA
                    I know.

      They hug.  Even Rebecca's fighting the tears.  Zoey goes.  
      Rebecca sits alone for a second.  The bartender approaches.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    You don t serve spaghetti here, do 
                    you?

      INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

      Looks like it smells like beer.  Just a few people.  A band s 
      doing a sound check.  Zoey enters as they finish a song.  She 
      claps wildly.  ELAN (29), the hot guy at the mic, squints 
      into the darkness, sees her and curtsies.

      EXT. DIVE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Walking arm in arm.  Elan s eating cheese puffs.   

                                  ZOEY
                    Nice dinner.                                                                                    11.


                                  ELAN
                    I ll have you know all four food 
                    groups are represented in this bag.  
                    You got your cheese: protein and 
                    milk.  Puffs...
                          (scanning the ingredients)
                    Some kind of corn product, so 
                    there s your bread.  And, um, chili 
                    and lime: fruits and veggies.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well then, please to share.

      They crunch.  But Zoey s distracted, contemplating whether or 
      not to tell him what s going on--  

                                  ELAN
                    I m sorry I have to play on one of 
                    our last nights together.

                                  ZOEY
                      Actually... I wanted to talk to you 
                    about that... I changed my ticket.

                                  ELAN
                          (hopeful)
                    You leaving later?

                                  ZOEY
                    Earlier.  Tomorrow.

                                  ELAN
                    What?  
                          (stops walking)
                    Wow.  I m trying not to take this 
                      personally, but why are you in such 
                    a hurry to get out of here?  
                      Australia s not going anywhere.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m just going crazy waiting. 

                                  ELAN
                    And I was going crazy thinking we 
                    only had a week left...

                                  ZOEY
                    Elan.  Really.  I just have to go.  
                    It has nothing to do with how I 
                    feel about you.

                                  ELAN
                    Obviously not.
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    12.

                                  ELAN (CONT'D)
                    I have to get back to sound 
                    check.

      Zoey opens her mouth to say something, then stops -- she 
      can t.  Elan leans in and kisses her.  A damn good kiss.  

                                  ELAN (CONT D)
                    Why d I have to meet you now?

      And he goes.

      INT. REBECCA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Rebecca's quietly flipping through a stack of mail as she 
      enters.  A breeze blows through her hair.  Breeze?  She looks 
      up and frowns.  Her window s wide open.  

      She takes a step towards it and freezes as she hears 
      something clatter to the ground in her bedroom.

                                  TALL GUY (O.S.)
                    Watch it!

      Rebecca's eyes go wide, but she s tough.  She grabs pepper 
      spray from her purse and edges toward her bedroom.  Sees two 
      men going through her stuff. 

      Holy shit.  Not that tough.  She hurries back toward the 
      front door...  

                                  TALL GUY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I m checking the living room again.

      Not gonna make it.  Rebecca ducks into a closet right before 
      Tall Guy emerges from the bedroom.

                                  OTHER GUY (O.S.)
                    It s not here, man.

                                  TALL GUY   
                    Keep looking.

      Here comes THE OTHER GUY.

                                  OTHER GUY 
                    We ve looked everywhere.  What if 
                    she has it on her?

                                  TALL GUY    
                    Well then, she's got to come home 
                      sometime...

      ON REBECCA: huddled in her closet.  Who the hell are these 
      guys?  Suddenly, KNOCK, KNOCK.  From the hallway:                                                                                      13.


                                  SECURITY TOM (O.S.)
                    Miss Stone?  It s Tom, security.  I 
                    forgot I had a package for you at 
                    the front desk.  

      Bad guys share a look.  

                                  OTHER GUY
                          (whispers)
                    Wonder if that s it.

      Tall guy gives him a shut up gesture.

                                  OTHER GUY (CONT D)
                          (mouths)
                    We should get it and find out.

      JOIN REBECCA'S POV through the thin crack between the closet 
      door and the wall.  Tall guy thinks.  Shakes his head.  

                                  TALL GUY
                    No.  Messy.  We ll come back later.

      The men slip out the window and down the fire escape.  

      IN THE CLOSET, Rebecca sits trembling.  KNOCK, KNOCK.  She 
      starts.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Miss Stone?

      She slowly pushes open the closet door with a shaky hand.  
      Apartment s empty.  Goes to the window and looks out.  
      They re gone.  

      Opens the front door.  SECURITY TOM smiles at her.

                                  SECURITY TOM
                    Sorry  bout that.  Hate to bother 
                    you.  Here ya go.

      Holds out a small package -- about the size of a glasses case.  
      Rebecca just looks at it, still stunned.

                                  SECURITY TOM (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yeah.  Sorry.  Just tired.  Thanks, 
                    Tom.

      Fakes a smile, takes the package, shuts the door.  But the 
      anxiety seeps back into her eyes as she turns the package 
      over and over in her hands...                                                                                    14.


      INT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Kat bursts through the door, tripping over Brian s shoes.  

                                  KAT
                    Ouch!  

      BRIAN (30ish) hurries out from the bedroom.  He's cute and 
      charming in a non-threatening way.  The perfect nice guy for 
      the perfect nice girl.

                                  BRIAN
                    You okay?

                                  KAT
                    Ah, fudgesickle, that hurts.

                                  BRIAN
                    I love it when you talk dirty.

      She throws down her stuff and falls into his arms.

                                  KAT
                    Ohmigod, I m so happy to see you.  
                    This is officially the suckiest day 
                    ever. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Everyone gets fired at some point.

                                  KAT
                    Laid off.  Like that s better.

                                  BRIAN
                    Oh, honey.

                                  KAT
                    God, what s my mom gonna say?

                                  BRIAN
                    Don t worry about her.  How are you?  

                                  KAT
                    Eight years of writing articles on 
                    Peppy Push-up Bras and, and... 
                    Statement Knits for Fall.  Sweaters 
                    can t talk, Brian!  I m never gonna 
                    be Fran Lebowitz.

                                  BRIAN
                    Poor thing.  Why aren t you drunk?  
                    Aren t you supposed to be out with 
                    your friends?                                                                                      15.


                                  KAT
                    I just wanted to be with you.
                          (hugs him again)
                    Tell me it s gonna be okay.  That 
                    it s not too late to start my career 
                    over, and that the important thing 
                    is we re getting married.  Right?

                                  BRIAN
                    Yes.  It really is okay.  And don t 
                    worry, my job s secure.  We ll be 
                    fine until you get another one.  
                          (kisses her)
                    Now.  Seriously, let s go get you 
                    some alcohol.  

                                  KAT
                    Wait.  I wanna show you something 
                    first.  Today didn t completely suck.  
                    I picked up my wedding dress.  And I 
                    know, it s bad luck to see the bride, 
                    blah blah... but I just want to show 
                    it to you.  It ll cheer me up.

      She runs into the bedroom, whips open the closet door and 
      smiles.  There it is.  Her wedding gown.  Fluffy, white and 
      huge.  She pulls it out.

      And there s a naked chick hiding behind it.

      And there goes her smile...

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Popcorn explosion number five-
                    hundred and seven.

      INT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT

      Knock, knock.  Zoey opens the door.  Finds Kat on her 
      doorstep.  Toothbrush in hand.  You watch Kat break down, and 
      as she explains what happened we hear:

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    This time... I m definitely going 
                    to the damn party.

      Zoey hugs Kat and is about to shut the door when...

      The elevator doors open across the hall to reveal Rebecca.  
      Standing there with a suitcase.  


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    16.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. JFK AIRPORT - SECURITY - NEXT DAY

      Kat, Zoey and Rebecca throw their spankin  new backpacks onto 
      the security conveyor.  (Note: Kat wears an old NY ballcap.)

                                    REBECCA
                    God, I m regressing -- I haven t 
                    had a backpack since college.  What 
                    am I doing? 

                                  KAT
                    I know, I got the you re-crazy-you-
                      can t-just-leave-for-a year-it s-
                      irrational speech from, let s see, 14 
                    different people?  Mom, Dad, Brian--  

                                  ZOEY
                    Brian s not allowed to weigh in.

                                  KAT
                    His argument was he made a mistake, 
                    but I m about to make a bigger one.

                                  ZOEY
                    Naked closet girl isn t a mistake.  
                    It s not like he broke your 
                    favorite mug--

                                    REBECCA
                          (miming the order in the air)
                    Slavery, witch hunts, Brian.

                                  KAT
                    I know.  I hate him.  I do.  I just 
                    don t know if this is the answer.  
                      Everything in me is screaming to 
                    stay here, get another job, forgive 
                    Brian--

                                  ZOEY
                    That girl s hoo-hah touched your 
                    wedding dress, Kat!

                                  KAT
                    I know!

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay, you re making a vow, right 
                    now.  Think of what you would 
                    normally do, then do the opposite.                                                                                    17.


                                  KAT
                    Normally do, then do the opposite.  
                    Okay.  Good.  Done.

                                  X-RAY ATTENDANT
                    Does one of you have liquid 
                      containers over 3 ounces?

      Kat freezes, like she s sincerely guilty of being a drug mule. 

                                  KAT
                    Me.  I do.  I m sorry.  That s me.  
                    I m so sorry.  You wanna search me?

                                    REBECCA
                          (looks to Zoey)
                    Got a little ground to cover.

      INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

      ON KAT in a little pool of light.  Face in a travel book. 
      Wearing an old NY ballcap.  The rest of the plane is dark. 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    People call Australia Oz.  And I 
                    guess it is -- this wild and 
                    forgotten adventureland at the 
                    bottom of the world.  You ve got 
                    your happy, fuzzy things -- 
                      kangaroos, koalas -- which are like 
                    the munchkins.  Then all the 
                    venomous crap that ll kill you like 
                    the flying monkeys.  I could go on 
                    all night with this... and 
                      unfortunately, I probably will...  

      PAN PAST Kat to find ZOEY.  Dead asleep.  Snoring like mad. 

      CONTINUE PANNING to see Zoey's head is propped on Rebecca's 
      shoulder, leaving a neat little puddle of drool.  Rebecca's eyes 
      are closed too.  But as an attendant walks by, they fly open.

                                    REBECCA
                    Could I get a scotch please.  Ice.

                                  KAT
                    You re awake.

                                    REBECCA
                    Can t believe this flight is 22 hours.

                                  KAT
                    Is it mean to say, I m glad you 
                    have insomnia, too?                                                                                    18.


                                    REBECCA
                    It s not that I can t sleep.  It s 
                    that sometimes I choose not to.

      Attendant sets down her scotch.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  What should I drink to?

                                  KAT
                    Rebecca.  Why are you here?

                                    REBECCA
                    Not a traditional toast, but okay.
                          (swigs, then)
                    I told you at Zoey s... what I said 
                    at the bar to you -- I guess I 
                    convinced myself.  

                                  KAT
                    Don t think my faculties are 
                      compromised due to lack of sleep.

                                    REBECCA
                    It s the truth.  That and what 
                    Sleeping Drooly said -- life is 
                    short.  I guess it hit me.  

                                  KAT
                    I can see how something as new and 
                    profound as  life is short  would 
                    rattle you to the bone.

                                    REBECCA
                    Believe me or not.  I m here, right?  

      The look on her face says there s more but Kat lets it go.

                                  KAT
                    Thank, God.

      They have a moment then Rebecca downs her scotch and removes 
      Zoey's head from her shoulder like it s kryptonite.

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    If Australia s Oz, guess that makes 
                    us Dorothy and her crew.  Think 
                    it s fair to say Rebecca needs a 
                    tad more heart.  And I could 
                      definitely use some courage.  And 
                    Zoey, well... what is Zoey?  You 
                    get a perfectly good analogy going 
                    and your friends have to go and be 
                    too complex...                                                                                        19.


      Zoey s head flops onto Kat's shoulder now.  Mouth open. 

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Most of the time, anyway...

      EXT. AUSTRALIA - MONTAGE

      As  Time to Get Away  by LCD Soundsystem plays we see the Sydney 
      Opera House, Uluru, Broken Hill and the Great Barrier Reef...

      INT. QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA - AIRPORT - DAY

      A luggage turnstile spins.  Kat and Zoey have their packs but  
      Rebecca doesn t.  Nobody else waits.  The conveyor s empty.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Great.  I hate the traveling part 
                    of traveling.

      EXT. GREAT BARRIER REEF - FIVE STAR RESORT - DAY

      Taxi drives the girls up to a postcard perfect resort.  
      Turquoise water.  Hammocks stretched between the palm trees 
      on a white sand beach.  Ahh. 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    See.  Emerald City.

                                  ZOEY
                    This is so not what I had in mind.

                                    REBECCA
                    Then I ll probably love it.

                                  KAT
                    Zoey, I just need to squeeze this 
                    honeymoon suite for all it s worth 
                    then I promise, we ll go into full 
                    roughing it mode.  Yes?  

      INT. RESORT - LOBBY

                                  KAT
                    No!  This isn t right.  I called 
                    two days ago.  They said it d be no 
                    problem to move up the reservation--

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    I m so sorry, but it was cancelled 
                    by the credit card holder this 
                    morning.  There s nothing we can do.                                                                                    20.


                                  KAT
                          (starting to panic)
                    There s gotta be a mistake.  Lemme 
                    see that--

      Kat reaches across the reception counter, grabs the computer 
      from the HOTEL CONCIERGE and swivels it toward her.

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    Miss, please, let go. 

                                    REBECCA
                    Kat, Kat, it s okay.  Let go, baby. 

      Rebecca pulls her off.   

                                  KAT
                    How could he do this to me?

                                    REBECCA
                    Don t worry.  We ll figure 
                    something out.

                                  ZOEY
                    I know!  We can go to the Farmstay 
                      I originally booked.
                          (off both friends, unsure)
                    It s a real working farm.  They ll 
                    probably have sheep and other 
                    charming little animals.  It ll be 
                    awesome!

      Beat.  And then it s Rebecca who lunges across the counter 
      and grabs the computer.   

                                    REBECCA
                    How could he do this to me?!

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    Security!

                                  ZOEY
                          (pulling Rebecca off)
                    Trust me, it s gonna be heaven.

      EXT. TROPICAL NORTH QUEENSLAND - FARMSTAY - DAY

      The girls stand silhouetted against a raging fire.    

                                    REBECCA
                    Heaven?  I thought fire went with 
                    the other place.                                                                                    21.


      The owner, OWISO, a magnetic and striking Australian-Aboriginal 
      man in his 30's, walks up, all smiles.  When you think 
          Australian-Aboriginal, think modern Native-American: street 
      clothes, normal Australian accent, etc. 

                                  OWISO
                    Hello!  Welcome to Baganu Sugar 
                    Cane Farm.  I m Owiso.  Aren't you 
                    girls lucky to be here during a 
                    real burn-off?!

      Off the girls... they sure are...

      INT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - NIGHT

      Rustic, but cozy.  Kat brushes her teeth over a sink in the 
      corner while Rebecca pulls off her shoes.  Zoey enters.

                                  ZOEY
                    You guys, there s an outhouse out 
                    there.  Isn t that cute?

                                    REBECCA
                    Adorable.  They sell Depends in 
                      Australia?

      Zoey throws her pack on her bed, pulls out a framed photo and 
      sets it next to her bed.  ANGLE ON IT: A beautiful, young 
      woman beside a waterfall.

                                  KAT
                    God, your mom was gorgeous.  How 
                    come I haven t seen that picture?

                                  ZOEY
                    I found it last Christmas in a box 
                    of her stuff.  The back says she was 
                    17.  That s when she travelled -- 
                    before she even met my dad. 

                                  KAT
                    Where was it taken?

                                  ZOEY
                    I don t know... but I ve got a year 
                    to find it...

                                    REBECCA
                          (looking out the window)
                    Nothing like a sky fulla black gunk 
                    to make me feel right at home.                                                                                    22.


                                  ZOEY
                    Think of it as a really big 
                    campfire.

                                    REBECCA
                    Until we re engulfed in flames.

                                  KAT
                    Don t worry.  I ll keep an eye out.  
                    You know I m not going to sleep...

      INT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - LATER

      ON KAT, snoring like a buzz saw.  ON ZOEY, also dead asleep.  

      ON REBECCA, staring at the ceiling.  She sighs, slips out of 
      bed and tiptoes outside...

      EXT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

      Pitch dark.  Rebecca climbs into the outhouse trying not to 
      touch anything.  Pulls down her shorts and hovers...   

      Then, a noise outside.  Shorts go up and she freezes. 

      Moment of quiet, then more noise.  Sounds of someone stepping 
      on dry brush.  Rebecca's eyes dart around for a weapon.  
      Grabs a shovel.  Counts to herself, one, two...  Then leaps 
      out, shovel raised like an axe.  Owiso throws up his arms. 

                                    REBECCA
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  OWISO
                    I came to tell you that the 
                    outhouse is for the farm workers.  
                    You re welcome to use it but 
                    there s a regular bathroom down the 
                    hall from your room.  

                                    REBECCA
                    You came to tell me this at three 
                    in the morning?  

                                  OWISO
                    I was checking on the fire.
                          (smiles, amused)
                    You going to put down the shovel?

      She finally lowers it.  Looks around for a place to set it.  
      Owiso takes a step toward her, holds out his hand.  He takes 
      the shovel, brushing her hand.  Rebecca flinches.  He 
      chuckles to himself as she hurries off.                                                                                     23.


                                  OWISO (CONT D)
                    Good night.

      INT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - THE NEXT MORNING

      CLOSE ON KAT.  Sleeping blissfully.  She giggles as if being 
      tickled.  PULL BACK to see a few fat roaches nesting in her hair.  

                                    REBECCA
                    What re you giggling about?
                          (flopping over)
                    You having a dirty dream-- Ahh!

      Rebecca jumps outta bed.  Zoey and Kat's eyes fly open.

                        KATZOEY
      What?  What is it?What s happening?!

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Roaches!  

                                  KAT
                    Where?!

                                  ZOEY
                    In your hair!

      Kat screams, shaking her hair out.  The roaches scatter.

                                    REBECCA
                    Guess we found the charming little 
                    animals.

      EXT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - MORNING

      Zoey and Kat are sitting at a picnic table full of breakfast 
      food.  Owiso s pouring juice.  Rebecca walks out.

                                  OWISO
                    Yes, I apologize for that.  Insects 
                    come inside because of the fire.

                                    REBECCA (ON PHONE)
                    And someone will call me the minute 
                    it gets in?  Thank you...
                          (hangs up)
                    I hate people.  Especially when 
                    they take my luggage.

                                  KAT
                    Still no backpack?

                                  OWISO
                    Good morning.                                                                                    24.


      Rebecca just nods.  

                                  ZOEY
                    Sit down and have some brekkie.  
                    It s so authentic -- look, vegemite!  

                                  KAT
                          (pointing to fried eggs)
                    These yellow and white things are 
                    good.

                                  OWISO
                    If you ve lost your luggage, I can 
                    possibly help.

                                    REBECCA
                    I didn t lose it.  The airline did.  
                    But no.  Thanks.  I ve got it.

                                  OWISO
                    Are you sure?  I can--

                                    REBECCA
                    I said, I ve got it.

      Owiso nods, smiles, walks away. 

                                  KAT
                    He was just trying to be nice.

                                    REBECCA
                    I don t trust nice.

      Zoey lightens the moment, looking out at the view.

                                  ZOEY
                    You guys, we are here.  Look.

      Without the fire, you can finally see the place.  And it s 
        spectacular.  The grounds are tropical and lush.  But it s 
      the sky that s epic.  Cobalt blue streaked with white.  

                                  KAT
                      Amazing... So let s go see it.
                          (opens a guidebook)
                    There s a tour that goes from 
                    Cairns to Port Douglas, maybe--

                                  ZOEY
                    No.  No guidebooks.  We already 
                    decided how we re gonna do this.  In 
                    the bar, remember?  The dream list.  
                          (pulls out her journal)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                  ZOEY (CONT'D)
                    Now I already wrote down the cherry 
                    blossom trees and the tomato chucking 
                    but we need something for Australia.  
                    So... what are your dreams?

                                  KAT
                    Oh.  Well.  Lemme think...  

                                  ZOEY
                    Rebecca?

                                    REBECCA
                    Um... 

                                  ZOEY
                    Here, I ll give you one of mine...  
                    there s a group called the 
                      Thankakali Aboriginal Corporation. 
                    They teach art and stuff to kids 
                    who ve been part of the justice 
                    system.  I called them before I 
                    left, they said I could maybe teach 
                    a music class.  When I was a kid, I 
                    had support.  I want to give some 
                    to kids who don t.  Now, you.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Wow.  Well, I hear that the bar 
                    bathrooms here are tiled all the way 
                    to the ceiling in case people barf.  
                    I d like to see if that s true.

                                  ZOEY
                          (hurt)
                    Look, this trip is very important to 
                    me.  You guys are basically crashing 
                    my party, so I d appreciate it if 
                    you didn t mock me.   

      Zoey gets up to go, Rebecca stops her.

                                    REBECCA
                    Wait, Zoey, I m sorry.  I m not 
                    trying to make fun of you.  You ve 
                    just had a lot more time to think 
                    about it than we have.  And, I 
                    don t know, I ve never thought of 
                    what my dreams would be... outside 
                    of dominating the Manhattan 
                    financial district, of course.  So 
                    just... gimme a little time.

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay.                                                                                    26.


                                  KAT
                    Ya know, Brian and I were going to 
                    take this big scuba diving adventure.  
                    I was terrified but I spent three 
                    weeks in a pool getting certified, 
                    might as well put it to use.

                                    REBECCA
                    But was that Brian s dream or yours?

                                  KAT
                    Mine?  Sort of.
                          (off the girls, unconvinced)
                    I mean, I m not that scared.  
                    Really.  I wanna go.  I like fish.

      EXT. GREAT BARRIER REEF - DAY

      Sun bounces off the azure water as a dive boat rips through 
      it.  Rebecca s driving, Zoey's upfront in the spray and Kat 
      (wearing her NY ballcap again) is green.

                                  KAT
                    So much water.

                                  ZOEY
                          (pleasant)
                    It s not the water you should worry 
                    about -- it s what s in it.  You 
                    know how many things are in there 
                    that can kill you?  Sharks, 
                    saltwater crocodiles, box jellyfish, 
                    cone shells, blue ring octopus...
                          (waves at Rebecca to stop)
                    Okay, this is good.  Let s get in!

      EXT. GREAT BARRIER REEF - UNDERWATER

      Magical.  Surreal.   Beautiful Day  by U2 plays as the girls 
      swim in a kaleidoscope of coral and fish.    

      Until Kat taps Rebecca... spells out Z-O-E-Y with her finger 
      then shrugs?  Rebecca looks around and shrugs back.  Where is 
      she?  They swim around, searching the water.  Panic rising...

      Finally Kat spots her in the far distance.  She grabs Rebecca 
      and points.  They swim toward Zoey but Zoey swims further 
      out.  They wave their arms.  Doesn t she see them?   

      Kat and Rebecca give it a serious push and finally catch up 
      with Zoey.  Kat points at her oxygen gauge.  Zoey shakes her 
      head starts to swim away again.  This time, Rebecca grabs 
      Zoey's arm, points adamantly back the way they came and 
      starts towing her along--                                                                                       27.


      EXT. GREAT BARRIER REEF - SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER

      The girls come up for air.  Kat s more scared than angry.

                                  KAT
                    What s wrong with you?!  Where d 
                    you think you were going?

                                  ZOEY
                    Just swimming.

                                  KAT
                    What s the first rule I told you?  
                    Buddy system.  Stay close to each 
                    other.  We only have an hour tank-- 

                                    REBECCA
                    Hang on, where s the boat?

                                  KAT
                          (spinning around)
                    What?  It s right--  Where is it? 

                                  ZOEY
                    We didn t go that far.  Did we?

                                  KAT
                          (panicking)
                    No, I was paying attention.  This is 
                    where we left it.  I think... Oh God, 
                    Oh no.  Oh no--  

                                    REBECCA
                    Alright, calm down.  It s gotta be 
                    close by.

                                  KAT
                    No, no, no.  It s gone.  This is 
                    like Open Water only worse.

                                  ZOEY
                    How s it worse?

                                  KAT
                    Because it s happening to us.

      Off Kat, Rebecca and Zoey terrified and floating in the 
      middle of the great blue. 


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    28.


                                      ACT THREE

      EXT. GREAT BARRIER REEF - SURFACE - HOURS LATER

      The girls tread water.  Exhausted.  Faces sunburnt.  

                                  KAT
                    This was Brian s dream.  What was I 
                    thinking?  I was trying to be 
                    brave.  But I m so not brave.  I m 
                    terrified we re gonna die out here 
                    and it s gonna be my fault.

                                  ZOEY
                    We re not gonna die.

                                  KAT
                    How do you know?

                                  ZOEY
                    Because we ve got a year of 
                    adventure left.  We can t die the 
                    first week.

                                    REBECCA
                    Solid reasoning.  I m swimming for 
                    shore.

                                  KAT
                    Not a good idea.  Land can look 
                    close, but water plays tricks on 
                    you.  And swimming actually speeds 
                    up hypothermia... and death.  

                                    REBECCA
                    So do sharks, blue-winged octopuses 
                    and all their other scary friends.

                                  KAT
                      Blue-ring.

                                    REBECCA
                    What?

                                  KAT
                    It s not blue-winged, it s blue ring.  
                    Isn t that what you said, Zo?

      Zoey nods.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m going to kill you, Zoey.                                                                                     29.


                                  ZOEY
                    What d I do?

                                    REBECCA
                    If we didn t have to chase you for 
                    five miles, we might ve seen the 
                    boat drift away.

                                  ZOEY
                    It s not my fault it drifted in the 
                    first place.  I wasn t in charge of 
                    dropping the anchor.

                                  KAT
                    I did exactly what the rent-a-boat 
                    guy told me to.  Maybe it broke.

                                    REBECCA
                    Maybe somebody came by and stole 
                    it.  This continent was populated 
                    by criminals.

                                  KAT
                    What s that?

                                  KAT
                    That noise...  It s a boat.  Over 
                    there!  Wave your arms!

      They all wave and yell like maniacs.  The boat heads over.  A 
      tan and lean Aussie, MAX (30ish), down under s answer to 
      Matthew McConaughey, waves back and yells:

                                  MAX
                    Ahoy!

      INT. SURFER'S MOTORBOAT - MOMENTS LATER

      Boat s a mess.  Guys are perfect.  They pull the girls aboard.

                    Thank you, thank you so much.  I

                    I know.  It s stupid.  The water s, 
                    like, 90 degrees.  I have poor 
                      circulation.

                                  MAX
                    Take your suit off.

                    You can get hypothermia in warm 
                    water, too.  We ve got to get you 
                    dry.  

      A laid-back surfer, GREGORY hands out some towels. 

                                    GREGORY
                    He s right.  Get naked.  We ll turn 
                    around.

      Zoey and Kat drop trow.  But Rebecca hesitates.

                                    REBECCA
                    We have a cozy bed of roaches just 
                    waiting to warm us up.  So if you 
                    could get us home, that d be great.

                                  MAX
                    Where s home?

                    Sugarcane farm in Mossman.

                    No can do.  It ll be dark in less 
                    than an hour.  You ll have to stay 
                    the night at Tent City.

                    What s Tent City?                                                                                    31.


      EXT. TENT CITY - DAY

      A perfect, remote beach.  Fifteen or so tents and a big 
      campfire.  Shiny, happy people playing in the surf, tossing a 
      frisbee about... or some other sport that requires you to run 
      in the sand and look carefree...

       The Kids Don t Stand a Chance  by Vampire Weekend plays as 
      the three girls (in bikinis now, wet suits in hand) approach.

                                  KAT
                    So... what do we do now?

                    Nothing.

      EXT. TENT CITY - BEACH - LATER

      Sunset.  Everyone s milling about, getting dinner ready.   
      Kat' sitting on the sand, watching the waves.  Max sits.  
      Hands her a bottle.

                                  MAX
                    Hey.  Brought you some Supercat.
                    It s like moonshine.  You ll love 
                    it.

                                  KAT
                    Thanks... I think
                          (swigs, winces)
                    I don t know why I expect the sun 
                    to set over the water down here.

                                  MAX
                    I know.  Toilets flush the wrong 
                    way but the sun still sets in the 
                    West.  We don t make sense down 
                    here.
                          (looks out at the water)
                    Just wait til morning.  The sunrise 
                    is amazing.

                    more neckties in my wardrobe than

                      I graduated law school last year.  
                    Was working at my Da s firm.  One 
                    morning I looked at his face across 
                    the desk.  There was no happiness 
                    in it.  And it occurred to me that 
                      I couldn t remember him being happy 
                    one day in his life.  

                                  KAT
                    So you quit.

                    Okay, I am a little.  I was gonna get 
                    married.  He cheated.  Blah, blah.

                                  MAX

      EXT. TENT CITY - TIDE POOLS - CONTINUOUS 

      Rebecca's getting way too into spear fishing.  She's got a 
      huge bucket-o-fish and she's still stabbing.  Zoey approaches.

                                  ZOEY
                    That s probably enough fish.

                    Whatever you call it, I ve always 
                    admired it in you.

                    Well, I d like to thank the academy, 
                    my dad for bailing when I was eight 
                    and my mom for passing out every 
                    night.  Without them, none of this 
                    would ve been possible... 

      Rebecca stabs another fish.

      EXT. TENT CITY - FIRE PIT - EVENING 

      Big ol' bonfire.  It's like a weenie roast only with fish... 
      and plantains for Zoey.  The Supercat s flowing.

                    It is.  When you jump.  But once

                    Then you hit the water, and you

      They look at each other for a moment.  Then, out of nowhere, 
      it starts to pour rain.  The group heads for the biggest 
      tent.  Everyone's laughing.  Kat swoons.  Max steadies her.

      Everyone shoved together, dripping wet.  Gregory s tossing 
      two coins back and forth between his hands.

      Everyone yells again.  Except Rebecca who has one discerning 
      eye on Zoey... who is definitely not herself...

      INT./EXT. MAX'S TENT

                      Inventive?  Skilled?

      She laughs.  He kisses her.  Suddenly, outside, someone 
      shrieks.  They poke their heads out to see Zoey running bare-
      butted down the beach.  Kat pulls on some clothes, joins 
      Rebecca and the others.

                                  KAT
                    What happened?

                    We ran out of Supercat.

      Everyone laughs, watching Zoey run, just a naked silhouette 
      in the moonlight.  She suddenly cuts toward the waves. 

                                    GREGORY

                    But the water s so warm--                                                                                    39.

                    He s right, Zoey.  Don t be stupid.

      Zoey grins.  Loving the game.  Suddenly she leaps into the 
      water, screaming with delight.  A few people laugh with her.

                                  KAT
                    Zoey, come on.  That s enough!

                                  ZOEY
                    It s so beautiful!

      But then, she lets out a short scream.  A few laugh, assuming 
      she s kidding.  But the screaming doesn t stop.  Everyone 
      sprints down the beach, leaps into the surf and drags Zoey 
      onto the beach. 

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    Ah!  God!  My leg!

                                  MAX
                          (inspecting Zoey)
                    She s been stung.

                                    REBECCA
                    Damnit, Zoey, we told you to get out.

                                  KAT
                    Is it a jellyfish?  The box kind?

                                  MAX
                          (avoids answering; to Zoey)
                    Don t move.  It ll make it worse.
                          (to Kat)
                    Go in my tent.  There s a first aid 
                    kit and my shaving kit in the duffle 
                    bag -- grab both.  Hurry.  Go.

      Zoey winces in pain.  Kat takes off running--

      INT. MAX'S TENT

      Kat jumps inside.  Digs frantically in Max's bag.  Finds... 
      her NY BALLCAP?  Wha???  

      She shakes her head, confused.  No time now.  She tucks the 
      ball cap under her arm and continues to dig through the bag 
      until she finds the kits, then runs outside.  

      EXT. TENT CITY - BEACH

      Kat tosses the bag to Max.  He pours vinegar on Zoey s leg, 
      yanks on a glove then sprays the site with shaving cream.                                                                                    40.


                                    REBECCA
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  MAX
                    If there are any tentacles in her, 
                    it s the best way to get  em out.

      He shaves the site then pours more vinegar to rinse it.  
      Towels it dry then rubs it with Benedryl.

                                  ZOEY
                    Ohmigod it hurts.

                                  MAX
                    The fact that you can tell us that 
                    is a good sign.  If it were a box 
                    stinger you d be in shock.
                          (to Gregory)
                    Get her by the fire.  Heat s good 
                    for it.

      Gregory and another surfer lift Zoey and start to take her 
      back toward camp.  Max turns toward Kat.

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    I think she s gonna be okay.  

      Relieved, Kat nods her head.  But then, unable to contain it 
      any longer, she holds out her hat.

                                  KAT
                    Where d you get this?  

                                  MAX
                    Oh, um... found it on the beach 
                      yesterday.

                                  KAT
                    It s mine.  It s my hat.  I left it 
                    on our boat yesterday.  

      Rebecca, heading back toward the camp, overhears, turns around. 

                                    REBECCA
                    Kat?  What is it?

                                  KAT
                          (growing dread)
                    I don t know.  My hat.  I found it 
                    in Max s tent... I...  

                                    REBECCA
                    You what?  
                          (grabs the hat, then)

                    Wait a second.  You stole our boat.  
                    Of course, you did.  Ohmigod, we re 
                    so stupid.  Surfers, my ass.  
                    You re thieves.

                                  MAX
                    What are you talking about?

                                    REBECCA
                    You wait for people to go diving 
                    and you grab their boats.  

                                  MAX
                    What?  We saved you.

                                    REBECCA
                    You probably came back outta guilt -
                    - or to see what else you could 
                    steal from the gullible tourists.

                                  MAX
                    This is crazy... Kat?  

                                  KAT
                    I don t know.  It doesn t make 
                    sense.  If my hat washed up here, 
                    why wouldn t the boat?  

                                    REBECCA
                    Come on, let s go.  We gotta get 
                    Zoey to a hospital.  

                                  MAX
                    Kat.  You have to believe me--

                                  KAT
                    I want to but--

                          (taking Kat by the arm)
                    Let s go.

                                  MAX
                    Kat?

      Kat glances back once, beyond confused... betrayed...  Max 
      throws his hands up, stunned.  Watches them walk away.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    42.


                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. QUEENSLAND - DIRT ROAD - DAY

      Middle of nowhere.  Sun's blazing.  Kat and Rebecca support 
      Zoey's weight between them as they walk.  Kat and Zoey have 
      swim fins on.    

                                  KAT
                    The ground s so hot I can feel it 
                    through these things.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well, these fins weren t made for 
                    walkin .  

                                    REBECCA
                    Wanna borrow what s-his-name s flip 
                    flops?  It was the least I could 
                    steal.

      Kat shakes her head.  Zoey winces.

                                  KAT
                    You okay, honey?

                                  ZOEY
                    Yeah, I m fine.

      They continue schlepping.  Zoey glances at an unhappy Kat.

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    How  bout you?

                                  KAT
                    I just don t understand it.  I 
                    follow my head, and things go 
                    wrong.  So I follow my gut, and 
                    things still go wrong. 

                                    REBECCA
                     Gut  isn t really the word for 
                    what you followed.

                                  KAT
                    I know.  I was perhaps too easily 
                    charmed by the Australian accent.  
                    I was like a cobra with that crazy 
                    flute.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well, I say, good girl.  You had 
                    fun, didn t you?                                                                                    43.


                                  KAT
                    I kinda did.
                          (sighs)
                    But still, is there anybody out 
                    there I can trust anymore?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yeah.  Us.

      They look at each other... grateful.  Not an ounce of 
      toughness on Rebecca's face -- a rare, but beautiful thing.  
      Then finally, in the distance, they see a pick-up truck 
      approach.  They wave their arms to flag it down...

      EXT. FARMSTAY - DAY

      The pick-up drops the girls off.  Owiso jogs out to meet them 
      like a worried parent.

                                  OWISO
                    Where were you?  I was so worried 
                    when you didn t come home last night.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Are we grounded?

                                  KAT
                    We went diving, but then we kinda 
                    lost our boat, or rather -- it was 
                    stolen--  

                                  ZOEY
                    --then we hung out with the guys 
                    who stole it--  

                                  KAT
                    --anyway, long story.  Right now we 
                    should get Zoey to a hospital -- 
                    she was stung by a jellyfish.

      Owiso bends down to check Zoey's leg.

                                  ZOEY
                    No, no, no.  I m fine.  Seriously.

                                    REBECCA
                    Zoey, we should get it checked out 
                    just to be sure.

                                  ZOEY
                    Hospitals make people sicker.  I m 
                    not going.                                                                                    44.


                                  OWISO
                    Don t need a hospital.  I ve got 
                    something better.

      INT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE

      Rebecca and Kat watch as Owiso dabs a poultice on Zoey s leg.   

                                    REBECCA
                          (whispers to Kat)
                    For all we know that mess could be 
                    poisoning her.

                                  OWISO
                    It s the root of a peanut tree and 
                    it s getting the poison out.
                          (lays a leaf on top)
                    And this, is a snakevine leaf.

                                    REBECCA
                    What, no eye of newt?

                                  OWISO
                          (smiles, then to Zoey)
                    You were stung by a blue bottle.  
                    Not deadly, but hurts like a bitch.  

                                  KAT
                    Where d you learn all this?

                                  OWISO
                    My parents, grandparents.  Aboriginal 
                      medicine s been around for thousands 
                    of years.  No cancer cures, but I can 
                    fix a jelly sting.  

      Zoey reacts -- from what he says, not what he s doing.

                                  OWISO (CONT D)
                    So leave that on for a half hour 
                    and you ll be good as new.

      Owiso leaves.

                                  KAT
                    Okay, so promise me you re not 
                    gonna be running around like a 
                    silly little freak this whole year.

                    What d you mean?  I m always silly 
                    and freaky.  I went skinny dipping 
                    and got stung.  Not that big a deal.                                                                                    45.

                    Not just that.  I mean, we ve been 
                    a little sidetracked, but I wanted 
                    to talk to you about the diving 
                    thing.

                    There s free-spirited and there s 
                    reckless.  We do know you, Zo.  
                    You re acting different, I don t 
                    know... desperate.

                    She s right.  If we re off, say so, 
                    but something s going on with you.

      Beat.  Zoey looks away, thinking...

                    I... I had a doctor s appointment 
                    the day before we left New York.  I 
                    blew it off.

                    I don t know.  I was supposed to 
                    get a test to check for BRCA 1 and 
                    2... I couldn t do it...

                    you feel, but here s a thought that 
                    keeps me sane... you aren t your mom.

                                  ZOEY
                    It wasn t just my mom.  It was her 
                    mom.  And her sister -- every woman 
                    in my goddamn family has got the 
                    stupid c-word in their lady 
                    business!

                    That doesn t mean you will.  And if

                    let s get it done.

                    The other day I went jogging and I 
                    got this little pain in my side and

                    Every little twinge I get -- elbow, 
                    leg, whatever -- it means my uterus

      Quiet.  Until Owiso interrupts.  This time, carrying 
      Rebecca's missing pack.

                    My bag.  Airport finally pulled it 
                    out.  Miracle.

      Rebecca pounces, immediately opens it and digs around.  We 
      see her find the PACKAGE, then shove it back inside.

                                  OWISO
                    Actually, I made a call.  Drove out 
                    there last night.  I know a guy. 

      Owiso grins and leaves.  Rebecca stares after him, dumfounded.

      EXT. FARMSTAY - FIELDS - DAY

      Owiso's talking to some workers when Rebecca walks up.

                    something nice for you?

                    Not usually, no.

      Owiso's phone rings.

                                  OWISO
                    Baganu Farms?... Great.  Thanks.

      EXT. RENT-A-BOAT PLACE - DAY

      The girls and a frowning RENT-A-BOAT GUY stand beside the 
      trashed remains of their dive boat.

                    Wait, Kat.  Who cares.  This means 
                    Max was telling the truth.  We need 
                    to go back.

      Zoey starts to pull Kat back toward their waiting taxi. 

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    Hang on then.  Someone needs to pay 
                    for the boat.

                                    REBECCA

                    God.  How much is that in American 
                    money?

      Zoey and Kat turn expectantly to Rebecca.

      Rent-a-boat guy hesitates, then takes the passports and the 
      girls are off--

      EXT. TENT CITY - DAY

                          (thinks)
                    Then I know what I m gonna do.  I m 
                    gonna pay for the boat.  

                                    REBECCA
                    But you can t do that and still go 
                    on the trip.

                                  KAT
                    I m not going on the trip.  I m 
                    going home.

                                    REBECCA
                    No, no.  We should all pay.  Maybe 
                    it ll shorten the trip by a few 
                    months but that s okay -- we ll 
                    travel as long as we can.

                                  KAT
                    You just told me not to listen to 
                    you.  I'm going home and that's it.
                          (touches Rebecca's cheek)
                    I think I ll miss you the most, 
                      Scarecrow.  Oh, wait, you re the 
                    Tin Man.

                                    REBECCA
                    Too many movies, honey.

                                  KAT
                    Let s just go.

      EXT. FARMSTAY - LATER

      And when their taxi drives up, Kat's mouth drops open 
      because...  Brian's standing there.  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    All I need is a tornado and a 
                    house.

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - LATE DAY

      Kat flits around, packing up her stuff.  Brian grovels.  

                                  BRIAN
                    You can t imagine what it s been 
                    like since you left.  I hate not 
                    seeing those little date labels you 
                    make for all the food when I open 
                    the fridge.  I hate that I can 
                    always find my razor by the sink.  
                    I hate that the bed s half empty 
                    and the closet s half empty and--

                                  KAT
                    --I m sure Little Miss Naked could 
                    take care of the last two things.

                                  BRIAN
                    Kat, I flew to Australia.  Doesn t 
                    that mean something?  

      But Kat maintains a poker face.  Brian stops her, pulls her in.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Look.  I screwed up bad, I did.  
                    But I need you.  And you need me.  
                    Please.  Give me another chance.

      And as Brian takes the engagement ring from his pocket and 
      slips it back on Kat's finger... we PULL BACK: 

      EXT. FARMSTAY COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

      To find Rebecca and Zoey spying from outside the window.  
      Rebecca and Zoey moan like they just saw a bad ski wipeout.

                                    REBECCA
                    Man down.  Man down!

                                  ZOEY
                    Crap.  Whatta we do?

                                    REBECCA
                    Lemme think... We chop off Brian s 
                    balls, give  em to Kat.  Two birds.  
                    One stone... well, two stones.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m serious.  This is serious.  She s 
                    got that look.  I hate that look.                                                                                    53.


      INSIDE, Brian smooths a piece of stray hair back from Kat's 
      face...

                                  BRIAN
                    I love that look -- that little 
                    lost look.  You re so cute when 
                    you re confused.  

                                  KAT
                          (looks away; fights tears)
                    I just--  I don t know what I m 
                    gonna do when I get home.

                                  BRIAN
                    Be with me.  Where you belong...  
                    Honey, who else is gonna love you 
                    despite all your funny little 
                    neuroses?  Because I do.  Panic 
                    attacks, insomnia... all of it.

      Brian takes Kat's face in her hands...

      OUTSIDE,

                                  ZOEY
                    Is her eye twitching?  If it s 
                      twitching, it s over.  

                                    REBECCA
                    I can t tell.  His ham hands are in 
                    the way.  

                                  ZOEY
                    That s it.  We re intervening.   

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes.  Good.

      Rebecca goes to the door, grabs the knob.  Zoey stops her.

                                  ZOEY
                    Wait.  Give her 20 more seconds.  
                    One, two--

      INSIDE,

                                  BRIAN
                    I m glad you ve realized that this 
                    trip isn t for you.  You need to 
                    come home... with me.  My funny, 
                    lost little Kat...

      Brian s still got her face in his hands.  He leans in to kiss 
      her but Kat suddenly bursts out laughing.                                                                                      54.


                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    What?  What s so funny?

                                  KAT
                    I just can t figure it out.

                                  BRIAN
                          (can t help but laugh too)
                    Figure what out?

                                  KAT
                    What I ever saw in you.

      Brian stops laughing.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    You think this trip isn t for me 
                    because I m weak, right?  Wishy-
                    washy, safe, nice, little me.  Know 
                    what?  Not anymore.  I don t know 
                    exactly what I want or even who I 
                    am, but I know I don t want to be 
                    with a patronizing asshole.  

      She turns around, zips up her pack. 

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    I m staying, Brian.  For once, I m 
                    taking a leap of faith.  

      She smiles at him, grabs her pack and heads for the door.  
      With her hand on the knob, she turns back around.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    And speaking of insomnia?  I just 
                    realized I ve slept better in this 
                    crazy place with roaches in my hair 
                    than I ever did in your arms.

      As she turns the knob.  Rebecca and Zoey burst in, act casual.

                                    REBECCA
                    Hello.  Hi.

                                  ZOEY
                    What s up?

                                  KAT
                    I finally thought of something for 
                    the dream list.

      EXT. FARMSTAY - NEXT DAY

      Owiso helps the girls load their stuff into a taxi.                                                                                      55.


      Zoey stands off to the side and pulls out her iPhone.  Taps 
      Skype.  Taps Elan s name.  His groggy face appears.

                                  ELAN (ON PHONE)
                    Hi.  Hi.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m so sorry, did I wake you up?

                                  ELAN (ON PHONE)
                    Yeah... but no, it s okay.  I m 
                    just happy you called.  I wasn t 
                    sure you were going to... but, I m 
                    just really glad you did...

      Rebecca shakes Owiso s hand.

                                  OWISO
                    Goodbye, Rebecca.  Maybe we can 
                    keep in touch.

                                    REBECCA
                    Keep in touch?  What s with you?  
                    We didn t even sleep together.

                                  OWISO
                          (chuckles)
                    I just like you.  You re very... 
                    spirited.

                                    REBECCA
                    That s what they call kids who have 
                    to wear helmets to school.

                                  OWISO
                    And funny.  So, can I get your email?

                                    REBECCA
                          (hesitates, then)
                    I m not really the pen-paling type.  
                    Sorry.

      She gets in the taxi.  The other girls hug Owiso goodbye...

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    In real life, the yellow brick road 
                    doesn t end at Emerald City.  You 
                    don t just change or figure things 
                    all out overnight...  

      INT./EXT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

      The taxi rumbles away then suddenly stops.  Rebecca jumps 
      out, runs back and hands a small piece of paper to Owiso.                                                                                      56.


                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    But you can get closer..

      As she runs back to the taxi, he unfolds it and smiles.  It's 
      her email address.        

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    With every risk you take.

      And as the taxi disappears in the distance, see another car 
      pull out from a side street and start to follow it...

      INT. OTHER CAR

      Gregory, the laid-back surfer from Tent City, not quite so 
      laid back anymore.

                                    GREGORY (ON PHONE)
                    I left those guys this morning... 
                    No, they have no idea.  Either does 
                    she... 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

      The two men from Rebecca s apartment stride through the 
      terminal.

                                  TALL GUY (ON PHONE)
                    Good.  Keep her in sight.  We re 
                    getting on a plane now.

      TIGHT ON: KAT'S ENGAGEMENT RING 

      ...as she pulls it off her finger and hands it to the rent-a-
      boat guy...

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    That s not to say things will turn 
                    out perfectly...

      TIGHT ON: KAT'S LAPTOP

      ...as she types in the back of the taxi... the first entry of 
      her travelogue...  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    And I m still terrified.  But since 
                    I can fall on my face in my dorm 
                    room, I might as well get out there 
                    and play some beer pong.   

      Then the taxi rolls to a stop.  They're here.                                                                                    57.


      TIGHT ON: THREE PAIRS OF HIKING BOOTS 

      ...as the girls jump out of a jeep and onto the dusty red 
      clay.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Because I have a feeling... 

      EXT. KUNUNURRA - THE GROTTO WATERFALL - DAY

      ...Zoey holds up the photo of her mom.  Nope.  Not this time.  
      But that s okay... one down...  

      And then, we're back at the beginning.  Watching the girls 
      hike the banks of that steep waterfall. 

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    The only leaps of faith I m ever 
                    going to regret...

      They reach the top, hold hands and jump...  

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...are the ones I didn t take.

      Cue Ida Maria s  Oh My God  as, this time, we watch them 
      plunge into the dark pool below - a flurry of white froth 
      boiling up in their wake.  And then, for a moment, it's 
      still...  

      Until suddenly they burst back through the glassy water, and 
      as they each take a huge gulp of air, we: 

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
