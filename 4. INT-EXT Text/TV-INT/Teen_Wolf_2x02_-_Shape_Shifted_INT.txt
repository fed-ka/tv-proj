      The CLINK and CLATTER of silverware fills the strangely 
      hollow, lonely house. Across a small table in the dimly lit 
      kitchen, Mr. Lahey and his son, Isaac, quietly eat dinner.

                    So far it s an A in French and a B 
                    minus in Econ.

                                  LAHEY
                    What about Chemistry?

                                  ISAAC
                    Not sure yet. Mid-terms are in a 
                    few days so it could go up.

                                  LAHEY
                    What s it at now?

                                  ISAAC
                    The grade? I don t know.

                                  LAHEY
                    You just said it could go up.

                                  ISAAC
                    I meant like... generally.

      Lahey peers over his wire-rimmed glasses at Isaac.

                                  LAHEY
                    You re not lying to me, are you?

                                  ISAAC
                    No.

                                  LAHEY
                    Then what s the grade?

                    I just told you I don t know.

                    You want to take this conversation 
                      downstairs?

      Isaac shakes his head.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    What s the grade?

                    Isaac?

                                  ISAAC
                    There s plenty of time--

                    It s a D.

      Lahey stops twisting the knife. Then, to Isaac s surprise, he 
      gently sets it down.

                                  LAHEY
                    All right, I m not angry. But you 
                    know I have to punish you. I have 
                    my responsibility as a parent. So 
                    how about we start with something 
                    simple. You do the dishes and clean 
                    the kitchen. Okay?

      Isaac gives a wary nod, unsure about getting off so easy.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Good. Because I want to see this 
                    place spotless.

      With a strange calm, Lahey picks up his glass and HURLS it to 
      the floor, SHATTERING it over the linoleum.

      into pieces against the cabinets.

      Another glass FLIES past Isaac and EXPLODES against the 
      refrigerator.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Spotless.

      Cowering, Isaac raises his head to reveal BLOOD dripping down 
      the side of his cheek. With a shaky hand, he carefully 
      extracts a SHARD of glass from just below his eye.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    That s your fault. Not mine.

      Isaac gazes at the shard between his bloody fingertips. 
      Breathing hard, he turns an angry gaze on his father.

                                  ISAAC
                    You could ve blinded me.

                                  LAHEY
                    Shut up. It s a scratch. It s 
                    barely...

      Lahey trails off, staring at Isaac. Watching THE DRIP OF 
      BLOOD on the boy s cheek literally REVERSE its flow. As if 
      being sucked back into the open cut. 

      Isaac brings his hand to his face, seeming to sense what s 
      happening. In mere seconds, the broken skin on his cheek 
      RESEALS, leaving only the vaguest traces of blood.

      The cut is gone. Healed.

      Isaac stands, knocking the chair to the floor. Only when he 
      moves for the door does Lahey blink back to reality.

                                  LAHEY (CONT D)
                    Isaac!


      Lahey speeds down the dark road as RAINDROPS begin pelting 
      the windshield. Slowing, he spins into a U-turn and whips 
      back the other way. 

      Taking turn after turn, he hurtles down darker and darker 
      roads until finally--he slams on the BRAKES. 

      Through the windshield wipers, he spots Isaac s BIKE lying in 
      a dark alley.


      Easing the driver s side door closed, Allison carefully 
      breathes onto the window. The glass fogs up, revealing a word 
      written by fingerprint... 

      Midnight.


      A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness. Using her phone as 
      a flashlight, Allison wanders out of the woods and into the 
      clearing overlooking the town. 

      Her breath catches when the light reflects off a PAIR OF EYES 
      like those of an animal. But it s only Scott.

                                    ALLISON
                    Hey--

      Scott goes for her phone, covering the display with his hand.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing?

                                    ALLISON
                    Trying to find you.

                    Did anyone see you leave?

                                    ALLISON
                    No. No one. I was careful.

      But Scott keeps glancing past her until she takes his cheek 
      with her hand, turning his eyes to hers.

                    you some things.

                    Okay. But I don t really know him. 
                    He s kind of just a guy who sends a

                                    ALLISON
                    No. My dad didn t tell him a thing. 
                    Trust me, it wouldn t be good for

                    What is it? Did something happen?

                                  SCOTT
                    We just need to be a lot more 
                    careful now. This can work. But 
                    only if we re careful.

                                    ALLISON
                    They re not going to split us

                    Not us...

      Pulling him closer, Allison calms him as only she can do. 
      With a kiss. Cheeks touching, lips brushing against lips, 
      they speak between kisses.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You re totally sure no one followed

      The door whips shut. Sitting in the back, flanked by the 
      hunters, the bewildered Principal gazes at Victoria Argent.

      Victoria raises a telescoping STUN BATON. She clicks it on 
      sending BLUE WISPS OF ELECTRICITY snaking up its sides.


      Isaac charges down the station steps to the platform. 
      Breathless, he spins around, searching the shadows.

      lacrosse practice.

                    I m serious. It s not like the last 
                    full moon. I don t feel the same.

                    the moon goes up and out come the 
                    fangs and the claws and there s

                    and it s all just way too

                    Fine. But I do think I m more in 
                    control now. Especially since 
                    things are good with Allison.

                    Now shut the hell up before I have

                    Well, do you have something better 
                    than a pair of handcuffs this time?

                                  STILES
                    Much better.

      Stiles opens his locker. But before he can reach in, HEAVY-
      DUTY CHAINS begin falling out. Everyone in the locker room 
      turns at the METALLIC CLATTERING.

      Scott and Stiles look down at the growing pile on the floor. 
      Jackson glances over with a look of abject contempt. 

      Even Coach steps next to Stiles to watch the chains continue 
      tumbling out. Pile rising higher and higher, until finally, 
      the last link clatters down.

                                  COACH
                    Part of me wants to ask. The other 
                    part says knowing will be more 
                      disturbing than anything I can 
                    imagine. So I m going to walk away 
                    now.

                                  STILES
                    Wise choice, Coach.

      As the locker room goes back to normal, Stiles and Scott 
      kneel to pick up the chains. 

      But Scott pauses, drawing a sharp breath. His eyes FLARE 
      briefly with a YELLOW GLOW. SOUND dissipates as he scans the 
      faces in the locker room, Jackson, Danny, everyone.

      Allison and Lydia step into the student-filled corridor. When 
      the door CLANGS SHUT, every single eye turns to focus on 
      Lydia as the crowd hushes to a dead silence.

                    Maybe it s the nine pounds.

      After a few agonizingly awkward seconds, Lydia whips her hair 
      around. And owns it. She and Allison walk through the crowd, 
      heads held high.


      While Mr. Harris writes notes on the chalkboard, Scott leans 
      over to speak to Stiles in a hushed whisper.

                    Doesn t being a teenager mean your

                    Not if they have solid evidence. 
                    Or... a witness.

      This last thought sends him scanning the faces in the room.

      Scott and Stiles point to each other.


      Sitting on the bench outside the Principal s Office, Stiles 
      peers over Scott s shoulder as he listens into the 
        conversation happening behind the closed door.

                    going to like you. I m not that 
                    strict, though. However, being that 
                    it s my first day, I do need to

                    someone s going to have to take the 
                    fall and stay for detention.

                    now...

      Derek opens a door next to the kitchen. He clicks on the 
      light revealing steps leading down to Lahey s basement.

                                  SCOTT
                    What s down there?

                                  DEREK
                    Motive.


      With her back pressed to the wall at the edge of the hallway, 
      Allison holds very still. Listening, waiting for the right 
      moment. Waiting for--

      FOOTSTEPS. The click of boots across the wood floor. At the 
      just the right moment, Allison darts out from around the 
      corner, almost colliding with--

      A HUNTER. Having just stepped out of Gerard s guest room.*

                                    ALLISON
                    Sorry.

      The Hunter gives a tight-lipped smile. Allison glances him 
      over, noticing something odd. The Hunter wears a SHERIFF 
      DEPUTY S UNIFORM under his coat. 

      He also carries a small WOOD CASE which he quickly drops into 
      the pocket of his coat as he slips by her.

                                  ARGENT
                    Allison?

      She turns to the open door of the guest room to find Gerard *
      and Argent peering out at her.

                                  GERARD
                    Come in. We d like to talk you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m supposed to go study with 
                    Lydia. I really don t have time--

                                  ARGENT

      The door clicks open to the basement of Isaac's home. Light 
      spills down the steps to a dank concrete-floored space 
      cluttered with boxes piled almost to the ceiling.

                                  SCOTT
                    What am I looking for?

                                  DEREK
                    You ll find it.

      Scott slowly steps down, stairs CREAKING underneath him. 
      Moving into the darker recesses of the basement, he reaches 
      out, feeling over the boxes, the musty wall.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Follow your senses.

      Breath tightening, Scott glances back but he can no longer 
      see Derek. He just hears his voice whispering toward him.

                                  SCOTT
                          (a whisper)
                    What happened down here?

                                  DEREK
                    The kind of thing that leaves an 
                      impression.

      Scott continues forward, past strange antiques, a torn 
      stuffed animal peeking out of a box. A plastic clown s mask.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Can you feel it?

      Swallowing nervously, Scott nods.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Think about how the sound of 
                    screaming can leave tiny 
                      impressions in the wood. Sweat left 
                    from fear. Saline from tears. In 
                    the walls, the floor...

      Scott peers down, then kneels, hands feeling over the floor 
      where he discovers several SCRATCHES in the cement.

                                  SCOTT

                      Fingernails.

      Scott connects his own fingertips to the marks on the floor. 
      Drawing his hand back, he moves with the direction of the 
      marks. Inching back around a support beam, retreating into 
      the darkness where--

      A LARGE FREEZER sits in the shadows. A small, open PADLOCK 
      hangs from its hinge.

      Scott slowly gets up, moving to the freezer. He reaches out 
      to put his hands on the lid as--

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Open it.

      Derek now stands right behind him, causing Scott to catch his 
      breath. Then, gathering his nerve, he pushes the lid open.

      He peers in to find the same desperate SCRATCH MARKS on the 
      inside. Dried blood in the grooves. And not just a few marks.

      They re everywhere.


      Phone pressed to his ear, Stiles drives far too fast while 
      talking to Allison.

                    Harris literally just let me out of

                    Well, we need to do something right 
                    now.


      Keeping an eye on her closed bedroom door, Allison whispers 
      into the phone.

                                    ALLISON
                    They were asking me all these 
                    questions about Lydia and how she 
                    was bitten by Peter. And then they 
                    sent this guy out--

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    They re sending him to the station.

                    He was also carrying this box and 
                    there was something on it. Like a

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    What was it?

                    I m taking a picture.

      Hearing FOOTSTEPS outside her door, Allison pauses. Then with 
      her phone she begins snapping pictures of an image in a book 
      on her desk.


      Stiles pulls his phone from his ear to look at the picture 
      that pops up on the display.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Did you get it?

      On his phone is a picture of a very familiar looking FLOWER.

      made bed. Jackson steps into frame and peers into the lens. 
      Then steps out to make another adjustment.

      With MUSIC blaring from his computer speakers, Jackson steps 
      in front of a full length mirror to gaze at himself. He 
      flexes his muscles. Gives a satisfied smile.

      Holding out his hands, he turns his fingers inward eyeing the 
      nails as if imagining what his claws will look like. 

      Coming closer to the mirror, he bares his teeth. Then 
      playfully growls at himself. 

      Laughing, he steps away and falls back onto his bed. Still 
      smiling, it s almost like he's preparing to lose his 
      virginity.

      ON HIS COMPUTER a web page displays the full moon and the 
      time it will hit its peak.

      Past his desk, the camera stands on its tripod, RED LIGHT 
      blinking as it records the image of Jackson lying peacefully 
      in bed. Slowly falling asleep...


      The Hunter dressed as a Sheriff s Deputy speeds down the 
      road. Making a turn, he slows to a halt at a STOP SIGN. 

      As he s about to hit the gas, he hears an odd THUNK from 
      outside. Pausing to listen, he holds very still as--

      THUNK. It happens again. Bewildered, he rolls down the window 
      to discover an even more alarming sound.

      descends the stairs.

      She flinches at the sound of his voice. It s gravelly, 
      deeper. Still unable to see him, she nervously sets down 
      Stiles s gym, a metallic CLATTERING coming from inside.

                    Are you sure we have to do this?

      She unzips the bag, revealing the HEAVY CHAINS inside. 

      A shadow falls over her, Scott stepping out of the darkness. 
      Eyes glowing. Teeth sharpening to fangs. The transformation 
      taking effect.

      Head low, the darkly sinister look on his face is enough to 
      convince her.

      Scott turns his eyes to the open freezer.


      Down a long corridor, a simple steel door with a small wire-

                    to do. Please. I don t want to hurt 
                    you.

      With her hand still on the lid, Allison leans down and gently 
      presses her lips to his. When he opens his eyes, they ve 
      returned to normal. But only for a moment. As they FLARE back 
      with a yellow glow--

      Allison shuts the freezer. Heaving the chains up, she begins 
      wrapping them around.


      The bored Night Officer types at her computer, barely even 
      glancing up as Derek walks in. For a brief second it looks 
      like Derek might actually not have a clue what to say.

      Realizing someone is there, the Night Officer lets out a deep 
      sigh.

                                  NIGHT OFFICER
                    How can I help--
                          (she looks up)
                    --you.

      As she gazes into his eyes, utterly mesmerized, Derek offers 
      a charming smile. 

      Watching from around the corner, Stiles throws his hands up 
      in defeat. Then hurries for the open corridor.


      Eyes held shut inside the freezer, Scott listens to Allison 
      pull the chains taut. Breathing becoming more and more 
      labored, Scott opens his eyes. Their glow turns the interior  
      of the freezer a dim yellow.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s done. It s locked.

                                  SCOTT
                    Go.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott--

                                  SCOTT
                    Just go.


      Stiles slips into the darkened office and goes for the lock 
      box on the wall. He quickly types in a series of numbers. 
      Then gives a self-satisfied smile when the box pops open. 
      Reaching up, the smile disappears from his face. 

      The keys are gone.


      A DROP OF BLOOD appears on the tile floor of the corridor. 
      And then another. And another.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1241.

      Limping, but determined, the Hunter dressed as a Sheriff s 
      Deputy moves quickly. In one hand he holds a SET OF KEYS, 
      exactly the ones Stiles was looking for.

      With the other hand, he pulls out the wood case from his 
      pocket and clicks it open. Inside is a SYRINGE filled with a 
      darkly ominous liquid.

      Rounding another corner, he spots the holding cells when-- 
      Stiles whips out from the adjacent corridor and almost 
      collides into him.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, hey. Sorry. I was just looking 
                    for my...

      He pauses, noticing BLOOD on the Hunter s pant leg. Looking 
      up, he connects eyes with the man. Stiles turns to run, but 
      the Hunter grabs him, hand slipping over his mouth before he 
      can shout for help.


      Allison closes the door of the basement. Nerves rattled, she 
      hugs herself as she backs away into the kitchen. She draws in 
      a deep breath and then...

      Pauses. Listening. She s still breathing hard, nervous 
      breaths. But then, holding still, she puts a hand over her 
      mouth.

      She s no longer breathing. BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS.

      Allison spins around to see a BLACK SHAPE standing in the 
      living room, silhouetted by the windows. Its EYES GLOWING.

      She SCREAMS.


      Inside the freezer, Scott snaps his eyes open.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison!


      Stiles tries to wrestle free of the Hunter, but he s vastly 
      out matched. The only thing he can do is reach out with a 
      free hand and grab-- 

      THE FIRE ALARM.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1242.



        Transformed, Scott smashes at the inside of the freezer with 
      his fists. Pounding and pounding while on the outside--

      The CHAINS pull taut, seeming almost to stretch.

      Hands pressed to the lid inside, Scott bares his fangs, 
      ROARING with both rage and fear as--

      One of the LINKS begins to separate. And then SNAPS APART.


      ALARM blaring through the station, RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS 
      flashing above, the Hunter shoves Stiles to the floor.

      Syringe in hand, he turns to Isaac s holding cell to find the 
      door ALREADY OPEN.

      The Hunter spins around to face Isaac, now a fully 
      transformed werewolf. Fangs bared, he lunges at the Hunter.

      Scrambling back, Stiles tries to stay out of the way of 
      swiping claws and a stabbing syringe. 

      Bodies smash from wall-to-wall until finally, Isaac CRACKS 
      the Hunter s skull into the drywall, knocking him 
        unconscious. 

      The syringe falls from his hand, rolling away. And then a 
      BLACK BOOT stops it, CRUSHING it underneath the sole. 

      Derek looks up. His eyes are glowing RED.

      But Isaac s murderous gaze fixes on Stiles. He lunges forward 
      when Derek steps in front of the new werewolf and ROARS with 
      a ferocity and power that practically shakes the building.

      Isaac drops down, cowering back with his arms over his head. 
      When he slowly pulls them away, he s transformed back to 
      human. Now just a teenager again, confused and frightened.

      Amazed, Stiles looks to Derek.

                                  STILES
                    How d you do that?

      Eyes dimming back to normal, Derek turns to Stiles.

                                  DEREK
                    I m the Alpha.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1243.



      Stilinski hits a button on a pad silencing the ALARM. Then 
      with other Deputies following quickly behind him, he turns 
      the corner to find--


      His son, Stiles. Standing in front of the open holding cell, 
      the unconscious Hunter lying next to him.

                                  STILES
                    Uh... he did it.


      Allison retreats into the kitchen. She yanks a butcher knife 
      out of the block and grips it with a trembling hand.

      THE BLACK SHAPE from the other room approaches, BREATH rising 
      as it closes in on her.

      Brandishing the knife, Allison pushes away her fear and 
      actually steps forward.

                                    ALLISON
                    Come on. Come on!

      The basement DOOR SMASHES INWARD, exploding into splinters as 
      Scott lunges into the kitchen. Knife in hand, Allison slips 
      back as--

      Fangs bared, Scott rolls in front of her and springs to his 
      feet in a protective stance.

      A BLACK SHAPE darts up the wall and then onto the ceiling.

      Scott and Allison look up, staring in shock at--

      A TAIL. Leathery and sharp, it whips about. Even more 
      frightening is the creature to which it s attached. Stuck on 
      the ceiling with talon-like fingers, it snaps its head down 
      revealing for one brief flash--

      A REPTILIAN FACE. With a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth, it 
      SHRIEKS at them with an ear-piercing SCREECH.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 202"PINK DRAFT1/13/1244.

      CONTINUED:5555

      Then moving with lightning speed, it darts across the ceiling 
      and slips out the door into the night.

      Gasping, Allison turns to Scott.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    What the hell was that?

      Breathless, he shakes his head.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know.


      Jackson's eyes snap open. Lying in bed, the morning sunlight 
      pours over him through the open window.

      He springs up, hand feeling over his torso, inspecting for 
      any kind of change. Getting up, he glances at himself in the 
      full length mirror. He s the same.

      He goes for the camera. Pulling it free of the tripod, he 
      starts hitting buttons.

      Breath held tight, Jackson watches the video on the LCD 
      screen. He pushes down, fast forwarding. From the look on his 
      face something is clearly wrong with the recording.

                                    JACKSON
                    No, no, no...

      With a CRY OF RAGE, Jackson SLAMS the camera down. A moment 
      later, the door swings open. Panicked, Mrs. Whittemore looks 
      in on her son. 

                                  MRS. WHITTEMORE
                    Jackson? What is it? What happened?

      Jackson slowly raises his head, teeth clenched in anger.

                                    JACKSON
                    Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

      ON THE LCD - Jackson can be seen lying in bed. An innocent 
      smile on his face, he sleeps soundly and peacefully.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
