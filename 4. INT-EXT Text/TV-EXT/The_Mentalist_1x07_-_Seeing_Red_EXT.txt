      A Victorian gingerbread villa tastefully overlaid with a 
      pastiche of Buddhist and other mystic symbology -- bells, 
      wheels, flags, yin/yang circles, eyes, etc.. 

      A well made SIGN planted on the lawn declares this is "The 
      Temple of Harmony, devoted to Psychic Wellness under the

      ROSEMARY TENNANT, 50's, an ageless beauty, classy dresser,  
      at present angry and in tears, comes storming out of the 
      front door.    

      KRISTINA FRYE, 30's, appears a beat later and stops in the 
      doorway. 

                                  KRISTINA
                    Rosemary, please don't go.  I'm 
                    only trying to help you.  

      Rosemary puts her hands over her ears.

                                  ROSEMARY
                    I'm not listening to you any more.  


                                  KRISTINA
                    You're making a terrible mistake. 
                    You're in serious danger.  

                                  ROSEMARY 
                    I'm not listening.

      Rosemary's out to the street and marches off.  Kristina 
      shakes her head sadly.


      Rosemary walks along a quiet downtown street.  Three or four 
      people out and about.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She takes it out of 
      her bag, looks at the caller ID, tosses her head in 
      irritation and puts the phone away unanswered.  Keeps 
      walking.  A beat.  And suddenly a nondescript SEDAN pulls out 
      from a parking spot at the curb, and rockets up the street.  
      The car hops the curb, and makes a beeline for Rosemary.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     2.

      Eyes wide in fear, she tries to get out of the way, but the 
      unseen driver swerves after her, clipping some garbage cans, 
      before it HITS HER, throwing her over the hood and into the 
      windshield.  She rolls off onto the ground into the gutter.  
      The sedan stops for a beat, then drives off.  

      CLOSE ON ROSEMARY:  Lying in the garbage strewn gutter.  We 
      watch as the light goes out of her eyes.  


      Later.  Same angle on Rosemary, under a draped sheet now.  
      She's at the center of a small circus of cops, forensics, and 
      gawkers.  A YOUNG COUPLE tells a Santa Rosa PD OFFICER what 
      they saw.

      JANE, LISBON, CHO and RIGSBY come across the yellow tape, to 
      meet with DETECTIVE MARCO FRANCIS, 30's.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Thanks for coming so quickly.

                                  LISBON
                    Your victim is the widow of Macon 
                    Tennant. 

      Francis shakes his head, looks blank.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Founder of CalSecure Financial and 
                    The Lieutenant Governor's close 
                    friend. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    We got to use the chopper.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Cool.

      They reach the body.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                    Two witnesses saw a silver sedan 
                      deliberately chase her down.  We're 
                    getting paint off those trash cans, 
                    hoping for a make and model, and we 
                    already have a partial plate.

                                  LISBON
                    Sounds like you're on top of it.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     3.

      CONTINUED:33

                                    FRANCIS
                    Sure.  But I don't mind getting 
                    your back-up.

      Jane clocks a flirtatious smile from Francis to Lisbon.  She 
      isn't biting.  

                                  LISBON
                    We're not back-up.  We're lead.  

      Francis kinda likes that she's a hardass.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Yes, ma'am.  

      Cho kneels to lift the sheet off the victim.  Jane glances 
      down at her as well.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                    A few days ago Rosemary here filed 
                    a missing persons report on her   
                    teenage son, Travis.  He'd been 
                    gone over a week.  Ran away twice 
                    before, with one stint in juvie.

                    What was the juvie charge?

                    DUI on a learner's permit.  Her 
                    house is eight blocks south, so we 
                    figure she was walking home.  From 
                    where, we don't know. 

                                  KRISTINA
                    She was with me.

      They all turn to find Kristina Frye has materialized right 
      behind them.

                                    FRANCIS
                    And who are you exactly?
                          (irritated, to uniform 
                            cops)
                    Who let her past the tape?

      Kristina affects an air of serene sadness, waving away 
      Francis' concerns.

                                  KRISTINA
                    My name is Kristina Frye.  I was 
                      Rosemary's spiritual advisor.

                    Please tell me I heard that  *
                      correctly. *

      Lisbon checks Jane with a look... She leads Kristina aside, 
      Jane follows.  The others go back to the car.

                                  LISBON
                    Ms. Frye, she was with you, where?

                                  KRISTINA 
                    At my home.  We just finished a 
                    session.  We contacted her husband.

                                  LISBON
                    Her dead husband?

                                  KRISTINA
                    That's right.  He told her this 
                    would happen.  He warned her she 
                    was putting herself in danger.

                                  LISBON
                    From whom?

                                  KRISTINA
                    I don't know.  I'm merely a 
                    channel.

                                  JANE
                    A channel for what?

                                  KRISTINA
                    For the energy of the departed 
                    souls.

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  Of course.  So, you knew this 
                    murder would happen?  

                                  KRISTINA
                    Her husband knew it.  I just passed 
                    his warning on to Rosemary.

                                  JANE
                    I see.

      Jane talks to Lisbon as if Kristina isn't there.

                    a channel for the energy of 
                    departed souls, or she's involved 
                    in the murder.  So you have a

      A grand place, but not what it once was.  Jane, Lisbon and

      bearded artist-type, stands in the doorway.

      The sights and SOUNDS of an old time CALLIOPE CAROUSEL -- 
      wooden horses, bright lights.  A FEW PEOPLE hop on for a 
      nostalgic ride.

      ANGLE ON:  A nearby wooden bench where Jane, Rigsby and Cho 
      sit eating peanuts and cotton candy.  

      Impatient, Cho eyes his watch as Jane eagerly scans the 
      crowd.  Rigsby licks his fingers.

      backpack coming to the ticket booth.  It's TRAVIS TENNANT,

      Moments later.  Travis gets into a chariot.  As the carousel 
      starts to turn, the guys take positions.  

      The MUSIC PLAYS.  The LIGHTS FLASH.  Eyes welling with tears, 
      Travis doesn't notice Jane passing one horse after another, 
      moving closer.  Then their eyes connect and, like a deer in 
      headlights, Travis realizes something's up.  He turns and 
      sees Cho in one direction, Rigsby in another.  He grabs his 
      backpack to bolt.

                    It could have been Jeremy.  He had 
                    access to it as well.

                    Put one of them in this car that 
                    night -- traffic cameras, a witness 
                    at a gas station.  If it exists, I 
                    want to know. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    I'm on it.

      Santa Rosa Detective Francis approaches.

                                    FRANCIS
                    You going to arrest Travis Tennant, 
                    or you want us to do it?

                                  LISBON
                    Sorry, Detective, but everything 
                    we've got so far is circumstantial.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Well, I go with my gut.  Ninety 
                    percent of the time if it feels 
                    right, it's meant to be. 

                                  LISBON
                    And what about the other ten 
                    percent?

      He checks Lisbon out, smiles.  Cho and Francis move off to 
      take a look inside the sedan.  Jane keeps watching Kristina.

                                  JANE
                    If anyone needs arresting it's 
                    Kristina Frye.  She knew Rosemary 
                    was in danger.  She knew where to 
                    find the car.  The murder weapon.  
                    Which means either she really does 
                    have supernatural powers or, she 
                    was involved in the crime.   

      Lisbon smiles.

                                  LISBON
                    Come on.  She simply did what you 
                    do so well.  With an air of great 
                      confidence, she made an educated 
                    guess.  Where else would you dump a 
                    car around here?  She's a good 
                    guesser.

                                  JANE
                    Well, yes.  That's possible also.

                    Yes.  And that's what you object 
                    to, isn't it?  Not that she's a con 
                    artist, but that she's so good at 
                    it.  Maybe even better than you.

                                  JANE
                    Not at all.  Alright, yes.  Not 
                    better than me mind you, but she's 
                    good.  It's the good ones that are 
                    most dangerous.    

      Van Pelt is agitated by their certainty.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Excuse me, but you might consider 
                    the possibility that she's actually 
                    honestly in touch with things that 
                    are beyond your understanding. 

                                  JANE
                    That would be golf, and musical 
                    theater.

      Cho comes back from the sedan carrying a pair of gloves in a 
      baggie. 

                                  CHO
                    Car's empty except for these on the

      He shows the gloves.  Lisbon takes them for a closer look.

      Van Pelt and Rigsby walk to the front door of a charming 
      little country house.  Rigsby KNOCKS. 

      The door opens and there's CONNIE ADAMS, 20's, all sexy and 
      disheveled, just like in Jeremy's photograph.  Van Pelt 
      clocks that she's wearing an antique diamond pendant around 
      her neck.

                    Nice necklace.  Police.  We're

      Suddenly Jeremy enters from the kitchen, seemingly oblivious 
      to their arrival.  He's wearing boxers and is shaking a can 
      of Reddi-Whip in his hand.

                                  RIGSBY

      FADE IN:


      A brisk autumn day.  Jane pulls up in front of the house.  
      Dooley, the Retriever, is running around.  Travis is out 
      front tossing a ball with his lacrosse stick as high into the 
      air as he can and catching it.  











































                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Seeing Red"     GREEN 10/07/08     38.

      It's out of sync with his emo-punk appearance and kind of 
      touching for that reason.

                                  JANE
                    Nice cradling.

                                  TRAVIS
                    You play lacrosse?

                                  JANE
                    No.  Fast moving sticks scare me.

      Travis throws the ball up again.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Did you find who did it yet?

                                  JANE
                    Not yet.

      Clara comes out of the house. 

                                  CLARA
                    Hi.  Find anything?

                                  JANE
                    I think Kristina Frye is 
                      responsible for your mother's 
                    death.  I need you to tell her that 
                    you want her to conduct a seance.  
                    To contact your mom when the will 
                    is read. 

                                  CLARA
                    I don't understand.  How will 
                    getting in touch with my mom help 
                    you catch Kristina?

                                  JANE
                    She won't really be getting in 
                    touch with your mother.  She's a 
                    fraud.  I'm going to expose her. 

                                  CLARA
                    But how do you know she won't 
                    really pull it off?

                                  JANE
                    She won't because she can't. 


      Clara sits in the car, the lights off, silent. 

                                  CLARA (V.O.)
                    I saw her after she left Kristina's 
                    place. 

      CLARA'S POV -- Rosemary walking down the street. 

      Clara takes out her phone...

                                  CLARA (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                    And I called her.  So she wouldn't 
                    be freaked out by me suddenly just 
                    turning up in the middle of the 
                    night.

      On Rosemary, taking out her phone and looking at the screen.  
      She tosses her head in irritation and puts the phone away 
      again unanswered.  

                                  CLARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    She wouldn't take my call.  Her own 
                    daughter?  I just got mad.  I got 
                    so mad.

      She turns on the headlights and swerves out into the street.  
      She knocks over the garbage cans, hops the curb and hits 
      Rosemary.
