      Inside, LENA FOSTER (35, warm, striking, African-American) 
      sits in her car with her cell phone pressed to her ear. 

                                    STEF (V.O.)
                  Hey, it s Stef.  I m either working 
                  or avoiding your call, so leave a -

      Lena hangs up, takes a breath, then climbs out of the car.



      Lena approaches DAVID FRESSOLA (32, overwhelmed, harried), who 
      extends his hand.

                                    DAVID
                  Hi, Lena?  I m David.  Nice to meet 
                  you. 

                                    LENA
                    Where s Bill?  I just spoke with him.

                                    DAVID
                  Um, yeah.  One of his cases - well, a 
                  kid in one of his foster homes OD d, 
                  so he had to rush to the hospital.

                                    LENA
                  Oh my God.

                                    DAVID
                  Yeah, it s terrible.  Anyway, I take 
                  it he told you about Callie...

      He consults a file in his hands.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  It seems she s been having a little 
                    trouble with male authority figures 
                  of late, which is why he thought of 
                  you, I guess...

      Lena nods.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"4.


                                    LENA
                    I guess so.  She got into a fight 
                  with her foster father?

      He checks the file again.

                                    DAVID
                  Um, yes.  And she, um, damaged some 
                  of his property.  Which is how she 
                  landed here in juvie.

      This is news to Lena.  She is taken aback.

                                    LENA
                    Damaged his property?  What does that 
                  mean?

      David doesn t know.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Oh, wow.  Um, look, David.  Bill and 
                  I have known each other a long time.  
                  He s been a friend of the family ever 
                  since he placed the twins with us.  
                  And I know he wouldn t have asked me 
                  to do this if he weren t in a jam -

                                    DAVID
                    - yeah, he had someone lined up but 
                  they fell through this afternoon -

                                    LENA
                  - but I can t be bringing someone 
                    violent into my house.  I ve got my 
                  own kids to think about.

                                    DAVID
                          (checking the file)
                  This is the first time anything like 
                  this has ever happened with her.

                                    LENA
                    Still...

                                    DAVID
                  Bill would never have put you in this 
                    position if he thought she was 
                    actually dangerous.

      This is true.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  And if there were any other options.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"5.


      This was a smart move on David s part.  Lena s a soft touch.

                                    LENA
                    I don t know.  I m just not sure this 
                  is the right time for us.

                                    DAVID
                    Please.  We just need a few weeks to 
                  find a more permanent solution.

      A beat.  Lena s wheels are turning.  She wants to help; she s 
      a caretaker by nature.  

      Just then, a LOUD BUZZ and the doors open to reveal Callie, 
      dressed in tight jeans and a ragged T-shirt, her face bruised 
      and bloodied.  Her right eye is swollen almost shut, and her 
      lower lip is cut.  Lena gasps.  Her instinct is to get in her 
      car and leave.  But she doesn t - she looks at David instead.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                            (explaining)
                    Sometimes - when kids are getting 
                  out, the other inmates get jealous 
                  and pick fights. 

      He smiles at Lena, then trots over to meet Callie.  As soon as 
      he approaches her -

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  Hi, Callie.  I m David.  I work with 
                  Bill at Child Protective Services...

                                    CALLIE
                    Where s Jude?

                                    DAVID
                  Um, I m - I don t know.  

                                    CALLIE
                    I wanna talk to Jude.

                                    DAVID
                    Callie, this is not the time.

      Callie starts to get upset.

                                    CALLIE
                  What the hell?  I wanna talk to Jude!  
                    Where s Bill?  Why isn t Bill here?

      David looks over at Lena, who is watching Callie like a hawk.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"6.


                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                          (then, re: Jude)
                  Why can t I just call him?  I just 
                  got out of juvie!  Jesus!  What the 
                  hell is wrong with you people!

      David shoots one more look to Lena, sure that he s going to 
      lose her.  Then he shuts Callie down.

                                    DAVID
                          (sotto, but intense)
                    Callie!  Enough!  Unless you want me 
                  to turn you around and march you 
                  right back in to Juvenile Hall, you 
                  need to calm down and be quiet! 

      Callie shuts up, but she s not happy about it.  A pause, 
      before David leads her over to Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Hi, Callie, I m Lena.  Nice to meet 
                  you.

      Lena holds out her hand.  Callie does not take it.  A long 
      beat.  David turns to Lena, moves in for the kill.

                                    DAVID
                    I mean, I guess I could take her to 
                  one of the group homes...

      Lena sighs - she knows how awful those homes are.  Callie 
      looks to Lena.  She would never beg, but her bruised eyes say 
      everything.  Please.  Please don t send me away.

                                    LENA
                  It s just for a few weeks, right?

                                    DAVID
                    Absolutely.

      A beat.  A breath.

                                    LENA
                  Okay.

                                    DAVID
                          (a smile over his threat)
                  All right, Callie.  I need you to 
                    behave, okay?  No acting out, no 
                    mouthing off, no running away or 
                  you ll be back in juvie before your 
                  head hits the pillow - got it?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"7.


                                    LENA
                          (re: David s threat)
                    David...

      But David stands his ground with Callie.

                                    DAVID
                  Got it?

      Callie finally nods.  

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  Okay, I ll let you guys head on home.  
                  Thank you, Lena. 

      Lena nods.  David hands Lena Callie s overstuffed, dirty 
      backpack.

                                    LENA
                  You ready, Callie?

      Callie nods again.  She still hasn t said a word to Lena.  
      Lena lets out a tense breath, then leads Callie wordlessly to 
      the car.



      Lena and Stef step outside.  Stef is a little hot; Lena was 
      prepared for this, and is assuaging her as fast as she can.

                                    LENA
                    I tried to call you.  Several times.

                                    STEF
                  I was with Brandon at his audition.  
                  You knew that.

                                    LENA
                  Look, I m sorry - but it was time 
                    sensitive.  And I knew you wouldn t 
                  want to leave the poor girl -

                                    STEF
                  Oh, no.  No, no.  Don t make this 
                  about me.  We made a deal, a long 
                  time ago -

      Lena tries a new tack.

                                    LENA
                  It s just for a few weeks.

                                    STEF
                  What happened to her face?

                                    LENA
                  She got beat up in juvie.

      Stef grumbles - juvie?

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                      I double-checked with Bill - she s 
                  not violent, she s not dangerous in 
                  any way.  It was a one time thing.

                                    STEF
                  You can t save them all, Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Don t patronize me, please.

                                    STEF
                  Who s patronizing you?  How about you 
                  don t get all uppity with your fancy 
                  words.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"15.


                                    LENA
                    Patronize is hardly a fancy word.  
                  And don t call a person of color 
                     uppity.   It s tawdry.

                                    STEF
                          (mocking her)
                     Person of color? 

                                    LENA
                          (pointing to her skin)
                  Brown.

                                    STEF
                          (pointing at her skin)
                  White.

                                    LENA
                    White s not a color.

                                    STEF
                  Okay, fine.  Sorry, Person of Color.  
                  I d hate to be  tawdry  in my own 
                  home.

      Lena laughs.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  It s just a few weeks, right?

      Lena nods.  A moment.  Stef heaves a big sigh - she s knows 
      she doesn t really have a choice.  With a shake of her head, 
      she gestures for Lena to head back inside.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                          (to herself)
                    Tawdry... don t be tawdry...  stupid.



      Callie slips around the side of the house and dials a number 
      from memory on Brandon s phone.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, it s me.  I m out.  And I m 
                    coming.  I promise.  I just gotta 
                  figure out how to get there.

      She hangs up, lets out a deep sigh.

                                        END OF ACT TWO      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"23.


                                      ACT THREE



      Day breaks over the charming craftsman.  It s perfectly still 
      and silent out here.



      Lena s car pulls into the parking lot alongside RILEY CHARTER 
      SCHOOL.  Everyone piles out.

                                    LENA
                  Why don t you guys show Callie 
                    around?  She ll be in Timothy s room 
                  to start the day...

      Brandon and Jesus nod.  Mariana takes off like a bullet.  

                                    MARIANA
                  See ya.

      Jesus watches her go - he is a little concerned about her.

                                    CALLIE
                          (under her breath)
                  Man, that girl is sketchy...

                                    JESUS
                  She s just being all weird right now.  
                  Ignore her.

                                    BRANDON
                          (defending his sister)
                  Didn t you just get out of juvie?

      This is news to Jesus, who looks at Brandon, both surprised 
      and impressed.  Callie s unhappy that word is out, and looks 
      around uncomfortably as the boys lead her across the small, 
      grassy quad at the center of the campus.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Thanks a lot.  Just what I want - 
                    everybody in the school knowing I 
                  just got out of jail.

      Jesus laughs.  Brandon mumbles an apology.  SEVERAL KIDS wave 
      hello to Brandon and Jesus, shooting them funny WHO IS THAT? 
      looks. 

                                    JESUS
                  Are you kidding?  That s the best 
                  thing in the world anybody could say 
                  to these asshats.  They ll be scared 
                  as hell of you...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"26.


      But Brandon can see that Callie s not buying Jesus  logic.  
      For the first time, he feels some sympathy for her situation.

                                    BRANDON
                  But don t stress - we won t say 
                    anything.

      Callie has little choice but to believe them.

      Jesus sees a FRIEND, stops to talk.  Brandon and Callie wander 
      the campus.  An awkward moment of silence.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  So, um, Timothy s room is over 
                    there...
                          (he points)
                  You ll find it okay?  We ve got like 
                  twenty minutes before class and I 
                  wanna go practice.

                                    CALLIE
                    Practice for what?

                                    BRANDON
                  I have that music competition 
                    tonight.

                                    CALLIE
                  Oh, right.  Okay.  

      Brandon gives her an awkward wave and starts to cross the 
      quad.  Callie feels the eyes of the arriving students on her 
      and calls out to him.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Hey - wait up.

      She trots over to him, grateful to have someplace to go.



      Jesus trots up behind Mariana.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey.

                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Hey.

      They walk a few steps in silence.

                                    JESUS
                  So I been thinking - I ll go with 
                  you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"31.


                                    MARIANA
                  What?

                                    JESUS
                  To meet Ana.  I ll go with you.  If 
                  you want.

      Mariana gets a little awkward.

                                    MARIANA
                  You don t even want to meet her.

                                    JESUS
                    I know...

      A beat.  

                                    MARIANA
                  I told you - I don t think I m ready.

                                    JESUS
                    I know, that s why I wanna go with 
                  you...

                                    MARIANA
                  No, thanks.

      And she walks away, leaving Jesus more confused than ever.



      Callie comes out of class and trots over to the BOY WITH THE 
      KEYCHAIN.  She puts on her most seductive smile.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, um - what s your name?

      He slows down.

                                    BOY
                  Aiden.

                                    CALLIE
                  Nice to meet you, Aiden.

                                    BOY/AIDEN
                  You new here?

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah.  Yup.  New girl.  Just, um, 
                  moved here.  I could really use 
                    someone to show me around...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"32.


                                    AIDEN
                  That could probably be arranged...

      He s playing it cool, but he s definitely into her.  Callie, 
      however, is after something here - something specific.

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah?  Cool.  In fact, I was kinda 
                    thinking about checking out San 
                  Ysidro this afternoon.

                                    AIDEN
                          (instantly put off)
                  San Ysidro?  Down by Tijuana?

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah.  I heard it s cool down there.

                                    AIDEN
                            (cautiously)
                  What, are you looking to party or 
                    something?

                                    CALLIE
                  No, no.  I just - I got someone I 
                  need to see.  
                          (then, glancing at his 
                            keychain)
                  You got a car, right?

      And suddenly he sees through her facade.  And then he notices 
      the remnant of her black eye.  He shuts down entirely.

                                    AIDEN
                  Yeah.  No thanks.  Good luck.

      And he walks away.  Fuck.



      It s lunchtime.  Kids litter the quad, sitting on the grass or 
      the few tables in pairs or threesomes or foursomes or 
      moresomes.  Mariana is eating lunch with a couple of LATINA 
        GIRLFRIENDS, speaking Spanish, when she overhears Callie 
      talking to a STUDENT nearby.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey.  Is there a metro stop around 
                  here?

      Mariana crosses to her.

                                    MARIANA
                          (with attitude)
                  You going somewhere?  Gotta meet your 
                  pimp?

                                    CALLIE
                  You wanna back the hell off, Selena 
                  Gomez?

      Callie glares at her, turns to go, then stops.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  You know, I didn t ask to be brought 
                  into your house, okay?  I m not 
                  trying to steal your family or 
                    something.  

                                    MARIANA
                  You can have  em.  They re pissing me 
                  off.

                                    CALLIE
                            (cautiously)
                  Why?

                                    MARIANA
                  Lena is always in my face, and Stef 
                  jumps down my throat every time I 
                  open my mouth.

      Callie nods - she gets it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Well what do you expect, your mom s a 
                  cop...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"34.


                                    MARIANA
                  She remind you of the guards from 
                  juvie?
                          (then, off Callie s face)
                  Jesus told me.  What d you do?

      A beat.  Of course he did.  Callie considers whether to take 
      Mariana in her confidence.

                                    CALLIE
                  My foster dad did something really 
                    screwed up, so - I took a baseball 
                  bat to his beloved Mustang.

      Mariana s eyes get wide.

                                    MARIANA
                    Seriously?  That s bad ass.

      Callie shrugs.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Keep it to yourself?

      Mariana agrees.  A beat.

                                    MARIANA
                  So are you leaving?

                                    CALLIE
                  I got some stuff I gotta take care 
                  of.

      Mariana looks at her curiously.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Sorry.  Better if you don t know.  
                  That way, if your moms start asking 
                    questions -

      Mariana gets it - she s got secrets of her own.  As Callie 
      turns to head for the front entrance - 

                                    MARIANA
                  Wait.  If you re gonna take off, make 
                  sure you go out the back way - Lena s 
                  office looks out over the front 
                    entrance.  The Metro s three blocks 
                  that way.

      Callie smiles, nods - these two have come to a small, but 
      important, understanding.  The BELL RINGS.  Both girls head 
      off in separate directions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"35.


      ELSEWHERE ON THE QUAD - Lena stands near the rear exit, 
      talking to a FIRST YEAR TEACHER.  

                                    LENA
                    Believe me, I get it.  I ve got four 
                  of them at home right now.  They can 
                  make you absolutely homicidal.  But 
                  you cannot, under any circumstances, 
                  let them see that they re getting the 
                  better of you, okay?  I learned a 
                  long time ago that as soon as I raise 
                  my voice I lose my power...

      Lena looks over and spots CALLIE HEADED HER DIRECTION.  She 
      waves.  

      With a sigh, Callie changes directions and goes to class.



      The BELL RINGS.  Students flood the breezeways.  Brandon walks 
      with Talya.  His phone BUZZES.  He looks at the screen - SAN 
      YSIDRO, CALIFORNIA.  He IGNORES the call.

                                    TALYA
                  So... my parents are out of town this 
                    weekend.

      Brandon smirks at her.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh yeah?

                                    TALYA
                  Yup.  Wanna spend the night?

      She puts her hand through Brandon s arm.

                                    BRANDON
                  I d have to sneak out.  

                                    TALYA
                  Or just tell  em you re staying - 

      Brandon looks at her, with a smirk.  Then, out of the corner 
      of his eye, he notices CALLIE HEADED OFF CAMPUS.  He takes 
      off.

                                    TALYA (CONT D)
                  - at Aiden s.  Where are you going?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"37.


                                    BRANDON
                  Gimme two secs.  Hey, Callie!

      Brandon trots across the lawn, chasing after his new foster 
      sister.

      ELSEWHERE - Mariana hangs by her locker with some girlfriends 
      when Jesus comes striding over, his hand out.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey.  I need some money.

                                    MARIANA
                  Um, rude much?  No - you ve got your 
                  own money.  

                                    JESUS
                  I left my wallet at home.  C mon, I m 
                    hungry.  I didn t eat lunch.

                                    MARIANA
                  Too bad for you.  

                                    JESUS
                  I just want a snack.  I ll pay you 
                    back...  

                                    MARIANA
                  No, you won t.  You never pay me 
                  back, because you never have any 
                  money, because you always spend it on 
                  surf stuff.  So no...

      Mariana turns back to her friends.  

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                          (in Spanish)
                  So what were you saying?  Sorry...

      Jesus grabs her purse out of her locker, takes out her wallet.

                                    JESUS
                  Look, just gimme five bucks.  I 
                    promise I ll pay you back tonight.

                                    MARIANA
                  Jesus!  Gimme that!

      She turns to grab her wallet from him, but it s too late - 
      he s opened it to find a WAD OF CASH, mostly twenties and 
      fifties, several hundred dollars all tolled.  He holds it up.

                                    JESUS
                  What is this?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"38.


      She grabs it from him, stuffs it back in her purse.

                                    MARIANA
                    Nothing.

                                    JESUS
                  Bull.  Where did you get that?

                                    MARIANA
                  Don t worry about it.

      She peels off a five dollar bill and shoves it in his hand.

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                  Here.  Now go get something to eat 
                  and leave me alone.

      Jesus knows better than to push her when she s this angry, but 
      he also knows she s lying through her teeth.  He gives her a 
      look, then walks away.

      BACK TO Brandon AND CALLIE - Callie is being more stand-offish 
      than usual.

                                    BRANDON
                  So... where you going?

                                    CALLIE
                  I ve got some stuff to take care of.

                                    BRANDON
                  Stuff to take care of?  Right now? 

                                    CALLIE
                  It s important.

      Brandon looks over and catches Talya staring at them, 
      displeased.  He almost unconsciously takes half a step back 
      from Callie

                                    BRANDON
                  Well, you re not gonna be able to 
                  take care of it if you end up back in 
                  juvie.  My mom s a cop - do you 
                    seriously think she won t track you 
                  down in like a minute flat?  

      Callie loses it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Why can t you just stay out of my 
                    goddamn business!  Your whole 
                    freaking family!      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"39.


                                    BRANDON
                  We re just trying to help you...

                                    CALLIE
                  Well stop!

      Before Brandon can reply, his phone BUZZES.  He pulls it out 
      of his pocket, looks at it, annoyed.

                                    BRANDON
                  God.  Someone s been calling me from 
                  this number all day...

      Callie grabs the phone from him.  

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  Hey - 

      She looks at the screen, then answers.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, baby, it s me.  What s going on?

      Brandon overhears something.  It sounds something like a teen 
      boy saying YOU GOTTA GET ME OF HERE.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  What?  What do you mean?
                          (a beat)
                  Jude, what are you saying?

      Someone interrupts the call.  Callie gets mad.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Let me talk to Jude.
                          (a beat)
                  Put him back on!

      The line goes dead.  Callie dials a number and presses send - 
      but no one answers.

      Brandon stares at her, disturbed by what he overheard.  Callie 
      is clearly devastated.  

                                    BRANDON
                  What s going on?  Who was that?  And 
                  why were they calling my number?

                                    CALLIE
                    I borrowed your phone last night.  
                  Look, I gotta go.  Now.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"40.


                                    BRANDON
                  So who was that?  Your boyfriend or 
                    something?

      Callie looks at him, shakes her head.

                                    CALLIE
                  No.  It s my brother.

      Not the answer Brandon was expecting.  He takes in her scared 
      but determined face. 

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  He s all I got.

                                    BRANDON
                  Let me call my mom.  She can help.

      Callie is instantly against it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Who?  Stef?  No way.

                                    BRANDON
                  She s a -

                                    CALLIE
                  No cops.  I don t trust -

                                    BRANDON
                  My mom s not like that.

                                    CALLIE
                  If you call your mom she s gonna look 
                  in the system and find all these 
                    complaints my foster father filed 
                    against me.  I kept trying to tell 
                  the police my side of the story, but 
                  they didn t care.  And then they 
                    arrested me instead of him.  You re 
                  just gonna get me sent back to juvie 
                  and Jude is still gonna be stuck in 
                  that house.
                          (then)
                    I gotta go.  I gotta go now.

      And she takes off, leaving Brandon to decide who he wants to 
      be - the good boy he s always been, or the great man he might 
      become.  He watches her disappear through the rear gate - and 
      after a deep breath, he takes off after her.

                                        ACT FIVE



      Brandon comes up behind Callie, who is moving at quite a clip.

                                    CALLIE
                  I m not coming back.

                                    BRANDON
                  I m not asking you to.  I m coming 
                  with you.

      Callie is shocked to hear this.  And not 100% sure she trusts 
      him.  She stops.

                                    CALLIE
                  You re not gonna call your mom?

      He shakes his head.  A beat.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Okay.

      And together they take off down the street.



      Dusk has just fallen.  Brandon follows a step or two behind 
      Callie, who storms up the street on a mission.

                                      END OF ACT FIVE      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"47.


                                        ACT SIX



      Stef drives as Lena stares out the window apprehensively.  
      Stef s phone rings.  Lena picks it up, looks at it, answers 
      it.

                                    LENA
                  Hey, it s Lena.

                                                                            INTERCUT



      A modest house in a nondescript neighborhood.  A DENTED 
      MUSTANG sits in the driveway.  Callie drops her backpack 
      silently on the patchy grass, and signals to Brandon with a 
      head nod.  He goes to the front door and KNOCKS.  

                                    BRANDON
                  Hello?  Anyone there?  Can you help 
                  me?  I m lost...

      Callie sneaks over to one of the windows on the side of the 
      house and taps on it lightly.

                                    CALLIE
                          (just louder than a 
                            whisper)
                  Jude?  Jude?  

      No response.  Callie taps again.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                          (a little louder)
                  Jude?  

      A light turns on in the house.  Callie drops to the ground.  
      Brandon knocks again.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hello?  Anybody home?

      Callie gets up, tries once more.

                                    CALLIE
                  Jude?

      Still nothing from Jude.  The front door opens.  JIM PIERSON 
      (40s, imposing) peers out through the screen.

                                    PIERSON
                  Can I help you?

      Callie disappears around the back of the small bungalow.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"53.


                                    BRANDON
                  Um, yessir.  I was... I was just...  
                  I m looking for the, um, Metro?

                                    PIERSON
                  The Metro s a few miles from here.

                                    BRANDON
                    Yessir.  Guess I got kinda lost.

      Over Pierson s shoulder, Brandon can see all the way to the 
      back of the tiny house, where Callie slips in the kitchen 
      door.  She creeps into the house as quietly as she can.

                                    PIERSON
                  Well, you gotta go about six blocks -

      Callie steps just a little too hard, making a small THUD.  
      Pierson whips around.

                                    PIERSON (CONT D)
                  What the hell are you doing in here?  
                  Get outta my house.

                                    CALLIE
                  I just want to see Jude.  Just for a 
                    minute.

                                    PIERSON
                  No.

      She moves toward the hallway.  Pierson grabs her by the arm.

                                    PIERSON (CONT D)
                  I said No!  You made a lot of trouble 
                  for me the last time you were here.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey!  Don t touch her!  

      Brandon reaches for Pierson.  Pierson whips around and shoves 
      Brandon against the wall.

                                    CALLIE
                  Look, I m sorry about your car.  I ll 
                  pay to have it fixed.  I just want to 
                  talk to Jude, okay - please?

      She shakes him off.  He grabs for her, but she slips past him.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Jude!

      Pierson opens a desk drawer and pulls out a gun.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"54.


                                    BRANDON
                    Callie!

                                    PIERSON
                  Get the hell outta my house!

      She freezes.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey, man!  Calm down.

                                    PIERSON
                  Don t you move.



      Just then, Stef and Lena pull up in Stef s XTerra.  Stef, 
      (still in uniform) jumps out and sprints to the front door.  
      Through the window, she can see Pierson with his gun drawn.  
      She pulls out her pistol.

                                    STEF
                    Brandon, get back!
                          (then)
                    Freeze!  Police!

      Pierson puts his hands up.  

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Set down the gun, slowly.  

      He does.  As soon as he lets go of the gun, Callie DASHES DOWN 
      THE HALL.

                                    PIERSON
                    Damnit!  Tell her to stay outta my 
                    goddamn house!

                                    STEF
                  Don t you move!  Now back away.  And 
                  get on your knees.

      Callie comes out of the back with JUDE (13, artistic, 
        effeminate).

      Stef and Lena watch as Callie hugs this boy.  There s a 
      softness to Callie in this moment, a vulnerability not seen 
      before.

                                    CALLIE
                  You okay?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"55.


                                    JUDE
                  Yeah.

      She notices that Jude has a BAD BRUISE on his arm.

                                    CALLIE
                  Did he hurt you?

      Jude doesn t answer.  Brandon walks over to Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Who is that?

                                    BRANDON
                  That s her brother.

      Not the answer Lena was expecting.  Stef snaps cuffs on 
      Pierson, then leads him outside.



      Stef sits Pierson down on the gravel drive.  Lena leads 
      Callie, Brandon and Jude out of the house.  After a moment, 
      Lena makes her way over to Stef.

                                    STEF
                  So what do we do now?  Call Child 
                    Protective Services?

      A beat.  Lena looks at her, something hopeful in her 
      expression.  Stef knows where this is headed.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                          (quietly)
                    Lena...

                                    LENA
                  We can t - send these kids away...

                                    STEF
                  We don t have enough room as it is.

                                    LENA
                  We ll make room.  

      Stef looks to Brandon.  He nods his approval.  With a sigh, 
      Stef surrenders.  Lena smiles, turns to Callie.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                    Callie, introduce us.

      Callie leads Jude over.  She is a little hesitant, afraid 
      there might be consequences for her actions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"56.


                                    CALLIE
                  This is Lena and Stef.  This is Jude.

      Jude hangs back, uncertain.  Callie takes in Lena s face.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  It s okay - they re on our side.

      Slowly, Jude reaches out his hand.  Lena takes it.

                                    LENA
                  Nice to meet you, Jude. 



      Mariana sits on the top of a damp picnic table, under the 
      harsh glow of a street lamp.  She holds the taped-up photo in 
      her hands, tracing the cracked lines with her fingers.  

                                    ANA (O.S.)
                    Mariana?

      Mariana looks up to see her birth mother ANA (40s, beautiful 
      but tired), for the first time in over a decade.  She swallows 
      and stands up.

                                    MARIANA
                          (quietly)
                  Hey.

      A long moment.  Ana seems even more anxious than Mariana.  Is 
      it just nerves?  Or something else?  

                                    ANA
                  You re really pretty.

                                    MARIANA
                    Thanks.  So are... you.

      Ana just shakes her head.

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                  How are you?

                                    ANA
                  I m good, I m good.  Back in town, 
                  you know - trying to get back on my 
                    feet...

      And with that, Ana s agenda becomes pretty transparent.  It 
      hangs in the air, until Mariana reaches in her purse, pulls 
      out the cash.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"57.


                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Here.  Hope this helps.

      Ana looks at it, resists the urge to count it.  The 
      humiliation on her face is easy to see.

                                    ANA
                  It will.  Trust me.  Thank you so 
                  much.

      Mariana just nods.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                    Promise I ll pay you back.  Once I 
                  get a job and stuff...

      Now that Ana has the money, she s ready to go.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                  So... you better get home, huh?  Your 
                    folks ll be wondering where you 
                  are...

      And suddenly it all clicks for Mariana.  This is not going to 
      be the mother-and-child-reunion of her fantasies.  She 
      hardens, just a bit.

                                    MARIANA
                  My moms.

                                    ANA
                  What?

                                    MARIANA
                  My moms will be wondering where I am.  

      Ana nods - right.  Another beat.

                                    ANA
                  Okay.  Well...

      And she gives Mariana a very awkward hug.  Ana s eyes well 
      with tears that do not fall.  As she turns to go, she holds up 
      the money.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                  Thanks again.

      Mariana nods, then watches as Ana disappears into the dark.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"58.



      As they load Jude s few things into the back of the car,  Lena 
      gives Brandon a stern look, shakes her head.

                                    BRANDON
                  I was trying to do the right thing.  

      It s true.  A moment.  

                                    LENA
                  I get it.  But you re still in all 
                  kinds of trouble.  We ll talk about 
                  it later.

      He wisely chooses not to argue.

      ELSEWHERE - Stef gets a moment alone with Callie.

                                    STEF
                  So I need to ask you... Why didn t 
                  you come to us?  

      Callie has nothing left to lose, tells the truth.

                                    CALLIE
                  The last time I told a cop the truth, 
                    I ended up in jail.

                                    STEF
                  Well I m really sorry to hear that.  
                  I m a cop, but I m telling you, I m 
                  not like that.

                                    CALLIE
                  Look, if you guys wanna send me back 
                  to juvie now, at least I know Jude ll 
                  be somewhere safe.

                                    STEF
                    Callie, I want you to listen to me - 
                  we re not going to send you back, 
                  like you re a... bad steak or 
                    something.  You re not disposable.  
                  You re not worthless.

      These words land hard on Callie.  It s the first time in her 
      life she s heard something like this.  If she were a different 
      girl, she would cry.  But she s not a different girl, so she 
      simply lowers her eyes to the ground and nods her head.

      Stef places a hand on her shoulder with a smile.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"59.


                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Come on - let s go home.

      MUSIC UP:  BRANDON S COMPOSITION

      Brandon s flawless composition starts to play. 



      Stef and Lena drive Jude, Callie, and Brandon home in silence.  
      Stef places a comforting hand on Lena s leg.

      Callie is draped protectively around Jude.  Brandon stares at 
      her, more taken with this confounding creature than ever.  She 
      looks over at him with a soft smile.  Then something occurs to 
      him.

      Just then, Brandon s music begins to build, but this time 
      there is an ADDITIONAL LAYER - TWO new components adding to 
      the complexity of the piece.  It makes the sound richer, 
      darker even - but also more harmonious.  It s beautiful.  

      Brandon ever so SUBTLY PLAYS AN IMAGINARY KEYBOARD along with 
      the music.  He glows with satisfaction.



      Mariana sits on the bench, not yet ready to go home.  Her 
      cellphone rings.  She looks at the screen, ignores it.



      The SUV cruises down the boulevard, framed by palm trees and 
      the street lamps.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"60.



      The XTerra pulls into the driveway.  

      Stef, Lena, Brandon, Callie, and Jude tumble out, carrying 
      Jude s few belongings.  Jesus comes out on to the porch to 
      meet them.  Stef introduces him to Jude.  They shake hands.

                                    STEF
                    Where s Mariana?

      Jesus tries to figure out how to answer the question, but is 
      saved as she comes jogging up the driveway.

                                    MARIANA
                  Here I am.
                          (then, off Stef s look)
                  I was over at Blanca s.

      Stef shoots an I m-not-buying-it look to Lena.  Jesus tries to 
      distract them, cover for his sister.

                                    JESUS
                  This is Jude, Callie s brother.

      Mariana smiles and waves hello.  And one by one, they file 
      inside the house, until only Brandon and Callie remain.  As he 
      heads into the house, she grabs him by the wrist and pulls him 
      back onto the porch.  

      They stare at each other for a long moment - something 
      unspeakable passing between them.  Finally...

                                    CALLIE
                  Thank you.

      Stef appears at the door, wondering where they are - and 
      notices the tension.  Callie carefully extracts her hand and 
      goes inside.  

      Stef gestures for Brandon to come in, then closes the front 
      door, shutting out the danger, and heartbreak, and hardship 
      that awaits them all in the rest of the world.  Tonight, they 
      are safe.  Tonight, they are family.  Tonight, they are home.


                                        END OF PILOT.
