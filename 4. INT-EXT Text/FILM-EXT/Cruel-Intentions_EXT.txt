We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and

A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
steps to the townhouse.
METER MAID
You can't park there.
Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
the townhouse.

COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
a Polo sweater with an American Flag.
KATHRYN (V.O.)
You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
Reynolds?
Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
up her hair.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
Of July Weekend?

A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.
KATMRYN (V.O.)
I went to great lengths to please Court.
Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
keep him happy.
Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.
SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
Swallow?
She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.
KATHRYN (V.O.)
What do you think?
Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Sorry.

Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.
KATHRYN (V.O.)
None other than Cecile Caldwell.
She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.
16

ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.
ANNETTE
It's a beautiful home you have here
Mrs. Rosemond.
AUNT HELEN
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
with my family for over sixty years.
Does your family do much riding?
ANNETTE
My mother and I used to ride a lot,
before she got sick.
AUNT HELEN
I'm sorry about that.
ANNETTE
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
farm so I would come over and ride all
the time.
AUNT HELEN
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
the mid-west. What's his name?
ANNETTE
Ben Schwarz.
AUNT HELEN
Schwarz. Jewish?
ANNETTE
German.
AUNT HELEN
Doesn't ring a bell.
Annette throws her a concerned look.
AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
In any event, I want you to consider
this your home for the time being.
ANNETTE
Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
around here.
BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.
ANNETTE (cont'd)
What was that?
AUNT HELEN
Sebastian must be here.
Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
FRANKLIN stands by the trap.
SEBASTIAN
Pull!
The TARGET soars into the air,
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Die motherfucker!
He fires the gun, missing the target.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Shit, shit, shit.
Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
perks up.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Kitty. Kitty.
He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
again. Sebastian searches for the cat.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.
He raises his rifle and takes aim.
AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
Sebastian!
He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
Annette riding over to him. He waves.
Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
I've been looking all over for you.
God, I've missed you.
AUNT HELEN
I've missed you too. How are your
parents?
SEBASTIAN
They're coming back next week. I write
them everyday.
She strokes his cheek, lovingly.
AUNT HELEN
Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
She's going to be staying with me for
a few weeks.
SEBASTIAN
I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.
He extends his hand and they shake.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
(to Aunt Helen)
Why don't you head in and whip us up
some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
take care of the horses.
AUNT HELEN
Anything for you, my dear.
Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.
AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
Stay out of trouble you two.
SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
We will.
He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
Cecile and braids her hair.
KATHRYN
So, rumor has it that you went on a date
with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
nice.
CECILE
He's alright.
(giggles)
He kept talking about this bulimic
headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
KATHRYN
Really? Bulimic headcase.
CECILE
What a loser she must be.
(beat)
Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
for Labor Day Weekend.
KATHRYN
That's great.
CECILE
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
just scared.
KATHRYN
What are you scared of?
CECILE
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
first base with a guy. What do I do?
KATHRYN
Haven't you ever practiced with one of
your girlfriends?
CECILE
Eww. No. That's gross.
KATHRYN
It's not gross. How else do you think
girls learn? Here turn around and
face me.
Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.
KATHRYN (cont'd)
Now close your eyes and wet your lips.
CECILE
Are you for real?
KATHRYN
Do you want to learn or not?
CECILE
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
her on the mouth.
KATHRYN
See that wasn't so bad.
CECILE
It was nothing.
KATHRYN
Let's try it again, only this time I'm
going to stick my tongue in your
mouth. When I do that I want you to
massage my tongue with yours. That's
what first base is.
CECILE
(reluctant)
Okay.
KATHRYN
Eyes closed.
Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
as instructed and they start to make out.
Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
continues her seduction.
She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.
Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
and smile.
KATHRYN (cont'd)
Not bad.
CECILE
That was cool.
KATHRYN
Maybe you should try it on your friend
Ronald sometime.
CECILE
What are you saying?
KATHRYN
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
you.
CECILE
Is it that obvious?
Kathryn nods.
CECILE (cont'd)
He sends me letters you know. Love
letters.
KATHRYN
That's so romantic. Have you
responded?
CECILE
No.
KATHRYN
Well do you like him?
CECILE
I don't know.
KATHRYN
Cecile, we just made out in the middle
of Central Park. You can trust me.
CECILE
(beat)
I do like him. I can't stop thinking
about him.
Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.
CECILE (cont'd)
What am I going to do? If my mother
found out about Ronald she would kill
me.
Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.
KATHRYN
Listen to me. Your mother must never
know. Never.
CECILE
Okay.
KATHRYN
Did you hide the letters?
CECILE
Yes. They're in this antique doll house
in my room.
KATHRYN
I want you to make me copies of his
letters and bring them to me.
CECILE
Why?
KATHRYN
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
at it's love letters. With my help,
he'll be eating out of the palm of
your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
little get together for the two of you
at my house.
CECILE
You'd do that for me?
KATHRYN
Of course I would. We're friends,
right?
CECILE
Best friends.
Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

Annette steps onto the balcony.
HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.
ANNETTE
(calling out)
Excuse me. Excuse me!
SEBASTIAN
You talking to me?
ANNETTE
Look, I know this is your house and all,
but do you think you couid keep it down?
I'm trying to read.
SEBASTIAN
What'cha reading?
ANNETTE
The Fountainhead.
SEBASTIAN
Great book.
ANNETTE
(skeptical)
You've read The Fountainhead?
SEBASTIAN
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
you know. When Howard Roark makes love
to Dominique Francon... most romantic
scene in all of literature.
ANNETTE
Romantic? He rapes her.
SEBASTIAN
That's a matter of opinion.
ANNETTE
You need help.
SEBASTIAN
Why don't you come join me for a swim
and we'll discuss it.
ANNETTE
At this hour? I don't think so.
SEBASTIAN
Oh come on. Quit acting like a
geriatric and get in the pool.
ANNETTE
Gee, with an invitation like that how
could a girl refuse.
SEBASTIAN
Please.
ANNETTE
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
SEBASTIAN
Thank you.
She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
RINGS. He answers it.

Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.
ANNETTE
(holding out the letter)
You know it amazes me that someone as
bright as you can be so horrible.
SEBASTIAN
What? Another letter from your friend?
ANNETTE
This is my favorite part.
(reading the letter)
Even more treacherous and dangerous than
he is charming and fascinating. He has
never taken a single step or spoken a
single word without some dishonorable
or criminal intention. Every young girl
he has successfully pursued has
regretted it.
SEBASTIAN
You know you could at least have the
decency of telling me who's badmouthing
me so I might have the opportunity to
confront them face to face. How do you
know it's not some girl who's pissed
off at me for breaking up with her?
ANNETTE
I sincerely doubt it.
SEBASTIAN
Give me the fucking letter.
Annette smiles and tears the letter up.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Why did you do that?
ANNETTE
The last thing I need is you going into
my room searching for this while I'm
away.
SEBASTIAN
(mocking)
Is that the last thing you need? My
your clever.
She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
bathing suit underneath.
ANNETTE
How's the water?
SEBASTIAN
Refreshing.
She dives in the pool and surfaces.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
You're right you know.
ANNETTE
About what?
SEBASTIAN
About what you said today in the stable.
I'm not a happy person.
ANNETTE
I never said that.
SEBASTIAN
You implied it.
ANNETTE
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
time.
SEBASTIAN
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
with all your morals and values and
well, YOU seem to be happy in your
choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
ANNETTE
(caught off guard)
Thank you.
SEBASTIAN
Seriously, you're amazing. You have
everything going for you.
(counts with his fingers)
You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
determined. You're everything I want
in a girlfriend.
ANNETTE
(jokingly)
Shut up.
SEBASTIAN
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
out.
ANNETTE
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
could never work.
SEBASTIAN
Why not?
ANNETTE
Because you act like a pig.
He swims towards her.
SEBASTIAN
Do you deny that there's an attraction
between us?
ANNETTE
I don't... I don't want to answer that...
look we're friends.
SEBASTIAN
You don't find me cute? Come on, look
at these muscles.
He flexes for her. She laughs.
ANNETTE
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
SEBASTIAN
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
that.
He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.
ANNETTE
You're naked.
SEBASTIAN
It's my house.
She pushes him off her.
ANNETTE
That's repulsive.
SEBASTIAN
What's the big deal? We're friends.
Haven't you ever seen your friends
naked before?
Annette climbs out of the pool.
ANNETTE
Get some manners.
She walks into the house.
SEBASTIAN
Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.
She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
Mary's for you.

Good night.

Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.
Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
her.
SEBASTIAN
Need a lift?
ANNETTE
No thank you.
SEBASTIAN
How are you today?
ANNETTE
Give it up.
SEBASTIAN
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
you an apology.
ANNETTE
I'm not going to speak to you till you
realize that you can't intimidate me.
SEBASTIAN
I said I was sorry.
She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Have a nice sleep last night?
ANNETTE
It was fine.
SEBASTIAN
I wish I could say the same for
myself. I was up thinking about you
all night.
ANNETTE
I thought we agreed that we were going
to be friends.
SEBASTIAN
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
switch the "on" button to "off." The
sad fact of the matter is that you've
unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Annette stops running and turns to him.
ANNETTE
And that's a bad thing?
SEBASTIAN
I'm trying to better myself, but the
one person who can help me is the same
one pushing me away.
ANNETTE
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
savior.
SEBASTIAN
Well try this one on for size. I think
I'm falling in love with you.
ANNETTE
You don't even know me.
SEBASTIAN
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
ANNETTE
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
is far from mutual.
SEBASTIAN
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
time together this morning?
ANNETTE
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
SEBASTIAN
Who?
ANNETTE
That's none of your business.
SEBASTIAN
How about tonight?
ANNETTE
I'm busy.
SEBASTIAN
Doing what?
ANNETTE
That's also none of your business.
SEBASTIAN
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
win your heart. I'll do anything. I
can't get you out of my mind.
ANNETTE
You truly want to do something to make
me happy?
SEBASTIAN
Yes.
ANNETTE
And you promise to abide by it?
SEBASTIAN
Without question.
ANNETTE
Alright.
(beat)
I want you to leave and go back to
New York.
SEBASTIAN
What?
ANNETTE
If that's a problem, then I'll make
arrangements to stay with some friends.
Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.
SEBASTIAN
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
ANNETTE
It's not about being happy. You and I
can't -
He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
ocean.
GREG
He told you he's failing in love
with you? I've never known him to
say those words before.
ANNETTE
Really? I thought he said it all
the time.
GREG
That's not his style. one thing I can
say about Valmont. He always speaks
the truth.
Annette looks lost.
GREG (cont'd)
What's wrong?
ANNETTE
Nothing.
GREG
Is there a mutual feeling between you
two?
ANNETTE
No. I mean. I don't know.
(beat)
What else do you know about him?
GREG
Not a whole lot. We take some classes
together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
mostly bullshit.
ANNETTE
What do you mean?
GREG
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
he's loaded.
ANNETTE
(sighs)
I don't know. I've been hearing some
awful things about him.
GREG
From who?
ANNETTE
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Greg takes her hand.
GREG
Annette, how long have we known each
other?
ANNETTE
Forever.
GREG
Now it's my job to look out for you.
You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
look like some kind of gossip queen?
Annette laughs.
ANNETTE
You promise not to say anything?
GREG
On my mother's life.
ANNETTE
(beat)
Okay...

Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.
GREG
Positive.
SEBASTIAN
Did you do everything I asked you to?
GREG
Yes.
SEBASTIAN
You told her I never said I love you
before?
GREG
Yes!
SEBASTIAN
You told her that people are jealous
cause I'm loaded?
GREG
Yes!
SEBASTIAN
And you think she bought it?
GREG
I'm pretty sure she did.
SEBASTIAN
Pretty sure or sure sure?
GREG
She bought it.
SEBASTIAN
I'll be in touch.

AUNT HELEN
More the merrier.
(to Cecile)
Is everything alright my dear?
CECILE
I'm just not feeling well.
Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.
SEBASTIAN
Afternoon ladies.
Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
seat at the table.
MRS. CALDWELL
I didn't know you'd be here,
Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN
I wasn't planning on it, but being
such a lovely day, why waste it in the
city. Anyone for tennis?
He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.
Cecile stands and rushes into the house.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
What's wrong with her?
No one knows.
MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.
SEBASTIAN
(concerned)
I hope she's alright.
AUNT HELEN
I better go check on them.
Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.
SEBASTIAN
Alone again.
(beat)
What are you up to today?
ANNETTE
I'm doing some volunteer work.
SEBASTIAN
Need any company?
ANNETTE
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
SEBASTIAN
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
trying to change here. You could be
supportive.

Am I bothering you?

Not at all. Have a seat.
He sits down next to her.
SEBASTIAN
Don't tell me you finished The
Fountainhead already?
She nods. He points to her book.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Great book. What's the guy's name,
Florentino...
ANNETTE
Florentino Ariza.
Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
around.
SEBASTIAN
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
of Florentino.
ANNETTE
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
SEBASTIAN
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
(low voice)
Bonjour mademoiselle.
ANNETTE
(laughs)
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
SEBASTIAN
(Monsieur Philipe voice)
You are very pretty. I would like to
kiss you.
The puppet kisses her on the cheek.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
(Monsieur Philipe voice)
Oooo, that felt good.
ANNETTE
Thank you.
He kisses her on the cheek.
SEBASTIAN
(Monsieur Philipe voice)
That felt good too. I will kiss you
all over.
The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
tickles her back.
They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
pushes him off her.
Sebastian stands.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
I'm sorry about that.
ANNETTE
I am too.
He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.
SEBASTIAN
You know what? I don't take it back.
ANNETTE
Why are you doing this?
SEBASTIAN
Because I'm in love with you.
ANNETTE
I thought you said we were going to be
friends.
SEBASTIAN
I can't handle it. I can't keep my
feelings bottled up like you. Can you
honestly tell me that you feel nothing
for me? ... Tell me!
ANNETTE
I have feelings for you.
SEBASTIAN
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
It's not like you have a husband,
unless your married to Jesus.
ANNETTE
That's not fair.
SEBASTIAN
Why can't we be together?
Annette's eyes well up with tears.
ANNETTE
You really want to know?
SEBASTIAN
Yes.
ANNETTE
It's because I don't trust myself with
you.

I took a vow and because of you I'm
tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
for me. Please.

McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in

GREG
I told you I don't know.
SEBASTIAN
One.

Alright. She's staying with some
friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
She caught the train twenty minutes ago

Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
What's your problem?
RONALD
Where the hell do you come off hitting

SEBASTIAN
What are you talking about?
RONALD
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
SEBASTIAN
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
RONALD
Did you hit her?

Ronald, you don't know what you're
talking about.
RONALD
Don't know what I'm talking about? I
