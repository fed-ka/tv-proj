      A dirt-covered stairwell leads down to a root cellar, long 
      overtaken by unchecked growth. While the SHOUTS and FOOTSTEPS 
      of Hunters echo down from above--

      Peter holds a terrified Derek in his arms, keeping him still.

                    They stayed there for two days. 
                    Hiding and waiting.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/133.



      Cora peers out the windows, watching a steady rain wash away 
      the Alpha s Triskele painted on the window.

                                  CORA
                    It s what we were taught to do when 
                    Hunters found us. Hide and heal.

      She glances to Stiles who looks about the loft, unsatisfied.

                                  STILES
                    So is two days standard? Or are we 
                    thinking Derek s on an extended 
                    getaway?

                                  CORA
                    Why do you care?

                                  STILES
                    Because in the last few weeks, my 
                    best friend almost killed himself, 
                    his boss nearly got ritually 
                      sacrificed, a girl I ve known since 
                    I was three was ritually 
                      sacrificed, Boyd was killed by 
                      Alphas--you really need me to go 
                    on? Because I can. For like an 
                    hour.

                                  CORA
                    You think Derek can do anything 
                    about it? 

                                  STILES
                    Since he s the one everyone seems 
                    to be after, it s more like he 
                    should do something about it.

                                  CORA
                          (quietly)
                    I don t know. There s something 
                    about him now. He wasn t like this 
                    when I knew him.

                                  STILES
                    Well, what was he like?

                                  PETER (O.S.)
                    A lot like Scott actually.

      Startling them, Peter steps down from the spiral staircase.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/134.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    A lot like most teenagers. 
                      Unbearably romantic. Profoundly 
                      narcissistic. Tolerable really only 
                    to other teenagers.

                                  STILES
                    So what changed him?

                                  PETER
                    The same thing that changes a lot 
                    of young men. A girl.

                                  STILES
                    Some girl broke his little heart 
                    and that s why he s like that?

                                  PETER
                    The details are a bit more 
                    textured. You remember before Derek 
                    was an Alpha his eyes were blue? Do 
                    you know why some werewolves have 
                    blue eyes?

                                  STILES
                    I thought it was a genetic thing.

                                  PETER
                    Genetics? Come on, Stiles. Don t 
                    reduce our nature to something as 
                    boring and mechanical as DNA. You 
                    want to know what changed Derek? 
                    Then you need to know what changed 
                    the color of his eyes...

        Approaching, Peter s own eyes begin to glow an ice-cold BLUE.


      A SINGLE BULB from a table lamp lights Gerard s room. He 
      blots his nose with a handkerchief, a constant drip of BLACK 
      BLOOD always at his upper lip.

      The door clicks open and he peers up to see Allison 
      cautiously step inside.

                                  GERARD
                    Did you bring him?

      Following behind her, Scott appears out of the shadowy 
      corridor. He stays paused at the threshold, however, gazing 
      on Gerard with trepidation.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/135.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Come in, Scott. Come in and give an 
                    old man a little something for his 
                    pain.

      Gerard holds out his hand.

                                    ALLISON
                          (to Scott)
                    You don t have to do this.

                                  GERARD
                    You want me to talk. This is the 
                    only way it s going to happen.

      Scott pulls a chair in front of Gerard and takes a seat. 

                                  SCOTT
                    If I do this, you have to tell us 
                      everything you know. Everything.

      Gerard simply extends his hand, waiting. With a nervous 
      glance to Allison, Scott finally takes her grandfather s 
      hand. 

      BLACK VEINS immediately appear under the surface of Scott s 
      skin, rippling up his forearm as he eases the pain from 
      Gerard s body.

      Clenching his teeth, Scott begins to pull back. But Gerard s 
      grip on him tightens, a sigh of relief escaping his lips as 
      black tendrils snake all the way up Scott s neck, into his 
      checks and toward his GLOWING YELLOW EYES.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      A hand reaches to the counterweight of a METRONOME and gives 
      a gentle push to start it clicking. Fifteen year-old PAIGE 
      raises a bow over a cello and begins to play.

      Another BEAT invades the ticking, however. Paige pauses. Now 
      only hearing the metronome. She starts playing again and--

      A POUNDING comes from the corridor outside. When it stops, 
      she tries to play again, but the sound returns, louder and 
      more recognizable.

      The sound of a BASKETBALL smacking against the tile floor, 
      completely throwing off her rhythm.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/136.



      The double doors of the music room burst open, turning 
      several boys around to find Paige glaring at them.

                                  PAIGE
                    Do you guys mind? I m trying to 
                    practice.

      The one boy with his back still to her, slowly turns around, 
      bouncing the ball in front of him.

                                  DEREK
                    How do you know we re not trying to 
                    practice too?

                                  PAIGE
                    Well, I m practicing in the music 
                    room. I m pretty sure basketball 
                    practice takes place in the gym.

                                  DEREK
                    I m pretty sure basketball practice 
                    takes place anywhere you have a 
                      basketball.

      He dribbles the ball through his legs, an impressive display.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    See?

      The others laugh behind him while she watches, visibly 
      annoyed. Giving up, she turns back to the music room.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Hold on.

      Paige pauses at the door.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    If you can take the ball away from 
                    me, I ll stop.

      With a sly smile, he bounces the ball right in front of her, 
      tempting her to try.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Come on. It ll be easy.

      He edges closer, bouncing the ball slowly and rhythmically as 
      she glares at him, eyes never leaving his, even as--                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/137.

        CONTINUED:77

      She SWIPES at the ball. Derek yanks it back. Behind him, his 
      friends laugh, enjoying the show.

      Derek dribbles the ball toward Paige, a little faster now, a 
      little more challenge to it. She tries to grab it again, and 
      fails again. Each time she reaches for it, Derek pulls the 
      ball back with greater speed and dexterity, with more skill 
      and flair.

      Finally, Paige shakes her head at him and turns back for the 
      music room. Watching her walk away, Derek only now notices 
      the cruel tone to his friends  laughter.

      While they head down the corridor calling out for him to 
      join, he lingers, glancing back to the music room.


      Seated with her cello, Paige grabs the bow and reaches to 
      start the metronome again.

                                  DEREK (O.S.)
                    Sorry about that.

      She gives only a brief glance at him standing in the doorway.

                                  PAIGE
                    Whatever.

      Hand on the fingerboard, she starts playing.

                                  DEREK
                    What s your name?

                                  PAIGE
                    I m trying to practice if you 
                    didn t notice.

                                  DEREK
                    Okay. I ll leave you alone.

      She places the bow against the strings again.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    If you tell me your name.

      She throws a glare back at him. But it begins to falter 
      against his charming smile.

                                  PAIGE
                    I ll tell you my name if you can 
                    play one instrument in this room.                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/138.

        CONTINUED:88

                                  DEREK
                    One?

                                  PAIGE
                    Just one.

                                  DEREK
                    Any of them?

      Paige gestures to the multitude of instruments in the room. 
      Setting the basketball down, Derek approaches. With his back 
      to her, he looks over the instruments. Paige cranes her head, 
      curious to see what he s going to choose.

      Then, after a long moment, he turns around and holds up a 
      TRIANGLE. With a metal wand, he gives the instrument a 
      delicate tap.

      Paige glares at him, lips pursed together in a monumental 
      effort to not smile back at him.

                                  PAIGE
                    Paige. Now please go so I can get 
                    back to practicing.

                                  DEREK
                    My name s--

                                  PAIGE
                    I know who you are.

      Quite pleased with himself, Derek heads out. Grabbing the bow 
      again, Paige can t help give a last glance at the charming 
      boy stepping through the doors.


      Scott grips his hand, trying to massage the residual pain 
      from it while a renewed Gerard sits up to address Allison.

                                  GERARD
                    They found a third body?

                                    ALLISON
                    Another doctor. Right after Scott 
                    found Deaton.

                                  GERARD
                    Right after? Almost like it was 
                    expected that he would survive.

                                  SCOTT
                    What s that supposed to mean?                                TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/139.

                    isn t the wise veterinarian 
                    himself? Maybe he knew you d find

                                  GERARD
                    Don t be so sure. You d be 
                    surprised how far some people would 
                    go to get rid of someone like 
                      Deucalion.

                                    ALLISON
                    Or someone like you?

      Gerard nods, enjoying her dig. He reaches for a tissue to 
      blot the black blood at his upper lip.

                                  GERARD
                    I don t go easily though, do I? You 
                    know, Scott, you ve made me 
                    something of a celebrity here. I m 
                    a medical mystery. The cancer is 
                    now virtually undetectable, but the 
                    doctors have no clue why my body 
                    keeps producing and ejecting this 
                    bizarre black fluid.

      He flicks a wet tissue to the floor in front of Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    I did what you wanted. Tell us how 
                    to beat him.

                                  GERARD
                    You can t. I ve tried.

                                    ALLISON
                    Then this is a total waste of time. 
                    He doesn t know anything.
                          (to Scott)
                    I m sorry I brought you here. I m 
                    sorry you did this.

      Surprised, Scott watches her get up.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Let s go--                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1310.

      She pauses. Only Scott sees her calculated expression, 
      knowing the threat would get to Gerard.

      FADE IN:


      While rain continues to run in rivulets down the windows, 
      Stiles turns a confused look on Peter.

                                  STILES
                    So if Derek was a sophomore back 
                    then how old was he? How old were 
                    you? How old are you now?

                                  PETER
                    Not as young as we could have been, 
                    but not as old as you might think.

                                  STILES
                    That was frustratingly vague.
                          (to Cora)
                    How old are you?

                                  CORA
                      Seventeen.

                                  STILES
                          (to Peter)
                    See? That s an answer.

                                  CORA
                    Seventeen the way you would count 
                    it in your years.*

                                  STILES
                    Forget I asked. What happened to 
                    Derek and Cello Girl?

                                  PETER
                    Her name was Paige.

      Cora and Stiles glance up at Peter s stern correction. But 
      his odd tone disappears just as abruptly.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    What do you think happened? They 
                    were teenagers. One minute it was 
                     I hate you. Don t talk to me.  The 
                    next it was frantic groping in any 
                    dark corner they could manage to be 
                    alone for five minutes.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1312.



      Hurrying out of the fallow woods, Derek guides Paige toward a 
      barn-like steel structure.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    Their favorite dark corner was an 
                    empty distillery outside of Beacon 
                    Hills.

      Inside, Derek pulls Paige close, his lips to hers.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    All right, hold up.


      Stiles levels a skeptical eye on Peter.

                                  STILES
                    How do you know all this? You just 
                    said they were alone.

                                  PETER
                    And back then I wasn t just Derek s 
                    uncle. I was his closest friend. 
                    His most trusted confidante. That s 
                    how I knew.


      Through a HOLE in the corrugated steel wall of the 
      distillery, Peter secretly watches Derek and Paige as they 
      kiss. He looks on them more with curiosity than jealousy. 
      Until Paige pauses, gently pulling away from Derek.

                                  DEREK
                    What?

                                  PAIGE
                    Why do you like me?

                                  DEREK
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  PAIGE
                            (persistent)
                    Why do you like me?

                                  DEREK
                    Why do you think I like you?                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1313.

                                  PAIGE
                    Honestly? I think, at first, you 
                    liked me because I didn t like you.

                                  DEREK
                    So are you worried that now that I 
                    know you like me, I m going to stop 
                    liking you?

                                  PAIGE
                    Not worried. Just wondering when.

                                  DEREK
                    What if I never stop liking you?

      He draws her back into his arms, but then glances up, 
      attention grabbed.

                                  PAIGE
                    What? Did you hear something?

                                  DEREK
                          (confused)
                    It sounded like someone gagging.

      Peter whips back from the hole in the wall as Derek turns 
      toward him. Keeping still for a moment, he carefully peers 
      back into the distillery.

      Derek now stands in front of Paige, scanning the other side 
      of the building s interior.

                                  PAIGE
                    What s wrong?

                                  DEREK
                    Something happened here.

                                  PAIGE
                    What do you mean?

                                  DEREK
                    I caught a scent. Blood.

      He takes her hand, guiding her closer to him. Then snaps his 
      eyes to the doors.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Now I definitely heard something.

      Outside, Peter cocks his head, focusing on a far off sound 
      Paige would never be able to hear. FOOTSTEPS. People 
      approaching fast.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1314.

                                  PAIGE
                    Derek, I don t hear any--

                                  DEREK
                    We have to go.

      He grabs her hand, pulling her out and into a run. Peter 
      retreats from the side of the building, glancing nervously 
      about.

      IN THE DISTANCE, shadowy figures appear, approaching fast.

      Hurrying around the corner of the building, Peter crouches in 
      the darkness. Back to the wall, he listens to the rush of 
      people, a dozen or more filling the inside of the distillery.

      Through a crack in the wall, a familiar face arrives--Ennis. 
      Leading the group, he points to the ceiling.

                                  ENNIS
                    There. You see it?

      A ROPE dangles from above, BLOOD staining the lower end. A 
      crowd of werewolves gather underneath, powerful men and women 
      grouped with their respective packs.

                                  ENNIS (CONT D)
                    They dragged him here, an arrow in 
                    his throat. They hung him and cut 
                    him in half. They killed one of 
                    ours.

                                  KALI
                    One of yours.

      Standing with her own pack, Kali faces Ennis.

                                  KALI (CONT D)
                    You can t say your plea for 
                      solidarity doesn t come with 
                      convenient timing. Why should I 
                    care about one of your pack?

      LAURA HALE, a strong young woman with the voice of a rising 
      leader, steps out from the others.

                    But they do discern motive.

      His back to the others, Deucalion gazes up at the bloody rope 
      above. Then turns to look on them with perfectly normal and 
        surprisingly gentle BLUE EYES.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Ennis, why did they kill him?

      Ennis doesn t answer, standing firm with his pack. One of 
      Deucalion s Betas, MARCO, steps forward.

                                  MARCO
                    Because your young, naive Beta 
                    killed one of them.

                    Marco--

      Deucalion tries to ease him back.

                                  MARCO
                    He killed a Hunter. Didn t he? 

                                  ENNIS
                      Accidentally.

      Murmurs of dissent rumble through the crowd.

                    No, but Beacon Hills was a very 
                    different place back then. And 
                    there was an exceptionally powerful 
                    Alpha who did live here. She had a 
                    capacity to shape-shift that was 
                    rare among her kind. That made her

      A HOWL pierces the night, immediately quieting the gathered 
      werewolves. Deucalion steps away from them, looking past the 
      open doors of the distillery where--

      Out of the pitch black, TWO GLOWING EYES approach. Surging 
      toward them, the shape of the creature catches the moonlight.

      A WOLF. 

      Magnificent in its size and power, it lopes toward them with 
      an elegant grace. When it crosses the threshold, it 
      transforms with startling speed into a beautiful, dark-
      haired, naked woman.

      Stepping out from the group, Laura Hale drapes a long, black 
      coat over the woman s shoulders.

                    She was Derek s mother. Talia Hale.

      The brilliant RED GLOW fades from TALIA s eyes as she turns 
      to face the werewolves surrounding her.

      FADE IN:


      Through a gap in the steel wall, Peter watches his older 
      sister, Talia, try to maintain the peace among the wolves.   

                                  TALIA
                    It s his right. And we re hardly 
                    the only people who adhere to 
                    rituals thousands of years old.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Which is no excuse for not 
                    evolving.

      Ennis holds up a CLAWED HAND.

                                  ENNIS
                    They ripped his claws right out of 
                    his fingers. They desecrated his 
                    body. You call that evolving? 
                    What s their excuse?

      Peter leans closer to listen as--A HAND YANKS HIM TO HIS 
      FEET. He spins to face Laura.

                                  PETER
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  LAURA
                    Me? You re the one lurking in the 
                    shadows all of the time.

      He yanks free of her.

                                  PETER
                    Try to remember I m your uncle.

      She starts to respond but they both glance back when Ennis 
      ROARS in fury, silencing the voices inside.

                                  ENNIS
                    Useless debate. I m done with it.

      Now both Laura and Peter peer through the gaps to watch Ennis 
      approach the far wall of the distillery. He places the tips 
      of his claws against the corrugated steel.

                                  DEUCALION

      Hand against the wall, Ennis pauses.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Don t make us part of a historical 
                    clich . With two such powers it 
                    never stops at an eye for an eye. 
                    Revenge becomes a blood feud. A 
                    skirmish becomes a war. A murder 
                    becomes a massacre. And we become 
                    no better than our enemies.

      Ennis holds a moment longer. But then he TEARS through the 
      steel with his claws, hand arcing around, sending SPARKS 
      FLYING. Finally, he steps back, walking away to reveal the 
      image carved into the wall.

      A SPIRAL.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      of Derek s loft.

                    Our mark for a vendetta. One that 
                    wouldn t end until Ennis was

                    It s not just revenge. Losing one 
                    of your pack isn t like a death in

                    And they wouldn t even let him see 
                    the body...


      The double doors of the hospital clatter open and Deputy 
      Stilinski enters with two other officers behind him.

      He slows at the sight of the immensely intimidating Ennis and 
      two of his Betas, both of whom are just as frighteningly 
      large. Engaged in argument with several Hospital 
        Administrators, Ennis spots Stilinski. His approach is so 
      swift, Stilinski makes an instinctive reach for his gun.

                                  ENNIS
                    I want his body. It belongs to me. 
                    Both halves.

                                  STILINSKI
                    First of all, I m just a Deputy. I 
                    do what I m told. And what they re 
                    telling me right now is that a 
                    young man was shot in the throat 
                    with an arrow and then literally 
                    cut in half. This is a homicide 
                      investigation. Second, as close as 
                    you were to him, you re not 
                    related.

                                  ENNIS
                    He was family to me.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Not according to the law.

      A stare-down. And despite Ennis s size and considerable 
      threat, Stilinski doesn t blink.

                                  CORA (V.O.)
                    I don t get it.


      Impatient, Cora turns to Peter.

                                  CORA
                    Why are we hearing the Ennis 
                    revenge epic? What does any of that 
                    have to do with Derek?

                                  PETER
                      Everything. Don t you know how 
                    these things happen? It s never one 
                    moment. It s a confluence of 
                    events. A tragedy of timing. 
                      Personally, I looked at Ennis s 
                      circumstance and saw a profound 
                    loss. Derek saw something 
                      different. He saw an opportunity.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1320.

                                  PETER
                    To always be with her.


      While other students dutifully take notes during the 
      teacher s lecture, Derek s focus drifts toward the sound of a 
      CELLO which only he can hear.

      The deep notes rise louder, away from the row in which he 
      sits, out the door and--


      Down the corridor. Past students heading into class. Past the 
      lacrosse team coming out of the locker room. All the way down 
      and through a set of double doors where--


      Paige sits alone, her concentration absolute as she plays a 
        particularly difficult piece. And plays it masterfully. She 
      stops, looking up with a shy smile at Derek in the doorway.

                                  PAIGE
                    What are you staring at?

                                  DEREK
                    I m not staring. I m listening. Am 
                      I distracting you?

                                  PAIGE
                    No. I ve got laser-like focus.

                                  DEREK
                    You sure about that?

      Ignoring him, she starts playing again. Derek steps behind 
      her. She doesn t even blink as he leans close. While she hits 
      every note, Derek slowly lets his lips touch her ear and--

      THE CELLO SHRIEKS with an unbearably false note.

                                  PAIGE
                    I hate you.

                                  DEREK

                    You love me.

      But when she looks into his eyes, his expression changes. He 
      says the words again and this time they re spoken softly and 
      seriously. Spoken like a plea.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You love me.

      She gives a tentative nod. And it s all he needs. Under the 
      lone spotlight in the music room, he kisses her again.


      Paused at the windows, Peter gives a sad shake of his head.

                                  PETER
                    The thing is, though. He had this 
                    constant fear. He was obsessing 
                    over it. Thinking about it. All 
                    night. All day. It was always on 
                    his mind...


      Cora and Stiles watch Peter, rapt with attention as he 
      details the decade old conversations.

                                  PETER
                    I kept telling him not to do it. 
                    But every day the more he thought 
                    about it, the more he was 
                      convinced. You know how teenagers 
                    are. I bet even he blames me now. 
                    He s probably convinced himself 
                    that it was all my idea.


      Peter looks through the locker cages at Derek as he changes 
      for basketball practice.

                                  PETER
                    I have the perfect idea.

                                  DEREK
                    Go away.

                                  PETER
                    Laura told you about the packs 
                    being here, right? There are more 
                    Alphas than I ve ever seen in one 
                    place. Your mother would never do 
                    it. And these packs won t be here 
                    for long. The time to do it is now.

      While other players head out, Derek s movements slow, caught 
      by Peter s persuasive voice.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    One little bite and she never gets

      A shaft of light falls over the stairs. Argent steps down, 
      followed by Gerard and TWO HUNTERS.                               TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1325.

      Eyes running over the vast system of roots, Argent reaches 
      out to touch one of the thicker branches and notes a FIVE 
      RING SYMBOL painted on it.

                                  GERARD
                    What is that?

                                  ARGENT
                    A Celtic Five Fold Knot. It s a 
                    Druid symbol.

      One of the Hunters steps back, nervous. The cellar is 
      strangely quiet. Only the sounds of their breathing.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    The air s different in here. Do you 
                    feel it?

      Gerard gives a nod. All of them now visibly unnerved. 

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    I think I know what this place is. 
                    Look over here.

      He gestures toward a dark stain on the larger roots.

                                  GERARD
                    Is that blood?

                                  ARGENT
                      Sacrificial blood. We re in a 
                    Nemeton. It s a sacred meeting 
                    place. Ancient Celtic Druids would 
                    usually choose a large, older tree 
                    in a grove. It would represent the 
                    axis mundi, the center of the 
                    world. There was a belief that 
                    cutting or harming the tree in any 
                    way would cause serious problems 
                    for the surrounding villages.

                                  GERARD
                    What kind of problems?

                                  ARGENT
                    Fires, plagues, strife. Death and 
                      destruction of all kinds.

      He notices Gerard inching back, an unconscious retreat while 
      his stare remains on the ominous symbol.

                    Where is it? Can we find it?

                    It s near the distillery. If that s 
                    still standing. The root cellar 
                      underneath was buried a long time 
                    ago, but the trees around it were 
                    enormous. The entrance is hidden, 
                    but you should be able to find it 
                    with a little effort.

                                    ALLISON
                    Would my Dad know?

                                  GERARD
                    Why don t you ask him yourself?

      Both he and Scott notice her hesitation.

                                    ALLISON
                    How does he know all of that about 
                    Celtic symbols and Druids?

                                  GERARD
                    Know thy enemy, Allison. He did his 
                    homework. If you haven t figured it 
                    out yet, the older wolves had a 
                      relationship with the Druids. They 
                    called them Emissaries.

      With effort, Gerard pushes himself up out of his chair and 
      goes to a dresser across the room.

      Gerard returns to them with an old, weathered book, sets it 
      down on a table and begins flipping through pages.

                                  GERARD
                    According to myth, some Greek 
                    citizens believed they owed their 
                    lives more to Prometheus than the 
                    Gods of Olympus. Some followers 
                    even took names to honor the Titans 
                    instead of the Gods.

                                  SCOTT

                          (nodding)
                    The son of Prometheus.

      Gerard turns the page to a painting of Prometheus giving fire 
      to man.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Lycaon didn t just refuse to honor 
                    the gods. He challenged them. He 
                    invited Zeus to a banquet and tried 
                    to serve him the flesh of a human 
                    being. Angered, Zeus tore the place 
                    apart with lightning bolts. And 
                    then punished Lycaon by turning him 
                    and his sons into wolves. 

      Gerard opens to a page showing Hendrik Goltzius s famous 
      engraving of Zeus turning Lycaon into a wolf.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    The part that s lesser known is how 
                    Lycaon sought out the Druids for 
                    help turning him back to human.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why Druids?

                                  GERARD
                    The belief was that the Ancient 
                    Druids knew how to shape-shift. 
                    They couldn t make Lycaon and his 
                    sons human again but they did teach 
                    them how to shift back and forth. 
                    So the Druids became important 
                    advisors to the packs. In a way--

                    stuff? I said some very personal 
                    things to her.

                                  CORA
                    Did she give you good advice?

                                  STILES
                    Actually, yeah.

                                  PETER
                    That s what they do. It s what 
                    Deaton used to do for Talia.


      Under the glow of the overhead light, Deaton speaks with 
      Talia and Deucalion, a tense conversation.

                                  DEATON
                    While I admire your willingness to 
                    extend an olive branch, I have to 
                    warn you it might not be welcome.

                                  TALIA
                    And I m not sure Gerard s the one 
                    to accept it.

                                  DEATON
                    It s true. The Argents have a 
                      matriarchal leadership.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1329.

                    Actually, I was talking about the 
                    fact that he s a complete 
                      psychopath. The man cuts people in 
                    half with a broad sword.
                          (to Deucalion)
                    If you want someone who ll listen 
                    why not go to his son, Chris? At 
                    least his moral compass seems to be 
                    pointed somewhere near the right 
                      direction.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Do the two of you really have so 
                    little faith in people? You think 
                    Gerard doesn t worry about the 
                    deaths on his own side? Deaths in 
                    his own family?

                                  DEATON
                    Do you know the story of the 
                    scorpion and the frog?

                                  DEUCALION
                    I have a feeling I m about to hear 
                    it.

                                  DEATON
                    When the scorpion asked the frog to 
                    carry him across the river, the 
                    frog said  How do I know you won t 
                    sting me?  The scorpion replied 
                     Why would I do that? We d both 
                    drown.  So the frog agreed. Halfway 
                    across the river, the scorpion 
                    stung the frog. When the frog asked 
                    why he did it since now they were 
                    both going to die, the scorpion 
                    replied  It s my nature.  All the 
                    faith you have in humanity may not 
                    matter if you underestimate 
                    Gerard s nature.

      Deaton turns to Talia for the final answer.

                                  TALIA
                    Make sure you meet him on neutral 
                    ground. And you don t walk in there 
                    alone.

      Paige looks down at a NOTE in her hand that reads: Meet me at 
      my locker 10pm. After the game.

      Folding the note, she glances nervously about the empty and 
      dark hallway. Utterly quiet. Until--

      HEAVY FOOTSTEPS echo toward her. The sound of boots hitting 
      the tile.

                                  PAIGE
                    Derek?

      The only response is the insistent fall of footsteps growing 
      ominously louder.

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                          (softly)
                    Derek? Is that you?

        A SILHOUETTE appears out of the shadows of the corridor. A 
      huge figure striding toward her. Gripped in fear, Paige can 
      barely seem to lift her own feet to back away.

      GLOWING REDS EYES appear in the darkness.

      Finally, Paige turns to run, a scream trapped in her throat. 
      She never sees the terrifying face of Ennis transformed as a 
      wolf and CHARGING RIGHT FOR HER.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      THUNDER rattles the loft as Cora approaches Peter.

                                  CORA
                    Ennis? You asked him to do it?

                                  PETER
                    Why not? He needed a new pack 
                    member. Paige was young and strong. 
                    Doing a favor for Derek would mean 
                    Ennis would be in good with Talia. 
                    Back then, everyone wanted to be in 
                    good with her. 

                                  STILES
                    So what happened? Did he turn her?

                                  PETER
                    Almost.

      His back to them, they don t see the change in Peter s 
      expression, an unfamiliar look for him... Regret.


      While the rest of the team finishes showering after the game, 
      Derek sits on one of the benches. Pensive, he holds a 
      basketball in his hands, turning it over and over.

      Letting it drop from his grasp, he bounces it against the 
      floor. Then again. The sound of the showers and the voices of 
      his teammates drift away. The SLAP of the rubber ball against 
      cement begins to change, becoming--

      The CLICK of a METRONOME. Ticking back and forth. Faster and 
      faster, louder and louder, until it seems to be hammering 
      through Derek s skull.

      The ball slips from his hands and SOUND rushes in. He looks 
      up, breathless and jumps to his feet, racing for the door.


      Stiles turns to Peter in realization.

                                  STILES
                    He doesn t remember it was Ennis, 
                    does he?                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1332.

                                  PETER
                    If he does, he keeps it to himself.

                                  STILES
                    Like everything else.

                                  CORA
                    What happened next?

                                  PETER
                    I know he saw her...


      But it s Peter who cowers in the shadows of a dark corner, 
      watching Paige crawl across the tile floor, trying to get 
      away from Ennis. 

      Still, Peter does nothing. Even as Derek charges blindly in 
      from around the hall, launching up to attack.


      Peter turns, gesturing toward the corridor in his mind.

                                  PETER
                    He came at Ennis. This fifteen year-
                    old boy against a giant. 


      Ennis slams Derek against the wall and tosses him to the 
      floor. As Derek tumbles past, Peter pulls further back into 
      the shadows, trying not to be seen.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    But there was no reason for Derek 
                    to fight.

      Pinned to the floor, Derek struggles against Ennis s powerful 
      hand. But the Alpha simply turns the boy s head to show him 
      what s already been done.

      Paige pulls herself up from the floor, hand clutching her 
      side where BLOOD seeps through her torn shirt.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    She d already been bitten.

      Ennis releases Derek, leaving him lying on the floor. Leaving 
      him there to see Paige gasp in terror at the horrifying bite 
      in her side.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1333.



      Scott and Allison watch Gerard press a tissue to his 
      blackened upper lip.

                                  GERARD
                    I wasn t really surprised when 
                    Deaton came to arrange a meeting 
                    with Deucalion. As William Blake 
                    said  When a sinister person means 
                    to be your enemy, they always start 
                    by trying to become your friend. 

                                  SCOTT
                    How do you know he didn t actually 
                    want to make peace?

                                  GERARD
                    Because I m not an idiot. Do you 
                    know the Sanskrit fable of the 
                    scorpion and the turtle?

                                  SCOTT
                    The scorpion asks the turtle for a 
                    ride across a river--

                                  GERARD
                    And when the scorpion stings the 
                    turtle and dooms them both what 
                    does the scorpion say to explain 
                    his behavior?

                                  SCOTT
                     It s my nature. 

                                  GERARD
                    I know a werewolf s nature. Bitten 
                    or born, they re the same. I knew 
                    exactly what was coming. A trap.


      Sunlight streams through the broken windows, falling on 
      Deucalion and three other BETAS. A mere few feet away, stands 
      Gerard and three HUNTERS.

                                  GERARD
                    It s kind of fitting that we re 
                    meeting in a distillery.

                                  GERARD (CONT'D)
                    You know the process of 
                      distillation is to separate two 
                      substances by pushing them into 
                    their different volatile states.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Volatile is exactly the state I m 
                    hoping to avoid.

                                  GERARD
                    Then this is going to come as a 
                    pretty big disappointment.

      Almost casually, Gerard twists one of the valves on a large 
      vat. What happens next surprises everyone, Hunters and 
      werewolves alike.

      A VIOLET STEAM pours from the vat. It rushes into the air, 
      sending them all into a panic, coughing, turning about in 
      terror while--Gerard pulls an INJECTION PEN from his coat 
      pocket and calmly plunges the needle into his arm.

      One of the Hunters falls, hands grasping at his throat as he 
      chokes on a mouthful of gas. Betas dropping beside him, 
      Deucalion whirls back toward Gerard.

                                  DEUCALION
                    What have you done?


      Allison starts forward, surprised by the revelation.

                                    ALLISON
                    They attacked you?

                                  GERARD
                    It was an ambush.


      With the violet gas pluming about him, Gerard pulls out a 
      large weapon that almost resembles a baseball bat.

                                  GERARD
                    One of the earliest weapons used by  
                    man was the Spiked Mace. I ve made 
                    one of my own. I d love to get your 
                    opinion on it...

      He raises the club, revealing the spikes on the end are 
      actually the CLAWS of fallen werewolves. Gerard swings it up, 
      moving toward one of the Betas.                               TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1335.

      But instead, he brings the head of it down right onto one of 
      his own, killing the Hunter instantly.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Your own people...*

                                  GERARD
                    They were hoping for peace too. 
                    Look what you did to them.

      Gerard SLASHES the mace across another, killing him 
      instantly. He starts toward the third Hunter while the 
      wolfsbane gas sends Deucalion and his Betas lurching to the 
      floor.


      Cora approaches Peter, noticing a change in tone to his 
      voice, a reluctance to look her or Stiles in the eye.

                                  CORA
                    So did she turn?

                                  PETER
                    She should have. And most of the 
                    time it takes. It does. The bite 
                    heals. There s a change in 
                    reflexes. All the senses heighten. 
                    Most of the time.

                                  STILES
                    Wait. When you offered it to me, 
                    you said  If it doesn t kill you. 

                                  PETER
                          (nodding)
                    If...


      Rushing down the steps, a breathless Peter spots Derek 
      through the shafts of moonlight. He sits under a tangle of 
      roots, Paige held in his arms. BLACK BLOOD streams from her 
      mouth, nose and ears. It stains her shirt and arms, running 
      all the way down to the tips of her fingers.

      Peter approaches, but only close enough to get a better look.

                                  DEREK
                    What s happening to her?

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    He knew the answer, though.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1336.



      Peter touches his fingers to the windows where rain drips 
      down, almost like the black blood on Paige s arm.

                                  PETER
                    It didn t matter that she was young 
                    and strong. Some people just 
                    weren t made for this. But she 
                    fought. She struggled. Desperately 
                    trying to survive...


      Derek clutches Paige s hand in his own, BLACK VEINS rippling 
      up his arm as he tries to take the brunt of her pain. But she 
      struggles in his arms, CRYING OUT.

      Peter watches from the shadows, finally backing away and 
      leaving. Horrified by the results of his own actions.

      Derek lets go of Paige s hand. Her breathing slows. A 
      momentary respite from the pain.

                      What--What do you mean?

                                  PAIGE
                    Right after I told you my name, I 
                    think I knew. And I ve seen things 
                    in this town before. Things no one 
                    really could explain. Then there 
                    was the way you d talk. Saying 
                    things like you d  caught a scent.  
                    And I know you could hear things. 
                    Things no one else could hear. I 
                    knew.

                                  DEREK
                    And you still liked me?

                                  PAIGE
                    I loved you.

      Grasping her hand, he tries again to draw the pain from her. 
      But the lines of black under his skin become too dark. He has 
      to let go.

                    I m going to die, aren t I?

      Derek slowly nods.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1338.

                      I can t... Derek, I can t take 
                    anymore.

      He pulls her closer, holding her tightly even as another wave 
      of pain shivers through her.

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Derek... please...

      Finally, Derek squeezes his eyes shut under the sound of his 
      CLAWS UNSHEATHING.


      Without even seeming to realize it, Peter thumbs the tips of 
      his own fingers.

                                  PETER
                      I remember taking her body from his 
                    arms. I carried her out to the 
                    woods to a spot I knew she would be 
                    found. It was another in a long

                                  CORA
                    What about Derek?

      He looks up to Stiles and Cora, his own eyes GLOWING BLUE.


      Bloodied bandages fall to the floor. With Talia and Marco at *
      his sides, Deaton looks over Deucalion. His quick breath of *
      shock says everything.

                                  DEATON
                    I m sorry. The eyes will heal

      Deucalion replies with a SCREAM of anger and betrayal, almost 
      shaking the room around them. Then slumps against the steel 
      table in front of him, beaten.

      Arm around his Alpha, Marco nods to Deaton and Talia who back 
      away, leaving them in the examining room. But Deucalion 
      shrugs free of Marco.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Leave me alone.

      Marco holds still, however.

                    Marco...?

      Deucalion rises from the table, movements slow and steady.

                    I said leave me alone.

                                  MARCO
                    You are alone.

      Shocked, Deucalion turns as--a SLASH OF CLAWS sends him *
      staggering back. Still standing, however, he slowly raises 
      his head again to reveal the burnt remains of his eyes are 
      now somehow GLOWING A FURIOUS RED.

      DEUCALION S POV - Within a scarlet haze, he sees Marco 
      raising his claws to attack again. But with a vicious SNARL, 
      it s Deucalion who attacks first.


      Scott and Allison share a look, now understanding.

                                  SCOTT
                    He sees as a wolf.

                                  GERARD
                    In wolf vision. That s what we 
                    called it anyway. But yes, he s not 
                    always blind.

                                    ALLISON
                          (to Scott)
                    What if we can use it against him?

      Scott gives a nod and then rises to leave with her. But 
      Gerard holds out his hand.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1340.

                    Scott...

        Reluctantly, Scott reaches for him once more, taking a bit of 
      his pain. When their hands part, Gerard leans back with a 
      relieved sigh.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I think about you sometimes, Scott. 
                    I do. I wonder what if I had done 
                    things differently? Getting the 
                    bite to cure my cancer. I wonder 
                    about my choices. And I wonder when 
                    it became my nature to believe that 
                    most things couldn t be asked for, 
                    but had to be taken.

      Scott stares at him for a long moment. Then shakes his head.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t believe you. The whole time 
                    you told your story, I was 
                    listening to your heartbeat. It 
                    never went up. It never went down. 
                    It was steady the whole time.

                                  GERARD
                    Because I was telling the truth.

                                  SCOTT
                    Or because you re a really good 
                    liar.

      He grabs Gerard by the hand again. BLACK VEINS rippling up 
      his arm, Scott meets his startled eyes.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    If you lied and it gets people 
                    hurt...

      Gerard tries to pull free, but Scott s grip only tightens.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I ll be back to take away more than 
                    your pain.

      He releases him. Gerard snaps his hand back, glaring at Scott 
      in both anger and fear. 

      Giving her grandfather a last look, Allison takes Scott s 
      hand and guides him out.                              TEEN WOLF "Episode 308"PINK3/4/1341.



      Now alone with Stiles, Cora takes a seat next to him on the 
      steps of the loft.

                                  CORA
                    What? You have this look on your 
                    face.

                                  STILES
                    What look?

                                  CORA
                    The kind that makes me feel like 
                    punching you.

                                  STILES
                    You re definitely related to Derek.

                                  CORA
                    What s with the look?

                                  STILES
                    I don t believe him.

                                  CORA
                    Why would he lie?

                                  STILES
                    It s not just that. It s like... In

                    Really starting to want to punch 
                    you now, Stiles.

                    So we got the story from Peter s 
                      perspective. So what?

                                  STILES
                    So, I don t think we got the whole

                    Are you going to ask Derek about

                    I know.

      She gently guides his chin up to face her. But he keeps his 
      eyelids squeezed shut, even while tears slip down his cheeks.

                                  DEREK
                    My eyes. They re different.

                      Different, but still beautiful.
