      Scott slowly drops his bag in front of his locker. The gloves *
      fall to the floor next to it. He seems to be moving in a *
      trance. He slowly turns, back against the locker, eyes *
      staring in shock.*

      Stiles leans his head out from the corner.*

      And Stiles slams the door shut as--*


      The door to the darkened locker room CLANGS open, Stiles 
      dragging a hunched over Scott inside.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get back.

                                  STILES
                    I m just trying to help--

                                  SCOTT
                    Get away from me.

      His VOICE comes out with a frighteningly demonic rasp, head 
      snapping around as if to rip out the other boy s throat.

      Stiles retreats, almost stumbling over his own feet at the 
      sight of Scott s EYES. The sounds coming from him are 
      painful, animalistic and frighteningly aggressive.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/116.

      Turning back, Scott doubles over in pain. He tears off his 
      lacrosse gloves to reveal his SHARPENED CLAWS.

      Stiles keeps stepping away in fear, accidentally backing into 
      a FIRE EXTINGUISHER against the wall.

      THE CLANG OF METAL causes Scott to whip his head around. But 
      it s no longer Scott under that helmet or behind those rage-
      filled yellow eyes.

      He hurtles toward Stiles, rounding the corner of the lockers, 
      jumping onto the wood bench and up as--

      Stiles lifts the FIRE EXTINGUISHER and pulls the trigger, 
      BLASTING CO2 from the nozzle. Scott s clawed hands come up to 
      shield his face, PLUMES OF WHITE surrounding him.

      Darting around another corner, Stiles backs against the 
      lockers, waiting for the next attack.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.) (CONT D) 
                    Stiles?

      Slowly, Stiles peers around the locker row to see Scott on 
      the floor, chest heaving with each difficult breath. He pulls 
      the helmet off to reveal--

      He s back to normal. Face drenched with sweat.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What happened?

                                  STILES
                    You tried to kill me.

      Stiles drops the extinguisher to the floor. Still shaking and 
      unable to conceal his anger at his friend.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/117.

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      An emotionally and physically exhausted Scott tosses his 
      school bag on the floor and falls face first onto the bed. 
      Melissa McCall looks in.

                    Late shift again for me, but I m 
                    taking a night off to see your

                    I can and I will. One shift won t 
                    break us. Not completely. And 
                    what s wrong with your eyes?

      Scott glances up in alarm.

                    Kind of? Nothing else? You re not 
                    on drugs or anything?

                                  SCOTT

                                  SCOTT
                    Have you?

      A question she clearly doesn t want to answer.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Get some sleep.

      Car keys in hand, Melissa leaves. 

      Scott drags himself up from the bed and hits the mouse on his 
      computer. The moment it WAKES, a web chat INVITATION from 
      Stiles pops up. Scott hits ACCEPT and Stiles appears in the 
      window.

                                  SCOTT
                    What d you find out?

                                  STILES
                    It s bad. Jackson s got a separated 
                    shoulder.

                                  SCOTT
                    Because of me?

                                  STILES
                    Because he s a tool. It s not your 
                    fault.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is he going to play?

                                  STILES
                    They don t know yet. But now 
                    they re all counting on you for 
                      Saturday...

      Stiles pauses mid-sentence. Then comes closer to the web cam 
      window, squinting his eyes at it. He seems to be looking at 
      something in Scott s room.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/119.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

      A TEXT WINDOW pops up on Scott s screen. Stiles types: 

      It looks like--

      The cursor turns into a SPINNING WHEEL, the computer 
      momentarily hung up. Stiles s web cam image freezes.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (impatient)
                    Looks like what?

      A moment later, the cursor finally stops spinning and the 
      rest of the text appears: 

      It looks like someone s behind you.

      Scott stops breathing. He doesn t turn around. Staying very 
      still, his eyes move to his OWN IMAGE in the bottom corner of 
      the web cam window. He slowly clicks the mouse, re-sizing the 
      window, making it larger and larger until--

      He sees his own reflected face, an expression of pure fear on 
      it. And behind him--

      A STRANGE SILHOUETTE. Someone is standing there in the 
      shadows of his room.

      Scott spins around and Derek grabs him, yanking him away from 
      the desk, sending the laptop clattering to the floor. 
      Dragging him up, he slams Scott face first to the wall.

                                  DEREK
                    I saw you on the field.

                                  SCOTT
                    What? What are you talking--

                    You shifted in front of them. If 
                    they find out what you are, they 
                    find out about me. About all of us. 
                    Then it s not just hunters after 
                    us. It s everyone.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1110.

                                  DEREK
                    And they won t. Because if you try 
                    to play that game Saturday...

      Derek comes terrifyingly close, right next to Scott s ear.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    I ll kill you myself.

      He pulls Scott from the wall and sends him tumbling across 
      the room. When Scott looks up from the floor--

      Derek is gone.

      The bedroom window lies open where he must have leapt with 
      incredible speed, leaving Scott alone in his room. 

      And shaking in fear...

                    Listen, McCall. Part of playing 
                    first line is taking on the 
                      responsibility of being the first 
                    line in the game. If you can t 
                    shoulder that responsibility then 
                    you re back on the bench until 
                    you re ready.

                                  SCOTT
                    If I don t play the game you re 
                    going to take me off first line?

      The BELL RINGS. Coach ushers Scott to the door.

                                  COACH
                    Play the game, McCall.


      Stepping back into the corridor and into the rush of 
      students, Scott jumps when his phone RINGS in his pocket.

      He takes it out to read a text message from MOM: Got the 
      night off! Coming to see you play! So excited!!                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1113.

      Scott breathes a sigh of frustration. His phone BUZZES again 
      with a second text from Mom: What does LMFAO mean?

      He s about to type back when he notices someone coming down 
      the corridor to find him--

      Allison Argent. She walks through the crowd, every teenage 
      male eye seeming to follow her. But her perfect smile is 
      reserved for Scott.

                                    ALLISON
                          (nodding to the phone)
                    Hey, you busy?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. It s just my Mom. She s 
                    nothing. I mean it s nothing. I m 
                    never busy. For you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I like the sound of that. I have to 
                    run to French class but I wanted 
                    you to know I m coming to see you 
                    play tomorrow.

                                  SCOTT
                    You are?

                                    ALLISON
                    And we re all going out afterwards. 
                    You, me, Lydia, Jackson. It s going 
                    to be great. And bring Stiles too. 
                    Save me a seat at lunch. Gotta  go.

      Scott barely has a chance to nod as she hurries off. But just 
      before she disappears into the rush of students, she smiles 
      at him again. With a quick wave, she s gone.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1114.

      Scott slumps against the lockers.

                                  SCOTT
                    I am so screwed.


      Down the adjacent hall, Allison stops at her locker, quickly 
      spins the combo, grabs her French book and--

      Stops when she notices something strange inside. Slowly, she 
      pulls an item out, one that shouldn t be there... Her JACKET 
      from the party.

      As she eases the locker shut, she notices how very alone she 
      is in the corridor. She gazes down one end of the hall and 
      then the other.

      Not a soul. Not a sound. Until--

      THE SECOND BELL RINGS, startling her. Breathing a short laugh 
      at herself, she hurries off to class.


      At the chalkboard with other students solving algebra 
      problems, Lydia whispers to Scott.

                                  LYDIA
                    Why is there a rumor going around 
                    that you re not playing tomorrow?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because I m sort of... not.

                    the captain of a losing lacrosse 
                    team. I don t date losers. You

                                  SCOTT
                    Losing one game isn t going to kill 
                    anyone. In fact, it might save

                    home surfing the net for porn.

      She finishes her math problem, wipes the chalk off her hands 
      and saunters back to her desk. Scott returns his attention to 
      his own EQUATION on the board.

      A locker slams shut. Scott leans his head against it, utterly 
      weary. Stiles whips around the corner, grabbing him.

      and one his Deputies.

                    Hold on. Give me a second.

      Stiles looks at her, quite confused. But then she pulls out a 
      BLUETOOTH headset that was covered by her hair.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)

                    Uh... No. Sorry.

      As she gives an irritated sigh, Stiles takes a seat far away 
      from her, head falling into his hand.


      Scott covers his mouth while gazing down at the lower half of 
      the body. He slowly pulls the drawer open to where the sheet 
      finally flattens out just above the severed hip.

      Removing his hand from his mouth, Scott pulls the sheet up to 
      reveal the decayed and rotted feet. Then, unable to stand 
      anymore, the sight or the smell, Scott covers up the body and 
      slides the drawer shut.


      Jackson comes around the corner to find Lydia. He s massaging 
      his shoulder.

                                  LYDIA
                    Did he do it?

                    get into but one cortisone shot 
                    won t kill me.

                                  LYDIA
                    You should get one right before the 
                    game too.

                    Or do you want to go pro?

      She pulls him into a kiss that s all tongue. 

      As they walk off, Stiles watches with a jealous gaze from 
      behind the pages of a hospital pamphlet. It s titled: All 
      About Your Menstrual Cycle.

      Scott yanks it out of his hands, surprising him.

      Scott nods and starts off with Stiles following.

                    So he did bury the other half of 
                    the body on his property.

                                  SCOTT
                    Which means we have proof he killed 
                    the girl.

                    Tell me something first. Are you 
                    doing this because you want to stop 
                    Derek? Or because you want to play 
                    the game Saturday and he said you

      Derek glances up from the backseat behind the cage as Stiles 
      slips into the front passenger side.

                                  STILES
                    Just so you know, I m not afraid of 
                    you.

      Derek almost smiles. Almost.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Okay, maybe I am. Doesn t matter. I 
                    just want to know something. The 
                    girl you killed...

      Stiles quickly glances around to see if anyone is coming.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    She was a werewolf. But she was a 
                    different kind, wasn t she?

      He looks to Derek for confirmation. Gets none.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    She could turn herself into an 
                    actual wolf. I know Scott can t do 
                    that. And I think you can t either. 
                    Is that why you killed her?

                    Keep looking. Maybe it s like a 
                    ritual. Like they bury you as a 
                    wolf. Or maybe it s like a special 
                    skill. Like something you have to

      A SQUEALING SOUND pierces through Scott s head. A high 
      pitched PULSATING that brings his hands to his ears.

      He doubles over and finds himself looking right down at 
      Stiles s school bag at his legs. Scott yanks it open. Inside 
      is the WOLFSBANE twine.

      Stiles takes corners far too fast, charging down the street 
      in his Jeep. He puts his cell phone to his ear.

                    No, wait, wait--

      But the line dies. With a sigh of frustration, Stiles drops 
      the cell phone onto the passenger seat on top of--

      PRINTOUTS from his most recent werewolf research. One in 
      particular is a drawing of a ferocious werewolf, a beautiful 
      young woman fainting in its arms.


      Through the open second-floor bedroom window, Allison can be 
      seen sitting down at her desk with an open box. She pulls out 
      a simple UNFRAMED PHOTO, looking at the words on the back:

      Philly Girls 4eva. We ll miss you!

      She turns the photo back around, smiling at the picture of 
      her with her friends from her last home. Then she slips it 
      into the corner of her mirror while never noticing--

      window... Scott, still a werewolf.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1137.

      In the shadows under the setting sun, his breathing becomes 
      more hollow and ragged as Allison comes to the window.

      Scott moves forward, creeping out of the darkness as if in 
      another second he could leap into her room and--

      Allison pulls the window shut, the glass revealing a sudden 
      REFLECTION to Scott.

      Himself. The face of a monster staring back at him. 

      Scott retreats back into the shadows, frightened by his own 
      appearance. He jumps down from his perch on the tree, darting 
      away from the house and into the street just as--

      HEADLIGHTS appear. A car SCREECHES to a halt. Scott SLAMS 
      into the hood, rolling over it and toppling to the pavement. 
      Argent hops out of the driver s side.

                    Oh my God...

      He has his phone out, already dialing 9-1-1 as he crouches 
      over Scott. But the boy s hand comes up, gripping the man s 
      arm. When Argent looks down at him, he's back to normal.

                    Of course not. He ran out into the

      She kneels over him, tenderly brushing dirt from the road off 
      his brow. Argent looks on, a different kind of concern on his 
      face now as Scott and Allison gaze into each other s eyes.

      Pulling his locker open, Scott notices Jackson whispering to 
      another player. He tries to use his hearing to listen in...

      But the SLAMMING of lockers masks Jackson's VOICE and instead 
      causes Scott to wince in pain. As the sound subsides into a 
      slightly unbearable RING--

      The player gives a nod and then heads out while Jackson moves 
      to whisper in the ear of another team member.

      Stiles wanders into the locker room, pulling his own uniform 
      over his pads. He notices Scott on the bench. Then takes a

                    Allison. I want a semi-freaking 
                    normal life. Do you get that?

      Stiles goes quiet. Then gives an understanding nod.

                                  STILES
                    I get it.

      Scott grabs his gear, Stiles following him out.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Just try not to worry too much 
                    while you re out there, all right? 
                    And try not to get angry.

                                  SCOTT
                    Got it.

                    And don't worry about Allison being 
                    there. Don t think about her father 
                    trying to kill you. Or Derek trying 
                    to kill you. Or the girl he killed. 
                    Or that you might kill someone. If 
                    a hunter doesn't kill you first.
                          (off Scott s look)
                    I ll shut up now.


      Scott slams through the door of the locker room. He comes to 
      the MIRROR, pulling the helmet off to look at his face.

      He s still a werewolf. Still a monster.

      Crying out in frustration, he sends a clawed fist into the 
      mirror, SHATTERING IT. Millions of fragments rain down below 
      him, reflections of his face fracturing into pieces.

      As one shard of mirrored glass wobbles to a standstill on the 
      floor, the locker room door swings open again.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She steps in, but pauses when SCOTT S LACROSSE HELMET rolls 
      eerily to a stop in front of her on the floor. 

      She approaches. Turns the corner. But stops again at the 
      sound of GLASS CRUNCHING beneath her shoes. She glances 
      around at the shards.

      Then, just as she looks up, a SHADOW slips across the floor. 
      She doesn t notice it. Or THE DARK SHAPE above her on the top 
      of the lockers moving stealthily back.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1152.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Scott, are you here?

      She steps around a corner to face an empty aisle of lockers. 
      Retreating back, she stops when she hears an odd SHUFFLING. 

      Pressing her back to one of the lockers, she s now clearly 
      frightened. She swallows visibly and--

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                          (almost a whisper)
                    Scott?

      Reaching up with her fingers she touches the steel lockers 
      and slowly steps around to find--

      Scott. But his back is to her and she can t see his face.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Hey. Are you okay? Scott?

      He doesn t move. Just the rise and fall of his torso as he 
      draws deep breaths. Allison keeps approaching, reaching a 
      hand up and out when--

      He turns around. And is back to normal.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    You scared me. Are you all right? 

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry. Just felt really light-
                    headed for a sec .

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe it s the adrenaline. You were 
                    pretty amazing out there.

                                  SCOTT
                    Thanks. And sorry for acting 
                      completely weird today.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s okay. I can handle weird.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1153.

                                  SCOTT
                    To be totally honest you make me 
                    kind of nervous.

                                    ALLISON
                    I do?

                                  SCOTT
                    Kind of really nervous. I just want 
                    to make sure I get my second 
                    chance.

                                    ALLISON
                    You already have it. I m just 
                    waiting for you to take it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Maybe I need to learn to take more 
                    chances.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe you do.

      And then he does. By kissing her. Stepping toward her, he 
      presses his lips softly against hers. Surprised, she holds 
      still at first. But then moves into him, kissing him back. 
      And for a brief second, Scott's life is utterly and totally 
      perfect.

      Until Stiles rushes in to find him. He skids to a halt, 
      though, when he sees them together. 

      But while hanging back, he can t help but watch as Scott and 
      Allison pull away from the kiss, smiling at each other with 
      the kind of sweetness known to first love.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I need to get back to my Dad.

      Scott nods. And with that perfect smile she steps away.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Hi, Stiles.

      Stiles gives a nod as she passes by and then turns to Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    I kissed her.

                                  STILES
                    I saw.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1154.

                                  STILES
                    I saw that too.

      Scott nods, practically drunk with happiness.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    It s pretty good, huh?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know how but I controlled 
                    it. I pulled it back. Maybe I can 
                    do this. Maybe it s not that bad.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah. We should talk later then.

      Stiles turns to go, but Scott catches up to him.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                  STILES
                          (reluctantly)
                    The medical examiner looked at the 
                    other half of the body we found.

                                  SCOTT
                    And?

                                  STILES
                    I ll keep it simple. Medical 
                    Examiner determines killer of girl 
                    to be animal not human. Derek is 
                    human not animal. Derek not killer. 
                    Derek let out of jail.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you kidding?

                                  STILES
                    No, and here s the bigger kick in 
                    the ass. My Dad ID d the dead girl. 
                    Both halves. Her name was Laura 
                    Hale.

      And as the realization of a much more complicated mystery 
      hits Scott, he doesn t seem to notice that he s missing one 
      of his lacrosse gloves.
