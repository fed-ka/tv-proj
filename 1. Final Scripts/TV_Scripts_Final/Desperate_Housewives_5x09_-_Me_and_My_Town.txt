Gaby smiles as we REVEAL DR. BACH, standing next to Carlos 
with a clipboard. 

GABRIELLE
Hey, sweetie. 
(to Dr. Bach)
So, how s our patient?

DR. BACH
Well, he took a pretty nasty fall last 
night. But I got his CT scan back. 
There s no bleeding or swelling. Just 
to be on the safe side, though, I want 
to keep him in here one more day.

GABRIELLE
But that s it? No concussion?

DR. BACH
Actually... there is something.

CARLOS
Uh-oh. 

DR. BACH
No, this is not an  uh-oh.  The scan 
revealed a tiny bone fragment that may 
be putting pressure on the optic 
chiasm.

GABRIELLE
English for...

DR. BACH
The place where the optic nerves for 
your eyes meet.

GABRIELLE
And, what, you re afraid it might 
impair his vision?

Gabrielle laughs. Off the doctor s blank expression:

(CONT D) GABRIELLE
Sorry. You were saying?

DR. BACH
I think the bone fragment is a remnant 
from your injury five years ago. Due 
to its small size, the original CT 
must have missed it.

CARLOS 
So if it s been floating around in 
there all this time, we can just leave 
it, right? No harm no foul?

DR. BACH
That s not what I m getting at. There 
is a chance that if we remove that 
bone fragment, you could regain your 
sight.

Gaby and Carlos freeze in stunned silence.

GABRIELLE
Are you serious? This is fantastic!

I m not promising a slam dunk here. 
I m just saying it s possible.

CARLOS
Hey, I m a guy who defies the odds. 
 Possible  is all I need. 

DR. BACH
I ve spoken with Dr. Daniels -- he s 
the best eye surgeon in the state. He 
says he can fit you in for surgery in 
about a month. 

CARLOS
Oh my god. If this works... I m 
finally going to see my baby girls.

Carlos takes Gaby s hand and pulls her to him.

(CONT D) CARLOS
And after all these years, I m going 
to be able to open my eyes every 
morning and see my gorgeous wife 
laying there next to me. 

Carlos hugs Gaby.

MARY ALICE (V.O.)
Yes, Gabrielle Solis knew she had lost 
her beauty. She also knew the time had 
come...

As Carlos releases her, and shakes the hand of the doctor, 
Gabrielle catches a glimpse of her worn down face and figure 
reflected in a mirror on the wall.

MARY ALICE  (V.O.) (CONT D)

The detectives sit with Dave. 

DET. BULLOCK
(flips through his 
notebook)
We ve been interviewing everyone who 
was there last night. We were told by 
an Orson Hodge that you were on stage 
with the band when the fire broke out?

DAVE
Yeah, we just started and suddenly the 
curtains went up. Everything happened 
really fast after that. All this 
smoke, and screaming... it was awful.

Dave trails off, upset. Bullock closes his notebook and looks 
at Berry, who steps in.

DET. BERRY
(sympathetically)
Hey... that s okay. We know how hard 
this has gotta be.

DAVE
(collecting himself)
Yeah. So, have they figured out how 
the fire started?

DET. BERRY
Well, we know it was arson. 

DAVE
... Really?

DET. BULLOCK
Yeah. It s looking like the point of 
origin was the storage room off the 
back hallway.

DET. BERRY
And there was a body in there, too. 

Dave stares at them, trying to keep his cool.

DAVE
Uh... any idea who that was?

Guy was pretty badly burned. It ll

Dave nods. Berry produces his card and hands it to him.

Anyway. If you remember anything you 
think we should know, give a call at 
that number there. All right?

Dave takes the card. The detectives rises and head for the 
door. Det. Bullock stops.

DET. BULLOCK
Dave Williams. Aren t you the one who 
went back in and saved that Delfino 
guy, huh? 

DAVE
Yeah.

DET. BERRY
Wow. You re an honest-to-God hero. You 
should be real proud of yourself.

As Berry speaks, an orderly wheels past a covered body on a 
stretcher. Dave sees this, then looks back at the detectives.

DAVE
If you say so.

Berry and Bullock head back into the hallway...

I would ve come sooner, but I burned 
the first batch, and I wasn t sure 
you d appreciate the irony.

REVEAL MIKE who s munching on a cookie.

MIKE
I m so hungry I wouldn t have noticed.

So can I get a kiss with my cookie?

Mike starts to pull her toward him. She backs away.

She squeezes his hand and heads out. As she goes:

She laughs and exits.

By the way, your son made you a get-

MIKE
Well, technically I only tried to save 
him. But you don t need to tell MJ 
that. 

As Mike smiles, Susan spots the cookies on the bedside table.

SUSAN
Ooo, those cookies look good. Who 
brought them?

MIKE
Oh... just a friend. Have one.

SUSAN
No, they re yours. I shouldn t.

MIKE
Susan, you know you want one.

SUSAN
Well, I did just give blood.

Susan snatches a cookie and bites into it. She chews for a 
beat, then makes a face and SPITS something out.

MIKE
Attractive.

SUSAN
I hate macadamia nuts. You think 
they re white chocolate chips until 
it s too late. Who would taunt people

Orson lets out another snore, this one even louder and

Occasionally, but never quite this... 

Orson lets out another loud snore.

The injury to his septum might have

back. You should be thrilled.

GABRIELLE
I am. It s just... Carlos has been 
through so much these past five 
years -- losing his sight, his career, 
his independence -- and he never 
complained. He deserves to open his 
eyes to a wife who doesn t tuck her 
boobs into her pants.

look like you.

FADE IN:

INT. BREE S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (DAY 2)2424

Orson, in robe and pajamas, a bandage on his nose, comes down 
the stairs and sees a tired, cranky Bree stripping the 
bedding off the couch, which she s clearly slept on.

ORSON
Why are you sleeping on the couch? I 
thought you said it was uncomfortable.

BREE
It is. Sit down. We have to talk.

Orson crosses and sits.

ORSON
What s wrong?

BREE
Orson, dear, because of the way your 
nose was broken during the fire, you 
now... snore.

ORSON
Didn t I snore before?

BREE
Good point. Snoring is too mild a word 
for what you re doing. Imagine a 
terrified elephant summoning his herd.  
Now imagine him doing it every six 
seconds. Now imagine that elephant s 
wife dying from lack of sleep.

ORSON
You know, Bree, I can t help but take 
issue with your sarcastic tone. 
Snoring is not something I can help.

BREE
Not exactly true. The doctor said 
there s a simple procedure to correct 
this. Once we schedule that, I m sure 
my sarcasm will...
(yawning)
... vanish in no time.

Procedure? Do you mean surgery?

BREE

ORSON
It is to me! I had an uncle and second 
cousin die during routine operations 
because they were allergic to 
anesthesia. Given that family history, 
I m not risking surgery, especially 
for something as trivial as a snoring 
problem.

BREE
It s not trivial! This is a busy time 
for me. I have events to do, book 
signings, that cooking demonstration 
at the mall. If I don t get my rest it 
could affect the launch of my book.

ORSON
You re saying I should risk my life to 
boost your book sales?

BREE
Don t be so melodramatic.

ORSON
No, no, it seems perfectly reasonable. 
You get to be a best-selling author, I 
get to be an organ donor.

BREE
Orson, I need you to do this.

ORSON
No, Bree. I m not going under the 
knife. And that s final.

BREE
I see.
(then)
Do you have any problem going to a 
chiropractor?

ORSON
No. Why would I go to a chiropractor?

percent. And we are broke. 

DR. BACH
You know what? The hospital has a 
foundation to help people in this 
exact situation.

GABRIELLE
No! We don't accept charity.

CARLOS
Gaby, we always accept charity.

GABRIELLE
Yeah, well, I've turned over a new 
leaf. Sorry about the timing, Carlos, 
but it is what it is.

You want honesty? Fine. You never

really bad patch after the accident, 
but you never stopped loving him. And 
why would you? The relationship didn t

not mad at me or Mike or Katherine -- 
you re mad at yourself for letting 
your marriage fall apart!

That was very harsh. I haven t had

Bree stops for a moment, overcome with emotion. Then, quickly 
pulling herself back together --

Bree starts awake. 

BREE
Oh, excuse me.

Why don t you put the eggs in the

DENISE
Sure. And my name s Denise.

Denise carefully cracks the eggs and deposits the eggs in the 
blender. As she does so, Bree tries to remember her thread.

BREE
So where was I...?

Oh, right. So he swears to me he doesn t

upwards, splattering Bree s sweater.

DENISE
You have to put the lid on!

BREE
Okay, you know what? You re done. Sit. 
Write your own cookbook. 

Denise goes to her mother, who glares at Bree. Bree pours the 
mixture from the blender to a bowl.

BREE (CONT'D)
I m sorry, but she s been mouthing off 
to me this whole time.

There. We ll just mix it in the bowl.

On the audience, staring slackjawed. One father is avidly 
FILMING it with a home video camera.

ORSON
Bree!

He gestures to his own chest. Bree gets it, looks down and 
sees her exposed bust. This strikes her as very funny. 

BREE
Oops!

She throws her head back and laughs. The laugh slowly falls 
silent but her head remains tilted back.

A moment. Then she gently snores.

Debby approaches.

Did I ever tell you when I knew I was

I assume it was when you saw me on the 
runway.

CARLOS
No. That was when I knew I was going 
to sleep with you. I knew I was going 
to marry you the night we went to that 
restaurant on Third Street. You were 
wearing a white linen sundress and 
your make-up was perfect... and you 
ordered ribs. You ate them with your 
hands, sauce all over your face, hunks 
of meat in your teeth. And when the 
waiter stared at you, you said,  I 
don t care how I look. I love these 
ribs.  Well... Gaby, I don t care how

INT. DOCTOR S OFFICE - DAY (DAY 4)4646

Orson and Bree are seated. The doctor enters and crosses to 
his desk. He sits.

DR. STANLEY
So what can I do for you?

BREE
My husband has agreed to get that 
procedure you suggested. 

DR. STANLEY
The one to alleviate his snoring?

BREE
Yes, that s the one. So anytime you 
want to get inside his throat and 
start hacking away, he s ready for 
you.

ORSON
(strained smile)
Yes, dear.

DR. STANLEY
How is two weeks from Friday?

BREE
Fridays are when Orson plays golf. So 
we should absolutely do it on a 
Friday. Sound good, Orson?

ORSON
(strained smile)
Sounds fine.

DR. STANLEY
I m sorry, Mr. Hodge. I m sensing 
you re a bit apprehensive about the 
surgery.

Oh, he s not apprehensive. He s 
terrified.

one. Don t you, darling?

ORSON

Yes, Bree.

DR. STANLEY
I m sorry. What s going on here?

BREE
Are you married, Dr. Stanley?

DR. STANLEY
No. But I just started living with 
someone.

BREE
Well, once you ve been with them a 
long time you ll see that there s a 
balance of power in relationships. And  
if your beloved ever pulls a nasty, 
nasty trick on you, like, say drugging 
into you into a stupor, the balance of 
power shifts to you. And then you can 
demand they prove their love. Let s 
say by, undergoing elective surgery. 
Do you understand?

DR. STANLEY
Not really.

BREE
Don t worry. You will. Come along, 
Orson.

ORSON
Yes, dear.

Bree rises and exits. Orson follows her. He gives one last 
look of misery back to the doctor as he does. Dr. Stanley 
picks up the phone and dials.
