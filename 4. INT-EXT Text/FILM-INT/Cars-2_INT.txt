--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone
lifts him up, routine.
RAMONE
Hey. How far'd you make it this
time, Otis?
OTIS
Halfway to the county line.
RAMONE
Not bad, man.
OTIS
I know, I can't believe it either!
CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
Cup."
MATER
Wow. I can't believe they renamed
the Piston Cup after our very own
Doc Hudson.
McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
MCQUEEN
I know Doc said these things were
just old cups, but to have someone
else win it just didn't feel right,
you know?
MATER
Well, Doc would've been real proud
of you. That's for sure.
McQueen takes this in.
The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.
12.
MATER
Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir?
Mater proudly shows off a dent.
MATER
This new dent!
MCQUEEN
Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...
MATER
Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
you see what I got planned for
tonight.
MCQUEEN
Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
thinking of just a quiet dinner.
MATER
That's exactly what I was thinking.
MCQUEEN
No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
MATER
Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
going out for supper.
McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
MCQUEEN
Mater, I meant it would be just me
and Sally.
MATER
Oh.
MCQUEEN
It's just for tonight. We'll do
whatever you want tomorrow.
MATER
(DISAPPOINTED)
Okay.
MCQUEEN
Thanks for understanding.
MATER
Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
fun now.
13.
MCQUEEN
Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!
McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
LUIGI
Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
Let's go!
MCQUEEN
(IMPRESSED)
Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
remember: best behavior.
MATER
You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
that?
He sees something, peels away.
MCQUEEN
Mater!
LEWIS HAMILTON
Hey, McQueen, over here!
22.
It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
now has no choice but to let Mater go.
MCQUEEN
Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
CUT TO:
MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
his hook.
MATER
Hey! You done good! You got all the
leaves!
People turn at the noise he's making.
CUT BACK TO:
MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
JEFF GORVETTE
Check out that tow truck.
LEWIS HAMILTON
I wonder who that guy's with?
MCQUEEN
Will you guys excuse me just for
one little second?
He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
MCQUEEN
Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
Springs.
MATER
You're just realizing that? Boy,
that jet-lag really done a number
on you.
MCQUEEN
Mater, look -- things are different
over here. Which means maybe you
should, you know, act a little
different too.
MATER
Different than what?
MCQUEEN
Well, just... help me out here,
buddy. I ---
23.
MATER
You need help? Shoot, why didn't
you just say so? That's what a tow
truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
Mr. San Francisco!
FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
MATER
I'll introduce you.
MCQUEEN
Mater, no.
MATER
(already on his way)
Look at me -- I'm helping you
already!
On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
MATER
Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
to meet ---
FRANCESCO
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
MCQUEEN
Nice to meet you, Francesco.
FRANCESCO
Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
very good-looking. Not as good as I
thought, but you're good.
MATER
(TO FRANCESCO)
Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
you?
FRANCESCO
Anything for McQueen's friend.
As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
MATER
Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
sees this. She's Lightning
McQueen's girlfriend.
FRANCESCO
Oooh.
24.
MATER
She's a big fan of yours.
FRANCESCO
Hey, she has good taste.
MCQUEEN
Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
MATER
You're right. She's a huge fan. She
goes on and on about your open
wheels here.
MCQUEEN
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going "on and on."
FRANCESCO
Francesco is familiar with this
reaction to Francesco. Women
respect a car that has nothing to
hide.
MCQUEEN
Yeah, uh...
FRANCESCO
Let us have a toast.
McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
MCQUEEN
Let's.
FRANCESCO
(raising a drink)
I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
Miss Sally.
MCQUEEN
Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
win tomorrow to her. So if we both
do it, it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.
MATER
I'll go get you one. You mind if I
borrow a few bucks for one of them
drinks?
25.
MCQUEEN
(could kill him)
They're free, Mater.
MATER
Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
here?
Mater ZIPS OFF.
MCQUEEN
I should probably go keep an eye on
him. See you at the race.
McQueen starts to leave.
FRANCESCO
Yes, you will see Francesco. But
not like this.
Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
FRANCESCO
You will see him like this, as he
drives away from you.
Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
MCQUEEN
That's cute. So you had one of
those made up for all the racers?
FRANCESCO
No.
MCQUEEN
Okay.
He rolls off.
MCQUEEN
He is so getting beat tomorrow.
Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.
VOICE
Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
Axlerod!
MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
26.
MILES AXLEROD
It is my absolute honor to
introduce to you the competitors in
the first-ever World Grand Prix.
From Brazil. Number eight...
ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
--- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
HOLLEY
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.
FINN
That's because it's air-cooled.
HOLLEY
I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
have a message from London.
FINN
Not here.
(LOUDLY)
You must try the canapes on the
mezzanine!
He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.
IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.
FINN
So the lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent? What did they learn about
the camera?
HOLLEY
It appears to be a standard
television camera. They said if you
could get closer photos next time,
that would be great.
FINN
This was London's message?
27.
HOLLEY
Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
platforms you were on? Turns out
they're sitting on the biggest oil
reserve in the world.
FINN
How did we miss that?
HOLLEY
They'd been scrambling everyone's
satellites. The Americans actually
discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform, under deep cover. He was
able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.
The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
FINN
Who is it? Has anyone seen the
photo yet?
HOLLEY
No, not yet. The American is here
tonight to pass it to you. He'll
signal you when he's ready.
FINN
GOOD ---
Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.
FINN
Oh no.
Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
Holley follows suit.
HOLLEY
What is it?
FINN
Change of plan. You're meeting the
American.
HOLLEY
What, me?
28.
FINN
Those thugs down there were on the
oil platform. If they see me, the
whole mission is compromised.
HOLLEY
No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
agent.
FINN
You are now.
CUT TO:
MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
MATER
I'll take one of them.
He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
assortment of drinks balanced.
MATER
Never know which one McQueen'll
have a hankering for.
He approaches a sushi bar.
MATER
Hey, what you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?
He refers to wasabi, of course.
SUSHI CHEF
No, no. Wasabi.
MATER
Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
with you? That looks delicious.
The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
MATER
Uh, a little more, please.
It is free, right?
(the chef adds more)
Keep it coming. A little more. Come
on, let's go, it's free! You're
getting there... Scoop scoop!
The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.
29.
MATER
There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
ice cream.
SUSHI CHEF
(in Japanese, subtitles)
My condolences.
CUT BACK TO:
MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.
MILES AXLEROD
... and now, our last competitor ---
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
MCQUEEN
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
to racing. This is a great
opportunity.
MILES AXLEROD
Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
Lightning. You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism to
this competition.
As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
MATER
Somebody get me water!
He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
MATER
(LAPPING WATER)
Sweet relief...
Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.
MATER
(to the crowd)
Whatever you do, do not eat the
free pistachio ice cream. It has
turned!
MCQUEEN
Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
Mater.
30.
MILES AXLEROD
I know him. This is the bloke that
called into the television show.
(TO MATER)
You're the one I have to thank.
MATER
No, thank you. This trip's been
amazing.
MILES AXLEROD
(TO MCQUEEN)
He's a little excited, isn't he?
TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
MCQUEEN
Mater!
MATER
But wait, I... oh, shoot.
McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
MCQUEEN
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene.
MATER
But I never leak oil. Never.
MCQUEEN
Go take care of yourself right now.
Mater drives off.
ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER
He drives through the party, frantic.
MATER
Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
you. I gotta go!
Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the
CORNER ---
--- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,
neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.
31.
MATER
(CONFUSED)
What the...
Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater
zips out.
MATER
Sorry ladies!
He heads into the other door ---
CUT TO:
Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.
MATER
I never leak I never leak I never
leak...
He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.
IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
MATER
Wowee...
The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
if he's going to get an oil change.
MATER
What in the---
A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
MATER
(GIGGLING)
Hey, that tickles.
The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
freaks out.
OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,
clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.
32.
ROD REDLINE
Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's
time for the drop.
HOLLEY, rolls along by herself. Nervous. DING! Her rearview
monitor springs to life.
HOLLEY (INTO RADIO)
The American has activated his
tracking beacon.
FINN (OVER RADIO)
Roger that. Move in.
Rod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him.
GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see
Rod Redline.
Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is
suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a
shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS
FIGHT begins ---
IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as
if in a car wash. He is helpless.
OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he
scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.
IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he
backs out ---
--- Rod Redline is THROWN INTO MATER'S STALL DOOR, crunching
it and sending Mater ---
--- BACK INTO THE CLUTCHES of the insane toilet.
Holley isolates the tracking beacon's location in the party.
HOLLEY
Oh, you've got to be joking.
FINN
What's the problem, Shiftwell?
HOLLEY
He's in the loo.
33.
FINN
So go in!
HOLLEY
I can't just go into the men's loo.
FINN
Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.
Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of
concern. He's in trouble here.
ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts
into DRIVE ---
--- MATER'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN, knocking ACER out. Mater
jumps out, face-to-face GREM.
MATER
(out of breath)
Whatever you do, I would not go in
there.
The door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer.
MATER
A Gremlin and a Pacer!
Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity
here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE.
MATER
(to Grem and Acer)
No offense to your makes and
models, but you guys break down
harder than my cousin Betsy after
she got left at the ---
Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's
undercarriage.
MATER
(as he's goosed)
--- altar!
He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.
MATER
Are you okay?
ROD REDLINE
I'm fine.
34.
GREM
Hey. Tow truck.
Mater turns back to Grem and Acer.
GREM
We'd like to get to our private
business here, if you don't mind.
MATER
Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the
way of your "private business."
Oh! A little advice: When you hear
her giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.
GREM
Thank you.
MATER
It's to adjust the temperature.
ACER
Got it.
MATER
Remember it's in Celsius, not
Fahrenheit.
GREM AND ACER
Get outta here!
MATER
Alright then.
Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem
and Acer.
Mater returns to his team, lost in thought.
MCQUEEN
There you are. Where have you been?
MATER
What's a rendezvous?
LUIGI
It's like a date.
MATER
A date?!
MCQUEEN
Mater, what's going on?
MATER
Well, what's going on is I've got
me a date tomorrow.
Guido makes a crack in Italian.
LUIGI
Guido don't believe you.
MATER
Well, believe it. My new girlfriend
just said so. Hey, there she is.
Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot.
37.
MATER
(YELLING)
Hey! Hey lady!
Holley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF.
MATER
See ya tomorrow!
Guido makes another crack in Italian.
LUIGI
Guido still don't believe you.
Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up,
clings to consciousness.
GREM (O.S.)
I gotta admit ---
Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look
up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers.
GREM
--- you tricked us real good.
ACER
And we don't like being tricked.
Rod Redline laughs to himself.
ACER
Hey, what's so funny?
ROD REDLINE
Well, you know, I was just wearing
a disguise. You guys are stuck
looking like that.
This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock
him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied
with Allinol brand gasoline.
ROD REDLINE
Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
this stuff is good for you.
38.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.)
So you think.
The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Allinol by itself is good for you.
Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
spinning at a high rate of speed.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
But after microscopic examination,
I have found that it has one small
weakness. When hit with an
electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
extremely dangerous.
GREM
SMILE ---
Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that
was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod
Redline.
GREM
--- for the camera.
ROD REDLINE
Is that all you want? I got a whole
act.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
You were very interested in this
camera on the oil platform. Now you
will witness what it really does.
ROD REDLINE
Whatever you say, Professor.
Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
recording him there.
ACER
You talked up a lot of cars last
night. Which one's your associate?
ROD REDLINE
Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
was your sister. You know, I can't
tell them apart these days.
39.
GREM
(HAD ENOUGH)
Could I start it now, Professor?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Fifty percent power.
(to Rod Redline)
This camera is actually an
electromagnetic pulse emitter.
ACER
(re: a girl on the TV)
What about her? Did you give it to
her?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
The Allinol is now heating to a
boil, dramatically expanding,
causing the engine block to crack
under the stress, forcing oil into
the combustion chamber.
Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.
ACER
(re: a guy on the TV)
How about him? You talk to him?
ROD REDLINE
(to Professor Zundapp)
What do I care? I can replace an
engine block.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
You may be able to, but after full
impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.
ACER
How about him? Does he have it?
The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and
down the hall.
Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the
room could have ---
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
That's him. He's the one.
GREM
Roger that, Professor Z.
40.
ROD REDLINE
No!
As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
call.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (INTO PHONE)
Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
has passed along sensitive
information.
(beat, listening)
I will take care of it before any
damage can be done.
The Professor hangs up, turns to the room.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
The project is still on schedule.
You will find this second agent ---
Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
--- and kill him.
On the MONITOR - With Mater's frozen image on the screen we
see Rod EXPLODE in the reflection.
--- McQueen's SMILING FACE, on a Team McQueen poster.
REVERSE to reveal Mater looking at it, sadly. He drives on,
passing (but not noticing) ---
--- GREM and ACER.
AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their
tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line.
A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
SECURITY CAR
(in Japanese and English)
Come with me please, sir.
MATER
But I'm gonna miss my plane.
IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car
leads Mater inside.
SECURITY CAR
Right this way.
As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL
BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then
sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,
revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.
IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
Mater follows the Security Car in, nervous.
55.
MATER
Doggone it. This is about my hook,
isn't it? I know I should've
checked it, but I can't really,
look -- it's attached to me.
ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,
reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
MATER
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.
FINN
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British
Intelligence.
MATER
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
FINN
Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
MATER
Let's just say I'm triple-A
affiliated. You know, I know some
karate. I don't wanna brag or
nothing, but I've got me a black
fan belt.
BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem
and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around
the corner.
MATER
Hey, you wanna see some moves I
made up?
FINN
You're being followed.
Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
round hole.
MATER
This first one I can reach into a
car's hood, pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he
stalls. I call it, "What I
accidentally did to my friend Luigi
once."
56.
Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem
turn the corner.
GREM
There he is!
The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
MATER
(eyes the clock)
Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
about to miss my flight.
FINN
Don't worry.
Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---
FINN
I've taken care of that. Hang on.
--- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW!
CLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish
scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice
O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE
into McQueen's voice.
59.
MCQUEEN
"I'm so sorry for what I did. I
don't want to be the cause of you
losing any more races. I want you
to go prove to the world what I
already know - that you are the
greatest race car in the whole wide
world. Your best friend, Mater."
McQueen takes this in.
MCQUEEN
I didn't really want him to leave.
LUIGI
Wait, there's more here.
(READS)
"P.S. Please tell the hotel I
didn't mean to order that movie. I
thought it was just a preview and I
didn't realize I was paying for it.
P.P.S... That's funny right there --
PP."
(to the others)
There's a few more pages of P.S.'s
here.
MCQUEEN
(TURNING BACK)
Well, at least I know if he's at
home he'll be safe.
A well-appointed spy jet. Various computers line the walls.
FINN
Now that's how I like to start the
day! You never feel more alive than
when you're almost dead.
HOLLEY
(SCANNING MATER)
I hope that device didn't fall off.
MATER
That's the closest I ever been to
missing my flight! That was ---
60.
With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod
Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.
MATER
(JUMPS)
Yow!
HOLLEY
Still in one piece, great.
Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts
"ANALYZING."
MATER
I gotta go to a doctor. I keep
getting these sharp pains in my
undercarriage.
HOLLEY
Downloading the photo now.
MATER
Hey, lemme introduce you two.
(TO HOLLEY)
This here is Finn McSomething-or-
other. He's a First Class VIP
airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
this here's my date.
(TO HOLLEY)
I never did get your name.
HOLLEY
Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.
MATER
(TO FINN)
It's Shiftwell. Holley ---
DING! The computer is done analyzing. The cabin lights dim.
FINN
Finally. Time to see who's behind
all this.
AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a
photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck
together.
HOLLEY
(to Mater, expectantly)
What is this?
61.
MATER
Well, that's one of the worst
engines ever made. It's an old
aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what. Them ain't metric,
they ain't inches...
HOLLEY
Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is
this, Mater?
MATER
Well, it's kinda hard to tell from
this picture, ain't it?
HOLLEY
But you're the one who took it.
FINN
Holley.
HOLLEY
Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good
agent gets what he can, then gets
out before he's killed." Sorry.
MATER
Agent? You mean like insurance
agent, like,
(SINGS)
`Like a good neighbor, Mater is
there'? Wait, you mean secret
agents. You guys is spies!
FINN
Holley, in how many makes and
models did this type of engine
appear?
Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
HOLLEY
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period. At least
35,000 cars were made with this
engine.
Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the
hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.
MATER
You're pretty.
62.
HOLLEY
(ANNOYED)
Yes, alright. Thank you.
MATER
And so nice.
HOLLEY
Just pay attention.
She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again.
FINN
This seems like a dead end. If
there were something in the photo
that could narrow this down a bit
I'd be a lot happier.
MATER
You might not be happy, but I bet
this feller is. See how he's had
most of his parts replaced? And see
all them boxes over there? Them's
all original parts. They ain't easy
to come by.
HOLLEY
Rare parts.
FINN
That's something we can track.
HOLLEY
Exactly!
Holley drops her screen down.
FINN
Well done, Mater! I would never
have seen that.
(TO HOLLEY)
I know of a black-market parts
dealer in Paris, a treacherous
lowlife. But, he's the only car in
the world who can tell us whose
engine this is. Mater, what would
you say to setting up an informal
task force on this one?
MATER
Wait, what?
63.
FINN
You obviously have plenty of
experience in the field.
MATER
Well yeah I live right next to one.
(thinks about it)
I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly
been much help to anybody recently.
FINN
You're helping me. Please, Mater.
MATER
Well, okay. But you know I'm just a
tow truck, right?
FINN
Right. And I'm just in the
import/export business. Siddeley?
SIDDELEY
Yes, Finn?
FINN
Paris. Tout de suite.
MATER
Yeah, two of them sweets for me
too, Sid!
(TO HOLLEY)
You know, I always wanted to be a
spy.
HOLLEY
(SMILING SWEETLY)
Really? Me too.
SIDDELEY
Afterburners, sir?
FINN
Is there any other way?
Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened
stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
MATER
Excuse me. What are you selling?
It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In
French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater
FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY
A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking
for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.
In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer,
argues with a French customer.
FINN
There you are.
Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
MATER
Man, there are some great ---
FINN
Mater, get back!
Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in
a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
MATER
Hey, wait for me!
Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley
quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
66.
Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground
TO ---
--- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to
grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER,
rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.
Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives,
stops her.
FINN
(TO HOLLEY)
Have you lost your mind?!
HOLLEY
But I thought ---
FINN
Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
him up.
MATER
Sure thing.
CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley.
TOMBER
You rusty piece of junk, get your
dirty hook off me!
Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches.
FINN
(to the cars)
Allez! Maintenant - vite!
Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls
the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT ---
TOMBER
(TO FINN)
Electroshock! Are you kidding me??
FINN
Easy, Tomber. This is her first
field assignment - she didn't know
you were my informant.
HOLLEY
Informant?
67.
TOMBER
A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
smell.
Holley FUMES with anger.
FINN
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
Moroccan impound the first time I
saved him, if I recall correctly.
TOMBER
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage aren't you,
Finn?
HOLLEY
Alright, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old. So.
Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of
Tomber.
HOLLEY
There you go, informant. Inform us.
Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
TOMBER
That is the worst motor ever made.
Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
TOMBER
Wait. That oil filter... those
wheel bearings.
FINN
Do those parts look familiar,
Tomber?
TOMBER
They should. I sold them.
HOLLEY
To whom?
TOMBER
No idea. He's my best customer, but
he always does his business over
the phone. I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts. Now I
know.
68.
MATER
Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
nothing truer than that.
FINN
"Lemon?"
MATER
Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
ever work right. Lemons is a tow
truck's bread and butter. Like them
Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
the party and the race and the
airport.
FINN
Holley, pull up the pictures from
the oil platform. I want to know
what other type of cars were out
there.
Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
HOLLEY
Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
And Trunkovs.
FINN
Mater, are these cars considered
lemons?
MATER
Is the Popemobile Catholic?
HOLLEY
Finn. Everyone involved in this
plot is one of history's biggest
loser cars.
Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as
the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.
FINN
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.
TOMBER
This explains it!
FINN
What, Tomber?
69.
TOMBER
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
never get together. But they're
having a secret meeting in two
days.
FINN
Where's this meeting taking place?
TOMBER
Porto Corsa, Italy.
MATER
That's where the next race is!
FINN
Then there's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there too.
TOMBER
Your chances are more than good. I
just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday... to Porto Corsa.
FINN
Holley, contact Stephenson and have
him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
work.
Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style
photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front
train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and
intelligence command center.
MATER
You never see this many lemons in
one town. Unless there's a swap
meet, or something.
(TO HOLLEY)
(MORE)
70.
MATER (CONT'D)
Hey, how'd you get all them
pictures?
HOLLEY
Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto
Corsa's red light cameras to do
recognition scans.
MATER
Wow, not only is you the prettiest
car I ever met, but you the
smartest too.
HOLLEY
Thank you. I think.
MATER
That's a familiar sight.
Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead,
being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.
MATER
A Hugo being towed. But he looks
absolutely perfect.
FINN
Of course. They must be the heads
of the lemon families.
MATER
Makes sense. If I was rich and
broke down every day, I'd hire me
to tow me around all the time too.
FINN
We've got to infiltrate that
meeting. It's the only way to find
out who's behind all this.
HOLLEY
(EYEING MATER)
Hang on a minute.
MATER
What?
HOLLEY
Hold still.
Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
MATER
Ahh!
71.
Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on
screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.
FINN
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or
how pleased it makes her.
HOLLEY
Thank you, Finn.
MATER
Boy, I sure wish my friends could
see me now.
Stephenson glides along, all business.
STEPHENSON
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
FINN
Thank you, Stephenson.
Finn watches as HOLLEY attaches a new EMERGENCY LIGHT on
Mater's roof. It looks exactly like his old one.
HOLLEY
That should just about do it.
FINN
Perfect.
HOLLEY
So Mater, it's voice-activated. But
you know, everything's voice-
activated these days.
75.
MATER
What? I thought you was supposed to
be making me a disguise.
MATER'S COMPUTER
Voice recognized. Disguise Program
Initiated.
ZWWWWAT! A HOLOGRAPHIC disguise suddenly umbrellas out,
emitted from Mater's roof. It drops a clean cloaking image of
the EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK over Mater.
MATER
Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a
German truck!
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
ZWATTTT! Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat.
MATER
Check it out. I'm wearing
Materhosen. Make me a monster
truck!
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs.
MATER
(ALA DRACULA)
I vant to siphon your gas. Now make
me a taco truck!
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
MATER
A funny car!
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
Finn suddenly pushes a button, stops the madness.
FINN
The idea is to keep a low profile,
Mater.
Mater, chastened, moves on.
76.
MATER
So I just go in, pretend to be this
truck.
FINN
And leave the rest to us.
HOLLEY
Now hold still.
Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is
larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to
fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:
HOLLEY
I have to do the final fitting on
your disguise.
Holley STOPS. The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame,
but dents SHOW THROUGH.
HOLLEY
Oh dear. That's no good.
She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm, moves it toward
one of Mater's DENTS. Mater pulls away.
MATER
Hey, what are you doing?
HOLLEY
The disguise won't calibrate
effectively without a smooth
surface to graft onto.
MATER
Oh. For a second there I thought
you was trying to fix my dents.
HOLLEY
I was.
MATER
Well then no thank you. I don't get
them dents buffed, pulled, filled
or painted by nobody. They're way
too valuable.
HOLLEY
Your dents are valuable?
MATER
I come by each one of them with my
best friend Lightning McQueen.
(MORE)
77.
MATER (CONT'D)
I don't fix these. I want to
remember these dents forever.
HOLLEY
So you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your
cover?
FINN
Friendships can be dangerous in our
line of work, Mater.
MATER
But my line of work is towing and
salvage.
FINN
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is
designing iPhone apps.
MATER
No, I meant for real. I ---
HOLLEY
It's okay. Say no more. I'll work
around the dent.
FINN
In the meantime...
Finn hits a button. The walls transform into a MASSIVE
WEAPONS CACHE.
FINN
You look a little light on weapons.
Off Mater's RXN ---
Cars play craps with FUZZY DICE; slot machines with odometers
for jackpot numbers; cigarette girls sell car items.
CIGARETTE GIRL CAR
Air Freshener, antenna balls,
sparkplugs...
ON MATER - He tows VICTOR. They are flanked on all four
corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The
largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater
out of his funk.
MATER
(WIDE-EYED)
Wow, this place looks like it's
made out of gold.
The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
That's because it is, Mater. Now,
be careful what you say.
MATER
Why is that? What do you mean don't
talk to you?
(more talking from Holley
which we cannot hear)
So you want me to stop talking to
you. Right now?
ALEXANDER HUGO
You are acting strange today, Ivan.
MATER
I have no idea what you're talking
about...
MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and
starts to scroll reams of information alongside.
MATER
...Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop
Alex."
IN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all
but Mater. Some of Alex's other alias' include "Alexander Hu-
Don't Go" and "Alexander the Not-So Great."
85.
MATER
Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But I guess that makes sense
seeings how you's wanted in France,
Germany, the Czech Republic...
HOLLEY
(cutting in to his
DISPLAY)
Mater! Stop it!
Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to
Mater as they turn a corner.
ALEXANDER HUGO
Okay, okay. Keep your voice down.
You're gonna make me arrested.
(to the other Hugos)
Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in
a bad mood.
Mater tows Victor inside a private room, where inside are the
WORLD'S WORST CARS including VLADMIR TRUNKOV, TUBBS PACER and
J. CURBY GREMLIN.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Victor!
TUBBS PACER
Hey, Victor!
J. CURBY GREMLIN
There you are.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Come in, come in.
J. CURBY GREMLIN
Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin,
from Detroit. It's good to see you.
Now we can start.
VICTOR HUGO
Is the big boss here yet?
86.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
No, not yet.
TUBBS PACER
He's supposed to be here any
minute.
WHAM! A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns, now silent.
ON THE DOOR - It sits open. No one enters.
The room of Lemons watch, nervous.
ON MATER - Nervously watching too.
A car finally appears. It's Zundapp.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Guten Tag!
Everyone looks disappointed.
TUBBS PACER
It's just the Professor.
VICTOR HUGO
Zundapp, when is he coming?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
He's already here.
MONITORS descend from the ceiling. On them, an image of AN
ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo. But this is a
LIVE image. The car is being worked on.
VOICE
Welcome, everyone.
The VOICE is garbled, scrambled. No way to determine who.
ENGINE VOICE
I wish I could be with you on this
very special day but... my clutch
assembly broke. You know how it is.
The Lemons all nod in understanding.
87.
TUBBS PACER
Been there.
J. CURBY GREMLIN
Forget about it.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
We know how you feel.
ENGINE VOICE
We are here to celebrate. Today all
your hard work pays off. The world
turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts. The only
thing they haven't stopped doing is
laughing at us. They've called us
terrible names...
On VICTOR HUGO.
ENGINE VOICE
Jalopy. Rustbucket.
On TUBBS PACER.
ENGINE VOICE
Heap. Clunker.
On J. CURBY GREMLIN:
ENGINE VOICE
Junker, beater, wreck.
On ZUNDAPP.
ENGINE VOICE
Rattletrap.
And finally back on the monitor. The ENGINE.
88.
ENGINE VOICE
Lemon. But their insults just give
us strength. Because today, my
friends...
The monitors switch to LIVE RACE FOOTAGE.
ENGINE VOICE
...that all ends.
On the VIDEO SCREENS - CARLA VELOSO'S ENGINE BLOWS ---
The lemons are CHEERING. Mater is freaked out.
ENGINE VOICE
They laughed at us. But now it's
our turn to laugh back.
BOOM! Another racer blows an engine. Mater JUMPS again.
The video screens are now filled with ONE IMAGE - of the OIL
PLATFORMS in the Pacific from the beginning of the movie.
90.
ENGINE VOICE
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve, will
become the most powerful cars in
the world!
ENGINE VOICE
They will come to us and they will
have no choice, `cause they will
need us.
ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of
him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins ---
Suddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air!
He looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him.
ACER
(TO FINN)
We figured you might stop by.
ENGINE VOICE (V.O.)
And they will finally respect us.
So hold your hoods high. After
today you will never again be
ashamed of who you are!
Grem and Acer turn back to the camera. They line up Shu
Todoroki, who's a bit further along now.
FINN
No!
ENGINE VOICE
Long live Lemons!
91.
The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons!" Mater,
scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO.
ALEXANDER HUGO
Isn't this a great party, Ivan?
MATER
Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.
ALEXANDER HUGO
You are not leaving, are you?
MATER
Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.
MCQUEEN (O.S.)
I'm just in shock like everybody...
MATER
McQueen?
He turns, sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the
monitors.
MCQUEEN (ON TV)
Crashes are part of racing, I know.
But something like that shouldn't
ever happen.
94.
DARRELL CARTRIP (ON TV)
They're letting you choose your
fuel for the final race. Do you
have any idea what it's going to
be?
MCQUEEN (ON TV)
Allinol.
The excitement suddenly DRAINS from the room.
LEMONHEADS
- What?! - Did he just say
Allinol? After today?
MCQUEEN (ON TV)
My friend Fillmore says the fuel's
safe. That's good enough for me. I
didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently. I'm not gonna make the
same mistake twice.
On Mater. He takes this in.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV)
So a surprising revelation from
Lightning McQueen...
Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who,
based on his angry O.S. voice, sounds ticked off.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Yes, sir. Of course.
Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed.
Mater's eyes open wide.
MATER
No!
Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of
the monitors. ZZZZZAT! His holographic disguise flickers away
then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises,
finally revealing rusty old Mater.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
It's the American spy!
95.
The thugs DRAW TERRIFYING WEAPONS.
MATER
Dadgum.
MATER'S COMPUTER
"Gatling gun" request acknowledged.
WHIRRRRR! GUNS roll out of Mater on each side.
MATER
Shoot. I didn't mean ---
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
Mater SPRAYS BULLETS into the crowd.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Get down!
MATER
Whoa!!
The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---
Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back
through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
MATER
Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind
of shoot!
MATER'S COMPUTER
Correction acknowledged. Deploying
chute.
WHOOM! A PARACHUTE BURSTS out of the back of Mater, he
catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!
The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.
ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks
around, notices:
LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.
MATER
McQueen!
Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots
a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind
the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.
96.
ITALIAN MOTORBOAT
Aspetti!
The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him.
Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down
through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the
ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---
--- a barricade. Separating the press from the public,
ITALIAN SECURITY TRUCKS stand guard.
MATER
Lemme through! Lemme through!
MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco
memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off
him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
MATER
(TO SECURITY)
You gotta let me in! I gotta get
through to warn McQueen!
Security eyes one another. This is serious.
ITALIAN SECURITY #1
You cannot come through here. Back
up, signore.
ITALIAN SECURITY #2
(into a walkie-talkie)
We have a lunatic at Gate Nove.
MATER
No, listen! I was disguised as a
tow truck to infiltrate this
Lemonhead meeting and my weapons
system misinterperated what I was
SAYING ---
ITALIAN SECURITY #2
I repeat. Lunatic at Gate Nove.
Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.
MATER
McQueen! McQueen!
JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit.
PRESS LIAISON
Right this way, signore.
97.
MATER (O.S.)
(DISTANT)
McQueen!
MCQUEEN
Mater?
McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES,
flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite
antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running
back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
MATER
McQueen!
ITALIAN SECURITY #1
Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop!
Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---
ITALIAN SECURITY #1
Oy! Stop! Ferma li!
IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far
in the back.
MATER
McQueen!
ON MCQUEEN
MCQUEEN
That really sounded like Mater.
Mater?
PRESS LIAISON
(TO MCQUEEN)
Signore...
ON MATER, getting CLOSER...
MATER
McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!
ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but
where is he?
MCQUEEN
Mater?!
McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward
him, "Jaws"-like.
98.
MCQUEEN
Excuse me.
McQueen disappears into the press crowd.
PRESS LIAISON
No, no, where are you going?
Please, Mr. McQueen!
McQueen pushes through the press.
MCQUEEN
Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through
the last few vehicles ---
MCQUEEN
Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
so sorr ---
It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
MCQUEEN
(CONFUSED)
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
killed out there today." You're
the best.
MCQUEEN
What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
PRESS LIAISON
Right this way, signore ---
Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen
back in the other direction ---
MCQUEEN
(as he's pulled away)
I really thought I heard my friend.
As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come
between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
99.
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
(TO MCQUEEN)
In England you'll be finished. At
the finish line.
Ivan is now obscured again.
MCQUEEN
Wait, what?
The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
PRESS LIAISON
Please, the world press is waiting.
You come with me, please.
McQueen is pulled back ---
--- to the GONG of a CLOCK.
CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.
102.
All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED
CLOCKWORK.
HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in
the divots of large clock movements.
MATER
Holley! Finn! Where are we?
FINN
We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
Bentley.
Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---
--- whirring, scary machinery.
MATER
Woaaaah! ---
WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
MATER
This... this is all my fault.
FINN
Don't be a fool, Mater.
MATER
But I am, remember? You said so.
FINN
When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
complimenting you on what a good
spy you are.
MATER
I'm not a spy!
This echoes throughout the clock.
103.
MATER
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time. I really am just a
tow truck.
Finn and Holley take this in.
HOLLEY
Finn, he's not joking.
FINN
I know.
MATER
You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is
`cause I'm such a big one. This is
all my fault.
GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.
GREM
Good, you're up!
ACER
And just in time!
GREM
Professor Z wanted you to have a
front row seat for the death of
Lightning McQueen.
MATER
(HOPEFUL)
He's still alive?
Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it
toward the clock face.
ACER
Not for much longer.
He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---
FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD.
Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ----
--- McQueen and the rest of the team.
MCQUEEN
I called to talk to Mater. It never
occurred to me that he wouldn't be
there.
RAMONE
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
right now.
FLO
And Sarge is in touch with his
friends in the British military.
SALLY
You just need to focus on the race.
MCQUEEN
I know, but Sal, with everything
going on I'm not sure I should---
A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts,
revealing MILES AXLEROD.
MCQUEEN
Sir Axlerod.
MILES AXLEROD
I'm sorry to interrupt.
MCQUEEN
No, no, it's all right.
MILES AXLEROD
I just wanted to come down here and
personally thank you. Because after
Italy, I was finished. And then you
gave me one last shot.
MCQUEEN
Listen, I ---
MILES AXLEROD
And I probably shouldn't be saying
this at all but... I hope you win
today. Show the world that they've
been wrong about Allinol.
McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally.
105.
SALLY
Mater would want you to race.
MCQUEEN
All right. For Mater.
GREM
Here he comes!
Grem turns up the juice to the HIGHEST, DEATH-INDUCING LEVEL.
Holley and Finn watch, helpless. Mater closes his eyes.
Grem ZAPS MCQUEEN.
Zundapp suddenly SQUAWKS over the radio.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO)
What happened!?
GREM
I don't know, Professor.
ACER
What did you do?
GREM
(TO ACER)
I didn't do nothin'. Shh! I'm
talking to the Professor---
They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot
understand what is being said.
106.
ACER
You broke it.
GREM
Quiet!
(INTO RADIO)
I understand, sir. Yes.
Grem hangs up.
ACER
What'd he say?
GREM
We go to the backup plan.
MATER
Backup plan??
GREM
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!
ACER
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow," he's
gonna go "ka-boom"!
They LAUGH. Mater shudders, upset.
GREM
Don't feel bad, tow truck. You
couldn't have saved him.
ACER
Oh, wait. You could have!
Grem and Acer laugh. As they board the elevator:
MATER
Dadgum lemons.
MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.
Suddenly, Mater's GATLING GUNS rotate out again - a surprise
to Mater. But they SPIN IN PLACE, empty.
Grem and Acer just laugh more.
GREM
What, you didn't think we'd take
your bullets?
Mater NOTICES SOMETHING.
107.
CLOSE ON WHAT MATER SEES: A small piece of his ropes have
been shaved away by the Gatling.
He carefully rotates his guns BACK IN, pretending like he's
seen nothing.
ACER
That's right! You got nothin'.
GREM
(as the elevator descends)
Who's the lemon now, huh?
They're GONE.
FINN
Nice try, Mater.
MATER
Dadgum!
MATER'S COMPUTER
REQUEST ACK-
The guns ROTATE OUT AGAIN, SPIN. Mater watches as the
spinning barrels SLICE INTO the ropes, do some damage.
MATER
Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!
The COMPUTER responds with each "dadgum." The barrels
continue to SPIN, CUTTING THROUGH the ropes.
MATER
DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM ---
PING! The ropes BREAK AWAY and Mater FALLS --- right toward
the whirring machinery!
HOLLEY
Mater!
Mater QUICKLY WHIPS his tow cable around, hooks a pipe and
tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy THUD. He doesn't
HESITATE:
MATER
I gotta get you all out of there!
FINN
There's no time. McQueen needs your
help, Mater.
108.
MATER
But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.
FINN
It's up to you. Go to the pits and
get everyone out. You can do that.
MATER
What about you guys?
FINN
We'll be okay.
HOLLEY
Go and get some more dents, Mater.
On Finn and Holley, now closer to death.
HOLLEY
So we'll be "okay"? Really?
FINN
He wouldn't have left if I'd told
him the truth.
(re: his death trap)
Being killed by a clock. Gives a
whole new meaning to "your time has
come."
At this mention Holley seems to perk up, gets an idea.
HOLLEY
Time. That's it!
She spies a GEARBOX below them, at least 20 feet down. Holley
FIRES HER ELECTROSHOCKERS ---
--- but they miss their target. She recoils them back.
FINN
What are you doing?
HOLLEY
Trying to turn back time. If I can
just reverse the polarity...
She FIRES them again. Direct hit!
109.
Holley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE. The CLOCK STOPS.
It reverses itself.
Finn and Holley's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger.
FINN
Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!
Finn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction,
toward ANOTHER GEAR! And it's going MUCH FASTER. They're
seconds from a crushing death...
HOLLEY
Oh no!
FINN
Drive!
They both DRIVE, fast as they can with FULL FORCE ---
FINN
Burn rubber!!
They drive HARDER, separating bumpers with just enough room
for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES!
Their tires spinning, they both LAUNCH off in opposite
directions, LAND HARD on opposing platforms. As Finn squeals
around to Holley's side of the clock:
FINN
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to ---
Holley pops WINGS out of her side.
HOLLEY
Done.
110.
FINN
(IMPRESSED)
Miss Shiftwell.
HOLLEY
They're standard issue now.
FINN
You kids get all the good hardware.
They turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR
FILTER on the ground.
HOLLEY
Oh no. That's Mater's.
FINN
I knew his escape was too easy.
Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears
through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN'S.
LUIGI
Mater!
MATER
Everybody get out! Get out now!
Y'all gotta get out the pits!
The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here.
MATER
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
SALLY
We're here because of you, Mater.
FLO
Is everything okay?
MATER
No! Everything's not okay! There's
a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get
out! Now!
111.
EVERYONE
- A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.
FINN (OVER RADIO)
Mater!
MATER (INTO RADIO)
Finn! You're okay!
Mater SNORTS, blowing his air filter cover off. Cross-eyed,
Mater sees the explosive device attached to him. He looks up:
An ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head.
MATER
Uh-oh.
MCQUEEN
Mater! There you are!
Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and
closing in FAST.
MATER
Stop right there!
MCQUEEN
Oh man, I've been so worried about
you!
CUT TO:
The view of this scene through the window of a luxury box.
Reveal Zundapp in the window's reflection. He's watching from
inside. He's poised to push a DETONATOR BUTTON.
As Zundapp's front tire approaches the detonator ---
112.
MATER
Don't come any closer!
MCQUEEN
Are you okay?
MATER
No, I'm not okay. Stay away from
me!!
Mater PEELS OUT BACKWARDS, out onto the track.
MCQUEEN
No, wait. Wait!
CUT TO:
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP - He hesitates, can't believe it.
TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
Hold everything. A tow truck has
just raced onto the track. And he's
driving backwards!
IN MCQUEEN'S PIT
MCQUEEN
Mater, wait!
He breezes right through his pit, goes after Mater.
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
Normally an emergency vehicle on
the track means there's been an
accident.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
Wait, wait. Lightning McQueen is
chasing him!
Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops
into view just beyond the glass.
Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass
window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the
ground, and speeds off ---
The LEMONHEADS watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away.
J. CURBY GREMLIN
The Professor's on the run.
TUBBS PACER
Someone's gotta get McQueen.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Get McQueen!!
Grem and Acer are already out the door ---
Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break
the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.
McQueen approaches.
MCQUEEN
Mater, let's go. You're on.
The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main
Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
LORD STEWARD
Your Majesty. May I present for the
investiture of honorary Knighthood
of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
Radiator Springs.
MCQUEEN
Go get `em, buddy.
McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
QUEEN
I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
Applause from all around.
MATER
(LOOKS UP)
"Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
hear none of this "Sir" business.
By the way, have y'all met each
other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
Queen. McQueen? McMissile.
(MORE)
128.
MATER (CONT'D)
McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
McMissile.
He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO ---
