      FADE IN:


11EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 

      A BLOOD RED HARVEST MOON rises high above the dark waters of 
    the North Atlantic.  Bands of crimson moonlight cradle deep 
      rolling swells as they push their way towards the flickering 
      lights of a distant shoreline.  THE STEADY VOICE of a 
      determined young woman draws us in to hear her story.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    REVENGE.  The Oxford English 
                    dictionary defines it as the infliction 
                    of punishment in retaliation for an 
                    injury, harm, or wrongdoing done to 
                    oneself or another.  

    THE CAMERA GATHERS SPEED as it glides across the open sea 
      towards specks of light growing larger on the horizon.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Sunday school proverbs package it 
                    inside morality slogans like  an eye 
                    for an eye,  and  two wrongs don t 
                    make a right.   But two wrongs can 
                    never make a right because two 
                    wrongs can never equal each other.  

      A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT from somewhere on shore-- where a small spate 
    of East Coast mansions rests nobly beyond cresting whitecaps and 
      cascading sand dunes.  ANOTHER GUNSHOT pierces the night, 
      followed by an EXPLOSION of RED AND WHITE FIREWORKS...

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Hamlet, Medea, Captain Ahab, Charles 
                    Bronson.  The icons of vengeance 
                    teach us that for the truly wronged,  
                    real satisfaction can only be found 
                    in one of two places: absolute 
                      forgiveness or mortal vindication.

      A CRASHING WAVE stretches inland, POOLING FOAMY WATER around the 
      feet of A YOUNG MAN in a white tuxedo, face down in the wet sand.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (CONT D)
                    This is not a story about forgiveness.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - NIGHT22

      A WALTZING STEADICAM SPINS us through a HIGH-ENERGY HAMPTONS 
      AFFAIR set inside a spectacular PHILIP JOHNSON MODERN.  The 
      theme of the party is  FIRE AND ICE.   The female guests are 
    all dressed in red, the men, formal white.  From the lighting 
    to the floral arrangements, the  Fire and Ice  motif is 
      ubiquitous, executed throughout the home with tasteful flair.  
    On the ocean side courtyard we find an expertly crafted ICE 
      SCULPTURE of a woman s hand.  The icy ring finger sports a 
      brilliant sparkling engagement diamond.  White vanilla icing 
    on an oversized red velvet cake reads:  Congratulations 
      Daniel and Emily!!!  Projected on the patio wall beneath a 
      second floor terrace is a photo montage of the handsome young 
      couple (on the bow of a yacht, playing doubles tennis, 
      enjoying a sunset, etc.)  The bride to be is EMILY THORNE, 
    26, a brown-eyed, auburn haired beauty.  Her dashing fiance 
    is DANIEL GRAYSON, young 20s, all American, son of privilege.  
    We catch a lovely heirloom engagement ring on the hand of the 
      living, breathing EMILY THORNE as she steps into frame 
      wearing a graceful red cocktail dress.  THE SKY BEHIND HER 
      LIGHTS UP with brilliant RED AND WHITE FIREWORKS.  The crowd 
      looks up with  oohs  and  ahhs...   Emily pauses to 
      appreciate the frozen ring sculpture, trails a thoughtful 
      finger along the twinkling ice.  Notices a light dusting of 
      sand on the back of her hand.  Subtly brushes it away...

                                  WOMAN S VOICE
                    Emily, where have you been?  I ve 
                    been looking everywhere for you. 

      Emily turns to a beautiful young AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN-- 
      ASHLEY DAVENPORT, mid-20s, stylish and confident.  She s 
      wearing a small radio device in her ear.

                                  EMILY
                    Walking the beach.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Where s Daniel?

                                  EMILY
                    Still walking.  We re having a... thing.  

                                  ASHLEY
                    Same thing or different thing?

                                  EMILY
                    Stupid, small thing, it s fine.

                                  ASHLEY
                          (a true friend)
                    You sure?        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20113.


                                  EMILY
                    He s right behind me, don t worry.

                                  ASHLEY
                    It s my job to worry.  Your job is 
                    to enjoy yourself.  Don t make me 
                    fire you.  

      Emily manages a smile.  Ashley squeezes her hand and angles 
      off, calling orders into her lapel mic for champagne to be 
      passed around.  Ashley CROSSES BY a fresh-faced coquette, 
      CHARLOTTE GRAYSON, 17, and DECLAN PORTER, also 17, a rough 
    and tumble kid from town in a rented white tuxedo.  

                                  DECLAN PORTER
                    I feel like a dick in this tux.

                                  CHARLOTTE GRAYSON 
                    Stop acting like one and you ll 
                    stop feeling like one.  Trust me, 
                    if your friends could see you now--

                                  DECLAN
                    They d probably kick my ass. 

      Declan smirks, pulls a pair of yellow pills out of his pocket.

                                  DECLAN (CONT D)
                    Open up.

    She does.  He pops one pill into Charlotte s mouth, the other in 
      his.  Charlotte grins.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    How bad you want out of that tux?

      Charlotte bites her lip seductively, takes Declan s hand, 
      leads him through the crowd.  CAMERA CRANES UP to take in the 
      scope of the extravagant party.  As we rise above, we hear:

                                  MAN S AGITATED VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                    That case is twenty years old, they 
                    can t just rifle through private 
                    business records whenever they want...

      CAMERA LANDS on a second floor terrace off the master suite, 
      pushes in on the window where we find...


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - HOME OFFICE - NIGHT33

      CONRAD GRAYSON, 50s, a virile alpha fox in his prime, barking 
      into the phone in his bedroom-adjacent office.  He s wearing a 
      slick white tuxedo, shirt open, black bow tie undone.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20114.


                                  CONRAD GRAYSON
                    Screw the subpoena.  Get your ass 
                    down there and do what you have to 
                    do to protect me--

    He slams the phone down.  After a beat, WE HEAR a KNOCK--

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Conrad, what s keeping you?

    THE OFFICE DOORS leading to the bedroom open and in steps VICTORIA 
      GRAYSON, a spectacular woman in her mid 40s, dressed in a 
      sophisticated scarlet gown.  She quickly assesses her husband.

                                  VICTORIA
                    People are beginning to ask 
                    questions I don t have answers for.

                                  CONRAD
                    Do they work for Homeland Security?
                          (off her)
                    Federal authorities just confiscated 
                    my Madison Avenue archives.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (beat, then, unrattled)
                    Looking for what?

                                  CONRAD
                    What do you think?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Did you call Judge Barnes?

                                  CONRAD
                    He s not answering.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    What can I do?

                                  CONRAD
                    You ve done enough.  I need to think.

      Victoria turns, cool as they come, exits by way of the 
      terrace, shuts the glass doors behind her.  Conrad SHOVES his 
      computer and files OFF his desk.  They SLAM into the wall 
      beside him.  Victoria doesn t turn back.  


      EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - 2ND FLOOR TERRACE - NIGHT44

      Victoria, a subtle look of satisfaction on her face, steps 
      away from Conrad s office to survey the party below.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20115.


    The photo montage of Daniel and Emily projected beneath her 
      makes for an intriguing composition.  

      ANGLE ON THE PATIO, where Emily endures a surface conversation 
      with two random guests.  She glances up, meets Victoria s 
      gaze.  Holds it for a loaded beat.  On the wall below flashes 
      a photo of Victoria standing between Emily and Daniel with a 
      cool smile, her arm draped over her son s shoulder...


      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT55

    TWO HANDS DIVE INTO FRAME, grabbing the man in the water by 
    the arms, pulling him from the clawing surf.  With tremendous 
      effort, a breathless BEN PORTER, 26, blue collar townie in 
      jeans and a dark blue hoodie, drags the body to dry land.

      Distraught, Ben collapses on the sand next to the body, head 
    in his hands.  Away from the immediate shore, the sound of 
      rolling surf is now joined by the distant din of music and 
      laughter coming from the engagement party a few hundred yards 
      away.  Ben turns his head to the majestic summer home at the 
    tip of the cape, but the driftwood fence and long stretch of 
      pristine white sand are not the only things separating Ben 
      from the people at this party.  

    TWO FIGURES appear at the top of the hill, chasing each other 
      towards the beach.  Ben ducks down, watching the shadows of a 
      TIPSY young couple weaving their way through the low rising 
      sand dunes, laughing.  As they get closer we recognize the 
    two teenagers as Charlotte and Declan.  Charlotte races 
      ahead, pulling her red mini-dress over her head, tossing it 
    in the sand as she scampers into the surf.  Declan stops at 
    the shoreline.  Neither notices Ben and the body, hidden just 
      beyond the driftwood fence and hill of sand. 

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Come on bad boy, lets see what you 
                    got--

      Declan grins, starts pulling off his tuxedo...  

      BACK WITH BEN, considering his options.  A CELLPHONE STARTS 
      RINGING LOUDLY next to his ear.  It s coming from the dead 
      man s tuxedo pocket.  Ben quickly rifles through the jacket, 
      locates the phone-- there s a picture of EMILY on the ID 
      screen.  He tears the battery out, yanks the hoodie tight 
      over his head and staggers to his feet, stuffing the cell 
      phone into his jeans.  

                                  DECLAN (O.S.)
                    Yo, Eight-mile, private party here.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20116.


      Just over Ben s shoulder, less than 40 yards away, Declan 
      stands, stripped down to his boxers, posturing.  Charlotte 
      comes out of the water, hiding herself behind Declan.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    That guy better not be taking pictures. 

      Declan wraps Charlotte in his suit jacket.  Ben stands there, 
      frozen, his back to the young couple.

                                  DECLAN
                    We got a problem?

      Declan obviously doesn t recognize the man in the hoodie.  
      Which is all Ben needs to know before racing inland, 
      stumbling in the sand as he goes...

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Creep.

      Charlotte grabs for her dress, finds a discarded handgun in the 
      sand next to it.  Picks up the gun, looks to Declan:  WTF?  


      EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - COURTYARD PATIO - NIGHT66

      Emily stands away from the guests, phone to her ear:  The 
      party you are trying to reach is unavailable, please leave 
      your message at the tone...    Beep.   Emily s about to say 
      something-- but we ll never know exactly what...

                                  NOLAN ROSS (O.S.)
                    Nice night for it.

      Hanging up, Emily turns to see NOLAN ROSS, 34, a Howard 
      Hughes/Mark Zuckerberg-ian tech genius cum social misfit.  
      He s wearing a thrift-store 70s style white tuxedo, a RED SOX 
      BASEBALL CAP, and red KEDS All-Stars.  Emily and Nolan have 
    an understanding of one another, but not much affection.  

                                  EMILY
                    Nice night for what?

      Nolan grabs a champagne from a passing server, toasts her.

                                  NOLAN ROSS
                    Celebrating.

                                  EMILY
                    You aren t supposed to be here, Nolan.

                                  NOLAN ROSS
                    That makes two of us.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20117.


                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    Fire and Ice...

      Emily, Nolan, and the rest of the guests turn to look up at 
      Victoria, standing on the balcony above, holding a wireless 
      microphone and a glass of champagne. 

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    When we first sat down to discuss 
                    tonight s theme, I was immediately 
                    taken by the idea of an evening 
                    inspired by two primal bookends.  
                    Fire and ice, beginnings and 
                    endings, the elements in harmony. 

    As Victoria descends the stairs to the patio, she nods to 
      Ashley, the architect of the event.  ASHLEY smiles back, but 
      there s worry behind it.  She turns to Emily as a small circle 
    of guests are now clearing a space around her friend, whose 
      fiance, Daniel, is now conspicuously absent.  

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Tonight not only marks the final 
                    weekend of a truly remarkable 
                    summer in the Hamptons, it is also 
                      a celebration of my son Daniel s 
                    engagement to the lovely and 
                    beguiling, Miss Emily Thorne.

      Applause.  Emily manages a smile, trying to maintain composure 
      through the unwanted attention.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Though it s only been a few short 
                    months since Memorial Day, Emily 
                    already feels like a piece of the 
                    family puzzle we had no idea was 
                    even missing.  In a nutshell, I 
                    approve.  And as anyone here will 
                    attest, approval isn t something I 
                    give away freely. 

    As the crowd laughs, Victoria leans in to Emily, sotto voce...

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Where the hell is my son?


      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT77

    CU on Charlotte, stumbling up the slope of a steep sand berm, 
      soaking wet in her red dress and Declan s white jacket-- She 
      twists her ankle, collapses on the dune.  Lifts her head towards 
    the house, and SCREAMS at the top of her lungs...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/20118.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - PARTY - NIGHT88

      Charlotte s distant cry filters into the party.  At first, no 
    one is quite sure what to make of it.  Emily glances over at 
      Nolan, who subtly tips his glass to her, downs his champagne.  
      Something terrible has clearly happened, though it s not clear 
    if Emily knows exactly what that something is.  Victoria moves 
      towards the sound of Charlotte s cries, a wave of maternal 
      dread washing over her as she begins to run for the beach 
      path.  OFF Emily as chaos begins to rain down around her...

      FROM HIGH ABOVE,THE CAMERAPEERS DOWNat the dead man in the

      beside the body.  Guests begin to gather at the scene, and we 
      hold on the tableau as Victoria enters frame, pushing her way 
      through the crowd towards the body... GRADUALLY, VICTORIA, HER
      GUESTS AND THE BODYDISSOLVE AWAY and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY-- 

    THE BEACH BELOWis now barren and cold on a stark Spring 
      afternoon.  THE CAMERA PANS UP to reveal a charming New England 
      summer home 50 yards inland.  LEGEND: SIX MONTHS EARLIER.WE 
      HEAR a woman s voice with a thick Long Island accent:

                                  REALTOR S VOICE (O.C.)
                    I can t tell you what a rare 
                      opportunity you have here, Miss Thorne.  


      INT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY1010

    CU ON Emily staring out at the spectacular ocean vista, lost 
    in thought.    

                                  REALTOR
                    Beach front property entering the 
                    rental market this late is unheard 
                    of, never mind an address like this.

      A WIDE ANGLE reveals we re inside the New England summer home we 
    saw from shore.  The furniture is covered for winter in white 
      linen.  Emily pauses to regard a A FAMILY PHOTOon the 
      bookshelf: A handsome husband, wife, and kids pose on Adirondack 
      chairs around the deck.  They look like a Ralph Lauren ad.

                                  REALTOR (o.c.) (CONT D)
                    The current owners live in the 
                    city, of course.

                                  REALTOR (o.c.) (CONT D)
                    But they ve been loyal Hamptonites 
                    for years.  
                          (a little dirt)
                    Perhaps if Mr. Evans were a bit 
                    more loyal to his wife, we might 
                    not be having this conversation.  
                    The scuttle is Mrs. Evans walked 
                    right in on him with a girl half 
                    his age.  Men...

      Emily ignores this, already knows this particular rumor to be 
      true... She opens a glass door that leads to the deck, steps 
      outside.  A brisk March wind whips across the empty beach.  
      Emily pulls the lapels of her Pea coat tight around her neck.

                                  REALTOR (CONT D)
                    Now you have to imagine it s 
                    Memorial Day weekend, 75 and sunny, 
                    all those handsome boys of summer  
                    wondering who the new girl is...
                          (still no response)
                    Or perhaps you d like to see 
                    something in a lower price range.

                                  EMILY
                    I ll take it.  
                          (turns, smiles disarmingly)
                    It s perfect.

                                  REALTOR
                    Oh... Wonderful!  I ll get the 
                    contract.

      After the realtor disappears inside, Emily steps to a specific 
      spot on the deck where the stairs lead to the beach.  She 
      brushes a small drift of sand off the railing to reveal TWIN 
      INFINITY SYMBOLScarved beside one another in a secret place.  
    The carvings are weathered and worn, at least a decade old.  
    She touches them reverently.  And as she does, her hand turns, 
    and we notice TWO SMALL INFINITY SYMBOLS, identical to the 
      carvings, TATTOOED ON THE INSIDE EMILY S WRIST.After a beat, 
      Emily turns South to the tip of the cape, where we see what 
    she sees: GRAYSON MANOR, shuttered for winter.  Her expression 
      goes cold.  And OFF Emily, considering the plans she has for 
    her neighbors this summer...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      FADE IN:


      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - DAY1111

      LEGEND:MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, 2011.  Fresh flowers are on the 
      counter, art books and paperbacks pour out of moving boxes.  
    The Ting-Tingsbounce out of the kitchen i-pod dock as Emily, 
      dressed in jeans and vintage tee, hair pulled back, walks 
      into the room carrying a box of personal possessions.  WE 
      HEAR A GENTLE KNOCK on the open door that leads to the deck.

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (O.C.)
                    Hello hello?

      Emily looks over, happy to see Ashley entering from the deck, 
      dressed to impress, holding a bottle of champagne.

                                  EMILY
                    Ashley, what are you doing here?

                                  ASHLEY
                    I was in the neighborhood... working.

      Emily jumps up, gives Ashley a warm hug  hello.   Ashley sets 
    the champagne on the counter, taking the home in.

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    My God, girl, you weren t kidding about 
                    this place.  Ugh, I want your life...

                                  EMILY
                    You love your life.

                                  ASHLEY
                    You re right, I just want your money.

                                  EMILY
                    What s mine is yours.  
                          (the champagne)
                    Ash, you shouldn t have.

                                  ASHLEY
                    I didn t; it s for Victoria Grayson.  

                                  EMILY
                    Who? 

                                  ASHLEY
                    Your new next door neighbor and 
                    reigning queen of the Hamptons.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201111.


                                  EMILY
                    Queen Victoria?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Believe me, she s earned the title.  
                    She just summoned me to finalize the 
                    details for her Memorial Day party.  
                    If I screw this up, I might as well 
                    spend the summer in Branson.  

                                  EMILY
                    I hear Branson s lovely.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Try growing up there, you might 
                    feel differently.  

      Ashley notices a framed photograph peeking out of the box-- it s 
      a PICTURE OF EMILY AND ASHLEYat THE WEINGART BENEFIT at THE MET.

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    Can you believe this was only six 
                    months ago?  Feels like we ve been 
                    besties for a hundred years.

                                  EMILY
                    Ditto.  Wanna get drunk on cheap 
                    margaritas later?

                                  ASHLEY
                    With or without you.

      Ashley high-fives Emily as she heads back out to the deck.  

                                  EMILY
                          (calling after her)
                    Good luck...

      Ashley waves, makes her way up the beach path.  Out on the 
      deck, Emily FINDS THE CARVING OF THE TWIN INFINITY SYMBOLS ON 
    THE RAILING,shuts her eyes and breathes in the salty air.  
    As she does, a memory is jogged loose... TLC S  Waterfalls  
      blends together with the seagulls and surf.  When Emily opens 
    her eyes, we are in FULL FLASHBACK-- the deck is now filled 
      with a family s summer possessions: inner tubes, scuba 
      flippers, sand buckets, beach coolers, and a 90 s style 
      BOOMBOX, where the radio deejay lets us know that TLC s 
      summer singalong is on top of the charts for this, the first 
      week of June, 1995.  A FIT AND HANDSOME 35-YEAR-OLD MAN in a 
      gray  OHIO STATE t-shirt and Vaurnet sunglasses sits on a 
      deck chair, working on his brand new 1995 IBM THINKPAD.  His 
      name is KEVIN CLARKE.  He looks just past where Emily was 
      standing, removes his glasses, smiles paternally.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201112.


                                  KEVIN CLARKE
                    Hey kiddo, you and Jake having fun 
                    exploring?  

    THE CAMERA COMES AROUND AND WE SEE that in place of Emily is an 
      excited nine year-old blonde girl, AMANDA, who comes racing up 
      from the beach with  JAKE,  a yellow Labrador puppy, clutching 
    an oversized piece of driftwood in his mouth.  Amanda, we will 
      learn, is actually Emily as a young child.  

                                  AMANDA CLARKE
                    We really get to spend the whole 
                    summer here?

                                  KEVIN CLARKE
                          (folding his laptop)
                    And every summer after that.  What 
                    do you think, Amanda?

                                  AMANDA CLARKE
                    I think you re the greatest dad in 
                    the world.  

                                  KEVIN CLARKE
                    Easy for you to say.

                                  AMANDA CLARKE
                    Huh?

                                  KEVIN CLARKE
                    What?  

      Kevin grabs her in a tickle hug. 

                                  KEVIN CLARKE (CONT D)
                    Know how much I love you?

      Kevin draws twin infinity signs in some wet sand with a stick.

                                  AMANDA CLARKE
                    Infinity?

                                  KEVIN CLARKE
                    Infinity times infinity.
                          (then)
                    Race you to the waves?

      Amanda grins, takes off for the shoreline.  Jake begins to 
      bark playfully as Kevin chases after his little girl.  OFF the 
      warm father-daughter scene we DISSOLVE BACK TO PRESENT DAY. 

    The deck is empty once again, the beach deserted, the music 
      gone along with Emily s warm recollection of her childhood.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201113.


      Emily winces slightly, touches the twin infinity carving on 
    the railing.  Then directs her gaze towards Grayson manor 
      where she can make out the figure of a woman on a balcony 
      overlooking her property.  

      ANOTHER ANGLE, LONG LENS-- The birds eye view from...


      EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - MASTER SUITE TERRACE - DAY1212

      Victoria s bedroom terrace.  Victoria stands at the balcony, 
      face to the morning sun, her attention focused on the house next 
      door.  She watches Emily, who seems to be staring up at her, 
      challenging.  After a beat, Emily surprises Victoria with a 
      small, friendly wave, then heads inside, shuts the sliding door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Looks like Robert and Dianne s 
                    renter is settling in. 

      REVEAL CONRAD at a patio table behind his wife.  He s wearing 
      a golf hat, reading the WSJ.  Victoria does not turn back.

                                  CONRAD
                    Lucky girl, scoring that property.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Pretty one, too, even from up here.

                                  CONRAD
                    Guess that makes her doubly lucky.

    He approaches Victoria at the balcony, hands her her coffee.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I don t believe in luck.

                                  CONRAD
                    Could have been a heavy metal band.

      Touche.  He goes in for a kiss.  She allows it.

      They look down to see Charlotte enter the courtyard, holding a 
      pair of heels, looking like she just stumbled out of a club.  

                                  CONRAD
                          (waves over the balcony)

                    Didn t hear you sneaking out last 
                    night, either, Charlotte.  

      Conrad steps back to the coffee table. 

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    I went over to Tracey s.  I told you I 
                    was going to before you went to bed.

                                  VICTORIA
                    No, you didn t.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Mom, you re too young and too 
                    pretty to be this senile.

    On that, Charlotte slips inside the door.  Conversation over.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Remind me to buy her a cat bell.

                                  CONRAD
                    Aahh, let it slide.  Charlotte got 
                    straight A s this year.

                                  VICTORIA
                    No one s accusing her of being stupid. 

    As Conrad disappears into the bedroom, Victoria returns her 
      attention to Emily s rental, but no one is there.  OFF 
      Victoria s intuitive curiosity--


      EXT. DOCKS - DAY1313

    CU ON the name  Amanda  painted on the aft of a painstakingly 

      restored three sail vintage schooner.  AN OLD TIMER OF A YELLOW 
    LAB rests happily on deck, chewing on an oversized piece of 
      driftwood.  A palette of food, water, gas cans, etc., is being 
      loaded off the dock and into the boat by Declan Porter, the 17 
      year old bad boy we remember from the opening sequence.  Ben 
      Porter, who we also remember from the opening as the young man 
    on the beach in the blue hoodie, leans against the captain s 
      wheel kissing a pretty girl named MELISSA CONWAY, 25, sweet as 
      they come.  Declan uses his brother s romantic distraction to 
    set aside a case of beer.  When Melissa pulls out of Ben s kiss 
    we see that she s crying.  

                                  MELISSA
                          (her smudged eye make up)
                    Great.  The customers are going to 
                    think I m a basket case.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201115.


    We notice she s holding a green server s apron.  

                                  BEN
                    Why should today be any different?

                                  MELISSA
                    Jerk.

    She appreciates his humor, pulls herself together and kisses him 
    one more time, steps off the boat and heads towards shore.   Ben 
      watches her go with a smile.  Turns his attention to Declan. 

                                  BEN
                    Don t think I didn t see you 
                    eyeballing that case of beer, Dec.  

                                  DECLAN
                    Our parents own a bar, dumb ass, I 
                    can get as much beer as I want.

                                  BEN
                    That case, I ll make sure dad double 
                    checks inventory while I m gone.

                                  CARL PORTER (O.S.)
                    What s this about inventory?

    The two boys look to see their kind but tough father, CARL 
      PORTER, approaching.  Ben grins.

                                  BEN
                    Dec was just telling me how he s 
                    gonna pick up the slack for me at 
                    the  Stowaway  this summer, keep 
                    himself out of trouble.

                                  CARL
                    Mmm hm.  He can start by hosing 
                    down the garbage bins out back.  

                                  DECLAN
                    Beats uploading this future shipwreck.    

      Declan hops down, angles off towards the nautical themed bar 
      nestled just beyond the docks.  The Captain s wheel out front 
      reads:  PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN. Carl shakes his head...

                                  CARL
                    Pretty sure that one got switched 
                    at the hospital.

                                  BEN
                    I wasn t so different; he ll even out.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201116.


                                  CARL
                    Mmm hm.  Weather service s tracking 
                    a low pressure system, maybe you 
                    oughta wait ll it runs its course 
                    before setting sail.  

                                  BEN
                    Actually I was thinking about taking 
                    off a day early and avoiding it 
                      entirely... Unless you and mom need 
                    me to stick around and help out.

                                  CARL
                    Haitian s need your help a hell of a 
                    lot more than we do.  Already kept 
                     em waiting a year since that quake. 

                                  BEN
                    Going on two, actually.  Don t worry, 
                    still a lot that needs doing.

      Carl smiles at his son with fatherly pride.  Jake starts barking.  
    Ben and Carl turn to see what s bugging him.  It s Nolan Ross in 
      nautical pants and GREEN KEDS, walking up the dock.  

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Looks like tourist season s 
                    officially started...

      Carl just grumbles, heads for shore.  Nolan arrives, tips his 
      ever present Red Sox hat to Ben.  

                                  NOLAN
                    Ahoy, Cap n Porter.  

                                  BEN
                    Welcome back, Nolan.  What can I do 
                    for you?

                                  NOLAN
                    Need a boat for the summer, this

                                  NOLAN
                    Who said anything about renting?  
                    How much you want for it?

                                  BEN

                                  NOLAN
                    No, I m terrified of the ocean.  
                    Big difference.  Spent a lot of 
                    time and money working through that 
                    this year, among other things.  So, 
                    I m buying a boat.

                                  BEN
                    Just not this one.

                                  NOLAN

                    Something else for you to work 
                    through, I guess.

                    Good boy, Jake.

      With that, Ben heads into the hull with an armful of 
      supplies.  Off Jake, growling...

                                  ASHLEY S VOICE
                    The response to your  In With The 
                    New  Memorial Day party has been 
                      overwhelming, Mrs. Grayson.  


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - DAY1414

      Victoria sits on a couch off the bright and welcoming kitchen.  
    On the table in front of her, floral samples and a tasting 
      menu.  Gathered around her as a COURT TO THE QUEENare seven or 
      eight SOCIETY WOMEN. The champagne bottle is popped and on 
      ice.  Sitting beside Victoria is her lady in waiting, a sly 
      50ish redhead named LYDIA STOCKWELL, in  Juicy Couture  running 
      sweats.  Ashley is presenting the party plans on her i-pad.

                                  ASHLEY
                    The website s already collected 
                    nearly fifty thousand dollars for 
                    everything from cancer awareness to 
                    domestic violence prevention.

      Ashley smiles with pride, but the response from the ladies is 
      decidedly muted.  A little thrown, Ashley forges on.

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    Your guests are being encouraged to 
                    coordinate their outfits to match 
                    the charity ribbons of their 
                    choice.  I ll be wearing pink in 
                    honor of my grandmother.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201118.


                                  LYDIA
                          (toasting)
                    I ll be wearing champagne in honor 
                    of my favorite drink.

      Victoria picks up a copy of the guest list.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Some of these guests wouldn t wipe 
                    their nose with fifty thousand 
                    dollars, dear.  We can do better.

      Ashley takes a deep breath.  Fuck.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Give me the afternoon to brainstorm--

                                  LYDIA
                    I m pretty sure Victoria s already 
                    stormed her brain.  This ain t her 
                    first time at the rodeo, as they say.  

    The ladies all chortle, lean in, hanging on Victoria s response.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What this party needs is a moment.  
                    If we re going to set the tone for 
                    the summer, I want to do something 
                      provocative... So, in keeping with 
                    the theme of Spring cleaning, I ve 
                    decided to auction off a piece of 
                    our art collection.

      Ashley glances at the expensive and important paintings and 
      sculptures positioned around the house.  Featured prominently 
    on the wall closest to them is an originalPicasso etchingof 
      a seductive woman.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    The guest with the highest bid on 
                    any single work of art gets to go 
                    home with it.  

    The ladies  oooh  at the dramatic gesture, not to mention the 
      possibility of taking home a piece of Victoria... One woman 
    in particular, KARRIE THURGOOD can t resist chiming in.

                                  KARRIE
                    What a wild idea, Victoria, I d say 
                    you ve found your moment.  

    The ladies all clink glasses in agreement.  Lydia takes the 
      opportunity to reassert herself in the pecking order.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201119.


                                  LYDIA
                    Well I don t care how good the cause 
                    is, if you put up the Picasso Michael 
                    and I gave you, I ll kill myself. 

    The ladies are all impressed with Lydia s  donation  to 
      Victoria s collection, but Karrie can t help but take a swipe.

                                  KARRIE
                    Lydia, we were all so sorry to hear 
                    about you and Michael.  You were one 
                    of those couples everyone roots for.

                                  LYDIA
                    I have no doubt.

      Lydia is stung.  Victoria doesn t like seeing her favorite 
      friend knocked down, offers her a rare bit of comfort.

                                  VICTORIA
                    The Picassois off the table, for 
                      sentimental reasons.  Karrie, why 
                    don t you and the girls head out to 
                    the patio where Ashley will walk us 
                    through the staging plans...

    On command, they all head out to the patio.  Victoria puts a 
      kind hand on Lydia, indicating for her to stay behind.  Lydia 
      appreciates the special attention.  Karrie, not so much.

    OUT THE WINDOW,Lydia notices Emily making her way down to 
    the beach from the neighboring home.

                                  LYDIA
                    Is that Robert and Dianne s renter?

                                  VICTORIA
                    It would appear so.

                                  LYDIA
                    Hmm.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Hmm indeed... 
                          (then, sincerely)
                    How are you holding up through 
                      everything, Lydia?

                                  LYDIA
                    It s officially ugly.  Michael just 
                    threatened to put the beach house 
                    on the market if I don t release my 
                    claim on the Westside walk up.

                                  LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Please don t tell anyone, I can t 
                    bear the idea of losing my lone 
                    sanctuary to one of the wolves.

                                  VICTORIA
                    The more you allow Michael or anyone 
                    else to push you around, the harder 
                    they will.  Don t ever reveal your 
                    weakness, it s the first thing your 
                    enemies use against you.

      Victoria puts a hand on Lydia s shoulder.  And as Lydia 
      considers Victoria s razor sharp advice...


      EXT. SOUTHAMPTON BEACH - DAY - LATER1515

      Emily stands ankle deep in the chilly water, watches as the 
      wave recedes and sinks into the sand... WE HEAR THE LAUGHTER 
    OF A LITTLE GIRL and CUT INTO A FLASHBACK...

      YOUNG AMANDA AND HER FATHER CHASE WAVES WITH JAKE, THE PUPPY.

                                  AMANDA
                    Eeeee!  These waves are freezing!

                                  KEVIN
                    There s a trick, you know.  If you 
                    plant your feet and stand still for a 
                    whole wave, the next one will feel 
                    warmer, then the next one after, and 
                    the next one... until you barely 
                    notice the cold at all.  Want to try? 

      Amanda nods, tentatively.  Kevin takes her hand as a wave rolls 
      towards them.  The cold water nips at their ankles.  She 
      squeals, squeezes his hand, but holds her ground...

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (O.C.)
                    Must come from a family of polar bears. 

    AND LIKE THAT, WE SNAP BACK TO PRESENT DAY, WHERE Emily turns 
    to see Lydia Stockwell approaching from behind her.

                                  LYDIA
                    That water s ice cold.  

                                  EMILY
                    Only at first.  After a while you 
                    can t feel anything. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Sounds like my marriage.

                    I m Lydia Stockwell.  We ll probably 
                    be seeing a lot of each other, I 
                    walk this beach nearly every day.  
                    Not that it does my ass much good.

                                  EMILY
                          (playing along)
                    I think your ass looks great.  

                                  LYDIA
                          (smiling gamely)
                    I do believe you re going to fit 
                    right in around here, Emily.  
                    Welcome to the Hamptons.  

      With that, Lydia starts her power-walk along the shoreline.  
    As Emily watches her go, her smile drops.  After a beat, she 
      drops her robe as well, DIVES into the frigid ocean... As she 
      swims out, WE HEAR:

                                  TELEVISION REPORTER (O.S.)
                    All eyes were on Lydia Thomas this 
                    afternoon as the federal government 
                    called its most damning witness yet 
                    against disgraced wall street exec, 
                    Kevin Clarke.


      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - DAY1616

    ON A COMPUTER MONITOR we see archival news footage dated March 
    23, 1997.  We re inside a federal courtroom, focused on Kevin 
      Clarke at the defendant s table as a red haired woman takes 
    her oath at the stand.  She may be 15 years younger, and a 
      hell of a lot less confident than the woman we ve just come to 
      know, but there s no mistaking who it is: LYDIA STOCKWELL.  

                                  TELEVISION REPORTER (V.O.)
                    Mr. Clarke s former secretary testified 
                    to shredding thousands of potentially 
                      incriminating documents under Clarke s 
                    orders in the Spring of 1995...        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201122.


    THE SCENE JUMPS TO THE COURT HOUSE STEPS-- where Lydia stands 
    in front of a dozen reporters, giving her statement.  We hear 
      a reporter shout out his question:  Miss Thomas, was it 
      difficult giving testimony against your former boss today? 

                                  LYDIA
                    Kevin Clarke had everyone he ever 
                    met fooled, including me.  If I have 
                    any regrets, it s that I didn t see 
                    through his act earlier.  Now I have 
                    to live with the likely fact that I 
                    helped launder money for a terrorist 
                    organization that s killed hundreds 
                    of innocent Americans... I hope he 
                    gets the chair.

    THE IMAGE FREEZES, and we come around to find EMILY, sitting 
    on her bed staring at her laptop, hair slicked back, still 
    wet from her swim.  She takes her eyes off the computer, and 
    WE HEAR KEVIN S VOICE: 

                                  KEVIN (O.S.)
                    I need you to promise me something, 
                    Amanda.  


      INT. FEDERAL PRISON - 1996 - DAY (FLASHBACK)1717

    10 year old Amanda sits behind a plexi-glass window that 
      divides convicts from visitors.  Her face is flush and 
      streaked with tears.  On the other side of the window is 
      Amanda s father, Kevin, wearing an orange jump suit.  He s 
    got a black eye and a busted nose.

                                  KEVIN
                    No matter what you hear, or read, 
                    or see on TV about me... I need you 
                    to promise that you ll grow up 
                    believing your father did not do 
                    what they say I did.  

                                  AMANDA
                          (through tears)
                    I promise.

      Kevin glances at a Social Service lady behind Amanda.

                                  KEVIN
                    See that lady there?  She s going to 
                    take you to live with a real nice 
                    family for a little while.  And 
                    since you made a promise to me, I ll 
                    make one to you.

                                  KEVIN (CONT'D)
                    I swear that I m going to find out 
                    who did this to us.  And that if you 
                    can be patient, one day I ll send 
                    for you, and you ll come to know the 
                    whole truth.  But until that day, I 
                    need you to be strong for daddy.  
                    Can you do that?

      Amanda nods bravely.  Kevin smiles reassuringly for her.

                                  KEVIN (CONT D)
                    Know how much I love you? 

                                  AMANDA
                          (through her tears)
                    Infinity times infinity.

                                  KEVIN
                    That s my girl.

      QUICK CUT away from a tortured Kevin, and we re--

      BACK IN EMILY S BEDROOM,Emily clicks a button on her 
      computer.  A photograph of present-day Lydia pops up.  She s 
    on the balcony of a hotel suite, and she's not alone.  In 
      quick shutter series, a man can be seen stepping onto the 
      balcony to join her.  He puts his arms around her.  And as he 
      does we see his face, clear as day: Victoria's husband, 
      Conrad Grayson.  Lydia turns to kiss him.  And off Emily, her 
      first target selected...

      FADE IN:


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - PATIO - DAY1818

      Workers check the sound system on the patio, set up tables, 
    rig the lighting, etc.  Ashley walks through, on the phone.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Jeremy, it s Ashley, the acoustics on 
                    the patio still need help.  Is there 
                    any way I can get you to drive out 
                    from the city to supervise?... 
                    Fantastic, see you at three.

      Ashley hangs up, stops a confused looking assistant carrying 
    an armful of pastel satin rolls. 

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    I want these ribbons draped over the 
                    balcony in an overlapping pattern.
                          (her phone rings again)
                    Find Darryl, he has the drawings.
                          (answers her phone)
                    Ems, please don t kill me. 


      EXT. MONTAUK HOTEL - RESTAURANT - DAY - INTERCUT1919

      Emily sips coffee in the lobby-adjacent restaurant, her eyes 
      trained on A MAN checking in at the front desk.

                                  EMILY
                    That depends.  What am I not 
                    killing you for?

                                  ASHLEY
                    The fact that I have to stand you 
                    up this afternoon.  It s been one 
                    fire after the next over here, I m 
                    so sorry.

                                  EMILY
                    You re working, I m sight seeing.  
                    Hardly a capital offense.  Want me 
                    to pick your dress up for you?

                                  ASHLEY
                    You re a life saver.
                          (herother line again)
                    That s the cater calling, I have to go.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201125.


                                  EMILY
                      Absolutely, go, go...

    THE MAN Emily s been watching receives his key, turns around-- 
      it s CONRAD.  He makes a phone call as he waits for the 
      elevator.  When the doors open, he steps in.  A BEAT later, 
      LYDIA enters the lobby from outside, on her phone.  As she 
      slips into the elevator behind Conrad, OFF EMILY...


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - KITCHEN - DAY2020

      Victoria pours herself a cup of coffee, watching Ashley manage 
    the mayhem through the open patio doors.  A sea of flower 
      arrangements whose colors mimic the satin rolls on the patio 
      surround Victoria.  She almost looks pleased.

                                  CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                    Think I m tan enough for my first day on 
                    the beach or do I need another spray?

      Victoria turns to see Charlotte in a bikini.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    What you need is another bathing suit.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Compared to what the rest of my 
                    friends are wearing, this is 
                      practically a burka.

      Victoria hands Charlotte a cotton beach shirt for a cover.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Unlike the rest of your friends, 
                    it s important to me that you re not 
                    featured on Page Six at one of 
                    Diddy s hot tub parties.  Or maybe 
                    you d like to spend your senior year 
                    at boarding school?

                    Really Mom?  Still with the  
                    boarding school threats?

      They turn to see Daniel walking in the front door, looking 
      very ivy league, luggage in hand.  

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Danny!!

      Charlotte rushes her brother, jumps up on him like the kid 
      sister that she really is.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201126.


                                  DANIEL
                    Mom s been taunting me with 
                    boarding school since eighth grade, 
                    don t worry, it s a bluff.

      TYLER CHANNING, a swarthy Hugh Grant style Brit in a HARVARD 
      cap, steps in behind Daniel with his bags, raises a charming 
      eyebrow  hello  to Charlotte.  As Charlotte climbs off her 
      brother, Daniel walks over to greet Victoria.  With every 
      step her son takes, Victoria s veneer cracks a little more.  
    By the time he reaches her, she s practically beaming.   

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Hi, Mom.

      They embrace.  It s the warmest we ve seen her. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Welcome home, honey.
                          (then, not quite so warm)
                    Who s your friend?

                                  DANIEL
                    Mom, Charlotte, Tyler Channing, one 
                    of my crew mates from Harvard.  Ty 
                    didn t have plans for the summer, 
                    thought he might spend a few weeks 
                    with us.

                                  TYLER
                    Unless of course I m imposing in 
                    your impossibly fantastic home.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (a cool, irritated smile)
                    A little notice would ve been nice, 
                    but that s what it s for.

                                  TYLER
                    Much appreciated.  Be nice to see 
                    what actual sunshine feels like for 
                    a change.  

                                  DANIEL
                    Ty s from London.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                          (flirty)
                    Cool.  You guys should come down to 
                    the beach later, plenty of sun there.

      Charlotte plants a big kiss on her brother s cheek, whispers:      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201127.


                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT D)
                    I m so glad you re home.

                          (to Tyler, as she exits)
                    C mon, I ll show you around.

    As they gather their bags, Ashley catches Tyler s eye on the 
      patio.  Daniel seems to take note, raises his eyebrows to 
      Tyler in appreciation of Ashley.  Victoria observes it all.

                                  DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Dad golfing?

                                  VICTORIA

    by the hand, leads her inside...


      INT. PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN - DAY2222

      Small lunch crowd.  A few barfly s and an older couple.  Ben 
    is behind the bar trying to teach Declan how to cash out 
      credit cards.  Melissa, the girl Ben was kissing on his boat, 
      waits tables.  Jake, the dog, sits patiently with a piece of 
      driftwood in his mouth, staring at Ben, wagging his tail.

                                  BEN
                    First thing you do is enter the 
                    code.  Then swipe the card.  Then 
                    the amount.

    But Declan s attention is focused on Charlotte and her two 
      girlfriends, TRACEY and TIFFANY, who enter the bar dressed in 
      beach clothes, sitting themselves down at a bar table. 

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Dec.

                                  DECLAN
                    Got it.  Code, swipe, amount. 

    Ben notices the table of girls.  So does Melissa.  

                                  MELISSA
                    Can you deal with the  mean girls  
                    table?  Too early in the season for 
                    me to start making enemies. 

    As she heads into the kitchen with an arm load of dishes, Ben 
      claps Declan on the shoulder-

                                  BEN
                    Next lesson, how to politely ask 
                    underage patrons to relocate from 
                    the bar to a restaurant table.  
                    Think you can handle it?

      Declan grins, heads over to the girls.  A YOUNG BUSINESS MAN 
      carrying a briefcase steps up to Ben at the bar.  Jake growls.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201129.

      Carl steps out of the kitchen, shakes the man s hand.

                    Carl Porter, thanks for coming 
                    down.  Why don t you follow me back 
                    to my office.

    As they head in back, Ben watches after them, curiously.  
      Jake whimpers at Ben s feet with his stick, wagging his tail.

      OVER BY THE TABLE OF GIRLS

      Declan approaches.  Charlotte is clearly the leader of her pack.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    We ll take three rum and cokes.  

                                  DECLAN
                    Gonna need IDs.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Um, we left our ID s at the beach.  
                    But we have plenty of money.

      Charlotte pulls out a wad of cash, starts peeling off 20 s.  
    Ben calls to Declan as he heads to the door with Jake.

                                  BEN
                    Dec, I m taking Jake for a walk.  
                    Watch the bar a minute. 

      Declan nods to his brother as he exits.  Declan looks back to 
      Charlotte, who s holding out a bunch of twenties...

                                  DECLAN
                    Sorry, not interested in your money.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201130.


                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Are you interested in my phone number?

      Declan stands there a beat, unreadable, then...

                                  DECLAN
                    Bacardi or Meyers?

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    Malibu.

    And OFF Declan s killer grin...


      EXT. MONTAUK YACHT CLUB RESORT - DAY2323

      Paramedics rush a gurney out of the hotel lobby towards a 
      waiting ambulance.  The man they re tending to is CONRAD, 
      who s clutching his chest in great pain as a PARAMEDIC 
      squeezes an oxygen bag above his mouth.  Rushing along side, 
      holding his hand is Lydia, practically hysterical.

                                  LYDIA
                    One minute he was fine, the next he 
                    couldn t breathe.  

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Is he taking any medications?

                                  LYDIA
                    I m not sure-- 

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Pulse is 100 over 60 and dropping.

                                  LYDIA
                    Is that bad?  Is he going to be okay?

                                  PARAMEDIC
                          (loading him in)
                    Ma am, I need you to step back.  

                                  LYDIA
                    Where are you taking him?

                                  PARAMEDIC
                      Southampton hospital.

    On that, he shuts the doors and the ambulance takes off.

                                  WOMAN S VOICE
                    Lydia?

      Lydia turns to see Emily step out of the crowd that s gathered.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201131.


                                  EMILY
                    It s Emily Thorne.  Was that your 
                    husband?  Do you need a ride to the 
                    hospital?

    ALL EYES ON LYDIA.  She suddenly realizes how vulnerable and 
      conspicuous she is.  

                                  LYDIA
                    No, I don t.  I... I have a car.

    And on that, Lydia turns ankle and motors for the hotel  
      parking lot.  Emily watches as Lydia s brisk pace turns into 
    an all out run.  As the crowd begins to whisper, OFF Emily...


      EXT. HARBOR PARK - DAY2424

      Emily walks along the bike path with a pink dress in a dry 
      cleaning bag slung over her shoulder.  Jake the dog jogs past, 
      chasing after a piece of driftwood.  By the time he gets 
      there, he s tuckered out.  Sits down and starts chewing on it.  

                                  BEN (O.C.)
                    Whole point of fetch is to bring the 
                    stick back when I throw it, Jake.  I 
                    really gotta explain this again?

      Emily turns to see Ben, about thirty yards away. 

      INSIDE EMILY S MEMORY-- FLASHBACK NINE YEAR OLD AMANDAand 
    her father, Kevin, play in the same spot with Jake, now just 
      a puppy.  Kevin hands Amanda a ball.  

                                  KEVIN
                    Go ahead, throw it.

      Amanda heaves the ball.  

                                    KEVIN/YOUNG AMANDA
                    Go get it, Jake!  Fetch!

    The puppy races off, but not towards the ball.  Instead, he 
      runs up to BEN, now a NINE YEAR OLD BOY, dredging a mud 
      puddle with a stick.  Next to the boy is a fishing pole and a 
      Folger s can full of worms.  Jake splashes into the puddle, 
      starts a tug of war for the stick.  

                                  KEVIN
                    No, Jake!  The ball-- get the ball!

      Young Ben slips in the puddle as Jake zips off with the stick.  
      Amanda and Kevin run over.  As Kevin helps the boy up...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201132.

                                  YOUNG BEN
                    Yeah...

      Kevin chases after the puppy.  Amanda smiles apologetically 
    to Ben as he flicks off the mud.

                                  AMANDA
                    Sorry.

                                  YOUNG BEN
                    S okay.  

                                  AMANDA
                    I m Amanda.

                                  YOUNG BEN
                    Ben.  Looks like your dad could use 
                    some help catching your dog.

      Amanda smiles.  And as the two kids run after Kevin, calling 
    for Jake... WE SNAP OUT OF EMILY S FLASHBACK--

                          (softly)
                    Jake?

    Old Jake immediately turns to Emily s voice.  Comes bounding 
      over, barking playfully, jumping up on her like he s 
      reuniting with a long lost friend.  Because he is. 

                                  BEN
                    Jake, get down.  What are you doing?

    Ben arrives, pulls Jake off of her.  But not before Jake s 
      knocked the pretty pink dress onto the muddy path.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Jake!  

    Ben bends down to help Emily with the dress.  Jake kisses her 
      face, spins around in a circle.  It s an adorable mess.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    I don t know what s gotten into him, 
                    he s not usually so... friendly.  
                    Kind of an old grump, actually.

      Emily looks up, Ben s eyes are like tractor beams.  He smiles, 
      taken back by her beauty and... something he can t put his finger 
      on... He notices a tear in the garment bag and a stain on the hem.

                                  BEN
                    He got mud on your dress.  

      Their hands touch.  The sensation is electric.    

                                  EMILY
                    It s not my dress... I was picking 
                    it up for a friend.  

                                  BEN
                    Even worse, huh?  There s Sam and 
                    Emma s dry cleaners around the 
                    corner, I ll walk you over.

                          (this is now dangerous)
                    That s okay, I ll find it.

    She starts to march towards town.  Ben keeps up with her.

    She stops, takes control, tries her best to put a stop to it.

                          (firmly)
                    I m sorry, I really have to go.

                                  BEN
                    Oh, okay.  Well, make sure you tell

                    I m not picking up the tab, Jake is.

                    Thanks anyway.

                                  BEN
                    All righty, then.  Well, you have a 
                    great summer.

    But Emily is already hustling off, leaving Ben to watch and 
      wonder what might have been.  As she disappears around a 
      corner, OFF Jake whimpering...

    But Victoria s already on the move, marching into the ward.  
      Finds room 316.  Opens the door to see--

    as the doctor makes a note in his chart.

                    My God, Conrad, I thought I was going 
                    to find you dead.  What happened?

                    Hope you re not too disappointed.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Far as I can tell, your husband is 
                    healthy as a thoroughbred.  But I 
                    do suggest he stays away from The 
                    Montauk s spicy bisque for a while.

                    You know I just get in the way when 
                    you re setting up one of your 
                    parties, so I thought I d go for a 
                    drive and stay out of your hair.  
                    I m sorry if I scared you.

    He means it.  Almost as much as she means her ice cold

                    Don t ever do it again.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - EVENING2727

      Daniel, in a yellow seersucker jacket, fixes a matching pastel 
    bow tie in the mirror.  Tyler walks in, fresh from a shower.  
    The vibe is macho frat boy locker room.  

                                  TYLER
                    You know we were actually graded on 
                    bow ties back in prep school.  Had 
                    to stand up and do it in front of 
                    the whole class without a mirror.

                                  DANIEL
                    How d you score?

                                  TYLER
                    Miserably.  If my father hadn t 
                    paid off the headmaster, I d 
                    probably still be standing there in 
                    a puddle of my own pee.

                                  DANIEL
                    Not as difficult as it looks.

                                  TYLER
                    Not for you, maybe.  Don t suppose you 
                    have an extra suit I could snag, left all 
                    my seersuckers across the pond.

    As Tyler exits, Victoria shuts the door.  Smiles at her son.

                                  VICTORIA
                    You ve grown into such a handsome 
                    young man, Daniel.  

                                  DANIEL
                    What can I say?  Good genes.

    She crosses to him, helps him finish tying his bow tie.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Meet anyone new at school this 
                    year?  Besides Tyler, of course.

                                  DANIEL
                    I take it we re talking girls?  

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes.

                                  DANIEL
                    I met lots of girls, Mom.

                                  VICTORIA
                    But no one special.

                                  DANIEL
                    Lots of special girls.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m not sure our ideas of what 
                    makes a girl special are in sync.  

                                  DANIEL
                    Can t help it if I m a romantic. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t be cute.  I won t tolerate a 
                    repeat of last summer s indiscretions.

                                  DANIEL
                    Don t worry, I learned my lesson.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Good.  You re an important young man 
                    with an important future ahead of 
                    you.  Which is why your father and I 
                    have decided to restrict access to 
                    your trust fund until you marry, 
                    assuming we all agree on the girl.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201138.


                                  DANIEL
                    Are you serious? 
                          (of course she is)
                    That s ridiculous-- I m not going 
                    to marry someone just to satisfy 
                    your ideas about how I should live 
                    my life, I don t care how much 
                    money s at stake.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    Now who s being ridiculous?  No one 
                    says you can t have it all, Daniel.  
                    I want you to be happy.

                                  DANIEL
                    What, like you and dad?  

                                  VICTORIA
                          (staring him down cold)
                    It s for your own protection.
                          (thenkisses his cheek)
                    See you down there.

    And with a loving smile, Victoria exits, leaving Daniel to 
      absorb his mother s non-negotiable mandate...


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - NIGHT2828

    CU ON EMILY as she steps into the party, wearing a virgin 
      white summer dress.  The place is packed with excited guests, 
      reuniting for another season in the Hamptons around the 
      champagne ice sculpture, oyster bar, and giant salt water 
      tank filled with Maine Lobsters.  Ashley, making a statement 
    in her hot pink dress, steps up to Emily.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Emily, you look amazing.

                                  EMILY
                    Ilook amazing, look at you.  Look 
                    at this house-- you did all this?

                                  ASHLEY
                    It took an army.

                                  EMILY
                    I m speechless.  Congratulations.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Too early for that.  Come with me.

                                  EMILY
                    Where are we going?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201139.


                                  ASHLEY
                    Birds eye tutorial of everything and 
                    everyone you need to know in the 
                    Hamptons.  You ll thank me later.

      Ashley takes Emily by the hand, leads her past the art work on 
      display for auction.  The Picassoremains firmly on the wall.   


      EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - PATIO - NIGHT2929

      Cross-fading pastel lights dance off the billowing satin 
      ribbons draped above the hip and sophisticated looking patio.  
      Subtle ambient club music creates a feeling of instant cool. 

      ANGLE ON EMILY AND ASHLEY about halfway up the terrace stairs 
    on the first landing.  Ashley is pointing out various guests.

                                  ASHLEY
                    See that girl in the one of a kind 
                    Jimmy Choos?  That s Ellen 
                    Bloomberg, Mayor Bloomberg s niece.  
                    The woman she s talking to?  Now 
                    this one s important, Megan Foster, 
                    shoe buyer for Barney s New York. 

                                  EMILY
                    What s with the mafia looking guy  
                    at the oyster bar?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Actual mafia, steer clear... 

                                  EMILY
                    Any regular people?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Just us.  And hopefully that cutie 
                    I may or may not be crushing on.

      Ashley points out Tyler, by the bar.  Tyler spies Ashley spying 
      him, play acts being struck in the heart by cupid s arrow.  

                                  EMILY
                    Looks like it may or may not be 
                    mutual.  Who is he?

                                  ASHLEY
                    One of Daniel Grayson s Harvard 
                    pals.  Which should be a red flag.

      Daniel steps up to Tyler at the bar.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201140.


                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    Daniel wrapped his Mercedesaround 
                    a tree on his way home from The 
                    Pink Elephant last summer.

                                  EMILY
                    Looks like he walked away okay.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Much better than the waitress in 
                    his passenger seat.  Rumor is his 
                    father paid off everyone and their 
                    mother to keep him out of jail.
                          (then, spotting someone)
                    And the plot thickens...

                                  EMILY
                    What?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Redsox cap with the flip cam.

      ANGLE ON NOLAN ROSS,taking a video of the party...

                                  EMILY
                    Who is he?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Nolan Ross, former tech boom whiz 
                    kid and perennial pain in the ass.  
                    If you emptied the bank accounts of 
                    everyone at this party, it wouldn t 
                    add up to the interest his makes in 
                    a week.  Thinks the rules don t 
                    apply to him, and he s right.

    As Emily watches Nolan, we enter one of Emily s FLASHBACKS--


      INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - 2003 - DAY (FLASHBACK)3030

      A TOUGH AND FERAL, CORN-ROWED, DISH WATER BLONDE 18-YEAR-OLD 
      GIRL is removed from her juvie cell, wearing prison clothes.  
    As a GUARD leads her into the hall...


      EXT. JUVENILE DETENTION - 2003 - DAY (FLASHBACK)3030

    The blonde girl exits the holding area, now in street 
      clothes, carrying the only possessions she entered with: her 
      sketch book and art supplies.  

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    Amanda?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201141.


      Amanda turns to see a geeky version of Nolan (now mid 20s).

                                  NOLAN
                    Not exactly how your father 
                    described you.

                                  AMANDA
                    My father hasn t seen me in eight 
                    years.  Who are you?

                                  NOLAN
                    The only friend either one of you 
                    seem to have.  Happy birthday.

      Nolan hands her a sealed envelope that reads:  FOR AMANDA ON 
    HER 18th BIRTHDAY  underscored by TWIN INFINITY SIGNS.  OFF 
      AMANDA, looking at this stranger in disbelief... CUT BACK TO 
      PRESENT DAY--


3131EMILY AND ASHLEY ON THE STAIRS... 

    As Emily watches Nolan disappear into the crowd,VICTORIA 
      APPEARSat the edge of the patio.  

                                  ASHLEY
                    And that... is Queen Victoria. 

      EMILY S WORLD GOES INTO SLOW MOTION.  She watches Victoria 
      weave through the party like a snake through an overgrown 
      garden.  Greeting and moving on, greeting and moving on.  Her 
    eye finds the girls.  Cocks her head curiously at Emily.

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)
                    Oh damn, we ve been spotted.
                          (offEmily)
                    Technically, I never got you added 
                    to the official guest list.  

                                  EMILY
                    I m a crasher?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Trust me, this is worse for me than 
                    it is for you.

                                  EMILY
                    Not if you don t panic.  

                                  ASHLEY
                    What else can I do?

    And Off Emily...


      ANGLE ON LYDIA,APPROACHING CONRAD, SPEAKING WITH GUESTS.3232

                                  LYDIA
                    Conrad, may I steal you a moment?

      Conrad excuses himself and they step to a private area.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Today was just too... awful.  I 
                    wanted to go with you to the 
                    hospital, but--

                                  CONRAD
                    Trust me, it s a good thing you didn t.  
                    Besides, I m fine.  

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t think I can do this 
                    anymore.  It s not fair to any one 
                    of us, least of all, Victoria--

      Karrie Thurgood, Lydia s frienemy from the planning session 
      notes the hushed voices, can t help but satisfy her curiosity. 

                                  KARRIE
                    What are you two doing hiding in the 
                    corner?

                                  CONRAD
                    No one s hiding from anyone, Karrie.

                                  KARRIE
                    Rumor has it you really dodged a 
                    bullet today.  Victoria must have 
                    been beside herself.  

                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    I m happy to report that rumors of my 
                    husband s demise have been greatly 
                    exaggerated. 

      They turn to see Victoria stepping up.  Lydia bristles.

                                  KARRIE
                    Well I m thrilled to hear it.  I ll 
                    make sure to spread the word.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m sure you will.  Looks like you 
                    could use another drink.  Would you 
                    show Karrie to the bar, darling?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201143.


                                  CONRAD
                    Can t think of anything I d rather do.

      Conrad nods to Lydia, takes Karrie s empty glass and leads 
    her off.  Victoria gives Lydia the  hate her  eyebrows, but 
      Lydia isn t her usual playfully snarky self.

                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    I had no idea you were even here, 
                    why didn t you come find me?

                                  LYDIA
                    Sorry, I was just about to...

                                  VICTORIA
                          (sensing something s up)
                    Are you all right?  You don t seem 
                    yourself.

      Lydia is torn.  Hates that she s deceiving her best friend, 
    but can t see a way out.  Before she can respond, they hear:

                                  ASHLEY (O.S.)
                    Mrs. Grayson? 
                          (Victoria turns to see Ashley)
                    Forgive me for interrupting, I 
                    wanted to introduce you to your new 
                    neighbor, Emily Thorne.

      Ashley steps aside to reveal Emily.  

                                  EMILY
                    Hello, Mrs. Grayson.  I m 
                      embarrassed to say I showed up 
                    uninvited, but Ashley put so much  
                    effort into your party, I just had 
                    to see it first hand.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    You two know each other?

                    Well, you got yourself one hell of 
                    a rental on a volunteer s salary.

                                  EMILY
                    Volunteering is more of a hobby for 
                    me.  I try to make a point of 
                    giving back whenever I can.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201144.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Then please stay for a drink, and 
                    give generously.

      Ashley squeezes Emily s elbow with a smile, exits.

                                  EMILY
                    I will.  Thank you.
                          (to Lydia)
                    Hello, Lydia.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (to Lydia)
                    Don t tell me, you ve taken up 
                    volunteering at the Met as well?

                                  LYDIA
                    Emily and I met on the beach.  Briefly.

                                  EMILY
                    And then this afternoon in Montauk.  
                    I hope your husband s feeling better.

    And there it is.  Victoria looks to Lydia, who is looking over 
    at Conrad at the bar.  All at once, Victoria understands the 
      magnitude of her betrayal.  Turns to Emily, the messenger...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Excuse me.

                                  LYDIA
                    Victoria, wait...

    But Victoria has no interest in hearing Lydia s explanation.  
      Victoria disappears into the party, grabs Conrad and leads him 
    up the terrace stairs.  Lydia simultaneously splits off in the 
      other direction, panic-stricken.  OFF EMILY and her plan...


      INT. PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN - NIGHT3333

    The hard working Hamptons' whiskey and beer crowd has 
      gathered to send Ben off on his adventure.  A hand painted 
      sign draped across the bar reads:  BON VOYAGE, BEN!  
      Roadhouse music blares from the jukebox, quite a contrast to 
      Victoria's highbrow fandango.  An earsplitting siren pierces 
    the crowd.  Everyone turns to the bar to see Carl, holding a 
      megaphone.  Next to him, his wife of 30 years, ABBY PORTER.

                                  CARL (O.S.)
                    Listen up, everyone!  I have a few 
                    words to say about my son before you 
                    all get too drunk to remember why 
                    you came tonight.

                          (the crowd laughs)
                    Anyone who ever met Ben knows he s  
                    never too busy or put out to lend a 
                    person in need a hand.  In a word, 
                    there s a kindness about him.  And 
                    now it s time for him to share that 
                    kindness with the world.  
                          (toBen)
                    Now I know you got your GPS and 
                    fancy navigation equipment, but just 
                    in case you ever really lose your 
                    way, I want you to have this, too.

      Carl hands Ben an antique brass compass.  

                                  CARL (CONT D)
                    Always got me just where I needed 
                    to be, safe and sound.  

      Carl puts an arm around his wife, proudly.  As they all hug...

                                  CROWD
                    To Ben!

      With that, everyone finishes whatever drink they re drinking.  
      Melissa tousles Ben s hair.  The only one not feeling the love 
    is Declan,  the other son.   He pulls out his phone, scrolls 
    the contacts until he finds  CHARLOTTE GRAYSON  and texts: 
       What s up Malibu? A beat later a response comes through... 
       Parent s party.  Bored.   Declan considers, then texts: 
       Wanna get high?   As he waits for Charlotte s answer...


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - PARTY - NIGHT3434

      ANGLE ON CHARLOTTE,leaning up against a pillar on the patio, 
      considering her reply to Declan s most recent text:  Wanna 
    get high?   She grins, texts back:  On my way. 

                                  NOLAN (O.S.)
                    You know I invented that.

      Charlotte looks up to see Nolan, leaning on the pillar 
      opposite her.  She raises an eyebrow, dubious.

                                  CHARLOTTE
                    You invented texting?

                                  NOLAN
                    If you want to get technical I 
                    invented the binary protocol that 
                    allows real time data transfer

                                  NOLAN
                    We ll put it in a sippy cup.

      ANGLE ON EMILY,watching as a creeped out Charlotte walks 
      off.  Nolan turns with a shrug, notices Emily, noticing him.   

                                  SERVER
                    Care for a drink, miss?

      Startled, Emily turns to a SERVER, holding a silver tray full 
    of bright red cocktails.  When she looks back for Nolan, he s 
      gone.  Emily does a quick scan, but instead of Nolan, spots 
      DANIEL, standing on the periphery, checking out girls with 
      TYLER.  She thinks a moment, then takes a drink with a smile.


3535EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - PATIO - NIGHT 

      Daniel takes in the fancy crowd with Tyler. 

                                  TYLER
                    So, this is how they do it in the 
                    Hamptons.

                                  DANIEL
                    Like clockwork.  Same people, same

      Daniel has his eye on the second floor terrace, where he can 
    see his mother and father arguing in Conrad s study.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)

      Tyler reveals a glass vial of cocaine.

                    Come on man, you know I m off that 
                    stuff...

      Daniel shakes his head, turns and bumps right into-- EMILY, 
      holding an empty glass, the bright red contents of which are 
    now spilled on the lapel of Daniel s suit jacket.  

                                  EMILY

                    How  bout a dry martini?  Twice the 
                    alcohol, half the stain potential.

                                  EMILY

                    I wish I could.  But I m just not 
                    built like you are.

                    It ll only be a year.  I ll be back 
                    before you know it.  

    He kisses Melissa sweetly.  She breathes in deep, holding her 
      tears at bay.  Ben glances to the front door to see DOUG REID, 
    the young banker who came in looking for his father that 
      afternoon.  Doug finds Carl and hands him an official document, 
      then heads back out the way he came.  Ben watches as his father 
      opens the letter, then upset, disappears towards the back 
      office.  Ben looks to Melissa, who can tell all is not well...


      INT. PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN - BACK OFFICE - NIGHT3737

      Carl sits at his desk with his head in his hands, staring at 
    the official letter from the bank.

                                  BEN (O.S.)
                    Dad, what s going on?  Why s that 
                    banker keep coming around?

                    Get in here and shut the door 
                    before your mother hears you.
                          (Ben does, waits a beat)
                    You know how bad business fell off 
                    these last few years, so I borrowed 
                    a little money against the bar, 
                    nothing to worry about.

                                  BEN
                    How much?

    Ben grabs the letter off the desk.  Reads, staggered.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Dad, this is a foreclosure notice.  

                                  CARL
                    I m sure they ll give me another 
                    extension.  Now get back out there 
                    with your friends.  Tonight s about 
                    you and your future, not me and my 
                    problems.  Go on.

      wall looking at all his father stands to lose.  Pulls

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT3838

      Victoria is up on her veranda in a familiar situation, 
      holding a microphone, addressing her loyal guests.  The crowd 
      applauds enthusiastically.  Lydia looks up, helplessly.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I chose tonight s theme to signify 
                    a fresh start for the summer.  A 
                    new outlook on friendships and 
                      philanthropy.  As difficult as 
                    these last few years have been, 
                    they ve been devastating on our 
                    charities.  Now as things are 
                    beginning to turn around, I m 
                    looking forward to giving back, and 
                    I know all of you are, too. 

      Applause.  Victoria motions for Ashley and a security guard, 
      waiting inside Conrad s study, to join her on the terrace.  
    The security guard is holding the framed Picasso etching. 

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    So to start things off right, I m 
                    pleased to announce that the winner 
                    of tonight s art auction is my dear 
                    friend Lydia Stockwell, who will be 
                    taking home our treasured Picasso. 
                    As secretive as Lydia is, I can t 
                    say how much she s paid for the 
                    privilege, but I assure you it cost 
                    her dearly. 

      Victoria leans into Ashley, sotto.  

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Have security escort both the etching 
                    and Ms. Stockwell off the premises.   

    As Ashley nods at the confusing request-- 

      ANGLE ON LYDIA, HORRIFIED as Karrie steps up to her, confused.

                                  KARRIE
                    But I thought the Picassowas a 
                    gift from you...

      Victoria returns the microphone to her lips.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201150.


                                  VICTORIA
                    In a bit of related news, I must also 
                    tell you that Lydia s victory is a 
                      bittersweet one, as an offer has just 
                    been accepted on the beach house she 
                    used to share with her husband.  
                          (surprise from the guests)
                    So I m afraid this will be her 
                    final weekend in the Hampton s.  
                      Congratulations, Lydia, wherever 
                    you end up, I hope the Picasso will 
                    be a constant reminder of the 
                    friendship we shared.

    The crowd applauds for Lydia as Victoria flashes an ice cold 
      smile at her former friend.

    As Karrie watches Lydia s humiliation, it becomes apparent 
      just how expensive entree into Victoria s inner circle really 
    is.  She glances up to Victoria, who nods down, silently 
      anointing Karrie as the new second in command...

      ANGLE EMILY,watching Victoria s handiwork as the security 
      guard escorts Lydia and the Picasso to the exit.   

      Daniel steps up behind Emily with a martini.  In his other 
      hand, a glass of soda on ice.

                                  DANIEL
                    She s really something, isn t she?
                          (off Emily)
                    My mother.

                                  EMILY
                    I ll say.  

                                  DANIEL
                          (toasting)

      Daniel and Emily clink glasses.  He smiles winningly.  His

      FADE IN:


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - NIGHT3939

    The party is nearly over.  Daniel and Emily sit on the bottom 
    of the terrace stairs with their drinks.   

                                  DANIEL
                    How many Harvard men does it take 
                    to screw in a light bulb?

                                  EMILY
                    I don t know, how many?

                                  DANIEL
                    One, and the whole world just 
                    revolves around him.

      Daniel s being charming and self effacing.  Emily laughs openly.  

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    One more?  

                                  EMILY
                    Drink or joke?

                                  DANIEL
                    Either.  Both.

                                  EMILY
                    Neither.   I m just buzzed enough to 
                    find that last joke funny, another 
                    drink and I might think you meant 
                    it.  But don t let me stop you.

                                  DANIEL
                    No, no, I ve had about all the club 
                    soda and lime I can take.  

                                  EMILY
                    You don t drink?

                                  DANIEL
                    Used to.  Epicly.  Not a whole lot of 
                    love out there for a guy like me 
                    trying to get a second chance.  Gotta 
                    admit, it s nice meeting someone like 
                    you who never knew the old me.

    He smiles sincerely, looks with clear eyes, right into hers.  
      Emily is surprised by how disarming Daniel is being.        Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201152.


    He notices a small tatoo on the inside of Emily s wrist.  
      It s the twin infinity symbols.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Infinity plus infinity?

                                  EMILY
                          (suddenly guarded)
                    Something like that.

                                  DANIEL
                    That s a long time...

    He touches it, she pulls back.

                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    Daniel.

      They look up to see Victoria has stepped onto her terrace.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    It s getting late.  

      Emily looks to Daniel.

                                  EMILY
                    She s right, I should go.
                          (looks up)
                    Thank you for a lovely party Mrs. 
                    Grayson, it was very nice meeting you.

      Victoria smiles coolly, heads into her room.

                                  DANIEL
                    Don t let my mom rattle you,  
                    intimidation is practically a sign 
                    of endearment with her.

                                  EMILY
                    Hate to be on her bad side.

                                  DANIEL
                          (speaking from experience)
                    Yes, you would.  Don t worry, I have 
                    a feeling she s going to like you.

      Daniel rises, extends a hand.  As Emily takes it...

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Walk you home?

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks, I ll find my way.  Next time.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201153.


                                  DANIEL
                    Until next time, then. 

      Emily walks off, leaving Daniel smiling after her.  And on 
      Emily s face, we can see she s torn.  The last thing in the 
      world she expected is to actually like this guy...


      EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT4040

      Nolan and Ben sit at a table on Ben s boat.  Ben is holding 
      tight to the brass compass his father gave him, practically 
      white knuckling it as Nolan cuts a check.  Jake growls.  Nolan 
      notes the party at the Stowaway.

                                  NOLAN
                    Sounds like quite the local 
                    shindig.  What s the occasion? 

                                  BEN
                    Going away party.

      Nolan hands him the check.  Ben pockets the compass.

                                  NOLAN
                    Oh yeah?  Who s getting out?

                                  BEN
                    No one, anymore.

    Ben signs the deed to the boat, hands it to Nolan. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Dog included?

                                  BEN
                    Dog stays with me.  I ll have my 
                    stuff cleared out by morning.

    As Nolan steps off, he notes the name painted on the stern.  
      Smiles, curiously...

                                  NOLAN
                    Why dyou name her Amanda?  
                          (Ben doesn t answer)
                    If I m gonna own her, I oughta know 
                    the story.

                                  BEN
                    Just a girl I knew once.  

                                  NOLAN
                    That s it?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201154.


                                  BEN
                    That s it.  Take care of her.

    And as Ben and his dog head below deck, we linger with Nolan--


      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - BEDROOM - NIGHT4141

      Victoria sits at her vanity removing her diamonds.  Conrad 
      steps in from the darkness of his office.

                                  CONRAD
                    You didn t have to exile her.  What 
                    you did was cruel.

                                  VICTORIA
                    WhatIdid was cruel?  You could 
                    have had anyone.  You knew Lydia 
                    was my closest friend.

                                  CONRAD
                    It was never meant to be an affair, 
                    it just...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Happened?  For Godsake, is it 
                    physically impossible for you to take  
                      responsibility for your actions?  

                                  CONRAD
                    A problem you and I seem to share.  
                    If you ll remember, I gave up everything 
                    once to prove how much I loved you.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    And I returned the favor.  

                                  CONRAD
                    Not exactly.  You did what you did to 
                    save yourself, as much as me.  You 
                    may have stayed in this marriage, but 
                    your heart stayed with him.

                                  VICTORIA
                    A choice I m reminded of everyday. 

                                  CONRAD
                    You got plenty in the bargain. 

      With that, Conrad heads back to his study, shuts the doors.  
    OFF Victoria, staring at her reflection in the mirror, 
      contemplating her sacrifices...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201155.


      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT4242

      Emily steps in through the sliding glass door, shuts it behind 
      her.  As she sets her things on the counter, she looks down 
    the hall towards the master bedroom.  Hears a MAN S AND 
      WOMAN S VOICESbehind the door.  Emily begins to walk towards 
    the sound of a lover s conversation as the WALLS CHANGE-- and 
    we are once again, in FLASHBACK,and Emily is once again NINE-
      YEAR-OLD Amanda, wearing summer pajamas, walks gingerly 
      towards the bedroom.  Spying through the cracked door, she 
      sees-- HER FATHER with a YOUNG VICTORIA.  Victoria is putting 
    on her stockings.  Kevin takes her hand.

                                  KEVIN
                    I love you, Victoria.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t say that.

                                  KEVIN
                    I can t help it, it s true.  
                          (he kisses her)
                    Stay.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (tears of love and frustration)
                    Please, Kevin, I can t... I m sorry.

    And as Victoria hustles out of the bedroom, into the main room 
    and through the glass doors, young Amanda takes cover in the 
      dark.  Kevin steps out of the bedroom, stands at the sliding 
      doors a beat, debating whether or not to go after Victoria.  
      Decides better of it, turns and sees his young daughter.

                                  KEVIN
                    Amanda...

      KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!And suddenly we are BACK IN REAL TIME
      with Emily.  Someone is pounding on the glass doors.  She 
      spins to see-- NOLAN.

                                  NOLAN
                    Special delivery, Amanda.  

      Emily opens the door, yanks Nolan inside.

                                  EMILY
                    What are you doing here?

                                  NOLAN
                    Nearly didn t recognize you tonight, 
                    but that s the whole point, isn t it?  
                    What s it been, seven, eight years?  
                    My how you ve grown...       Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201156.


    He circles around her, admiring.  Emily stands still.

                                  EMILY
                    Nolan, you have to leave, you ll 
                    ruin everything.

                                  NOLAN
                    Don t worry, your secret s safe.   
                    No one wants this imperious cadre 
                    of toxic phonies to eat it more 
                    than yours truly.  So, how can I be 
                    of service?

                                  EMILY
                    You can t.  You re not a part of this.

                                  NOLAN
                    I think your father might disagree. 
                    He was the first person who ever 
                    believed in me, you know.  Without 
                    his investment all those years ago, 
                    my company wouldn t exist.  Without 
                    my company, you wouldn t have that 
                    fat nest egg funding whatever your 
                    wicked little plan is...

                                  EMILY
                    I don t need any more of your help.

                                  NOLAN
                    Don t you?  Remember, I saw first 
                    hand what these people did to your 
                    father.  They re hard core.

                                  EMILY
                    I can handle them.

                                  NOLAN
                    Suit yourself, but I can be just as 
                    powerful an enemy as any one of 
                    them.  Just sayin ...

      Emily opens the door, inviting him to leave.  Nolan turns.

                                  NOLAN (CONT D)
                    By the way, I had a heart warming 
                    chat with Ben Porter tonight.  
                    Looks like someone s still carrying 
                    a torch for little Amanda Clarke. 

                                  EMILY
                    Amanda Clarke no longer exists.

    And as Emily slams the door on Nolan, OFFher stony expression...      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201157.


      INT. FEDERAL PRISON - 2003 - DAY (FLASHBACK)4343

      Amanda, the feral eighteen year old, sits on one side of the 
      familiar plexiglass booth.  Along the wall behind her stands 
      young Nolan.  In her hands she holds the letter that says 
       FOR AMANDA ON HER 18TH BIRTHDAY.  They wait quietly until a 
      BUZZER SOUNDS and the prison door opens revealing Kevin 
      Clarke in shackles, a shell of the man we remember.  He 
      shuffles in and sits down across from Amanda.  

                                  KEVIN
                    You kept your promise.  

                                  AMANDA
                    You owe me the truth.

    She notices an infinity symbol tattoo covering each of 
      Kevin s hands.  He holds them up, side by side.

                    And so my father and I were 
                    reunited, the bond we forged 
                    rekindled over a loss that only the 
                    two of us could understand...

      A CLEANED UP, still blonde version of adult AMANDA steps up

    She signs a log book and the door buzzes.

                    I told him about the little girl who, 
                    for eight years, was bounced from 
                    family to family, shelter to shelter.

      Kevin is now talking to Amanda.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201158.


                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And he told me the story of an 
                    ambitious executive, loving father, 
                    and perfect patsy-- a good man 
                    framed and sentenced to death by a 
                    deep and malevolent conspiracy.  
                    The more I listened, the darker the 
                    rage grew inside of me.  


      EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - DAY4646

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The week before my father was 
                    killed, he asked me to make him one 
                    last promise... 

      Amanda, early 20s, wearing black, exits the gates with her 
      father s personal effects, including a hand made wooden box 
      forged in prison, the twin infinity signs branded on top.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... That I would lead the life he 
                    had always wanted for me, walk away 
                    from my anger, and find a way to 
                    forgive the people who destroyed us.

    She opens the box and a photograph flutters out.  A picture of 
    the two of them when she was a little girl, laughing on the 
      beach, squeezing Jake on a warm summer day.  She notices a 
      loose panel under the lid of the box-- a secret compartment.  
      Amanda pulls away the panel, discovers a worn, folded 
      photograph of a large group of people on a Hawaiian vacation, 
      posing happily in front of a banner that reads:  GRAYSON 
      GLOBAL EXECUTIVE RETREAT - 1995  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But that was a promise I couldn t keep.

    OFF Amanda, her face streaked with tears of rage and loss... 


      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT4747

      Emily sits in the near dark, holding the wooden box with the 
      infinity symbols.  Gently removes the group photograph from 
    the secret compartment and unfolds it... Front and center, we 
    see a young Conrad with his arm around Victoria Grayson.  
      Next to Victoria, a young Kevin Clarke.  Behind Kevin, a 
      young Lydia (Thomas) Stockwell.  And all around them with 
      their drinks and Hawaiian leis: The dozens of happy 
      executives, business associates, legal counsel, and 
      significant others responsible for bringing Kevin down.      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201159.


                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    They say revenge is a dish best 
                    served cold... but sometimes it s 
                    as warm as a bowl of soup.


      INT. MONTAUK YACHT CLUB HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY4848

      Conrad opens the hotel room door to EMILY, barely recognizable 
    in a room service uniform, mousy wig and glasses.  

                                  CONRAD
                    Set it up on the patio, please.

      Emily wheels the cart in, catches a glimpse of Lydia through 
    the doors that divide the living room from the bedroom.  On the 
      cart is a bottle of Cristal champagne, a Nicoise Salade and a 
      bowl of Lobster Bisque.  She speaks with a Russian accent.

                                  EMILY
                    Ground pepper for your salad? 

                                  CONRAD
                    Actually, I m the bisque.  And yes, 
                    ground pepper sounds great. 

      Emily smiles, cranks some pepper.  And when Conrad turns his 
      back, pours a vial of clear liquid into the bisque, stirs...

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    It s been said that to forgive is 
                    to set a prisoner free and discover 
                    that the prisoner was you.  


4949EXT. DOCKS OUTSIDE PORTER S STOWAWAY TAVERN - NIGHT 

      Emily stands on the docks outside the bar, looking in the 
      tavern windows at Ben with his family and friends.  He s 
      telling something important to Melissa.  Melissa kisses him, 
      pulls him into a supportive hug.  Emily turns away, walks 
      down the dock until she sees the name  Amanda  painted 

      lovingly on the aft of a schooner.  She kneels to touch it, 
    all the gentle memories of her childhood surging forth.  
      JAKE, THE DOG, COMES UP FROM BELOW DECK, BARKS HAPPILYat 
      Emily.  From inside the bar, Ben hears the commotion.  But 
      when he comes out to check, Emily is nowhere to be seen...

                                  BEN 
                    What is it boy?      Kelley - "REVENGE"     Final Network Draft     1/25/201160.


    But for now, that question will go unanswered.  As Ben looks 
    out towards the ocean, THE CAMERA GLIDES OUT over the dark 
    and forbidding sea as Emily s voice over continues...

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    My father died a true prisoner.  An 
                    innocent man, reviled and unforgiven.


      EXT. GRAYSON MANOR - NIGHT5050

      Victoria stands on her terrace, staring down at the light from 
      Emily s beach house, the cool ocean breeze whipping around her.  


      INT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT5151

      Emily sits on her bed, studying the worn photograph of the 
      happy group of Grayson conspirators.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    When everything you love has been 
                    taken from you, sometimes revenge 
                    is all you have left.  

      With a red pen, Emily draws a  V across Lydia s face.  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    As I said, this is not a story 
                    about forgiveness. 

    And PUSHING IN ON the pixels of A SMILING YOUNG VICTORIA, we... 

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
