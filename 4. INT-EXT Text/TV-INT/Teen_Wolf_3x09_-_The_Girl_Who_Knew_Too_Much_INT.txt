      The double doors CLANG open and Deputy Tara Graeme rushes 
      into the shadowy, eerily quiet school corridor. With one hand 
      on her shoulder mic and the other on her sidearm, she slows. 
      Breath held, she hears an unexpected sound...

      MUSIC. The whisper of STRINGS and BRASS, a classical melody 
      weaving its way through the corridor. With a nervous glance 
      back, Graeme takes a tentative step forward.


      Inching down the stairs, Graeme pauses when the music 
      abruptly stops. She cocks her head, listening close. Leaning 
      forward as--

      A DOOR SLAMS OPEN. Several STUDENTS pour into the corridor, 
      each carrying musical instrument cases. Graeme stops Danny.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    What are you guys doing here so

                    Anyone or anything suspicious?

      Danny shakes his head. Then notices Graeme s hand at the 
      holster of her gun.

      Danny nods and quickly follows the others to the exit. 
      Turning to the empty corridor, Graeme presses the button on 
      her shoulder mic.

                    Dispatch, do you copy?

      Graeme holds still, listening to the static diminish to a 
      soft white noise. Ear turned to her shoulder, she begins to 
      hear something else coming through the mic s speaker...

      VOICES. A strange, rhythmic chanting. Louder and louder, it 
      rises from a quiet hum almost to a scream--

      STATIC BLARES from the mic. Startled, Graeme flips the 
      switch, turning it off. A DOOR CLANGS behind her and she 
      whirls around, gun drawn.

      Down the hall, the second door to the locker room stands 
      open. TWO FEET in black shoes lie just outside the threshold. 
      Slowly and terrifyingly, the feet are dragged the rest of the 
      way into the room.

      Frozen by fear, Graeme tries to keep the gun steady while the 
      locker room door quietly drifts shut.


      Stepping through the door, Graeme whips the gun about the 
      darkened room. One of the showers can be heard running, STEAM 
      gently drifting out to the lockers.

      Fingers tightening around the gun, Graeme spins around the 
      corner and finds--

      A BODY sitting propped against the tile wall just underneath 
      a shower lever. The body is her. Garrote around her neck.

      Eyes widening at the sight of her own murder, Graeme begins 
      to gasp. Then choke. The gun drops to the floor. A WIRE now 
      tightens around her own neck as she turns to look at the 
      scarred face of the Darach behind her.

      Graeme staggers forward. She hits the shower wall and begins 
      to slide. Her hand wraps around the shower lever, but all she 
      manages to do is to turn the water on, creating the same 
      tableau that she first witnessed--

      Dying in exactly the same position as she saw herself.


      Cheek to her pillow, Allison lies in bed, a distant look in

      Finally, he steps out and eases the door shut. Allison 
      listens closely, hearing him leave the apartment, then throws 
      back the covers to reveal she s fully dressed. 

      At her closet, she grabs a dark jacket and clicks open a case 
      containing her CHINESE RING KNIVES. She takes two and hurries 
      back to her dresser to get her keys when--

      She stops. Listening. Her eyes move to the open balcony 
      window. Finger slipping through the ring of a dagger, she 
      silently approaches the window and--

      YANKS Isaac inside, SLAMMING him to the floor. Stunned, he 
      peers up at the sharp tip of the dagger at his throat.

                    if you know about the starting gun 
                    in a race. Or a phrase like  seeing

      While other students drift through the hall below, Scott and 
      Stiles corner Ethan in the stairwell.

                    Our pack--they were killers. People 
                    talk about us as monsters. They re 
                    the ones who gave us the 
                      reputation. And our Alpha was the

      Cora whips her CLAWS BACK, blood at Aiden s chest where she s 
      slashed him. But the twin looks up with a furious glare, 
      barely fazed.

      She tries to step in for another attack, but he moves too 
      fast. Hands latching onto her, Aiden lifts Cora off her feet 
      and flings her across the room.

      EYES RED, he ignores her and grabs a BARBELL PLATE from a

      right across her cheek, sending her tumbling to the floor 
      past Lydia.

      Aiden glares at them, breathless with anger. Until he sees 
      Lydia gazing on him, horrified by his brutality.

      A few feet away, Cora barely seems able to hold herself up on 
      the floor while Stiles and Scott stand ready to defend her. 

      THE BELL RINGS. 

      No one moves. Scott throws a pleading glance to Ethan who 
      finally grabs his brother and pulls him out the door. 

      Stiles kneels in front of Cora to help her up, but pauses 
      when he sees the blood at her head.

      Raising the BLACKLIGHT, Allison clicks it on and shines the 
      purple light across the map on Argent s desk.

      her shoulder touching his. The slightest connection between 
      their bodies--

                    around thinking you can stop people

      He goes after her. Lydia looks to Scott and he gives her a 
      nod to go as well. While she leaves, Scott turns back to the 
      office door and the spiral in the window.

      The door SLAMS open, startling him. Coach hurries out shaking 
      out vitamins from a bottle.

                    with the Guidance Counselor.

      As Coach grabs a half empty bottle of water from an open 
      locker, Scott slowly looks up.

                    I think I will.


      Past an open door marked GUIDANCE COUNSELOR, Morrell packs up 
      her files as someone walks in.

      Morrell and Scott sit across the desk from each other, the 
      intensity of their stares matched only by the quiet 
      aggression in their voices.

      The door bursts open into the corridor and Scott hurries out. 
      As students pass by, he stands there, trying to catch his 
      breath while the weight of Morrell s warning looks like it 
      might literally push him to his knees and crush him against 
      the floor.


      CHALK swipes quickly across the board. A History teacher 
      named MR. WESTOVER transcribes headlines from his notes for 
      the next day s class.

      Pausing to look at the text of an open book, Westover steps 
      away from the board. Then turns back with a shocked gasp.

      Lowering the chalk, Westover stares at the board. All of his 
      notes have vanished, replaced by one strange image...

      A FIVE FOLD CELTIC KNOT.

      The chalk slips from his fingers. It rolls across the floor, 
      right out the open door and into the corridor.

      It finally stops, hitting a girl s shoe. Slowly bending down, 
      Lydia picks up the chalk. Eyes strangely unfocused, she walks 
      into the now empty classroom.

      She raises the piece of chalk to the Five Fold Knot and in 
      the same circle in which Allison discovered the word 
      PHILOSOPHERS, Lydia writes the number 2.

      And then she starts SCREAMING.

      wire pulled taught against the victim s neck and--

      dropping to the floor, he keeps pulling the trigger.

      The Darach, clothed in black, hurtles into the darkness, 
      appearing to almost be swallowed up by the shadows.

      Bewildered, Danny nods. Ethan steps away and notices his 
      brother, Aiden, watching. Not pleased.

      AT THE BACK - a worried Scott glances about the faces, trying 
      to find a suspect within the crowd. He sees the twins.

      But instead of taking a seat, Scott slowly retreats back and 
      finds himself standing next to Lydia.

      Looking in his eyes, Lydia takes Scott s hand and gives it a 
      gentle squeeze. The music swells as the concert begins.


      Cora stirs, slowly waking. Her eyes flutter open, fingers 
      tightening around a hand holding hers.

      Her breathing labored, she closes her eyes again as Derek 
      leans down to gently kiss her forehead.


      Doors clattering open, EMT s roll a gurney in past Stilinski 
      who leans over the reception desk to talk to Melissa.

                    what I can do.

      She slides a pen and pad over and Stilinski begins writing.


      The CONDUCTOR whips his wand furiously up and down, guiding 
      the players through a classical piece. 

      Lydia looks at her phone to see a message from AIDEN: Need to 
      see you right now.TEEN WOLF EP#309"THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH"GREEN3/22/1340.

      She glances into the audience to find him. He turns at his 
      seat and gives her a nod. Lydia s phone buzzes again with a 
      new message: Life or death!

                                  LYDIA
                    It better be.

      She heads for the exit doors, not noticing as Argent, Allison 
      and Isaac come in. But Scott does see them. As he shares a 
      look with Allison, Isaac takes a guilty step back, trying to 
      distance himself.


      Under a single light in the hospital s morgue, Melissa flips 
      through files to show Stilinski what she found.

                                    MELISSA
                    There was a patient just like you 
                      described. Slash marks all over the 
                    body. The doctors thought it had to 
                    be an animal. But there s something 
                    else. Something that happened at 
                    the same time that s even 
                      stranger...


      From his seat, Ethan glances back to see Stiles hurry in to 
      meet with Scott. He watches them whisper to each other, 
      searching the crowd, but looking hopeless.

      Turning back to view the concert, Ethan notices Aiden 
      fidgeting, hands searching his pockets.

                                  ETHAN

      Lydia steps into the empty room. She pauses, hearing the 
      MUSIC from the recital hall drifting in. A familiar CHANT 
      begins to rise. The same chilling refrain she heard from the 
      Music Teacher s recording.

      Lydia whirls about to face Jennifer. She holds a simple, 
      wooden stick with a wire on it. 

      A GARROTE. 

      As Lydia opens her mouth to scream, Jennifer swings the 
      garrote, BASHING it into the back of her head.

      Moving through the crowd at the back of the hall, Allison 
      begins to notice the strange singing from the choir. So does 
      Morrell, sitting up in her seat, visibly disturbed as the 
      chanting rises and rises.


      Lydia comes out of a blurry haze to discover she's being 
      hauled up into the teacher's chair. Her hand reaches for the 
      back of her head where BLOOD mats her hair down.

                    who knew too much.

      Just as the wire of the garrote swings over her neck, Lydia 
      raises her hand into the loop. It closes against her palm.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)

      At the back of the hall, Isaac flinches, hands moving to his 
      ears. In the audience, both Ethan and Aiden have the same 
      pained reaction.


      By Cora s side, Derek jerks back, eyes widening as Lydia s 
      SCREAM hits him even at this distance.


      Lydia s hand falls away allowing the wire to tighten around 
      her throat. Through tears, she peers back at Jennifer looking 
      on her in proud astonishment.TEEN WOLF EP#309"THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH"GREEN3/22/1344.

      Horns blaring, violins shrieking, people begin to wince in 
      the crowd, covering their ears. The piano completely veers 
      off from the rest of the piece and the sudden sound of WIRES 
      SNAPPING stops the other players.

      Danny lowers his horn, turning to watch the TEACHER at the 
      piano fall back off the bench, BLOOD POURING FROM HER THROAT, 
      slashed by an errant piano wire.

      SCREAMS erupt from the audience, people rising in shock.

      Allison starts forward even as the crowd begins to rush in 
      her direction, people racing out in panic. Musicians and

      BERRIES gurgle up from her open mouth.

      Gun aimed, Stilinski stands just inside the door.

      Reacting with a slight smile, Jennifer FLINGS THE KNIFE. The 
      blade lands in Stilinski s arm causing him to FIRE wildly.

      The gun drops, clattering in front of Scott s feet. He looks 
      up with fangs bared. Fully transformed. Stilinski s eyes 
      widen as he watches Scott launch toward Jennifer.

      She moves fast and with sudden strength. Ducking his claw 
      swipes and grabbing him, she sends Scott HURTLING off his 
      feet and SMASHING through desks all the way to the back of 
      the room.

      Stiles rushes to the door. But with the slightest push of 
      Jennifer s hand, the teacher s desk SLIDES across the floor 
      and slams into the door, locking Stiles out.

      He watches through the window pane as Jennifer slowly 
      approaches his father. But Stilinski picks up the gun with 
      his other hand and aims it.
