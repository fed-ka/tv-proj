    We ve been inside the parking garage Batista was stabbed in 
    Episode 110.  Dexter stands right where he was.  Same blood, 
    same crime scene.  But now DEBRA s where Batista stood.  Mid-
    sentence.  Didn t even know Dexter was in his own head. 

                                        DEBRA
                      -- seriously wannatake down the 
                        motherfuckerwho did this to Batista.
                                (realizing)
                        Hey.  You all right?

    Dexter looks around.  The area is fully populated, as it 
    should be: FORENSICS TECHSand UNIFORMS.  As MASUKA, 
    forensics kit in hand, hurries up to them:    

                                        DEXTER
                        Yeah.  I m just... distraught.  About 
                        Angel.
                                (then)
                        How s he doing?  Do we know?

                                        MASUKA
                        Still in surgery.  

                                        DEBRA
                        LaGuerta s there.  God, I hate feeling 
                      so helpless.
                                (waiting, then, to 
                                Masuka)
                        What, no jokes about providing gross, 
                        sexual comfort in a time of crisis?  

                                        MASUKA
                                (matter-of-fact)
                      Our friend was stabbed, and he might 
                        die.

    A quiet, emotional beat.  Moved, Debra reaches out and 
    wordlessly squeezes Masuka s arm.  ON DEXTER, watching...

    Debra looks across the garage, sees DOAKES waving her over.  
    She hurries off.  Masuka opens his kit. 

                                        MASUKA
                        Though her sweater melons do look 
                        excellent tonight.
                              (re: the scene)
                      So what do you think?

    They turn to the same series of JAGGED BLOOD SMEARS on the 
    concrete pillars and an SUV.  Dexter stares.

                                        DEXTER
                      He fought back.  These jagged smears.  
                        There was a struggle.

                                        MASUKA
                        Attaboy, Angel.

    Dexter s eyes turn to the ground, where he focuses on the 
    SMALL BLOOD DROPS:

                                        DEXTER
                      And here, this trail, the steady 
                        stream of drops... he had a few 
                        seconds.  Tried moving away... 
                        until...

    Follow Dexter s gaze to FIND the LARGE, DRYING POOL OF 
    BLOOD: 

                                        DEXTER 
                      ... until he fell.  

    Dexter stares at the abstract splotch, unable to turn away.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      So much blood...

    He looks up, sees everyone else moving about, doing their 
    jobs as if at HALF-SPEED.  Comforting each other... 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        What s happening to me?

    ACROSS THE LOT

    Debra and Doakes question the two roommates, ANDY and JERRY
    (20s), who witnessed Batista s attack.

                        Uh-uh.He wore some kind of a mask.  
                      And he was fast.  Took off as soon as 
                      we ran over.

    Doakeslooks around.  He takes Debra aside.

    Monique, naked,on her stomach on the bed.  Enjoying 
    herself.  CLOSE ON RUDY, drawing lines on her body with a 
    surgical pen.  He moves languidly, sensually -- it s erotic.

                        You re so different this time.

                        Actually, your imperfection is what 
                        saved you the first time.

    PULL UP.  REVEAL what Monique cannot see -- Rudy marking her 
    arms and legs... at every major joint.  For CUTS.

                        rather in its presentation.

    He moves down her leg, making lines at all the right spots.

                                        RUDY 
                      And that wrinkled flesh hanging off 
                        your radial carpal joint is far from 
                        perfect.  Quite unsightly, actually.  

    Stung, Monique sits up, her eyes flying open.

                                        MONIQUE
                        Hey, if you re gonna be an asshole--

                      No, no, no, hey, shhhh.

    He drops the pen, comes around her, massaging her shoulders.

                                        RUDY 
                      I m sorry.  I didn t mean to offend.

    Monique looks like she wants to say something, but the 
    massage feels so good.  She sinks into it...

                                        RUDY 
                        Truth is, I m very grateful to you.

                        Wait... what?

    Realizing she s in trouble, she struggles, but he s got one 
    arm around her neck, like a noose, clasped at the bicepby 
    the other.  A grotesque, intimate hug.  Too late for 
    Monique.

                                        RUDY
                        Shh, don t struggle.  It never helps.

    He leans his head next to hers, pressing her head sideways 
    at an awkward, unnatural angle.

                                        RUDY 
                      I m compressing your carotid artery, 
                      and that s cutting off oxygen to your 
                        brain.  In about ten seconds, you ll 
                      be unconscious.

    But Monique keeps squirming.  Desperately fighting for air.  
    Then she SLUMPS FORWARD.  Rudy catches her and hoists her 
    unconscious body over his shoulder.


    Rudy carriesMonique out of the bedroom and into the main 
    living area.  Crossing to the kitchen, he pulls opens the 
    ominous silver door leading to his refrigerated KILL ROOM.  

    Rudy s phone RINGS, but he doesn t even give it a glance.  
    As Rudy pulls the heavy door shut behind him --

    Nearby, a HOSPITAL WORKER hangs festive, brightly-colored 
    CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS, but Auricouldn t care less.

    He hangs up and watches through the window as an unconscious 
    BATISTA is wheeled past, headed for his ICU room, followed 
    by a DOCTOR, LAGUERTA and NINA (Batista s estranged wife).  
    LaGuerta splits off and joins the worried cops, gathered at
    the window.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Angel sustained severe internal

                                (tired smile)
                      The surgery was successful.  Looks 
                        like our boy s out of the woods.

    The room erupts with emotion: hugging, back slapping.  
    Relief all around.  Debra fights back her own tears, and 
    Doakes puts his arm around her, letting her lean on him for 
    support.

    Dexter standsapart from the cluster of cops.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I know I should stay.  Be a part 
                      of the group hug and the charade 
                        that the good guys always win.

    He turns to leave.

                      But I can t focus.  I m trapped in the 
                        clutches of a memory.  I need to know 
                        what it means.

    Doakes  look darkens as he watches Dexter quietly slip away.

    A beat.  Doakes stares intently into Dexter s eyes-- and 
    sees the dark soul inside.  Doakes slightly nods his head.

                                        DOAKES
                        Yeah.Just what I always thought.

    Doakes drops his hand.  Dexter turns and walks away.  OFF 
    Doakes, watching him go...

    Debra takes in Rudy s immaculate loft.

                        Wow.  Fancy.  I thought my brother was 
                        a clean freak.

    Rudy enters from the kitchen with wine and two glasses, 
    walking right past the silver door to his kill room. 

                                        RUDY

    He pours a glass for her.  Takes in Debra s solemn mood.

    Batista smiles as he nods off again.  The medsand trauma 
    taking their toll.  OFF LaGuerta, gently pulling up his bed 
    sheet so he can sleep. 


    Dexter stares intently at the blotched fabric.

    Dexter s gloved hand glides over a jagged tear indicating 
    where the knife went in. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

    Jarred from his own thoughts, Dexter glances up to see 
    LaGuerta standing in the doorway.

    As LaGuerta comes closer, Dexter points to a TINY BLOOD DROP 
    on the back of the shirt s collar.

    He points the remote and the tape FAST FORWARDS.  It s a sea 
    of BLACK until there s a brief flash.  REWINDING the tape, 
    Doakes then advances it in SLO-MO.

                        again.

                        Wait! I can t just... I fought so
                        hard to win them back.  Especially 
                        Astor.  They see me like this, I lose 
                        them forever.

                        Paul, the one good thing that came out 
                      of our marriage are these kids.  And I 
                        know you love them.  But if you want 
                      to have any kind of real relationship 
                        with them, it has to be with the 
                        father they have, not the father they 
                        wish they had.

                                        PAUL
                        I can t believe you re doing this.  
                      You really do hate me as much as I 
                        loved you.  

                                        RITA
                        I used to hate you.  But I won t give 
                      you that kind of control over my life 
                        anymore.  You cheated on me.  Broke my 
                        heart.  My bones.  And I took it all 
                      so the kids wouldn t have to.  Now, 
                      I m giving you a chance to make all 
                        that right.  Not for me.  For them.     

    Paul looks down.  Unable to face Rita. 

                                        PAUL
                        I wouldn t even know what to say.

                        your mistakes.  That s a valuable 
                        lesson.  It s one you never got. 

    Rita gets up from the table.  Crossing to the door.

                        Rudy was going to pop the question and

                        Thinking Rudy attacked Batista doesn t

    Dexter, still dirty and disheveled, carries A BLOOD SLIDE

                        It s kind of a rush.

    The tech just keeps bopping to the music.  Doesn t hear him.

    Rudy at the couch pouringCHAMPAGNE into TWOGLASSES.  Debra 
    enters from the adjoining room.

                                        DEBRA
                        This yacht is amazing.  Didn t know 
                      you went for stuff like this.

                                        RUDY
                        There s a lot to learn about me.
                                (then)
                      Did I hear your phone ring?

                                        DEBRA
                        Yup.Big brother.  I let it roll to 
                        voice mail.  Figured he could wait 
                        till we were done here.

                                        RUDY
                                (relieved)
                        Good.  I want you all to myself.  So 
                      let the toastingbegin, right?

    He holds out a glass, and she comes to the couch, takes it 
    and sits.  They clink glasses...

                                        RUDY
                      To what comes next.

    ON DEBRA as she sips.  She hears a CRINKLING SOUND.  She 
    turns to see Rudy, his champagne still untouched,pop a 
    THROAT LOZENGE.  He moves to kiss her -- she stops him.

                                        DEBRA
                        You re not drinking.  And you smell 
                        like menthol, which it turns out is 
                      not that sexy.

    She sees the discarded lozenge wrapper -- the same wrapper 
    we saw in Episode 105 -- and bends down to pick it up.

                                        RUDY
                        What s wrong?

                        Right.  Wait.  How do you know?

    Rudy leansbehind her, starts massaging her shoulders, 
    exactly like he did Monique.  Kisses her neck.

                                        RUDY
                        I don t make mistakes very often, but 
                        when I do... they haunt me.

    He slides his arms around her chest.  Again, likeMonique.  

                                        DEBRA
                        Hilarious.

                        Your champagne s gonna get warm.

    Rudy slips his arm to her neck and clasps it with the other.

                                        RUDY
                      You know that thing I ve been dying to 
                      ask you?  How could you notknow who I 
                        was?  You re a cop.

    Debra grows uncomfortable.  Tries moving.  Can t.

                                        DEBRA
                        This isn t funny.

    But Rudy doesn t release his grip, squeezing it tighter.

                                        RUDY
                      I d think a real cop would have at 
                        least a sense she was in the presence 
                      of the person she s been hunting, 
                        right?  

                                        DEBRA
                        Rudy.  You re hurting me.

                        refrigerated room.

    ON DEBRA.  A slow, cold realization washing over her.

                                        DEBRA

    Debra pivots, SLAMMING her elbow into his chin.  He lets go.  
    She tries to run but she s not fast enough -- he grabs her 
    shoulder.  She spins, throws a punch, but he grabs it, using 
    her momentum against her.  He wraps his arm around her neck.

                                        RUDY
                      You can fight, but everything s in 
                        motion now.  Maybe a little faster 
                        than I had planned.

    He drags her back onto the couch.  She struggles in vain.

                                        DEBRA
                                (gasping)
                        Why reyou doing this?

                                        RUDY
                      The tricky part was getting you on the 
                        boat.  The other women, I could just 
                      pay them to go where I wanted.

    He leans in, presses his head against hers to force it into 
    the same, unnatural angle we saw earlier.  Debra keeps 
    fighting, but she s growing weary.

                                        RUDY 
                        But... in the end, you made it easy.  
                      So desperate to fall in love.

    Tears stream down Debra s face; she knows the end is near.  

                                        DEBRA
                        Stop...

    Rudy s chokeholdcuts off her oxygen.

                                        DEBRA 
                                (barely a whisper)
                      ... please.

                        thinking, our guy doesn t get sloppy.  
                        He s precise.

                        See, the left wrist was two inches 
                        shorter than the right.  Why cut off 
                        more on the left than the right? 

    Masukawaggles the file at Dexter again, wanting him to 
    look.

                        Because she was a fucking amputee.  I 
                        looked up her medical records.  She 
                      had a fake left hand.  That s why we 
                        never found it.  The killer cut off 
                      the extra piece of wrist so we 
                        wouldn t see her stump.

    But he s already gone, rushing to the corridor.  As Dexter 
    races out, REVEAL Doakes.  Unseen by Dexter, he enters the 
    lab behind him. 

                                        DOAKES
                        What was he doing here?

                                  confusion)
                        Morgan.  What was he doing in here?

                                        YOUNG LAB TECH
                      It was blood samples.  He needed me to 
                        compare two blood samples.      DEXTER 111     "Truth Be Told"    Final Draft -- 10/02/06      61.

                                        DOAKES
                        What blood samples?  

    The Lab Tech withers under Doakes  stare. 

                                        YOUNG LAB TECH
                                (intimidated)
                        I don t know.  He, um, didn t say.  Am 
                        I in some sort of trouble? 

    Doakes reaches out, grabs the LAB REPORT from the Young Lab 
    Tech.  Scans it for a beat.  Looks back.

                                        DOAKES
                        What the fuckis he doing?


    Dexter, growing desperate, scans the bullpen: lots of cops.  
    No Debra.  He turns to the nearest body -- Detective Simms.

                                        DEXTER
                        Where s my sister?

                                        DETECTIVE SIMMS
                        Took her code twelve.  Left about an 
                        hour ago.

                                        DEXTER
                      She went to dinner?  She wasn t 
                        supposed to leave here.

    He grabs a WALKIEoff a desk and speaks into it:

                                        DEXTER
                        Dispatch, it s Dexter Morgan.  I need 
                      you to raise Officer Debra Morgan on 
                      her radio.  

    COME AROUND Dexter, radio in hand,as he waits for a long, 
    agonizing beat.

                                        DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        Sorry, sir, she s not responding.  
                        Would you like me to try again?

    Dexter drops the radio on the deskandraces from the 
    bullpen.
