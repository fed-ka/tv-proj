Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida.
LEOPOLD (V.0.)
And we're good to go.
TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,
walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.
Adjust their EARPIECES.
LEOPOLD (V.0.)
Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.
They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto
the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING --
CUT TO:
AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD
watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.
LEOPOLD
Okay sit tight. Company's coming.
THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like
barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're
protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --
LEOPOLD
Shit. Hang on.
Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --
LEOPOLD
WHOA --
The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas,
getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...
CUT TO:
POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE
rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off
her like diamonds in the sunlight.
2.
STEARNS
Oh, mama.
She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.
LEOPOLD
She sure is taking her time...
STEARNS
She must be really salty...
LEOPOLD
(shakes his head)
It's not just the salt. She's got
sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on
that, and it sticks...
(then still watching)
Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And
these three models --
STEARNS
Wait a minute.
(looks at him)
Hawaii.
LEOPOLD
-- Shit!
He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the
Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --
DAVE
Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something
like this ever happened to you?
(bends down to pet
THE CHIHUAHUA)
Because if you're a guy - or if you
know someone who is - then what you've
just seen should look pretty familiar.
He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.
DAVE
Scientists call this condition "Lust
Induced Brain Freeze." It affects
millions of guys, every day, in all
walks of life -- causing anything
from a mild embarrassment, to an
international incident.
He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS
pointing GUNS at him.
3.
LEOPOLD
Hand over the dog.
DAVE
Hey. I didn't even know it was a
dog.
They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.
DAVE
Notice I didn't say it's a condition
that affects men every day -- only
guys. And that subtle but important
difference is one of the things this
movie is about.
CUT TO:
Two OLD PEOPLE on a glider. LENORE talks directly to CAMERA.
ALBERT'S absorbed with some device that we can't see.
LENORE
Well when I met him, I didn't know
so much. About guys, or men or what
have you -- we just didn't talk about
such things then. In fact, I didn't
see him naked until quite well into
our marriage. When was it Albert?
6.
ALBERT
A year ago. By accident.
LENORE
Anyway. I thought I was marrying a
man, but didn't know that in his
heart, he was a guy.
DAVE (O.S.)
When did you first suspect?
LENORE
Not long after the wedding. But it
didn't bother me. I just didn't
know how to recognize the signs.
But we've learned to live with it.
Haven't we, Albert?
(then after a beat)
Albert.
ALBERT
It's twelve hundred and thirty-one
miles from this spot right here, to
Cleveland.
LENORE
What does that have to do with
anything?
He holds up the device - handheld GPS.
ALBERT
Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.
LENORE
Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?
ALBERT
You have a cousin there.
LENORE
Albert. There's a person here asking
us questions. There's a film crew
here.
He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there.
Then holding up the GPS --
ALBERT
You. Where do you live.
DAVE (O.S.)
Here in Miami.
ALBERT
What part.
Lenore buries her head.
CUT TO:
Dave walks down a crowded street. Colorful day life.
DAVE
Like a lot of big cities, Miami is
known for its sizeable population of
guys. So we came here to take the
city's pulse on the subject.
CUT TO:
A 20-ish HORSE GROOMER talks to the CAMERA while she combs
out a mane.
8.
HORSE GROOMER
Well guys, they're sort of like your
older brother. And men are like
your dad.
DAVE (O.S.)
In what way?
HORSE GROOMER
Your older brother doesn't have to
grow up. Your dad came that way.
CUT TO:
Dave walks out of the barn towards CAMERA.
DAVE
So now you have some background on
basic guy attributes. But before we
move on, let's look at one more scene
and see where you stand --
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"
The endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all
kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks.
Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling...
A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out.
CUT TO:
TNT. ONE OF THE CAVES
PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE
KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping
in a protective clump...
12.
He rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again...
CUT TO:
THE ROOSTER, COOKING ON AN OPEN FIRE
CUT TO:
PRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and
OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS
leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million
years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way.
PRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and
PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks.
PRIMATE ROGER
Grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt!
(SUBTITLE)
0
-- and that's why wildebeests are so
mean.
PRIMATE GENE
Grunt grunt!0
Ha ha!
PRIMATE LENNY
Grunt grunt grunt! 0
That's really funny!
PRIMATE PHIL
Grunt ...0
I don't get it...
The other three look at him.
PRIMATE WOMEN work in stooped-over positions, trying to pound
roots and tend fires while BABY PRIMATES crawl all over them.
They HEAR the Primate Guys' laughter trailing off. They
trade looks; Something seems to pass between them...
Primates Roger, Gene, Lenny and Phil get to the grounds and
SEE PRIMATES PETE and LOUIE already there. These two don't
have the rock slabs though.

PRIMATE ROGER
Grunt grunt?0
Whassup?
PRIMATE PETE
Grunt grunt grunt. 0
Nothing. We've been hunting.
PRIMATE GENE
Grunt grunt? 0
Where are your jagged rock slabs?
PRIMATE LOUIE
Grunt? 
Slabs?
(looks at Primate
PETE)
Grunt grunt grunt? 
Who needs slabs?
Primate Pete laughs with him; then holds up a ROUND ROCK,
about the size of a grapefruit. Primate Roger and Primate
Gene trade looks with Primate Lenny and Primate Phil.
Grunting/subtitles continue.
FIRST FOUR PRIMATES
Ooooohhhh.
Ooooohhhh.
PRIMATE ROGER
Where'd you get that?
PRIMATE PETE
Primate Discount Manny. He just got
them in.
PRIMATE ROGER
Mind if I have a look?
PRIMATE PETE
Be my guest.
He hands it over. Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock
slab to check it out. His buddies gather round.
PRIMATE GENE
How do you kill an animal with that?
PRIMATE LOUIE
You throw it.
14.
PRIMATE LENNY
You mean you don't chase the old
ones until they get tired and then
hit them with the jagged rock slabs?
PRIMATE PETE
(shakes his head)
You can stand in one place all day.
And when they go by, you just let
loose.
He shows a throwing motion. The first four look intrigued.
PRIMATE LOUIE
You can carry more than one - and if
you're throwing uphill, it rolls
back down if you miss. It's so much
easier with these.
PRIMATE GENE
-- I'm sticking with mine.
(then off their looks)
We've been using these jagged slabs
forever. And you know why? Because
they work. And anyway, killing them
is only half of it -- how are you
gonna skin a wildebeest with that?
They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how? But he's there.
PRIMATE PETE
We get the women to do it.
They look among themselves. They like it. But then.
PRIMATE ROGER
How?
PRIMATE PETE
-- I'm working on it.
CUT TO:
The PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires
and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS
O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE
POV FROM RIDGE --
The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs
and without any animals. But they are having great fun:
15.
running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS
back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like
the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in
terms of all they need now is beer.
The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more,
something seems to pass between them...
CUT TO:
Primate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock. He gives
it such a look.
16.
Then looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he
can...
AND THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE ROCK, UP, UP, IN SLOW MOTION,
PEAKING, THEN STARTING ITS DESCENT BACK TO EARTH -- ONLY NOW
IT'S NOT A ROCK BUT A WINDOWS --
CUT TO:
Shrouded in fog. EXPLORER ROGER scans the horizon through a
spyglass. Next to him is long-suffering EXPLORER ELAINE.
EXPLORER ELAINE
Well did you ask?
EXPLORER ROGER
This is a shortcut.
Explorer Elaine shakes her head. Dave enters.
DAVE
There's a very simple reason why
guys don't ask for directions. It's
because they know that if they do,
someone else - most likely Visigoths -
will come and steal their woman.
CAMERA PANS to the side rails, where a CLUSTER OF HUNGRY
VISIGOTHS nod, slobbering, confirming this.
EXPLORER ELAINE
I just want to get to Colonial
America.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "GUYS IN COLONIAL AMERICA"
A bunch of GUYS dressed as Indians are throwing barrels into
the water. A COLONIAL REPORTER interviews COLONIAL ROGER.
COLONIAL REPORTER
-- and this is your way of expressing
the public outrage over the high-
handed anti-democratic actions of
the British Government in general
and King George III in specific?
COLONIAL ROGER
(looks a little nervous)
Uh, yeah.
18.
COLONIAL REPORTER
Might I ask, sir, whose idea was
this?
COLONIAL ROGER
(POINTS)
Guy over there.
COLONIAL REPORTER
The one drinking coffee?
COLONIAL ROGER
That's him. His name's Starbuck.
He said to get rid of all the tea.
COLONIAL REPORTER
(NODS; THEN)
I see. One more question. Aren't
those Greek fraternity letters painted
on your chest?
The Guy looks; GREEK LETTERS in greasepaint.
COLONIAL ROGER
I didn't do that.
(then as the Reporter
WAITS)
Don't tell anyone.
CUT TO:
FOUR MIAMI GIRLS, ethnically cross-sectioned. LILA. MIA.
SIDRA. KARLA E.
LILA
Well that's pretty much how it is
right now, right? They don't grow
up. Or, they grow up, but they
don't change.
MIA
(NODS)
You want to know how to spot a guy,
there's your first clue: Look for an
otherwise man who did not grow up.
SIDRA
No they grow up all right -- but
only just enough - you know?
(MORE)
19.
SIDRA (CONT'D)
Like they'll meet the absolute minimum
requirements of being a man, but
that's it. The rest of the time
they're fourth-graders. Walking
fourth-graders.
KARLA E
More like driving fourth graders.
SIDRA
With credit cards.
LILA
And a phone.
MIA
And give them ten minutes on their
own? Or put them in with other guys?
Now you've gone nuclear.
KARLA E
Please.
CUT TO:
The lot is filled with 60's and 70's cars. Dave gets out of
a CHEVY VEGA; has mutton-chop sideburns, talks to CAMERA.
DAVE
In learning to understand Guys today,
it's important to remember that these
same guys, only yesterday, were just
kids.
CUT TO :
Dave stands in front of the entrance.
DAVE
A lot of work has been done in the
field of children's toys and how
they unconsciously reinforce gender
roles. Studies have found that over
ninety-three per cent of this work
is done by researchers who don't
have children of their own. But to
test the theory anyway, we're here
at Toy World Warehouse Planet.
CUT TO:
New Father Gene meets up with NEW MOTHER KELLY at the car.
She came from GROCERY WORLD; he helps load up the bags...
NEW MOTHER KELLY
What's this?
NEW FATHER GENE
(looks, sees the toy
STORE BOX)
Oh I got that for Benjy.
NEW MOTHER KELLY
You were supposed to get a rattle.
NEW FATHER GENE
All the rattles were recalled.
NEW MOTHER KELLY
So you bought a tank.
NEW FATHER GENE
Wait'll you see what this can do,
baby. Benjy's gonna love it.
NEW MOTHER KELLY
Oh yeah? Can he shake it? Will it
rattle?
NEW FATHER GENE
Rattle? This thing'll bring down a
bookshelf!
She looks at him. He'll be returning the thing within
seconds. CAMERA PANS to Dave, who shrugs.
CUT TO:
A rundown place with junked cars out front. ED's an intense
little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos.
ED
Well I'm into fireworks. I like to
take 'em apart, you know. And study
'em. See what makes 'em tick.
24.
He shows Dave a box with ASSORTED FIREWORKS inside.
ED
I just got these from Ohio. I don't
think they're as good as the ones I
got from Tennessee. Not as loud,
you know?
DAVE
Well no, if loud is your --
ED
If you want to hear loud - listen to
this.
He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a
stick of dynamite. Gets ready to light it; turns to CAMERA.
ED
You may want to step back a couple
hundred yards.
CUT TO:
A PHILADELPHIA GIRL stands outside a CHEESESTEAK PLACE.
PHILADELPHIA GIRL
Guys at work? Or guys doing work.

PHILADELPHIA GIRL (CONT'D)
I mean unless you want to talk about
faxing or emailing their stupid jokes
back and forth. Sick jokes.
CUT TO:
Dave and a SEASONED BROKER eat HOT DOGS from a CORNER CART.
BROKER
Ten, fifteen years ago? A guy would
call you up with some joke he just
heard. So you wanna pass it on,
it's by phone. One person at a time.
Then a while later, some guy calls
you up with the same exact joke.
Then when group faxing came in, it
really sped things up. Next thing
you know there's like ten faxes on
your machine, from places you never
even heard of. Places around the
world, I'm saying.
DAVE
And how long would that take.
BROKER
A run of the mill, 'guy walks into a
bar' joke, those'd take about .a. week
to come back to you. The topical
ones, your mass murders and tragic
accidents and the like, they're
naturally gonna have a lot more heat
on them and they'll circulate a lot
quicker. I mean no one's gonna sit
on a Princess Diana joke until three
weeks after the crash. No one i
know, anyway.
(THEN CHEWING)
Now there's the internet -- and what
used to take a week'll take like
seconds. I'm telling you it's getting
harder and harder to keep up.
DAVE
A lot of people don't understand the
attention and the kind of importance
these jokes have.
BROKER
Who.

BROKER (CONT'D)

Oh you mean women? Well, you know -
what's the importance of having
fifteen pairs of shoes?
DAVE
No one knows that.

TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"
The FOUR GUYS crouch in their starting stance. A SECRETARY
stands at the end of a marked-off course with a stopwatch
and a whistle. She blows the whistle. They're off.
SLOW MOTION WITH MUSIC
All four guys explode off the line. Patrick gets five strides
and goes down. Tom gets two more and falls, howling in pain.
Then Gene and Roger, neck and neck for at least three more
strides until Roger HEARS A "POP," that ECHOES over the music,
and goes toppling down. As Gene finishes alone - gripping
his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory.
29.
MUSIC FADES AS
DISSOLVE TO:
It says so on the SIGN. ANOTHER SIGN, like an international
road sign, has a graphic of a HAND IN A RUBBER GLOVE with a
RED LINE through it. There are also SPORTS TEAM BANNERS.
CUT TO:
ROGER and ELAINE get out of Roger's car. Elaine has an
armload of magazines.
ELAINE
Now remember. Gene's dad is real
sick. Kelly says he doesn't talk
about it. So see if you can draw
him out.
ROGER
He already did talk about it.
ELAINE
Oh? What did he say?
ROGER
He said his dad is real sick.
She gives him a look. Gets to the door.
ROGER
What are those?
ELAINE
Kelly's boss is turning forty.
ROGER
So you're giving her magazines?
ELAINE
(a look; then)
Just see if you can get him to talk.
CUT TO:
PEOPLE with NAMETAGS mingle with drinks and appetizers.
Dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul.
DAVE
-- They discovered they had something
in common right away.
He points to ROGER and ELAINE, over by a tiki-torch.
ELAINE
You're kidding! That was you? At
the Burger King?
ROGER
I was in fourth grade.
ELAINE
I was too! But my God, you remembered
that?
DAVE
(off Roger's nod)
She loved that he remembered that.
CUT TO:
Roger opens Elaine's door for her, then goes around. She
lingers, watches him before she gets in.
ROGER
What.
ELAINE
Nothing...
She smiles; gets in. Roger pauses. CAMERA PANS TO DAVE.
DAVE
Roger has no idea that this was a
defining moment for her.
Roger gets in. Fuzzy but not sure why.
CUT TO:
Roger drives away. Elaine goes into her building. Already
dialing her cell phone...
43.
BLAINE
Come on, Kelly -- pick up.
CUT TO:
Elaine huddles with Kelly.
KELLY
.and you said 'there's no knight.'
44.
ELAINE
(NODS)
- and no horse.
KELLY
Did you say 'no knight and no horse,'
or 'no horse and no knight?'
She looks at Elaine.. This is crucial.
ELAINE
I said 'no knight.' And then I said
'no horse.'
(THEN)
I know he agreed to the knight.
KELLY
But maybe not the horse.
Elaine racks her brain; just can't say for sure.
KELLY
It's probably not important...
(then watching her)
This is really it for you. Isn't
it.
ELAINE
(looks at her; nods)
Really it.
KELLY
(glad for her)
Does he know it?
Elaine looks up; she has no idea.
CUT TO:
Roger and Gene get ready for some 1 on 1. Roger passes to
Gene...
ROGER
Check.
.who passes it right back.
GENE
Check.
45.
Roger takes the ball, dribbles, almost starts but doesn't.
Gene looks at him.
ROGER
Listen.
GENE
What.
ROGER
(a beat; then)
-- Elaine and I.
GENE
Elaine and you what.
ROGER
(a beat; then he shrugs)
We sort of have this -- thing.
He looks at Gene. Conveys the full impact of this. Then --
ROGER
Did she ever mention owning a horse?
GENE
Who.
ROGER
Elaine. She ever talk about horses?
Like, to Kelly or something?
GENE
Not that I know of. Why?
Roger thinks.. .then shakes it off. Throws the ball to Gene.
ROGER
What's the score.
GENE
We haven't started yet.
They start to play. CAMERA FINDS DAVE, on a nearby bench.
DAVE
Roger's in love.
CUT TO:
Dave walks out, talks to the CAMERA.
DAVE
Contrary to what many women believe,
it's fairly easy to develop a long
term, stable, intimate and mutually
fulfilling relationship with a guy.
As long as this is the guy:
QUICK SHOT OF A LABRADOR RETRIEVER -- PANTING, FRIENDLY.
DAVE
With human guys, it's extremely
difficult. This is because guys
don't really grasp what women mean
by the term 'relationship.'
CUT TO:
A JERSEY GIRL on break at a SNACK HUT.
JERSEY GIRL
What I don't get is how they can be
a fully grown adult male and not be
able to make a commitment to a woman
who loves him like no one else - and
yet the same person, at age seven,
could make an unbreakable lifelong
commitment to the San Francisco
Giants, who do not even know him and
who never will.
(shakes her head)
I just don't get it.
CUT TO:
A SEATTLE GIRL outside the cafe.
50.
SEATTLE GIRL
They're never "ready." If you ask
me, guys are in a permanent state of
nonreadiness. That's where they
live. If guys were turkey breasts,
you could put one in a 350 degree
oven on the Fourth of July and they
still wouldn't be ready in time for
Thanksgiving.
CUT TO:
The OWNER arranges titles on a display outside her store.
CHICAGO GIRL
The thing is, you shouldn't even
think about marrying them until you
really know them. But you can't

STEVE leaves someone's house, heads for his super-outfitted
TRUCK. Haloed in golden sunlight. Strong, capable, equipped
for every situation.
WOMEN look out from kitchen and bedroom and living room
windows, from front steps and yards and gardens, just to see
whose house Steve is leaving. The women look all dreamy the
way they would in a really corny musical.
DAVE
(watching; to CAMERA)
As far as women are concerned, God
didn't really rest on the seventh
day. On the seventh day, God created
Steve.
As the Women all sigh...
CUT TO:
Elaine sits on the step, looking blank. Kelly is with her.
There are LOUD NOISES from the basement.
ELAINE
I don't know why he does this. He
doesn't know what he's doing down
there...
KELLY
It'll be all right.
54.
ELAINE
(off a loud CLANG)
It's not like some broken part is
just going to be standing there,
waving a flag that says "Help me."
Or there'll be an octopus on the
compressor, and then he could say,
"Look! There's an octopus on the
compressor!"
(THEN)
Of course, how would he know it was
the compressor...
KELLY
Trust me, it'll all work out. After
a while, there's no more harm they
can do.
Roger comes around from the side door. SLOSHING feet. Holds
a dripping PART.
ROGER
I just need to go to the hardware
store. Hi Kelly.
Kelly smiles, waves. Then as Roger sloshes past, to the
car.
ELAINE
And what is it about the hardware
store? All they do in there is buy
a bunch of tools that they don't
know how to use -- and no matter
what the problem is, all they'll end
up doing is whacking at it with a
hammer until it breaks even more.
KELLY
And then they cover it all up with
duct tape and then come out and say
it's supposed to work that way.
ELAINE
(SOLIDARITY NOD)
Then we have to call Steve. And
they get offended.
CUT TO:
Roger puts the tool set in his trunk...then stops.
ROGER
The thing is - I missed out.
(turns to CAMERA)
It's like everyone else was there
the day they taught all this stuff.
How to look inside acar.Or a
furnace. Or a rocketship.But the
guys like Steve, youknow.They
were born knowing allthis- and now
they're laughing.

STEVE also arriving. LAUGHTER pours out from inside.
CUT TO:
Steve rings the bell. Elaine tries opening the door.
ELAINE
(on other side)
I'm sorry - the door's stuck.
STEVE
I can fix that.
He checks it out, taps it in one place and opens the door.
Elaine steps aside, enchanted --
-- as Roger drives up and sees this. And the pain in his
heart is something we can feel.
CUT TO:
Steve is packing up his truck. Roger is about to go back
INSIDE WHEN:
KID
Dad, look! Look what Steve made me!
A working battleship made entirely
out of Coke cans!
Roger looks. It is a working battleship made from Coke cans.
KID
This is so neat! Thanks, Steve!
The kid runs off. Roger looks at Elaine.
ROGER
Do we have a kid?
ELAINE
Steve got him from the truck.
CUT TO:
Dave reports as BLUE AND RED CONCERN RAYS materialize from
the sky and descend on the arena, covering the roof.
DAVE
And it is here, at the arena, where
the combined Concern Rays from both
teams' fans will be measured - not
just for quantity, but for quality.
Because this - as every Guy must
believe - is what wins ball games.
BACK TO ROGER AND GENE AT THE TV
Dave steps away and the PICTURE UN-FREEZES.
TV ANNOUNCER
He sets...he takes the shot...it's

Roger and Gene leap up and scream. High fives, victory dance.

There is a SATELLITE DISH on top. Dave is with JOHN MADDEN.
DAVE
With me now is the great John Madden --
legendary coach of football's Oakland
Raiders and veteran network analyst
for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports
Network. John, thanks for coming by
today.
JOHN MADDEN
Happy to be here Dave.
DAVE
John, you heard what our leading
expert said about this particular
anxiety that guys have regarding
bathrooms in general and public ones
in particular. Any thoughts?
JOHN MADDEN
Well he's exactly right, Dave. I
mean the guy was a little loopy but
he hit the nail on the head.
DAVE
So an airport bathroom presents a
specific kind of challenge.
67.
JOHN MADDEN
The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta
ways. Because a guy's main goal is
to get in and outta there without
having to deal in any other way with
any other guy - and in an airport
bathroom especially, with the turnover
rate they've got, he's up against
some pretty mean odds.
DAVE
Couldn't agree more, John. Let's go
INSIDE --
CUT TO:
Dave walks the campus. Threads through GORGEOUS COLLEGE
GIRLS who don't know he's there.
DAVE
If there's anything that causes more
anguish in a guy than sports anguish,
and public restroom anguish, and
hardware store anguish, it's the day
that he realizes that somehow his
life is half over now, and no matter
what he tries to tell himself, he's
not young anymore and he's never
going to be young again.
(then he stops)
And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks.
CUT TO:
JOHNNY LAKE lifts a titanium frame up onto the back of a
pickup. Part of it catches on the lift gate and he SWEARS,
kicking it. About to really lay into it when the LAWYER
drives up in his twin turbo convertible and gets out.
LAWYER
Hi!
JOHNNY LAKE
Sorry. We're closed.
LAWYER
(stunned; watches him)
-- It's two thirty in the afternoon.
JOHNNY LAKE
Hey. I don't make the rules.
LAWYER
Aren't you the owner?
JOHNNY LAKE
You're right. I do make the rules.
We're closed.
75.
LAWYER
(sees he means it)
Look, there has to -- I really want
to learn this -- I just quit my job
to learn this.
JOHNNY LAKE
Be my guest - learn it.
He kicks the frame again, walks off. The Lawyer watches.
LAWYER
How can you do this? This is the
perfect job!
JOHNNY LAKE
Yeah right. Driving around in a
rusted worthless pickup truck that's
about to be repossessed anyway, while
a guy like you, my own age, is going
around in a Porsche Carrera.
LAWYER
But you get to fly.
JOHNNY LAKE
No, you get to fly. I get to hoof
this shit up and down these
godforsaken hilltops listening to
stockbrokers brag about getting lap
dances from college coeds, and
charging the whole thing through the
company expense account -- while I
can't even deduct my blood pressure
medication. That's what I get to
do.
He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough
so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the
dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge --
JOHNNY LAKE
Ahh, SHIT!
-- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead.
CUT TO:
The lot is filled with Ford Fiestas. The Lawyer and Johnny
Lake drive up. When they pull the door open there's WHINING
from inside...
Then the BARTENDER FROM BEFORE comes out, storms past them
and throws his rag down hard as he gets the hell out of there
and away from that shit job.
As Dave walks into frame, starts over to his car.
DAVE
Okay! Well it looks like it's time
to talk about sex.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC RESTROOM PROBLEM"
DAVE (V.0.)
Will you knock it off?
CUT TO:
Dave gets out of his car and walks towards the mall.
DAVE
For the sake of any younger viewers
who might still be paying attention,
during this next segment we will be
using certain euphemisms to describe
a natural and wonderful thing that
happens among grownups - grownups
besides your parents, that is.
CUT TO:
Dave walks outside, past a line of SCHOOLKIDS off a BUS.
DAVE
It all goes back to a time, millions
of years ago, when primitive males
often had to complete their part of
the equation quickly and right away
stand ready to fight off attackers.
CUT TO:
Dave stands outside while Kelly and Gene come back from
walking their dog. In a hurry.
DAVE
one technique for holding back the
inevitable, is when the guy - just
when he is about to have his euphemism -
will hurl himself violently into an
iron bed railing, and raise a lump
on his head the size of a golf ball.
CUT TO:
Dave watches the LIGHT GO OFF. Turns back to the CAMERA.
DAVE
In cases where there aren't any iron
railings, a good backup technique
can be found right on the end of the
cold wet nose of the trusted family
dog.
CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear:
81.
KELLY
Yes...yes...
GENE
.yesyesyesyes...yesyesyesyes...
KELLY
.just hold on...yes...
GENE
.yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW!!!
CAMERA PANS back to Dave.
DAVE
There are also mental techniques --
CUT TO:
Long shadows. PRIMATE WOMEN are still at it, pounding roots
and dealing with PRIMATE KIDS.
CUT TO:
Primate Elaine addresses the OTHERS. All SUBTITLES.
PRIMATE ELAINE
I've been thinking. We need some
standards around here.
PRIMATE KELLY
What are standards?
84.
PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
What is 'thinking?'
The others turn, look at her. Look back at Primate Blaine.
PRIMATE ELAINE
Standards are like rules. Things
they'll have to do. And things
they'll have to stop doing.
PRIMATE KELLY
How about "no leaving your dirty
smelly loincloths wherever you feel
like it, and expecting me to do
something about it?" Can that be a
standard?
PRIMATE ELAINE
That can be one of the first.
PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
How about "No gnawing on a fish head
during sex?"
PRIMATE ELAINE
There are all kinds of things we can
get them to do.
PRIMATE LUCY
How? They're stronger than we are.
PRIMATE KELLY
They smell stronger maybe.
PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
(off their laughter)
I like the smell.
PRIMATE LUCY
Of the men, or the rotten fish?
PRIMATE KELLY
There's a difference?
More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine.
PRIMATE KELLY
But how will we make them go along?
Most of them can't even remember
which cave to come home to every
night. How are they going to remember
rules?
85.
PRIMATE ELAINE
We'll give them a Look.
PRIMATE LUCY
A look?
PRIMATE ELAINE
A special look. A 'Certain Look.'
PRIMATE KELLY
But we look at them every day. And
they still do whatever they want.
PRIMATE ELAINE
(as the others agree)
I've been working on this. Watch.
She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd.
On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd.
PRIMATE ELAINE
See? And she wasn't even doing
anything.
Agreements and "Wows" go all around.
PRIMATE ELAINE
Now who's with me.
CUT TO:
VARIOUS SHOTS, QUICK CUTS OF THE PRIMATE WOMEN TRYING TO GET
THE "LOOK" RIGHT. EVENTUALLY, EVEN PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
GETS IT. . .ALTHOUGH AT ONE POINT SHE SCARES HERSELF AND DROPS
THE GOURD AGAIN.
CUT TO:
The Primate Guys come back lugging ANIMAL PARTS. Each now
has his own ROCK, instead of the giant jagged slabs.
PRIMATE GENE
What are you doing later.
PRIMATE ROGER
I don't know. Probably just stare
at the fire.
86.
PRIMATE GENE
A bunch of us are going over to
Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see
what she does with those gourds.
Want to come?
PRIMATE ROGER
-- Can't. Primate Elaine's ancestors
are still here.
PRIMATE GENE
Bummer.
PRIMATE ROGER
Tell me about it.
(THEN)
They are so Ice Age...
CUT TO:
Dave strolls among the SHOPPERS, TOURISTS etc. He has the
ROCK with him; tosses it unconsciously like a baseball.
89.
DAVE
This is basically where we stand
today. The only difference is, we
have way more standards.
(gives the ROCK to a
KID passing by)
There are social standards, about
being sensitive - remembering
anniversaries, listening during
conversations, not eating soup with
your hands, or sitting around in
your underwear when company's over.
CUT TO:
SEATTLE GIRL
Take laundry. To him his clean
clothes are ready when he's ready to
go get them. And they can dry the
rest of the way in the drawer. But
they don't dry the rest of the way
in the drawer, they sit there in
damp musty unfolded balls and he
doesn't even mind, and I can't figure
that out. What is the matter with
folding something? What is the matter
with waiting for it to be dry?
CUT TO:
Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila.
They take turns focus group style.
SIDRA
Sometimes I think they're just like
tapeworms. You know? I mean
tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's
all they are, and all they'll ever
be. They're just these repulsive
little parasitic beasts and nobody
expects anything different from them -
because people know that's their
nature. And it's the same way with
guys - although a tapeworm's more
likely to help clean out the garage.
LILA
(NODS)
They have to be the biggest and they
have to be the best. And they can
never back down from a challenge.
Ever.
92
KARLA E
They sleep with your sister and wonder
what's wrong with that.
MIA
They will make a game out of anything.
A contest out of anything. Give
them a grain of sand and they will
figure out some game with it.
LILA
And they'll argue over the rules.
KARLA E
(off their agreement)
They leave their dirty dishes
everywhere. I can't believe the
places I'll find some crusted over
cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of
God knows what in them. And the
thing is, from his point of view?
They really do get cleaned by magic!
Because I can't take seeing them sit
there, so I clean them.
SIDRA
(to Karla E)
I just get him to wash my car when
that stuff happens.
KARLA E
Sweetheart he could wash my car with
his tongue and it still wouldn't
make up for where I find those dishes
sometimes.
DAVE
(while they commiserate)
So now that we've heard your thoughts.
The frustration, the exasperation...
the obvious question comes to mind:
Why go through it? Why have guys in
your life at all?
They look at him.
MIA
-- You mean as a choice? You mean
like a mature adult choice to have a
guy in your life? In spite of
everything?
93
SIDRA
Like trying to borrow money from
you, after you've broken up, so he
can buy something for his new
girlfriend? And wondering what the
problem was with that? I mean like
really not knowing?
Dave looks at her. They all do. Until --
LILA
I'll tell you why. There is no good
reason, that's why.
The others turn, look her way.
LILA
-- I mean don't get me wrong. They
really can be fun. You know, like a
big stupid dog can be fun. I mean
not everything has to be so serious
in life. You want to be able to do
more with someone than just read
book reviews together - which is
something a guy would never do anyway.
(then as the others
LISTEN CLOSER)
But what a guy will do? Is at eleven
o'clock at night he'll show up at
your door and bring cheese steaks.
And he doesn't care that you look
all rumply and dreadful from not
expecting anyone. He might not even
remember that you're a vegetarian
and don't eat cheese steaks -- but
that doesn't really matter either.
Because the point is he wanted one,
and he can't come out and say it but
he didn't want to eat it alone.
MIA
And you're the person he thought of.
LILA
(off her look; nods)
I can't tell you what that feels
like, when they do that.
(a beat; and then)
I swear, if they knew how adorable
they are sometimes, they'd be
dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous.
The other Girls think about that. Considering...
94.
SIDRA
-- Bullshit. They're tapeworms.
The rest of them agree and all high-five her. Dave leans
back from the fray, turns to the CAMERA.
DAVE
I think it's time for the conclusion
now.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "THE CONCLUSION"
A SIGN says "UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT." Dave is on top of the
hill, in a rig that the EX-LAWYER is fastening him into.
DAVE
Well now you know where things stand.
You've learned a little bit about
guys, and the critical roles they've
played in the past and in modern
society today. And for better or
worse, they're here with us to stay --
so the best thing you can do about
it, is continue to learn about them -
by coming to see this movie lots and
lots of times, and bringing more and
more of your friends back every time
you do. Because the more people
that understand guys, the better for
everyone. And the more people that --
(as the Lawyer launches
HIM)
-- WHOAAAAAAAALII
Off he goes. . .right out of frame, and --
FADE TO BLACK.
MUSIC AND END CREDITS BEGIN, AS --
CUT TO:
A PICTURE OF ROGER AND ELAINE, IN ROGER'S CAR
SUBTITLE: Roger now owns a 104-piece tool set, and he has
successfully attempted to change his first switchplate.
A PICTURE OF ELAINE WITH HER HEAD AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR
95.
SUBTITLE: Elaine has an open line of credit with Steve.
A PICTURE OF GENE AND KELLY, AT A DANCE CLASS
SUBTITLE: Gene and Kelly won the Fred and Ginger Award in
three straight ballroom competitions. Gene was right; they
belong together.
A PICTURE OF SHERYL CROW, IN CONCERT
SUBTITLE: Sheryl Crow gave a concert in Central Park for
half a million people a while back. We weren't there, but
we have it on CD.
A PICTURE OF RICHARD M. NIXON WAVING GOODBYE
SUBTITLE: Richard M. Nixon was finally elected President in
1968. He held that position until August, 1974, when he
resigned in disgrace.
A PICTURE OF AGENTS LEOPOLD AND STEARNS
SUBTITLE: Agent Leopold and Agent Stearns were fired by the
FBI for gross incompetence. They now work in network
television.
A PICTURE OF THE BRITISH GUY WHO PLAYED EVERY EXPERT
SUBTITLE: This man is not really an expert. If you see him,
don't listen to any of his opinions.
A PICTURE OF A BALLPLAYER, WITH HIS FACE BLURRED OUT
SUBTITLE: Rufino Lupenza is an imaginary ballplayer, created
by the filmmakers to prove a point. However, if he did exist,
and if he were any good, the Yankees probably would get him.
And that would suck.
A PICTURE OF JOHN MADDEN ON A TV SCREEN. WHICH THEN COMES
ALIVE --
JOHN MADDEN
Now these are the kinda end credits
you like to see. You got the final
update thing goin', where you find
out how all the characters you've
been watchin' are gonna turn out.
You got good music, a lively kinda
feel, and maybe most of all, the
movie itself isn't too long --
He reacts now, looking down at the TAIL CREDITS as they start
speeding up.
96.
JOHN MADDEN
-- that's how you know it's a real
movie, in my book. That's how you
know it's not some boring kinda art
piece made by these tortured head
case kids fresh outta film school --
you're not gonna come outta this
theater talkin' about symbolism, or
the use of darkness and light or any
kinda mumbo-jumbo like that -- you
come out of this movie and you're
laughin'. And that's what I like in
a movie - a movie that's funny but
it doesn't take forever, you know?
You still got some time to do
somethin' after, maybe go get
somethin' to eat, y'know? Because
the guys behind the thing knew enough
not to drag on and on and --
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "THE END"
As the MUSIC FADES.. .and it's QUIET. A good quiet...
DAVE (V.0.)
Hey what do you know? We got through
the whole entire thing without saying
"booger."
