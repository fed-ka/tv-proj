                         And finally tonight, a young boy 
                         from South Park, Colorado found 
                         something very interesting during a 
                         field trip today. Here with a special 
                         report is a quadriplegic Swiss man 
                         on a pony.


               Back in the studio, the guy is at his desk, with a live image 
               of the reporter behind him.

                                     ANCHOR
                         Thanks, Tom. Those are some cute, 
                         cute kids. Except for that last one, 
                         he's a little tubby.

               The image WHIPS to Cartman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY!!


               The boys walk into Kyle's house.

                                     STAN
                         What are you gonna do with it, dude?

                                     KYLE
                         I'm gonna put it in my room, where 
                         Cartman can't find it!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh I'll find it, don't worry!!

               Kyle goes into his room and slams the door. Cartman tries 
               the knob, but the door is locked.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Goddammit! Give my triangle! Kyle! 
                         Seriously!

                                     STAN
                         You DID throw it away, Cartman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I was just setting it aside.

                                     STAN
                         Well, you might as well let it go.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Never! I'll get that triangle if 
                         it's the last thing I do!!


               Chef is in the kitchen, stirring up a large bowl of something 
               indistinguishable.

                                     CHEF
                              (Rap/Singing)
                         Gimme a little bit of that pepper. 
                         Gimme a little bit of that salt. Put 
                         it in the skillet and cook it-

                                     VOICE
                         Excuse me, sir...

               Chef turns around to see a plain looking man with a beard.

                                     CHEF
                         Can I help -- Hey, you're that movie 
                         critic guy on TV!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Leonard Maltin, yes.

                                     CHEF
                         Well I'll be a teenage girl backstage 
                         at an Aerosmith concert! Leonard 
                         Maltin in MY cafeteria! I'm Chef.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         I know who you are. You must listen 
                         to me, Chef. We have precious little 
                         time. Have you seen Barbara Streisand 
                         recently?

                                     CHEF
                         Barbara Streisand? You mean like, 
                         THE Barbara Streisand?

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                              (Snapping)
                         HAVE YOU SEEN HER?!?!

                                     CHEF
                         No! Not since Yentl!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Thank God, then I'm not too late.

                                     CHEF
                         Too late for what?

               Leonard steps closer to Chef.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Chef, it is of the utmost importance 
                         that you tell me where those little 
                         boys from the news report on TV are.

               Chef thinks.

                                     CHEF
                         Why do you care?


               Babs stands on her balcony overlooking the town and tapping 
               her fingers much like the Grinch.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         He has it Milo... That little bastard 
                         has the triangle.

                                     MILO
                         Are you sure?

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         I'm sure! He knew about the symbol 
                         of Krulock!!

               Bab's walks into the living room. Milo follows her.

                                     MILO
                         Then why don't we go get it?

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         A cop showed up. He's a clever one. 
                         I can't blow everything now that I'm 
                         this close. Everything must be handled 
                         very carefully.

               Now babs walks over to a bookcase and hits a button on it. 
               Immediately, the bookcase spins around and a huge, hidden 
               glass case reveals itself.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         How many years has it been, Milo? 
                         Thirty? Forty?

               Streisand walks up to the case and peers in.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         For so long I have waited to find 
                         the other triangle...

               We ZOOM in on the glass case.

               Inside, in a very strange display, is a small, blue triangle. 
               An empty space next to it, awaits another triangle... Kyle's 
               Triangle.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         And now I am so close... The dawn of 
                         Zinthar is close at hand!!!!

               Babs starts a horrible, maniacal laugh.

               FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK

                                          ACT II


               The inside of Kyle's house is lit softly by moonlight.

               PAN ACROSS Kyle's room.

               Kyle is sleeping soundly in his bed.

               PAN ACROSS further, where we see the triangle displayed 
               proudly on Kyle's dresser.

               A STRANGE SOUND cues the camera to TILT UP to the ceiling, 
               where a circle is being cut by a blue flame.

               The circle completes, and the piece of ceiling falls to the 
               floor.

               Kyle turns a little, but stays asleep.

               Now a rope falls from the ceiling, and a figure, dressed all 
               in black, slides down it.

               We see through the masked eyes of this person. It looks over 
               at Kyle, who tosses and turns, then back to the triangle. It 
               nears the triangle, reaches its black gloved hand towards 
               it...

                                     IKE
                         BABA MAMA BABA MA!!!!

               The figure is startled, and knocks over a glass framed picture 
               on Kyle's dresser. It hits the ground. SMASH!!!!! Kyle jolts 
               awake. Ike jumps in front of the figure.

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman?!

               Cartman takes off his black mask.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You scared the crap out of me, Ike!

                                     KYLE
                         What the hell are you doing?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm trying to get my triangle -- 
                         Wait a minute, I'm not talking to 
                         you!

               Cartman turns to Ike.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was 
                         just trying to get MY triangle back?!!

                                     IKE
                         Baba simi babangle ba.

                                     KYLE
                         Well Ike, YOU can tell CARTMAN that 
                         it's MY TRIANGLE!!

                                     IKE
                         Baba MY babamama.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, you can tell Kyle he's a dirty 
                         goddamn son of a bitch!!

                                     IKE
                         Koyle a goddam sonna ba.

                                     KYLE
                         Alright, alright! If it means that 
                         much to you, TAKE the stupid 
                         triangle!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh?

               Kyle storms over to the dresser and picks up the triangle.

                                     KYLE
                         If it'll make you leave me alone, 
                         then just take the damn thing, here!!

               Kyle hands Cartman the triangle. Cartman is speechless.

                                     KYLE
                         There! Now get out of my house and I 
                         hope you feel really, REALLY good 
                         about yourself!

               Cartman thinks.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hell yeah I do! I got the triangle!

               Cartman happily walks out. Kyle jumps back in bed and pulls 
               the blanket over his head.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Offscreen in distance)
                         I got the tri-angle! I got the tri-
                         angle!


                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Are you sure Barbara Streisand has a 
                         condo up here?

                                     CHEF
                         It was just a rumor... A lot of big 
                         celebrities have mountain condos.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Then we've got to keep looking...

               Chef stops the car.

                                     CHEF
                         Alright, Leonard Maltin, this has 
                         gone far enough! I ain't driving 
                         another mile until you tell me what 
                         this is all about!!

               Leonard Maltin takes a deep breath.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Haven't you ever been curious about 
                         the insanity Barbara Streisand 
                         exhibits?

                                     CHEF
                         Well, I always heard she was kind of 
                         a bitch, but-

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         MORE THAN A BITCH, Mr. Chef!! She is 
                         a calculating, self-centered 
                         egotistical... bitch. She was born 
                         in a small town, her mother was a 
                         Jackel and her father was an insurance 
                         salesman!

                                     CHEF
                              (He gets a chill)
                         Woo... Insurance salesman?

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                              (Rapidly)
                         When she was five, she knew that she 
                         wanted to be a famous singer. But by 
                         the time she was six, her ambitions 
                         became to rule the universe. She 
                         learned of an ancient diamond. The 
                         diamond of Pantheous.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, you know what? Never mind. I 
                         don't need to know all this -- forget 
                         I asked.

               Chef starts to drive again.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                              (Very quickly)
                         Before she was seven, the keepers of 
                         Pantheous learned of this insane 
                         little girl's wish. The diamond was 
                         split up and buried at opposite ends 
                         of the world. But then, during the 
                         shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbara 
                         Streisand found one of the 
                         triangles...

                         And the other triangle is the one 
                         that little Kyle has?

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Yes... Mr. Chef, if Babs gets a hold 
                         of that other triangle, she will 
                         fulfill her prophecy and become the 
                         most threatening thing ever known to 
                         mankind...

                         Mecha-Streisand? Oh man, I don't 
                         know what the hell that means, but 
                         it doesn't sound good!


               A large film crew is shooting around a large set of a living 
               room.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         And... ACTION!!

               Two actors, SIDNEY POITIER and SALLY STRUTHERS are doing a 
               scene together.

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any 
                         other, with dreams and emotions. And 
                         that's why I'll NEVER put a foreign 
                         object up my ass.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Cut! Great, print that! Excellent 
                         work, Sid. Take five guys, let's set 
                         up for the next shot.

               Sidney Poiter goes into his dressing room. The star on his 
               door does tell us this IS Sidney Poitier.


               Sidney walks in and plops down in front of his make-up table.

                                     VOICES
                         HELLO?!

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         Ho?

               Sidney looks down on his make-up table where two very small 
               Japanese girls are standing in an oyster shell.

                                     JAPANESE TWINS
                         You must hurry. A young man has found 
                         the Triangle of Zinthar!

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         Where?!

                                     JAPANESE TWINS
                         A small, pissant white-bread mountain 
                         town in Colorado called 'South Park'.

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         Excellent...

               Sidney smiles, is he evil or good?


               Barbara is back to her normal, bitchy self.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will 
                         be mine, and I WILL BE THE BIGGEST, 
                         MOST FAMOUS PERSON EVER!!!!

               The boys are all chained to the wall. The have shackles around 
               their ankles and wrists.

               Cartman is in the middle, hooked up to some kind of torture 
               device.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Let me go! Seriously!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah! Let us go!!

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         You fools have no idea the powers 
                         that you are meddling with! I'll 
                         teach you to meddle with MY TRIANGLE!!

               Barbara pulls a lever. The ropes holding Cartman start to 
               pull him apart.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AGHAGH!!!! IT'S NOT MY TRIANGLE!! 
                         IT'S KYLE'S!!!!

                                     KYLE
                         HEY! DON'T TRY TO PASS IT BACK ON 
                         ME, FAT ASS!!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Still being pulled 
                              apart)
                         SCREW YOU, HIPPIE!!

               The torture continues. Cartman gets stretched further.

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         WHERE IS THE TRIANGLE OF ZINTHAR?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't remember!

                                     KYLE
                         Goddammit, tell her!! I wanna go 
                         home!!

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         Well... Maybe THIS will help JAR 
                         YOUR MEMORY-

                                     CARTMAN
                         No! Don't!

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                              (Singing)
                         There's a place for us...

                                     CARTMAN
                         AGHAGHAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!

               The boys all shake and struggle to break free.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                              (Music stops)
                         NOW do you remember?!?!

               The boys all gasp for breath, as if they've all been beaten 
               severely.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Damn your black heart, Barbara 
                         Streisand!!

                                     STAN
                         I don't know how much more I can 
                         take, dude.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Alright, YOU ASKED FOR IT!!!
                              (Singing)
                         I'm gonna tell you now...

                                     BOYS
                         NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!


               Chef and Leonard Maltin are still driving.

                                     CHEF
                         I don't know, man... Maybe Barbara 
                         Streisand doesn't have a place up 
                         here after all.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Looks like we'll have to go to plan 
                         B.

                                     CHEF
                         There's a plan B? Why the hell have 
                         we been driving around all night and 
                         day for when there's a plan B?!?!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Have you ever heard of the band called 
                         'The Cure'?

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, come on. Don't tell me The Cure 
                         has something to do with this too!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         No, no... Just the lead singer. AGH!!

               Suddenly, Leonard Maltin grabs his temples.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         AGH!!

                                     CHEF
                         Woa, what's the matter, Leonard 
                         Maltin?!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         She's close! She's very close! I can 
                         feel her.

                                     CHEF
                         Where?!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         She has the boys! They're in trouble!!

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, fudge!!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Keep going this way, hurry!!

               Chef turns a corner and speeds up.


                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                              (Singing)
                         Happiness with you is like happiness 
                         with...

                                     BOYS
                         AAGHAGHAG!!!!

                                     STAN
                         OKAY! OKAY! I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE 
                         TRIANGLE IS!!!

               Babs stops singing.

                                     CARTMAN
                         IT'S INSIDE MY SHOE!!

               Milo dashes over and takes off Cartman's shoe. As soon as he 
               does, the boys all react to the smell.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh, for Christ's sake Cartman! When's 
                         the last time you changed your socks?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         And I suppose YOUR socks smell like 
                         the botanical gardens!

               Milo takes the triangle over to Babs. She holds it up and 
               looks at it with awe.

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         Finally, the triangle is mine!!

               Barbara storms over to the glass case and hits a button on 
               top.

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         After centuries of waiting, I finally 
                         have the triangle of Zinthar!!!

               She reaches into the case and grabs the other triangle.

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         NOW THE DIAMOND OF PANTHEOS IS 
                         COMPLETE!!!

               She slips the smaller blue triangle into the other triangle. 
               Immediately, the pair LOCK together and begin to spin, the 
               levitate of the ground in between the kids and Barbara 
               Striesand.

                                     BARBARA STREISAND
                         SUGOI! KONO HI WA ATARASHII HAJIMARU 
                         DA!! IMA KARA ATASHI NO NAMAE WA...

               A FLASH of brilliant bright light and a laser shoot from the 
               levitating triangles.

                                     STAN
                         Woa dude!!

               It hits Barbara Streisand right in the chest. Instantly she 
               starts to grow. She busts right out of the roof of her condo 
               and keeps growing.

               She keeps growing and expanding until she is a 800 FOOT TALL 
               HUGE METALLIC MONSTER BARBARA STREISAND!

                                     MECHA STREISAND
                         MECHA-BARBARA STREISAND DA!!!!

               Mecha-Babs lets out a tremendous ROAR! and walks off towards 
               South Park leaving the boys chained up in the roofless condo.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, this is pretty fucked up, right 
                         here.


               We are looking towards the Mayor's desk and Window. The Mayor 
               is standing with her back to us looking out the window.

               In the Window, we can see Mecha-Streisand destroying the 
               town.

               Now angle reverses and we see the Mayor's shocked face with 
               wide open jaw.

               In the background, the door opens and one of the aides pops 
               his head in.

                                     AIDE
                         Mayor! Barbara Streisand is-

                                     MAYOR
                              (Still staring out 
                              window)
                         I noticed!!! CALL THE NATIONAL 
                         GUARD!!!

               The aide dashes off, closing the door.

               The Mayor keeps looking out the window as we hear SCREAMING, 
               SIRENS and CRASHES in the distance.

                                     MAYOR
                         We'll get you, you bitch... And to 
                         think, I actually WATCHED your HBO 
                         special...


               Chef and Leonard Maltin run into Barbara's evil lair, where 
               the boys are still chained to the wall.

                         CHILDREN!!

                                     BOYS
                         CHEF!!!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Oh, no!

               Leonard stands next to the broken case where the triangles 
               once were.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         She has joined the two triangles?

                                     CARTMAN
                         YEAH! SHE STOLE MY TRIANGLE!

                                     STAN
                         Get us down from here!!

               Chef runs up to the boys and tries to free them.

                                     CHEF
                              (Struggling)
                         I can't break these locks!!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         Stand back, Chef!

               Chef takes a step away. Leonard Maltin gets in a martial 
               arts pose.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                              (Japanese Accent)
                         MARUTIN RAY!!

               Suddenly, red lasers shoot out of Leonard Maltin's eyes, 
               strike the chains and free the boys.

                                     KYLE
                         Woa! That was cool!!

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         I've got to go after Mecha-Streisand! 
                         Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith 
                         of The Cure at this number.

                                     STAN
                         Robert Smith?! Sweet!!!


               In the FOREGROUND a red telephone rings.

               ROBERT SMITH of The Cure walks over and picks up the phone.

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Hello?

                                     CHEF
                         Uh, yes, is this Robert Smith of the 
                         Cure?

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Yes it is.

                                     CHEF
                         This may sound kind of strange, but 
                         Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.

               Suddenly, Robert Smith's expression becomes very dismal. 
               (More than usual).

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Oh, Barbara Streisand's found the 
                         other triangle, eh?

               Chef looks suprised.


               Jimbo is holding a large rocket launcher as Ned Pilot's the 
               helicopter.

                                     JIMBO
                         GET AROUND SIDE HER, NED!! I CAN'T 
                         GET A SHOT IN FROM HERE!!

                                     NED
                         Okay.

               They fly up near Bab's scary face, her huge eye looks at 
               them with anger.

                                     NED
                              (Flatly)
                         Aaagh. Aaaagh. I'm scared.


               Kyle has the two triangles of Zinthar.

                                     STAN
                         Well, what should we do with the two 
                         triangles now?

                                     KYLE
                         We've got to get rid of them. NOBODY 
                         should have the kind of power Barbara 
                         Streisand wanted.

               Kyle throws the triangles in the trash.

                                     STAN
                         Well, at least I have this sweet 
                         walkie talkie Robert Smith gave me.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No! That's MY walkie-talkie! He gave 
                         it to ME!!

                                     KYLE
                         Dammit, Cartman don't you ever learn 
                         anything?!

               In the back ground, Ike hops over to the trash and reaches 
               in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Come on, Stan! it's MINE! I'll 
                         Roshambo you for it!

                                     STAN
                         Go to hell, Cartman!

               The boys walk outside as Ike picks the two triangles out of 
               the trash.
