                    Very shallow grave.  Done in a 
                    hurry.

      He leads them into the tent.  They look down.  They are 
      terribly shocked.  Danny leaves first.

      Outside the tent Harry and Adam join Danny.

                                  DANNY
                    It s only two hundred yards from 
                    the house.

                    The baby s got a head injury.  The 
                      pathologist thinks his neck s 
                    broken too.

                                  HARRY
                    They dropped him?

                                  ADAM
                    Probably coming out of the window.

                    Dear God.

      Out of the door and Adam is faced with dozens of flashes from 
      press photographers.  He has his hand over his face as he 
      rushes towards them.
