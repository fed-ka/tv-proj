Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.
Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a
TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys
cautiously look around and whisper.
JACOB
You see `em?
RUDY
No. But that doesn't mean they're
not here.
After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking
towards the tree house.
Jacob stays behind, eyeing their
safety.
RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Jacob, come on. It's cool.
Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.
It hits
Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.
Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and
debris come flying at him.
As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his
mask. He quickly runs for the tree.
TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come
running out of the woods, rocks in hand.
Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are
nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a
DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and
unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

Jacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy
crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.
JACOB
What the hell is that?
RUDY
Piss.
Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.
Jacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY
BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted.
RUDY
(calling to Kenny)
Anytime you're ready, dickhead.
LEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner
table, eating pancakes.
His FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8)
and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
LEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all,
crosses to the table, sits and starts eating.
JUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of
syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of
omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks.
YACCO CHUANG (35), Asian-American, sexy, uptight,
psychiatrist, paces the hallway on the phone.
HER DAUGHTER, MALEE (12) with long, black, braided hair and
thick rimmed glasses, peeks her head out of the bathroom.
MALEE
Mom, I need help.
YACCO (INTO PHONE)
(ignoring her)
Any parent is "parent of the year"
next to you, you selfish prick.
Yacco walks off.
Deflated, Malee reenters the bathroom.
Malee is wrapped in a towel and holding a TAMPON. Confused,
she grabs the TAMPON BOX and reads the directions. Malee's
confusion quickly turns to disgust.
Jacob wipes at his head wound, frightened.
JACOB
Maybe I should have mom look at it.
RUDY
If you didn't have that damn mask
on, you'd have seen it coming. Our
birthday comes once a year, and you
ask for a hockey mask. You don't
even play.
JACOB
Jason from "Friday the 13th" wears
one. He's bad ass.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
RUDY
Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home
`cause of a little blood. He'd get
back up, decapitate his victim and
move on.
Jacob looks out the makeshift window in the wall.
JACOB
You think Jeff and Kenny will come
back?
RUDY
I dropped piss on their heads.
I'd
say the odds are pretty good.
MALEE (O.S.)
You did what?
Rudy and Jacob turn to find Malee and Leonard, entering the
tree house.
RUDY
Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped
the piss I've been saving on their
heads.
LEONARD
Why were you saving piss?
RUDY
Just incase. Pretty smart, huh?
JACOB
No, it's stupid cause now they're
gonna come back here and kick all
our asses.
RUDY
Don't be such a pussy.
LEONARD
Yeah, I could probably take them
both myself.
RUDY
What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat
them?
JACOB
All I'm saying is, who cares if
they tear it down.
(CONTINUED)

RUDY
This is OUR place. We've been
coming here since we were seven.
JACOB
Nothing lasts forever.
RUDY
You're such a butt-munch.
Rudy pushes Jacob.
Jacob pushes back.
The two start
fighting.
MALEE
You guys, it's your birthday.
Could you try and get along?
Off the boy's fighting -
Yacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife,
conservatively dressed.
DEBBIE
I don't think therapy is helping.
YACCO
Why do you say that?
Are you still
"cutting"?
Embarrassed, Maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve. We see that
her arm is covered with cuts. Dried blood is everywhere.
Yacco is horrified by the sight.
YACCO (cont'd)
Oh, Debbie.
DEBBIE
It feels much better than it looks.
Really.
Suddenly, Malee bursts into her mother's office.
MALEE
Ma, I... Oops.
YACCO
Malee, out. Now.
MALEE
I'm sorry.
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
Malee quickly exits the office.
YACCO
Excuse me for a moment.
Yacco enters the reception area.
She is obviously angry.
YACCO
I told you a 100 times to knock.
MALEE
I said, I was sorry.
YACCO
Why aren't you with the boys?
MALEE
Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with
their parents.
Yacco crosses to a desk and removes a FLUTE from a drawer.
YACCO
I found this in the backseat of my
car this morning. Do you know how
much flutes cost?
Go outside, sit
on the front steps and practice.
MALEE
But, mom.
YACCO
Now!
Angered, Malee grabs the flute and exits.
Rudy and Jacob stare into the camera with big grins.

RUDY/JACOB
Cheese!
VFX: CAMERA FLASH
The boys relax their poses as ASHLEY and JIM CARGES (30's),
enter the shot. Ashley puts her camera down on the table and
picks up a large PRESENT.
JIM
Okay, you got your small gifts this
morning. Now for the big ones.
ASHLEY
This one is Rudy's.
Rudy rips into the present, revealing a SONY PLAY STATION.
RUDY
Sony play station! Oh my God!
Oh
my God! Yes! Too cool!
JIM
Since neither of you wanted a party
this year, we were able to splurge.
Ashley removes an ENVELOPE from her purse. She hands it to
Jacob. His enthusiasm suddenly turns to worry.
JACOB
What is it?
ASHLEY
Only one way to find out.
Jacob removes a colorful PAMPHLET from the envelope.
JIM
Go ahead, read it.
JACOB
"Plastic Surgery.
Isn't it about
time?"
(horrified)
I don't get it.
ASHLEY
Your father and I are going to pay
to have your birthmark removed.
JIM
Isn't that great.

JACOB
You got me surgery for my birthday?
JIM
Not just one.
A series of them.
RUDY
(overcompensating)
Cool.
JACOB
It's not "cool".
It totally sucks!
Jacob drops the envelope, walks from the room.
JIM
Jacob?
Rudy enters the darkened room and crosses over to Jacob, who
has his face planted in his pillow. Jacob has been crying.
RUDY
Don't sweat it. You can borrow my
play station anytime you want.
JACOB
This isn't about the play station.
It's about this thing on my face.
Everybody hates it.
RUDY
I don't.
JACOB
Who cares what you think? You're
the reason for all of this.
Perfect you with your perfect skin.
There to show the world what I'm
supposed to look like.
(beat)
You know, sometimes I just wish I
wasn't your twin.
RUDY
Screw you! Know what, I take it
back, you can't use my play
station.
Rudy exits the room, slamming the door after him.
10.
We SCAN the room and come to a set of BUNK BEDS.
SFX: ELECTRIC WATCH ALARM
A body in the top bunk sits up and turns on a small bed
light. Reveal, it's RUDY. Rudy grabs his watch from the
post and silences the alarm. Jacob sits up in bed.

JACOB
Rudy.
RUDY
Unless you're coming with me, I
don't want to hear it.
Jacob lies back in bed, silent. Rudy jumps off the top bunk,
gets dressed and grabs a BASEBALL BAT. Before leaving, Rudy
looks back at Jacob and shakes his head, disappointed.
RUDY (cont'd)
You know, you can't be a pussy all
your life.
JACOB
What?
RUDY
Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the
time, and you don't do shit.
JACOB
It's my problem.
RUDY
No, it's mine too. Cause we're
brothers. That's what brothers do.
They fight for each other, kill for
each other, die for each other.
JACOB
I don't feel that way.
RUDY
Cause you're a pussy. So stay
home, keep your head under the
blankets. I'm gonna fight.
With that, Rudy disappears out the window.
FADE TO BLACK:

Some provisions.
RUDY
We're only gonna be here a couple
of hours.
LEONARD
When two o'clock rolls around,
you'll be begging for one of these.
Rudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack.
LEONARD (cont'd)
(re: baseball bat)
I didn't bring my glove.
RUDY
Moron, the bat is for Jeff and
Kenny. You know, to scare them a
little.
He swings it hard.
RUDY (cont'd)
Maybe it's best if we don't talk.
Just listen. Listen for them, and
don't fall asleep.
LEONARD
I'm wide awake. I could stay up
all night.
Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window
and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it
in his sleep, wakes himself up.
LEONARD
Oh, shit.
Rudy jumps awake.

RUDY
What... What is it?
They here?
LEONARD
No.
Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in
the floor. He is about to exit.
RUDY
Where you going?
LEONARD
They're not gonna show up, I'm
goin' home. It's three o'clock-
Suddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window.
It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames.
Rudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming.
RUDY
Put it out! Put it out!
Leonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack,
but it's of no use. He spins around and finds the wall
behind him, engulfed with flames. He screams, terrified.
Leonard backs away from Rudy. Unfortunately, he doesn't
realize that the door in the floor is open.
Ashley jumps up from a deep sleep. There is terror on her
face. She rushes over to her DESK and turns on the LAMP.
Ken is awakened by her.
JIM
Ashley?
What is it?
ASHLEY
I forgot to deposit your paycheck
last week.
JIM
But I already wrote some checks.
ASHLEY
I know. With the cookout and

Malee, intrigued.
GUS
Friend or family?
MALEE
Huh?

Are you trying to make me sick?
Gus shoots Malee a look just as Yacco exits her office.
YACCO
Mr. Maitland?
Gus rises and enters the office.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I'll be with you in a second.
Yacco crosses to Malee and sits beside her.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
So, how was it?
MALEE
It was a funeral, Mom.
How do you
think it was?
YACCO
I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let
Rudy's parents know I'm available
if they need to talk. I won't
charge for the sessions.
Malee looks to Yacco, stunned by her comment.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You know, it's okay to cry.
MALEE
I know it's okay to cry. I don't
need you to tell me, it's okay to
cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.
YACCO
Okay.
Yacco re-enters her office.

Malee starts to cry.
Mourners stand in small groups, engaged in hushed

A number of MOTHERS watch as Ashley obsessively prepares a
platter of deviled eggs. Concerned, one of them crosses over
to her.
MOTHER
Ashley, there's more than enough
food here.
ASHLEY
No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs.
It's right that I make them.
Where's the paprika?
Ashley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika.
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Jesus, you put something down, and
it disappears.
Now angry, Ashley starts throwing objects out of the
cupboards, haphazardly.
MOTHER # 1
Ashley.
Ashley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and
spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen.
ASHLEY
Maybe I threw it out.
Ashley crosses to the garbage. She lifts it upside down and
dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees
and starts searching.
The other women look to each other, uncomfortable.
Mother #

ASHLEY
It's okay.
Ashley stops cold.
The grief and heartache hit once again.
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Not my baby! Please God not my son!
The mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround
Ashley in an attempt to comfort her. They give no care to
the pile of garbage they now sit in.
Leonard lies in a bed, staring out the window. There is a
BANDAGE wrapped around his forehead. Patrick sits beside him
in a chair.
Grace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her.
GRACE
This hospital is a nightmare. The
elevator is never there when you
need it.
Patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch.
PATRICK
Where are the girls?
GRACE
Haley took Sara up to the maternity
ward.
Grace crosses over to Leonard.

scared in my life. And poor Rudy.
Leonard starts crying.
GRACE (cont'd)
What?
LEONARD
My best friend is dead!
Grace hands Leonard a double cheeseburger.
GRACE
Eat this.
It'll make you feel
better.
LEONARD
I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't
taste anything anyway.
GRACE
Hospital food is always bland.
This has flavor.
LEONARD
No, it's because of my condition.
I can't taste or smell anything
anymore.
GRACE
What are you saying, condition?
What condition?
LEONARD
(shrugs)
My condition.
Patrick and Grace sit across from the DOCTOR (50's).
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
DOCTOR
Leonard has a condition.
It's
called Anosmia.
GRACE
Oh my God!
Is it serious?
DOCTOR
No. Anosmia is when a person
looses their sense of smell. It's
not uncommon in patients who suffer
serious head injuries.
Unfortunately, it's also affecting
his ability to taste. Again, not
uncommon.
PATRICK
Is it permanent?
DOCTOR
Depends on the patient.
GRACE
What do we do? He can't eat.
DOCTOR
He can eat. He just can't taste
what he's eating.
PATRICK
What she means is, he won't eat.
DOCTOR
Leonard's association with food is
no longer about taste. It's about
texture. While we may be partial
to sweet or salty foods, Leonard
will become partial to crunchy or
smooth ones. Once he settles on a
texture he likes, his appetite will
increase.
GRACE
I can't believe this is happening.
DOCTOR
Considering what Leonard could have
suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he
is severely overweight. A loss of
appetite may be a benefit.
Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death.
24.
Leonard lies in bed, staring out the window. A NURSE (40)
enters and crosses over to his bedside table.
NURSE
How'd we do?
The nurse sees that Leonard has barely touched his food.
NURSE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You have to eat something. It may
not be gourmet, but you don't look
that finicky.
LEONARD
This stuff feels like shit in my
mouth.
NURSE
It's macaroni and cheese.
LEONARD
It feels gross. Like there's a
film on my tongue.
The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched
apple and places it in Leonard's hand.
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I don't like apples.
NURSE
So, you can't taste it, right?
Maybe you'll like the crunch.
The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A
beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud
CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a
smile comes to his face. He likes it.
Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He
brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories
come back to him.
Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal
LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box
opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some
firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and
Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile.

GABE
This is hardly the time to talk

MR. FARMER
Great. Well, we still have a fall

Malee stands outside Mr. Farmer's office, staring at the SIGN
UP SHEET on his door. After a beat, she lifts her pen to
sign her name. Before she writes it, she stops, quickly
turns around and walks away.
After a beat, Malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts
writing her name. Halfway through, she stops, scratches out
her name and walks off.

some of her therapy sessions.

LEONARD
That's awesome. Can I listen in
sometime?
MALEE
No. Anyway, she says, if a person
wants closure, they gotta deal with
their problems head on. Go see
these guys and let them know how
you feel.
JACOB
I don't think my parents would be
up for that.
MALEE
Go alone. Juvy hall is only like
forty minutes from here. Take the
bus.
Off Jacob, thinking-
The bedroom door slowly opens. Jacob peeks his head inside
the darkened room and quietly enters. He tip toes over to
his parent's bed. Ashley lies asleep, wrapped up in a bundle
of blankets.
Jacob crosses to her night stand and opens the top drawer.
He removes her purse, unzips it and steals some cash, which
totals around 60 dollars.
Jim sits in his chair, staring off into space.
Jacob enters
and crosses to the front door.
JACOB
Bye, Dad.
Jacob and Kenny sit, staring at each other through a plate of
glass. Kenny picks up the ONE WAY PHONE. Jacob does also.
JACOB
Where's Jeff?
KENNY
He's sick.
I think he...
JACOB
(interrupting)
I hate you. You know that?
You
bastard.
KENNY
Rudy knew we were going to be
there. He never should have come.
You want the truth, all this
happened cause of you.
JACOB
Me?
KENNY
Yeah, you deformed retard! The
only reason we started picking on
you guys in the first place was
because of that thing on your face.
JACOB
Every night, I lie in bed and plan
your murder.
KENNY
I'm shaking.
JACOB
First I'm going to take a kitchen
knife and chop off your fingers
then your nose then your tongue.
Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes
with the end of a broomstick.
Well, not really poke them out, but
I'm gonna push them back into your
brain. Then I'm gonna take
scissors and cut off your ears.
When they find you, it's gonna be
like putting a jigsaw puzzle back
together.
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
KENNY
If you kill me, you come here.
JACOB
So? What do I have to look forward
to? You've already destroyed my
life.
KENNY
What happened was an accident.
JACOB
There are no accidents. You're
gonna pay for what you did. And
it's gonna hurt like hell.
Leonard sits, reading through nutritional manuals.
We see that he is writing things down on a piece of paper.
The words written are: Sugar, corn syrup, salt, gum.
Grace walks through the hallway half asleep. She enters the
kitchen and finds Leonard, sitting on the floor, surrounded
by boxes of food. All of the kitchen cupboards are open and
packages line the counter tops.
GRACE
What the hell is this?
LEONARD
I'm reading the list of ingredients
in our foods.
GRACE
Why?
LEONARD
Research. Do you know the damage
these chemicals can do to the human
body?
GRACE
Leonard, put everything back.
LEONARD
This is serious. You can't keep
buying this crap. Don't you care
that you're ingesting garbage?
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
GRACE
Just put everything back and go to
sleep.
Off Leonard's look -
Malee runs up a flight of stairs. She gets off at the second
floor and enters an open, unoccupied office.
Malee runs over to the heating grate and puts her ear to it.
YACCO (FROM BELOW)
How was your week?
GUS (FROM BELOW)
Same. Still can't sleep. When I
do, nightmares.
Yacco and Gus sit across from each other.
YACCO
Post traumatic stress is very
common in your line of work. Many
fire fighters go through this.
GUS
Yeah. But why now? I haven't
fought fires in ten years.
YACCO
Sometimes we experience something
so horrific, our memory blocks it
out. That way we won't have to
relive the pain. It's called
repression. Our bodies are not so
forgiving, however. Inside, we
feel the effects of trauma even
when we don't know why.
GUS
What does that mean?
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
YACCO
Something stirred your unconscious.
If we find out what that was, we
can begin the healing process.
Gus looks to her, confused.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You told me last week, the
nightmares started about the time
you moved here. Let's look at
that. Why did you move here?
GUS
A friend was making good money with
construction. He got an offer to
build that extension off Lindsay
Acres. He suggested I come into
town and work for a while.
SAME TIME
Malee is on the edge of her seat, listening. We see that she
has written the following words in her notebook: GUS -
NIGHTMARES - FIRE.
YACCO (FROM BELOW)
Are there any other reoccurring
elements in your dreams. Perhaps,
a face or...
GUS
"Light my Fire" is always playing.
YACCO
What?
GUS
Light my fire. The Doors song.
(singing)
"Da da something... wallow in the
mire... Da, da... we couldn't get
much higher. Come on baby light my
fire.
Yacco stares at Gus.
He is suddenly self conscious.
YACCO
Interesting.
45.
Malee circles the words "Light My Fire" again and again and
again.
SFX: CLANGING POTS AND PANS, coming from downstairs.
Jacob exits his room and goes to inspect the noise.
Jim stands on a chair, cleaning out the kitchen cupboards.
Pots and pans line the counter tops, dishes cover the table
and non perishable foods are spread out across the floor.
Jacob enters and is taken aback by the sight of Jim standing
on a chair and wearing an APRON and RUBBER GLOVES.
JACOB
Dad?
JIM
Jacob.
JACOB
You okay?
JIM
Fantastic.
Jim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth.
JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You know, for the past few weeks, I
sat in this house. I couldn't
move. Everything reminded me of
Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I
had a revelation. I am alive!
Your mother is alive! I became
overcome with joy because I
realized how lucky we are to still
have you.
JACOB
Me?
JIM
Jacob.
I love you.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
Jim grabs Jacob and hugs him tightly.
Jacob pulls away,
unsettled and bit frightened.
JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
(half crazed)
I went to work today. For the
first time in weeks. It was as if
I had just gotten out of college!
I was fearless! I went after
accounts I had avoided for years
because I thought they were out of
my league. I spoke to presidents,
vice presidents, business managers,
sales reps. I was amazing. I was
magic. But when I came home to
share the news with your mother, I
discovered her asleep. When I
looked around the house, I realized
that her "office", for lack of a
better word, was also piled up.
So, I took to the house. I have
made it my duty to clean this place
from top to bottom. Even if it
takes me all night, I don't care.
Jacob?
JACOB
(frightened)
Yeah?
JIM
Will you join me? Join me in this
celebration of life. A symbolic
gesture of cleaning out the old and
bringing in the new.
JACOB
Do I have to?
JIM
(thrown for a loop)
No, you don't have to.
JACOB
Good night, Dad.
Off Jim's look -
A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center
stage and singing "The Rose". She is not nearly as good as
she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle.
We FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along
with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row,
but Gus is no where to be found.
The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds.
Mr. Farmer crosses to the microphone.
MR. FARMER
I'm sure Bette Midler would be most
impressed with that rendition.
The crowd laughs.
Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a
joke.
MR. FARMER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Anyway, our next soloist is Malee
Chung. She will play the theme
from "Love Story" on the flute.
The crowd applauds as Malee rises and crosses to the
microphone.
MALEE
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
Malee spots Gus, walking down the aisle. He scurries into
the front row and sits. Malee lights up.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
There's actually been a change.
I'm not going to play the theme
from "Love Story". Um... this is a
song...
Mr. Farmer, waves to Malee from off stage.
Malee looks at
him. Mr. Farmer mouths something to her.
MALEE (INTO MICROPHONE) (CONT'D)
(to Mr. Farmer)
What? I can't hear you?
Mr. Farmer throws up his hands.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Anyway.
This is a song by The
Doors.
At the mention of The Doors, Gus' smile instantly fades.
The
coincidence is just too great.
Malee starts to play "Light My Fire". She is good. Mr.
Farmer and the audience seem pleased by her euphonious
performance. Even Gus is won over. He appears entranced by
the music.
The recital is over. Most of the audience has filed out. A
few remain, offering their congratulations to the musicians.
Malee stands with Leonard.
MALEE
Where's Jacob?
LEONARD
Couldn't make it. He...
GUS (O.S.)
Malee.
Malee spots Gus, heading towards her.
MALEE
Oh my God!
He's coming over.
LEONARD
Who?
MALEE
Shut up!
Leave now.
Malee pushes Leonard behind her just as Gus approaches.
GUS
You were awesome.
MALEE
Really? Be honest. I'd rather you
tell me I sucked then lie.
GUS
You were great.
Leonard peeks around Malee's back.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
MALEE
Excuse me for a second.
Malee turns around and pinches Leonard.
LEONARD
Ow, ow, ow alright.
I'm going.
Leonard walks off. Malee turns back around with a big smile
on her face. She plays coy.
MALEE
So you really enjoyed it?
GUS
Yeah. Good song.
What made you
pick it?
MALEE
(covering)
Oh, uh... my mother was humming it
all last week. Big Doors fan.
GUS
Really?
Is she here?
MALEE
No.
GUS
She missed out.
MALEE
You're so sweet.
GUS
Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks
again. I had a great time.
Gus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks
off. Malee melts. She stands frozen, clutching onto her
flute in ecstacy.
Leonard runs up and down the stairs, sweating like crazy.
Grace appears, watching him around the corner.
She shakes
her head and then returns to the kitchen.
GRACE
That boy is going to bring the
entire house down.
PATRICK
Let him be. He's looking good.
I'm proud of him.
GRACE
(to the girls)
Girls, have you decided what you're
going to go as for Halloween?
SARA
Either a witch or a princess.
GRACE
That's nice. Haley?
HALEY
I'm going to go as a marble.
GRACE
What do you mean, a marble?
HALEY
You know, like a bag of marbles,
but just one marble.
Jacob and Jeff sit across from each other on the phone. Jeff
has two black eyes and a fat lip. He is crying profusely.
Jacob doesn't appear at all sympathetic.
JEFF
I'm really sorry, man.
I...
(CONTINUED)

JACOB
You just think about what I said.
Get out of my sight. And send
Kenny in on your way out.
Jeff rises and walks to a door, leading to the jail. A
moment later, Kenny enters, looking pissed off. He sits
across from Jacob and picks up the phone.
KENNY
What did you say to him?
JACOB
I thought you'd both like to know
that Halloween was Rudy's favorite
holiday.
Jacob picks up some pictures and presses them against the
glass.
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
These are pictures from every
single Halloween since we were
five. You see how happy he was?
KENNY
Stop it.
JACOB
After we'd go trick or treating,
we'd sit in our room and swap the
candy we hated. Rudy loved
Snickers, I Almond Joys.
KENNY
Almond Joy sucks.
JACOB
What sucks is that I'll never get
to sit in my room and swap candy
with my brother ever again. Thanks
to you.
KENNY
Why are you doing this?
JACOB
To remind you.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED: (2)
KENNY
How could we forget? You been
coming here for months to "remind
us".
JACOB
No one is forcing you to talk to
me.
KENNY
Anything to get out of my cell.
JACOB
Is your cell small?
KENNY
Yes.
JACOB
So is a coffin.
KENNY
You're not the only one who wishes
he was still alive. I'd do
anything to bring him back, but I
can't. It's not easy being in
here. Hell, you saw Jeff.
JACOB
What happened to him?
KENNY
He pissed off the wrong guy off.
Jeff is totally fucked right now.
JACOB
Good.
KENNY
Don't come back here ever again.
JACOB
Free country. I'll come if I want.
KENNY
Don't expect me to show up.
Kenny slams down the phone and exits.
Jacob smiles, having
shaken him.
53.
Grace hands out candy to a few trick or treaters at her door.
GRACE
Be careful now.
Have a good night.
Grace crosses to the kitchen table where Pat is doing a
crossword puzzle.
GRACE
Kids keep coming later every year.
SFX: FRONT DOOR, opening and closing.
Haley and Sara storm into the kitchen in tears. Haley is
dressed as a MARBLE, and Sara is dressed as a WITCH.
HALEY
I hate him! I hate him!
GRACE
Who?
What happened?
HALEY
Leonard! He threw away all our
Halloween candy.
GRACE/PATRICK
What?
SARA
He grabbed our bags and just threw
them down a gutter.
Leonard enters.
Haley and Sara run out of the kitchen.
PATRICK
What the hell is going on? Why did
you throw away their candy?
LEONARD
Because their sugar intake is
completely unhealthy. Besides,
Halloween is supposed to be a
celebration of evil. How did candy
get wrapped into it?
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
GRACE
I am going to ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer. Are
you in a cult?
PATRICK
Grace!
GRACE
This is what happens when kids join
cults. The first thing they change
is their diets.
LEONARD
I'm not in a cult. This is all
information you can find in books.
GRACE
The issue here is that you have
stolen one of the most exciting
nights of the year from your
sisters.
PATRICK
If anybody had done this to you
when you were a child, we never
would have heard the end of it.
LEONARD
I wish somebody had done it to me.
I wish either one of you had given
a shit about my weight.
Leonard storms out of the kitchen.
Patrick and Grace are
speechless.
Leonard lies on the floor, doing sit-ups.
He can actually do
a few now. Patrick bursts into the room.
PATRICK
I do not care for your language.
LEONARD
I'm only trying to help you guys.
Leonard stops exercising.
LEONARD (cont'd)
You're fat dad. Mom is fat.
Us
kids are fat.

PATRICK
What's your point?
LEONARD
Dad, you and mom are going to die
young if you keep eating as poorly
as you do.
PATRICK
What is this obsession you have
with weight?
LEONARD
The coach for Jefferson High is
also my gym teacher. He told me
that if I got into shape, I could
start as center for the Freshman
team when I get to high school.
PATRICK
Center is a great position.
Toughest guy on the field. A good
center can make or break a team.
LEONARD
I know.
That's why I'm trying so
hard to get into shape. You guys
should to. At the rate you're
going, you won't make it to your
60's.
PATRICK
Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a
tasty meal is just a way of showing
she cares.
LEONARD
She doesn't! Tonight she served
spaghetti and meatballs from a can.
The amount of sodium alone can
wreck havoc on a person's blood
pressure. Not to mention...
PATRICK
Leonard, people just don't drop
dead from eating meatballs.
Off Leonard's look -
Obviously drunk, Gus stumbles to his front door.
He fumbles
for his keys and enters.
57.
Gus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a
GUN in the other. Distraught and at the point of tears, Gus
opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet.
Then he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to
his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the
room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's
gone.
Ashley stands with a big smile on her face.
ASHLEY
Jeff Laskey is dead.
Jim and Jacob look up, stunned.
JIM
What?
ASHLEY
He committed suicide in his jail
cell last night. Sally Yngve
called just now to tell me.
Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as
Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the
kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins
eating. She is smiling.
JACOB
Why are you smiling?
A boy died.
ASHLEY
No, a monster that murdered my son
died. Justice is served; end of
story.
Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves
and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss
as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.
Jacob and Kenny are on the phone together. Kenny looks gaunt
and tired. Jeff's death has obviously affected him.

KENNY
He used his bed sheet, waited until
lights out and then jumped.
JACOB
That's terrible.
KENNY
His cell mate let him hang there
the entire night.
JACOB
I'm sorry, Kenny.
KENNY
Like you even give a shit. I bet
when you heard, you started
dancing.
JACOB
No.
KENNY
I knew he wouldn't make it. It's
my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint
when I met him, but he sure as hell
wasn't headed here.
(tearing up)
That fucking asshole!
Kenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms. Jacob
watches through the glass, touched by Kenny's reaction.
MUSIC OVER SHOT:
UPBEAT CHRISTMAS MUSIC
Jacob sits on the floor, surrounded by boxes and wrapping
paper. Santa has obviously been good to him.
Jim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep.
Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the
fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it.
She is a drastically different woman than the last time we
saw her. She looks upbeat and pretty.
JACOB
An IPOD!
Sweet!
Ashley looks at Jacob and smiles.
He has just unwrapped an
IPOD.

ASHLEY
Jim, Jacob still has one more
present.
JIM
I thought we were going to wait.
JACOB
No, do it now! Now!
Ashley crosses to the couch and sits beside Jim.
They hold
each others hands.
ASHLEY
After serious debate, your father
and I have decided... to adopt A
BABY!
JACOB
What?
JIM
We're gonna adopt a baby.
Hopefully a boy.
Off Jacob's shock -
- DAY
Leonard's extended
family sits at the kitchen table, eating
Christmas dinner.
His extended family is just as overweight
as his immediate.
Leonard barely touches his own plate, too
disgusted to eat.
He rises.
LEONARD
May I be excused?
The entire family stops eating and turns to him.

MALEE
Why do I have to do this? It's

YACCO
You'll be one step ahead in
January.
MALEE
Just because you're an atheist, I

Yacco shoots Malee the look of death.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Don't you find it hard not

YACCO

MALEE
I'm going for a bike ride.
YACCO
There's a foot of snow outside.
MALEE
The streets are ploughed. Besides,
I like looking at all the lights.
YACCO
Be home in an hour. Be careful.
Malee knocks on Gus' door, but he doesn't answer. Then Malee
spots a WELCOME MAT. She kicks it aside and discovers a
SPARE KEY underneath.
Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A
beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your
typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every
shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old
couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen.
Malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room.
Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top.
Malee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed. Its
unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball.
Aroused, Malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy.
Malee goes through a photo album. We see pictures of Gus,
dressed in a firefighter's uniform. He appears much younger
and clean cut.
As Malee returns the album to the night stand, she notices a
an open drawer and peeks inside.
Gus lazily makes his way upstairs.
Malee holds Gus' gun. Complete with sound effects, she
pretends to shoot a beer bottle off the dresser.
Malee laughs and then jumps across the bed like a Charlie's
Angel.
62.
Gus fumbles for his keys.
Malee stands in front of the mirror, posing.
MALEE
Freeze!
That's right.
Malee laughs in spite of herself. In the process, she
unknowingly cocks the trigger.
Malee places the gun to her
forehead and pretends to shoot herself.
TIGHT ON TRIGGER, a hair away from firing -
SFX: BAM!
The loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut.
Gus
opens it and inspects the door frame.
Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his
bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some
one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found.
Gus begins getting undressed. We follow his shirt to the
floor and SEE Malee, hiding underneath his bed.
SFX: FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENING, SHOWER RUNNING
Malee looks out from underneath the bed. She watches as the
now naked Gus enters the shower stall in the bathroom.
As the water falls upon Gus, Malee rises from underneath the
bed and crosses over to him.
From over Gus's shoulder, we see Malee approaching. An inch
away from Gus, Malee reaches out her hand to touch him.
Suddenly, Gus breaks down and starts crying.
Unsettled, Malee slowly retreats out of the bathroom.
Malee, Leonard and Jacob sit, playing LIFE, the board game.

LEONARD
Don't worry, white male infants are
the hardest to come by. 60 minutes
did a whole story on it.
MALEE
Since when do you watch 60 minutes?
LEONARD
Since I was in the hospital. They
said, any adoption agency worth its
salt has at least a three year
waiting list. By the time your
parents get a kid, you'll be in
college. You think they'll want to
start over again with that baby
shit?
JACOB
No, but it's like they're trying to
replace Rudy.
LEONARD
It doesn't matter cause it's not
gonna happen.
Malee has been silent this entire time.
Seeing a moment, she
speaks up.
MALEE
I'm thirsty.

Can you get us some drinks?
LEONARD
Why me?
MALEE
Because it's the gentlemanly thing

Malee turns to Jacob.
MALEE
I need a favor. It's big. I need
you to hide something for me.
JACOB
Hide what?
Malee reaches into her back pack.
MALEE
Promise, you won't freak.

Jacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and
opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside.
JACOB
Is it loaded?
MALEE
No, but I do have some bullets.
Malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets.
Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Sure your parents won't find it?
JACOB
Nobody has the combination, but me.
Besides, I could be building a bomb

FADE TO BLACK:

My dad won't tell anyone. No one

YACCO
I'd prefer it if you'd put that

Fine, spend it. You'll have to do

Yacco exits the kitchen.
Malee looks at her cash and smiles.
Leonard, Patrick and Grace sit at the kitchen table.
PATRICK
Here's the deal. You know how my
company flies me to Florida every
April?
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
LEONARD
You and I have been going since I
was eight. It's the guy's week
off.
PATRICK
This year, I'm taking the girls.
Just the girls. You're staying
home.
LEONARD
Why can't we all go?
GRACE
I'm not staying here all alone.
Besides, you said it yourself,
you've been going for years. Give
your sisters a chance.
Leonard eyes his mother with hatred.
LEONARD
Whatever.
(beat)
I need money.
PATRICK
What for?
LEONARD
Clothes.
Nothing I have fits
anymore.
GRACE
Your father and I aren't rich. You
can't get a new wardrobe anytime
you want.
LEONARD
What am I supposed to do, go to
school naked?
GRACE
Wear a belt.
PATRICK
I'll give him some cash, he can get
some clothes.
GRACE
No. He's gonna gain all his weight
back in a few months.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED: (2)
GRACE (cont'd)
Then what, we have to buy him new
clothes all over again?
Obviously hurt, Leonard storms out of the kitchen.
PATRICK
Grace.
GRACE
What?
It's true.
Grace exits the kitchen.
JACOB (O.S.)
I thought you hated going to
Florida?
Yacco enters Malee's room.
YACCO
Malee, dinner!
Yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn
everywhere.
YACCO (cont'd)
Malee?
(noticing something)
Oh my God!
REVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the
gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed
into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced
by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin
length curls.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What did you do?
MALEE
I got a new look. You know, for
Spring. What do you think?
Malee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture.
YACCO
You look...
MALEE
Beautiful?
YACCO
Different. What happened to your
glasses?
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
MALEE
Contacts. It took me like forty
five minutes to get them in, but
beauty is pain.
YACCO
Honey, in the future, I'd like to
know if you're going to radically
change your appearance. Clean your
stuff up and come down for dinner.
Yacco exits.
Malee looks in the mirror, deflated.
Leonard descends the staircase and begins looking around at
the setting. Boxes of junk clutter the floor along with old
furniture and bicycles.
He crosses to the basement door, which leads out to the
backyard. As Leonard unlocks and opens the door, a mass of
cobwebs stretch across the frame like elastic bands. Leonard
grabs a nearby broom and starts wiping away the cobwebs.
Jacob sits at his desk, reading the PLASTIC SURGERY PAMPHLET
his parents had given him for his birthday last year.
The bedroom door opens and Ashley sticks her head in.
ASHLEY
We're home.
JACOB
Hi.
ASHLEY
Could you come downstairs for a
minute. We have a surprise for
you.
74.
Jacob stands in front of KEITH GARDNER (10), African
American, sweet faced and dressed in a shirt and tie.
He has
luggage with him.
Ashley and Jim stand behind the boys, beaming.
JIM
This is Keith Gardner. You're new
brother. Keith our son, Jacob.
Keith extends his hand.
KEITH
It's nice to meet you.
Jacob leads Keith inside.
JACOB
You get top bunk.
KEITH
I'm kind of afraid of heights.
JACOB
Sucks to be you.
Keith lets Jacob's attitude pass.
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
No offence, but I never thought my
future brother would be a... well,
a "brother".
KEITH
I never thought my future brother
would have a KOOL AID stain,
smeared across his face.
JACOB
Fuck you, it's a birthmark!
KEITH
We're getting off on the wrong
foot.
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
JACOB
When my parents said they were
taking in an orphan, I pictured a
baby. So what happened, your
parents die or something?
KEITH
I was given up at birth.
JACOB
You gonna try and find your mother
when you're 18?
KEITH
As far as I'm concerned, the fact
she had me was enough. I don't
need to show up one day and disrupt
her life.
JACOB
Oh, but it's okay to just show up
one day and disrupt mine?
Off Keith's hurt look -
Malee stands at the card catalogue, flipping through the "S"
section. She comes to cards with the word SEX in the title.
Malee enters her room, locks the door behind her and empties
her bag of SEX books on the bed. The first one she peruses
is the "KARMA SUTRA". At first glance, Malee's eyes go wide
in shock. She grabs her backpack and removes a number of
index cards. Malee starts taking notes.
Jacob is on the one way phone with Kenny.
JACOB
He's not some baby.
He's like 10.
KENNY
You're blaming me for this?
JACOB
No.
But can you believe it?
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
KENNY
Maybe this is the only way they can
get over Rudy's death.
JACOB
He's a person not a fucking vase.
KENNY
I know.
JACOB
I gotta get out of there. I can't
live in that house for one more
day. I want to go with you to New
Mexico.
KENNY
No way. You've never even
been
out on the road.
JACOB
So.
KENNY
It's not easy. After first night
falls, you'll be pissing yourself.
JACOB
No, I won't.
KENNY
You don't need me to run away from
home.
JACOB
That's not what this is about.
KENNY
Yes, it is.
(beat)
And you want to come with ME of all
people. Are you forgetting, I was
the one who killed Rudy!
JACOB
That was an accident.
Kenny appears stunned.
Jacob has never accepted that truth.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED: (2)
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I'll be helpful. I can get
everything we'll need together. As
soon as you're released, we can go.
Kenny appears to be weighing the decision.
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Please.
KENNY
If this is what you want.
Alright.
Yacco is on the phone with her ex-husband.
YACCO (INTO PHONE)
... I'm not asking for much. Just
call her from time to time...
Because she needs to know her
father cares... Call collect.
Malee enters the kitchen.
MALEE
Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?
YACCO
Take some responsibility for
yourself and grow... Hello?...
Yacco slams the phone down.
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
He hung up.
MALEE
Well, what do you expect?
All you
ever do is yell at him.
YACCO
Malee, you don't understand.
MALEE
He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it
bothers you, but I love him. You
keep this up then one day, when I'm
old enough, I'll leave here and go
and stay with him.
Malee runs out of the room, leaving a disappointed Yacco.
78.
Leonard hammers a piece of wood over the basement door, which
is now entirely boarded up.
REVEAL the basement. Now clean. Boxes, furniture and trash
are piled neatly in a corner. Only a mattress remains on the
floor in the center of the room.
Leonard grabs a grocery bag and crosses to a bathroom at the
opposite end of the basement.
Leonard turns on the light, revealing a shower, toilet and
sink. He removes toiletries from the grocery bag and places
them inside.
Grace watches FAMILY FEUD while eating cake.
LEONARD (O.S.)
(screaming)
Help! Oh God, Ma! Help!
Grace drops her fork.
GRACE
Leonard?
Grace jumps up and runs out of the room.
Grace opens the door to the staircase, which leads to the
basement.
GRACE
(screaming)
Leonard, what's wrong?
LEONARD (O.S.)
It's on top of me. I can't get up!
Oh, there's so much blood!
GRACE
I'm calling 9-1-1!
LEONARD (O.S.)
Get it off me first! I'm bleeding.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
GRACE
If I go downstairs, I won't be able
to make it back up. Let me call
9-1-1 first, okay?
Leonard doesn't answer her.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Leonard?
Silence.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Oh, Jesus!
Grace begins walking downstairs. Due to her size, she has
difficultly maneuvering through the tight space. Her
inability to see her feet isn't helping matters.
Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Leonard?
Suddenly, Leonard bursts through the bathroom door with a
hammer in hand. He runs past Grace and up the stairs.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What the hell?
Half way up the stairs, Leonard stops and pries two of the
steps off the stair case with his hammer. This creates a
GAP, making it virtually impossible for Grace to ascend.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What are you doing? I can't climb
up now!
Leonard runs upstairs and slams the door after him.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Leonard!
Leonard!
Malee crosses to Gus' door with a GROCERY BAG in hand. She
kicks the welcome mat aside, picks up the spare key and
enters.
80.
Malee enters and removes a pair of rubber gloves, a bottle of
ammonia and trash bags. She starts cleaning.
Leonard descends the staircase, holding a tray of food.
Grace instantly rises.
LEONARD
I hope someone is hungry.
GRACE
Get me out of here now!
LEONARD
No joke, Ma. For the next two
weeks while Dad and the girls are
away, you will be kept down here.
I'll provide you with nutritious
meals and plenty of water. You,
mother, will learn what it means to
be healthy.
GRACE
That's what this is about, food?
LEONARD
I'm trying to save your life, mom.
Trying to give you a life. Cause I
love you.
GRACE
My life is fine.
I don't need you
to "save me".
Leonard looks at his mother, sympathetic.
LEONARD
You don't even realize how sick you
are. It's a problem when an
otherwise healthy woman can't drag
her ass up a flight of stairs
because she's so obese. You're
staying down here.
Leonard turns and crosses back to the staircase.
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Oh, and no cigarettes either.
81.
The kitchen is now spotless. Malee removes TWO TV DINNERS
from the oven. She crosses over to the kitchen table and
places the food onto plates.
The table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the
center. Once the table is set and the food served, Malee
takes a step back and smiles.
Malee strips off her clothes and puts on a long, silk robe.
Gus approaches his door. As he takes out his key, he notices
that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side. Gus
lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone.
Gus enters.
He knows someone else is in there.
GUS
Hello?
We follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing
beside the table and dressed only in her robe.
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What the hell is this?
MALEE
I made dinner, my love.
And I have
a surprise.
GUS
You've been in my apartment before,
haven't you?
Malee drops her robe, revealing her naked body.
Gus quickly
looks away.
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Malee, put your clothes on now!
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
MALEE
Don't you like my body?
Malee starts walking towards him.
GUS
Malee, stop.
MALEE
It's okay because I love you.
Gus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now.
She puts
her head on his back.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Touch me.
Gus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long,
pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of
what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses
to the living room.
MALEE (cont'd)
Where are you going?
GUS
To go call your mother.
Gus exits.
Malee stands the fool.
MALEE
But we're soulmates.
Now embarrassed and crushed, she starts to cry.
Yacco and Malee sit in silence.
After a beat.
YACCO
I don't know what to say to you.
Jacob shoves clothes into his backpack.
Keith enters with Rudy's baseball glove on his hand.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
KEITH
Wanna play some catch?
Jacob notices the glove. He rushes over to Keith, yanks it
off his hand and pushes Keith to the ground.
JACOB
Where the hell did you get this?
KEITH
The closet. Ow, what's wrong?
Keith struggles to get free, but Jacob is too strong.
KEITH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
You're hurting me.
JACOB
Did I say you could play with the
glove? Did I?
KEITH
No, I just...
JACOB
Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING
in this room is mine. You are not
allowed to touch a thing,
especially the glove.
KEITH
Okay, okay.
Jacob gets off of Keith and crosses to his closet. He pulls
out the lock box, unlocks it and removes the gun. He points
it at Keith.
JACOB
If you tell my parents what I said,
I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in
the fucking face, I swear it!
Keith nods, petrified. Jacob puts the gun back in the lock
box, throws it in the closet and storms out of the room.
Ashley sits at the kitchen table, looking at a picture of
Rudy and Jacob when they were infants. Her eyes are filled,
but she's not crying.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
Jacob enters and crosses to the fridge.
He spots Ashley and
is taken aback by her state.
JACOB
(cold)
What's wrong now?
ASHLEY
I was looking at a picture of you
and Rudy when you were born. God,
I miss him.
JACOB
But you have Keith now
Ashley is struck by Jacob's comment.
ASHLEY
What the hell does that mean?
JACOB
You have Keith. Two boys again.
Everything is fine.
ASHLEY
We didn't adopt Keith to replace
Rudy.
JACOB
Didn't you?
ASHLEY
For your information, your father
and I discussed adopting for years.
JACOB
(not buying it)
Right. Maybe if it was me who
died, you wouldn't need another kid
to get over it.
ASHLEY
How can you say that? I never
wanted either of my children to
die.
JACOB
But one of us did. If you had to
choose which one, I bet you wish it
was me.
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED: (2)
ASHLEY
I know you think we favored Rudy...
JACOB
You did!
Admit it.
ASHLEY
I admit he was easier to raise, but
we didn't love him more. Jacob,
listen to me. You came with a
different set of challenges.
JACOB
My birthmark.
ASHLEY
It's not easy being different...
JACOB
(screams)
I'm not different!! You always
made me feel like something was
wrong. There's nothing wrong with
me.
ASHLEY
I know...
JACOB
No, you don't! It's like you don't
know how to deal with me. You
never did.
ASHLEY
I'm sorry if that is how you feel.
You do the best you can as a
parent. You don't always know
what's right. But you're my son.
I'd do anything for you. I'd fight
for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die
for you.
JACOB
Rudy used to say that exact same
thing.
ASHLEY
It's true. And as unchristian as
it sounds, I still want the boy
that killed Rudy dead. Someday,
when you grow up, you'll understand
what I mean. Someday.
86.
SFX: TOILET FLUSHING
Grace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the
basement, looking for a way out. She crosses to the boarded
up door and tries to pull the boards off. Unsuccessful, she
returns to the bed and sits.
After a beat, Grace spots the tray of food, which is still
untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it
at the wall.
CUT TO:
LATER THAT NIGHT -
Grace paces nervously while blabbering to herself.
GRACE
When Pat calls, and I don't answer,
he'll know something is wrong.
He'll know. I'll be fine.
CUT TO:
LATER THAT NIGHT -
Grace nervously rocks back and forth. Sweat covers her body.
She glances at the tray of food, which rests on the floor.
CUT TO:
LATER THAT NIGHT -
Grace stands at the base of the stairwell, screaming.
GRACE
Open this door now! Let me out,
God damn it! Leonard!
CUT TO:
LATER THAT NIGHT -
Grace is crying. She catches sight of the meal that she
threw on the floor.
After a beat, Grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it
down her throat. She doesn't seem bothered by the fact that
her dinner is covered with dirt.
87.
Yacco exits her office to find Gus waiting for his session.
They speak not a word. He rises and enters the office. She
follows, shutting the door behind her.
Gus and Yacco sit in their respective seats.
YACCO
Before we begin, I want to
apologize. I should have known
what was going on with Malee.
GUS
It's my fault. I knew she had a
crush on me. I guess, I felt bad
for her. She's a very unhappy
girl.
Yacco looks down, embarrassed.
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
If it's any consolation, the whole
thing was very "therapeutic" for
me.
(off Yacco's look)
Sorry. That was a very selfish
thing to say.
YACCO
This is your therapy. Not mine.
Why was it therapeutic?
GUS
I slept last night. I can't
remember the last time I slept so
deep or so sound. I don't remember
dreaming or anything.
YACCO
Why do you think that is?
GUS
One of the last fires I ever fought
was a brownstone, beautiful. The
place was burned from roof to
basement. Whole family was wiped
out. When I was upstairs,
inspecting, I found a girl. She
couldn't have been more than 12.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
GUS (cont'd)
The whole right side of her face
was burnt off, but her eyes were
open. She was alive. The pain must
have been excruciating. She was
begging for me to... kill her.
YACCO
What did you do?
GUS
Exactly what she wanted. I placed
my hand over her mouth and what was
left of her nose, and I... I killed
her. I told myself it was the
right thing to do, but I've never
been sure.
YACCO
What does this have to do with
Malee?
GUS
When I saw her last night, she had
the same look on her face as that
girl. She just wanted me to take
away her pain.
Yacco sits, pondering all of this.
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Doctor?
YACCO
Would you mind if we... cut out
early today? No charge.
GUS
I understand.
Gus rises and exits.
Yacco sits alone and starts crying.
Leonard is at the kitchen sink, arranging a fruit salad.
SUDDENLY, he hears the sound of water boiling over from the
stove. Leonard quickly turns the gas low, extinguishing the
flame. He removes the pot from the burner, grabs a strainer
and removes poached EGG WHITES from the water.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
Leonard grabs a dish towel and begins wiping the water off
the stove. Preoccupied, he doesn't realize that when he
wipes the oven knob dry, he turns the gas on high. (Since
the overflowing water, extinguished the pilot light, he is
unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner.)
In
his condition, HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT.
Leonard grabs the plates of food and exits the kitchen.
SFX: GAS LEAKING
Leonard places the food by Grace's bed.
She is sleeping.
Leonard sits on the couch, watching TV. Suddenly, he starts
coughing, hard. The fit subsides and Leonard resumes
watching TV, thinking nothing of it.
SFX: TELEPHONE
Malee enters the kitchen and answers the phone.
MALEE (INTO PHONE)
Hello?... Daddy!... No, she's not
home... Can I ask you something?
Can I visit you for a while?... A
week... But I can fly alone... No,
I understand... Yeah... I love y...
Hello?...
Malee hangs up the phone. Tears swell in her eyes.
She
places her head in her arms and start bawling.
YACCO (O.S.)
Honey?
Malee looks to find Yacco standing behind her.
MALEE
(through her tears)
Why does he hate me?
Yacco walks to Malee and hugs her tight.
It's a long,
overdue hug.
90.
Grace awakens from her nap.
Suddenly, she sniffs at the air.
Grace rises and crosses over to the foot of the basement
stairs. She sees that the upstairs door is wide open.
GRACE
Leonard!
Silence.
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Leonard, I smell gas!
- SAME TIME
Leonard is slumped over, unconscious.
Grace coughs hard.
GRACE
Leonard, don't you smell that...?
(sotto)
Oh God, he can't. Leonard!
Leonard, the gas is on!
Grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the
stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing.
With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the
GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels
her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes
separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap.
Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side.
With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing.
Exhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove
and shuts the gas off. She looks around for Leonard and sees
him in the living room, slumped over and unconscious.
GRACE
No!
Grace frantically shuffles over to the living room.

Leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed.
The same nurse

NURSE
It's alive!
LEONARD
What happened?
NURSE
Gas leak.
LEONARD
My mom, she's...
NURSE
She's fine. They've taken her into
surgery. She blew out her knees
somehow. We're trying to get your
father on the phone right now.
LEONARD
I...
NURSE
Shh. You need your rest.
Everything is fine now.
Grace lies in a hosptial bed, watching TV. Leonard enters,
dressed in a hospital gown. Grace turns to him, smiling.
GRACE
Leonard!

93.

LEONARD
I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to
leave the gas on. It was an
accident. And everything that
happened, I... I just thought that
maybe, I could help you.
GRACE
Leonard, my mother died at 52. We
had to cremate her body because
they didn't make a coffin big
enough for her to fit in. Even if
they had, no one could have carried
it.
(tearing up)
I loved her so much. I don't want
that to happen to me.
LEONARD
It doesn't have to.
GRACE
Even if I can manage the food...
Can you honestly see me, running a
marathon?
LEONARD
You don't have to run a marathon.
You just have to run to the end of
the block. It's not so hard as you
think it is.
GRACE
I'll try.
Leonard leans over and kisses his mother's forehead.
GRACE (cont'd)
I spoke to your father. He and the
girls caught a flight. They should
be here by morning.
LEONARD
Did you tell him what happened?
GRACE
I told him there was a gas leak.
LEONARD
I meant...

I know what you meant. I didn't

Leonard smiles.
Jacob lies awake, staring out the window.
A heavy wind
blows.
SFX: WATCH ALARM
Jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm.
Keith awakens as well, but remains silent. He watches as
Jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window.
Once he's gone, Keith gets off the top bunk, crosses to the
window and watches as Jacob runs off.
Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the
lock box and begins trying combinations to open it.
Keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and
now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER. He works
frantically, fearing Jacob's return.
Keith pries the box open.
It's EMPTY.
No gun or bullets.
96.
Jacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to
his closet and begins to change. Keith lies in bed, watching.
Jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back
inside the lock box. His hands shake violently. As he puts
the box back inside the closet. He finds Rudy's glove. He
smells the leather and smiles.
Jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed.
He places
the glove beside Keith.
KEITH
I thought I wasn't supposed to
touch this.
JACOB
You're awake.
KEITH
Yeah.
JACOB
It's yours. Just don't leave it
outside. If it gets wet, the
leather will crack.
KEITH
I'll take good care of it.
I know
this was Rudy's.
Jacob lies down on his bed.
KEITH (cont'd)
Why do you have a gun?
JACOB
Just a b-b gun. I returned it to a
friend of mine.
(beat)
I'm sorry for being such an asshole
to ya.
KEITH
Does this mean we're brothers now?
(CONTINUED)
98.

JACOB
(beat, torn apart)
Yeah. We're brothers.
Keith lies back in bed, smiling. Jacob rolls over, still
unnerved by what he is done. He'll never be the same, and he
knows it.
