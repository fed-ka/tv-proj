NIGHT
A 747 touches down on the tarmac.
CUT TO:
A late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
scanning the crowd.
HER POV
Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
emerges from the terminal.
5.
BACK TO SCENE
Amy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
passionately in love with each other.
AMY
God, I missed you.
JEFF
Me too.
AMY
Let's get out of here. Where's
your equipment? Don't tell me you
checked it?
JEFF
(holds up his bag)
This is it.
AMY
No camera?
Jeff shakes his head no.
AMY
No nothing?
Again Jeff shakes his head.
Amy arches an eyebrow.
AMY
Ah ha.
CUT TO:
A modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood. Not
much furniture, but lots of books and CD's. On the
walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.
Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly
full wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
hallway TO the open bedroom door.
More framed photographs.
Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets
are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of
disorder in this neatly arranged room.
6.
CLOSER
Amy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of
the bed, which is empty. She opens her eyes, surprised
to find herself alone.
AMY
Jeff?
No reply.
Something catches her attention from across the room.
She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
over to a closed door. She knocks softly.
AMY
Can I come in?
JEFF (O.S.)
Sure.
A walk-in closet has been converted into a small
photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a
clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are
moody black and white landscapes.
Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy
enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He
doesn't look up.
AMY
Couldn't sleep?
Jeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a
landscape photograph in the developing tray.
AMY
I remember when you took that. We
had fun on that trip, didn't we?
Jeff nods.
Amy looks at him.
After a beat:
AMY
You want to talk about it?
JEFF
There's nothing to talk about.
AMY
C'mon, Jeff.
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
I told you. I quit.
Walked out.
end of story.
AMY
That's
it?
Jeff nods.
AMY
Whatever happened back there
wasn't your responsibility. You
can't keep beating yourself up
over it.
He says nothing.
AMY
What do you think? You could have
stopped that girl from getting
killed?
JEFF
You don't understand...
He stops, lifts his eyes.
JEFF
It was different this time.
He breaks off and pushes through the curtain.
She
watches him go.
CUT TO:
Jeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands
on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her
eyes. After a beat:
JEFF
I talked to Reynolds.
(a beat)
He thinks I could still get the
job at the San Diego station.
AMY
Oh, Jeff, you didn't...
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Think of it. Low pressure, a
steady paycheck. So I shoot city
council meetings -- how bad could
it be?
She looks at him, concerned.
AMY
Is that what you really want -- or
are you just running away?
JEFF
Who's running? It's good money,
full benefits. I'm tired of
freelance. We could finally put
some money in the bank.
AMY
You know I'll never stand in your
way. But you've worked so hard.
Are you sure you want to throw it
away?
JEFF
Throw what away? Don't you get
it? I don't do anything. I sit,
I watch, I film -- I let it
happen.
AMY
You're supposed to let it happen.
It's your job.
JEFF
No, Amy.
It's my excuse.
She looks at him, not understanding.
He hesitates.
JEFF
That girl... it's like I was
paralyzed. I wanted to do
something, but I didn't. I just
stood there and watched her get
killed.
He looks at her, emotional.
JEFF
Please, babe, I need this.
Say
yes and we'll take as long
as you
want -- drive cross-country
and
make a vacation out of it.
What
do you say?
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
Amy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF
WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and --
CUT TO:
The AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS. On the console are two
empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of-
the-art Nikon Camera.
Jeff stretches in the driver's seat. He forces his eyes
open, fighting sleep. He reaches for the coffee cup...
it's empty. He glances into the back of the Jeep. There
is a thermos of coffee on the back seat.
Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos
and fumbles it to the floor. He strains to reach it. He
doesn't notice...
10.
Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
the road in front of him. Jeff drops the thermos and
spins the wheel!
Amy's eyes fly open --
Jeff expels a breath. Amy turns to see the pickup
stopped in the road. She looks at him, concerned.
AMY
Jesus, Jeff...
JEFF
Sorry.
I took my eyes off the
road.
AMY
(seeing thermos
on floor)
Maybe it's time we took a break,
you know?
Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror.
HIS POV - PICKUP
halted in the middle of the road. Inside, dimly-visible
through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats.
The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
finger.
11.
BACK TO JEFF
angry at himself.
He looks over at Amy.
JEFF
I'll pull over next chance we get.
(a beat)
Sorry...
He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken.
CUT TO:
Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert
Southwest. A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby, perusing the
magazines. He glances in Amy's direction, notices what
she's reading.
TRUCKER
On vacation?
Amy looks up at him. He's 50ish, plain-looking,
friendly, wearing a "U.S.A." logo baseball cap.
AMY
Sort of.
We're moving, actually.
TRUCKER
Whereabouts?
Amy hesitates. She's not used to talking with strangers,
but the guy seems harmless enough.
AMY
California. We thought we'd take
the scenic route.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
TRUCKER
Huh. In that case, you oughta try
the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles
west. Real pretty, makes a loop
through the hills, then hooks back
up with the highway.
Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register.
AMY
Thanks. I'll mention it to my
husband.
The Trucker tips his cap.
TRUCKER
Okay, then. Good luck.
Enjoy the
rest of your trip.
As Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the
rear-view mirror, sees --
MIRROR POV
Earl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the
disappearing Jeep.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from
there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75,
then 80, then 85.
AMY
This isn't the Grand Prix, you
know.
Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator.
The needle
sinks back down to 65.
She gives him a long contemplative look.
AMY
What's bothering you?
JEFF
I told you. Nothing.
(pause)
The guy was an asshole.
Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward
the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.
JEFF
What'd you get?
Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.
AMY
Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo
Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe
they still make this stuff?
JEFF
You kidding. It's probably
gourmet cuisine around here.
CUT TO:
Jeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window,
bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a
cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
AMY
(trying to brighten
the mood)
This is crazy. Look at this.
Says if you win this mail-in
contest, you can choose either
ninety thousand dollars or ninety
thousand doughnuts.
She gives him a playful glance.
AMY
What would you do with ninety
thousand doughnuts?
Jeff shrugs, disinterested.
JEFF
I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty
cents each and pay off this car.
AMY
Very funny.
(beat)
Alright, what about ninety
thousand dollars? What would you
do with that?
Jeff stares out the window.
He's not into this.
JEFF
I don't know.
Look, Amy, I'm
not --
Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --
JEFF
Sonofabitch!! My camera!
He
stole my camera!
AMY
(startled)
Who?
JEFF
The redneck at the gas station!
He lifted it right under my nose!
My brand new Nikon.
(pounds wheel
in frustration)
Goddammit.
AMY
Should we go back?
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
What's the use. He's probably
halfway to Bumblefuck now, the
bastard.
AMY
Look, maybe if we call the cops --
Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks.
JEFF
What the hell?
The car gives another jolt.
AMY
What'd you do?
JEFF
Nothing.
I --
A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The
brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold.
JEFF
Hang on -- I can't steer!
The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it
jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.
For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the
empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
the Nikon. She picks it up.
AMY
(deadpan)
Found your camera.
He rolls his eyes.
He yanks the hood release and gets
out.
Jeff drives, a determined expression.
Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers
in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and
watching a football game on a big MUTED TV.
Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other
patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to
their beers.
Jeff glances around.
No sign of Amy.
No sign of Red.
A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter,
preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu.
Jeff approaches.
JEFF
Excuse me.
The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.
JEFF
I was supposed to meet my wife
here.
The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:
Yeah, so?
JEFF
Dark hair, slender, about five-
five. Wearing a pale blue
Benetton shirt.
BARTENDER
A pale blue what?
JEFF
Benetton shirt.
The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an
order slip.
BARTENDER
Hank!
Your order's ready.
(to Jeff)
I been busy. They come and go.
JEFF
It would've been within the last
half hour. She might've been with
a trucker?
BARTENDER
A trucker.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Guy with a baseball cap.
Driving
an eighteen wheeler.
The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head.
BARTENDER
Don't ring a bell.
JEFF
You sure?
The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out:
BARTENDER
Hey! Man here's looking for his
wife, dark hair, button-on shirt,
travelin' with a guy in a baseball
cap. Anybody see 'em?
Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few
disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no.
A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him.
FLO
Looks like she got away from ya,
cowboy.
A few of the regulars chuckle at this.
Jeff ignores
them, turns back to the Bartender.
JEFF
Could she have left a message with
another one of your employees?
BARTENDER
Don't see how. I'm the only one
who works here.
Jeff scratches his head.
This doesn't make any sense.
JEFF
I don't understand. Is there
another Belle's Diner?
BARTENDER
(chuckles)
No siree. Definitely not.
Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around.
An
elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him.
They
whisper to each other.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
(under his breath)
Shit.
He turns and goes outside...
Jeff goes to the Bartender.
JEFF
Excuse me, how far is the next
town?
BARTENDER
About twenty miles.
JEFF
Look, if my wife comes in -- her
name is Amy -- tell her I was
here. Tell her to stay put till I
get back, not to move. Would you
do that, please?
BARTENDER
(shrugs, bored)
Okay.
Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically.
He takes one
last look around, then heads out.
28.
The stereo is off, the windows rolled up.
Jeff drives,
his jaw set tightly.
The speedometer reads 88 mph.
DISSOLVE TO:
... and then across the desert plain, traveling on
another road, he sees it...
PETERBILT
The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy.
Cruising leisurely.
Jeff presses the accelerator...
Jeff HONKS his HORN, flashes his lights.
JEFF
C'mon, you fat-ass.
Pull over.
Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff,
but the truck does not slow down.
Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside
the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the
truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its
speed.
Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver...
POV SHOT
It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap.
FROM this ANGLE, we can't see into the passenger side of
the cab.
Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled.
Jeff shouts at him,
waves:
JEFF
Pull over!
Pull over!
Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, BLARES
his HORN.
Jeff looks up, sees --
An RV camper approaching in the oncoming lane!
HIGHWAY
Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes
past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING.
CHEROKEE
Jeff is rattled, catching his breath.
He swings back
onto the road.
HIGHWAY
Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving
and braking, forcing the truck to slow.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop.
Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red
climbs down from the empty cab.
(NOTE: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks
pass in either direction.)
RED
Jesus, pal, what the hell you
doing?
JEFF
I was signaling you to stop.
Didn't you see me?
RED
No.
Jeff reacts.
How thick can this guy be?
JEFF
Where's my wife?
RED
Huh?
JEFF
My wife.
Where is she?
Red gives him a puzzled look.
RED
How should I know where your wife
is?
JEFF
I checked at the diner.
No one
saw her there.
RED
Mister, I don't know what you're
talking about.
Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts?
JEFF
You gave her a ride. You were
supposed to drop her at Belle's
diner.
Red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as
possible. He shakes his head.
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
RED
Nope.
Sorry.
JEFF
How can you not remember? It was
just half an hour ago, for
chrissakes!
Red gives him a peculiar look.
RED
Mister, I never seen you before in
my life.
Suddenly, there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab --
the CB RADIO.
CB VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you
copy?
JEFF
(reacts)
Your radio works --
(locks eyes with Red)
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly:
JEFF
Amy?
Amy?!
You in there?
Red shrinks back, unnerved.
RED
Look, mister, I don't know what
you want, but --
JEFF
I want my fucking wife, is what I
want! What have you done to her?!
Red's eyes dart to something in the distance.
Jeff
catches this, turns...
SHERIFF'S PATROL CAR
Cruising toward them.
Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves
frantically. The patrol car switches on its flash bar
and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
SHERIFF BOYD, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation.
Jeff runs over.
JEFF
Officer, I need your help!
SHERIFF BOYD
What's your problem?
JEFF
I don't know, this guy has my
wife!
SHERIFF BOYD
Calm down, sir. Tell me what's
going on.
Jeff catches his breath.
JEFF
I don't know what the hell's going
on. Last time I saw her she was
with this guy in his truck. Now
he's saying he's never seen her!
RED
Officer, he's crazy -- I don't
know what he's talking about.
JEFF
Don't lie, you son of a bitch!
The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster...
just a precaution.
SHERIFF BOYD
All right -- everybody just calm
down.
(to Jeff)
Sir, you want to tell me what
happened?
JEFF
Our car broke down. This guy
stopped to help us, said he'd
drive my wife to a pay phone.
But
she never showed up.
SHERIFF BOYD
(turning to Red)
Sir?
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
RED
I don't know, officer. I'm
driving along, suddenly this fella
runs me off the road and starts
hollering about his wife. I
swear, I never seen the guy
before.
SHERIFF BOYD
And you didn't give his wife a
ride?
RED
No, sir.
JEFF
He's lying!
The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure
what to think. He turns back to Red.
SHERIFF BOYD
Sir, all right with you if I
search your truck?
RED
Hell yes, officer. Go right
ahead. Name's Red, by the way.
Red Barr.
(pulls out his
wallet)
My permits are all current. You
can check 'em out.
SHERIFF BOYD
That won't be necessary yet. Just
stand back behind the line. Both
of you.
As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to
the ground. He bends to scoop them up. Jeff eyes this
suspiciously.
The Sheriff climbs up into the truck.
The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around.
Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig:
a CB radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the U.S. taped to
the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker X's showing
where the truck has been.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind. A
blanket is folded over a foam mattress. A stained pillow
rests on top.
Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy. He tosses aside
a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. There is nothing.
A wall is covered with missing persons' notices.
Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us.
Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the
notices.
PULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces.
It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN
CARVER, a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk
filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken.
DEPUTY CARVER
Is this a recent picture?
Jeff glances over. Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet-
sized photograph of Amy.
JEFF
Two months old.
DEPUTY CARVER
She still wear her hair like that?
JEFF
Yes.
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
The Deputy resumes filling out the form.
He clicks his
tongue sympathetically.
DEPUTY CARVER
We'll certainly do our best, Mr.
Taylor. There's over a hundred
thousand people go missing in this
country every year. Runaways,
deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks
hiding from the I.R.S. -- all
vanishing without a trace.
Jeff stares at the faces.
DEPUTY CARVER
Now I'm not saying she's one of
them. I sure hope not. But
unless there's a ransom demand or
evidence of forced abduction,
believe me, the F.B.I. won't even
look at your case till it's been
24 hours.
Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the
photograph to the form. He looks up at Jeff.
DEPUTY CARVER
Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our
eyes peeled. How's that sound?
Jeff clenches his jaw.
CUT TO:
Jeff enters, looks around. It's the same scene as
before: same Bartender, a slightly different cast of
characters.
No sign of Amy.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
Jeff advances to the Bartender, who stands at a sink
rinsing beer mugs.
JEFF
Did she come in?
BARTENDER
(looks up, uninterested)
Didn't see her.
JEFF
You didn't see her, or she didn't
come in?
BARTENDER
Buddy, I told you the last time.
I'm busy. Maybe she came in,
maybe she didn't. All I know is,
I didn't see her.
Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the
Bartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.
The other customers at the bar have been watching all
this. One of them, an older grizzled BARFLY, looks up at
Jeff.
BARFLY
(confidentially)
None of my business, mister. But
if I was you I'd take a look in
the ladies room.
The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer.
Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes
when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost
certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.
While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His
knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-
GASP.
JEFF
Amy?
Silence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles
it. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the
door, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --
42.
INSIDE BATHROOM
Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. She whirls around,
a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.
FLO
Hey -- what the hell you doing?!
Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut.
The barflies
chuckle among themselves.
Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,
takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying
him much attention. He turns to leave...
... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on
it. There's something wrong here...
He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye
contact? Are they hiding something?
He scrutinizes more closely...
There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze
ever since Jeff walked in.
And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,
sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.
Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book
at the bar? Probably an ex-con.
While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The
Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the
carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register.
Jeff stares, an idea forming...
He approaches the bar.
JEFF
I want to see your order slips.
BARTENDER
What?
JEFF
You write down the names.
I want
to see them.
BARTENDER
What are you, nuts? I don't have
to show you jack shit.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
Jeff leans in his face.
JEFF
If my wife came in here, then her
name's in that pile.
The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:
BARTENDER
You calling me a liar?
A tense beat.
Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the
receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand
clamps onto his.
BARTENDER
Mister, I've had just about enough
of you.
JEFF
Let me see the fucking slips.
In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts
the receipts. He starts going through them, fast,
looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...
Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
Smith & Wesson revolver.
BARTENDER
Now, mister, you're going to have
to leave.
Jeff takes a step back. Everyone in the diner is
staring. He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit.
Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim.
The speedometer
reads 100 mph.
Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages
of a pocket address book. He picks up the handheld
cellular phone and dials.
JEFF
C'mon... work, goddammit...
The "NO SERVICE" INDICATOR BEEPS.
JEFF
Fuck.
Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a
truck. There are no other vehicles on the road.
He keeps pressing the "REDIAL" button.
The "NO SERVICE"
INDICATOR BEEPS over and over.
Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone. For the
first time, the "SERVICE" indicator blinks green. Jeff
immediately grabs the phone again and presses "REDIAL."
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
There is a burst of STATIC, then we hear a SCRATCHY
RINGING. The call is going through.
JEFF
(thank God)
Yes.
He waits for an answer.
JEFF
Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor...
Listen, I -- don't put me on hold!
I need a favor... I've gotta talk
to that friend of yours at the
F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's
missing --
There is a burst of STATIC.
The reception is very poor.
JEFF
I said Amy's been --
More STATIC.
JEFF
Fuck!
Jeff holds the phone tight to his ear.
JEFF
Yes, I'm still here.
No -- don't
call back -- Steve?!
Steve?!
The SIGNAL CUTS OFF.
Jeff slams the phone against the
dash, furious.
JEFF
Goddammit!
He punches redial, gets the "NO SERVICE" BEEPING, then
glances up, sees a --
CHAINLINK FENCE
covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the
road. The sign: "ROAD CLOSED."
BACK TO JEFF
He mashes the brakes. The CHEROKEE SKIDS to a halt just
short of the fence. Jeff stares at it.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Shit!
He grinds his teeth. Beyond the padlocked gate, the
highway continues as an unpaved dirt road.
He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and
does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the
opposite direction.
He looks up, sees --
DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK
has been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches
forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking
Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he
recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl.
Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle.
He raises
it to his shoulder.
EARL
(calling out)
Out of the car! Put your hands
where I can see 'em!
JEFF
swears, panicking.
EARL
I said get out, dammit!
Now!
Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating.
His hand moves
to the gearshift.
He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!
CHEROKEE
peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming
for the chainlink fence.
It BURSTS the FENCE!
Poles and chain mesh go flying!
JEFF
cranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the
Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road.
He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.
49.
EARL
jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit.
JEFF
GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the
rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel-
drive lever.
DIRT ROAD
The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER
V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain.
JEFF
GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the
vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --
RAM
keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab,
Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter.
JEFF
throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As
the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --
IDLED BULLDOZER
blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended
earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.
JEFF
brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up;
on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.
He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and
plunges into the ravine!
CHEROKEE
bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING
through sagebrush and manzanita.
50.
JEFF
clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases
and packing boxes go everywhere.
The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES
through the upper branches of a willow grove.
As the leaves part, we see... a river.
CHEROKEE
lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to
rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.
EARL
jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge
of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river.
EARL
Sonofabitch...
He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
slope.
INSIDE CHEROKEE
The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff
is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The
AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.
Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking.
The
river is flowing right through the Cherokee!
Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke
cans bob on the surface of the water.
Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes
free and he drops suddenly into the water on the
passenger side.
He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the
driver's side door and pushes it open.
He hoists himself through the door.
RIVERBANK
Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee,
levels the RIFLE and FIRES!
51.
JEFF
ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking.
The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries
to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting
duck!
Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case
underwater in the back seat.
He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield.
The
first three blows bounce off harmlessly.
Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH!
He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater
through the broken windshield.
ON BANK
Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. Several
items of debris from the car are floating on the current.
EARL
Fuck!
He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the
river.
UNDERWATER
Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in
the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his
path.
He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for
air.
ON BANK
Earl sees Jeff break the surface. He aims the RIFLE and
FIRES! A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeff's head.
Then Jeff is under again.
EARL
Goddammit...
UNDERWATER
Jeff struggles to stay in control. The current is
turning swifter. His shoulder glances painfully off a
boulder.
52.
ON BANK
Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge.
His foot lands between two rocks. He pulls it out,
swearing.
BEHIND ROCK
Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of
Earl on the bank. Then he is down again.
ON BANK
Earl works his way along the shore. Up ahead, the river
runs over rapids before passing around a bend.
Earl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has
arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.
He shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.
EARL
He's getting away!
The Driver shouts something inaudible. Earl runs along
the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches.
IN RAPIDS
Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving
current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and
swallowing a mouthful of water.
A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs
desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!
Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object
floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack.
Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH
bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!
Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.
ON BANK
Earl works his way along the shore.
The unseen Driver of
the van shouts to him from upriver.
DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.)
Where is he?
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
EARL
He's in the water!
I just saw
him!
BELOW RAPIDS
The river has turned slow again.
Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.
Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver.
For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could
appear anytime.
Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky
canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but
scalable.
He begins climbing.
DISSOLVE TO:
There is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside,
dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes
won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in
silhouette. He can hear their voices:
EARL
He coming around?
BILLY
Should be... I clocked him pretty
good...
A gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs.
BILLY
Rise and shine, dad.
Jeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it
really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't
a halfwit anymore.
BILLY
C'mon, shake a leg.
Jeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But
one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all
an act.
JEFF
(weak)
Where is she?
BILLY
Give us some answers and you might
find out. According to her,
you've got a pretty good pile of
ready cash sitting in the bank.
Is that true?
JEFF
There's some... yeah...
BILLY
Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut
it. Your wife gave us a dollar
figure. I want the same exact
from you.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
(coming around;
stalling)
I don't -- there's different
accounts... the balance
fluctuates...
BILLY
Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot
like you ain't tracking his bottom
line, it'd be the first time in
history.
(turning)
What do you think, Earl?
EARL
We been fucked with, is what I
think. Little slut lied to us.
Put 'em on the spot, they'll say
anything to stay alive.
Billy nods, disappointed.
BILLY
Yeah, I suppose. Too bad.
(peers down at Jeff)
Guess you're not the donut magnate
after all.
(to Earl)
Waste of time. Plug him.
Earl raises a pistol.
Jeff's eyes flash.
JEFF
(blurting out)
Ninety thousand.
Earl stops, glances at Billy.
They both eye Jeff
carefully.
BILLY
Say again.
JEFF
(emphatic)
Ninety thousand dollars.
A faint smile plays on Billy's lips.
He slams the trunk.
It's nearly pitch black. A beam of sunlight shines
through a rusted hole. It illuminates Jeff's eyes.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert.
Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain.
He braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE
NOISE is deafening. The car hits a depression and
jounces wildly. Jeff is thrown about violently.
CUT TO:
Jeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small
town operation. A guard stands near the entrance.
Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.
Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He
doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an
older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the
nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun.
Jeff approaches.
JEFF
I need to see the manager. I need
a wire transfer from my bank in
Boston.
CALHOUN looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's
appearance.
CALHOUN
Yes... sir. I'm the manager.
Would you like to have a seat?
Jeff remains standing.
He eyes the other customers
nervously.
CALHOUN
Sir?
JEFF
(turning; preoccupied)
What?
CALHOUN
I said you can have a seat if you
want.
JEFF
Right.
He takes a seat across the desk from the manager, reaches
into his wallet and brings out several forms of
identification.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Here's my driver's license, credit
card if you need it, my account
number in Boston... How long is
this going to take?
Calhoun looks at him curiously.
CALHOUN
Are you all right?
JEFF
(quickly)
Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account
only has $5,000 in it. How much
can you advance me on my credit
card?
CALHOUN
Excuse me?
JEFF
(impatient)
My credit card. I've got a $6,000
limit. Can you advance me the
whole $6,000?
Calhoun looks mystified.
CALHOUN
No, I can't. For non-customers
the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are
you sure you're all right?
JEFF
Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer
the money, okay?
Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the
transfer form. Jeff eyes him, decides he has to risk it.
He leans toward the desk.
JEFF
Look, I'm going to tell you
something. Whatever happens, just
keep filling out that form, okay?
CALHOUN
(looking up;
baffled)
Sir?
JEFF
There are people watching --
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
COWBOY (O.S.)
Excuse me, you the manager?
Jeff turns. A GUY wearing cowboy boots and a feed cap
stands behind him.
CALHOUN
Yes, I am.
COWBOY
Lady over there said to see you
about a car loan.
CALHOUN
(indicating
waiting area)
Certainly, sir. Would you like to
have a seat?
The guy takes a seat ten feet away. Jeff looks at him,
paranoid. Their eyes meet. Jeff looks away quickly.
CALHOUN
(turning back
to Jeff)
You were saying, Mr. Taylor?
JEFF
Just... transfer the money.
CUT TO:
Jeff enters and locks the door.
He startles at his reflection in the mirror.
He is
sunburned, dirty, lacerated.
He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies,
looking for anything that could be used as a weapon.
He
tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.
He picks up
the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from
the rubber
base. He swings it into his palm a few times,
testing it
as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able
to conceal
it.
He checks his watch. Time is running out.
He takes one
last look around the bathroom, then exits.
65.
Jeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind
the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place
sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.
Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk.
There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands
for wrapping currency.
Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the
letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up
a handful of currency wrappers.
Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on
the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.
JEFF
Would you tell the manager I want
the money in these denominations?
The teller looks at him oddly.
CUT TO:
Calhoun speaks on the phone.
CALHOUN
Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down
at the bank. Is the Sheriff
there?
(a beat)
Well, maybe it's nothing, but you
might tell him we just had a
fellow in here acting kind of
strange...
CUT TO:
Jeff seizes the pistol from Earl's waistband.
Earl
flails and knocks the pistol from his grasp.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
The pistol flies onto the floor.
Earl uncorks a vicious backhand. Jeff's head snaps
sideways. He grabs Earl by the arm and twists sharply.
Earl howls!
Jeff gropes on the floor. His hand closes around the
pistol and he swings it at Earl -- crack! Earl's nose
erupts! Jeff reaches across and jams his foot on the
brake.
Jeff swings the pistol into Earl's face -- crack! Earl
tries to fend off the blows. Jeff creams him again --
crack!
A TOW TRUCK DRIVER traveling in the opposite direction
pulls to a stop. He gawks at the two men struggling in
the pickup.
Jeff aims the pistol at point blank range.
Earl is a
bloody wreck. His head lolls groggily.
JEFF
Where is she, goddammit?
What'd
you do with her?
Earl sneers. Jeff is about to slug him again when he
notices the two truck parked across the road, the driver
staring out.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
Jeff swears and wrestles Earl into the passenger seat.
He seizes the roll of duct tape and binds Earl's wrists,
then passes the tape under his legs so Earl is
effectively hog-tied.
He then slams Earl back in the seat, circles his neck
twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of
the passenger side headrest. Earl begins to gasp for
air.
The Tow Truck Driver gets out and approaches.
TOW TRUCK DRIVER
Hey!
You there!
Jeff gets behind the wheel and throws the pickup into
gear.
Jeff drives, one hand on the wheel, the other brandishing
the pistol at Earl.
JEFF
Where is she?!
EARL
(barely able
to breathe)
Fuck you!
Jeff swings the pistol. There is a crack of exploding
teeth! Earl's mouth erupts with frothy blood!
JEFF
You like that?
How about this?
Jeff hits the brakes. Earl is thrown forward, letting
out a strangled cry as the duct tape chokes off his
windpipe.
JEFF
Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you
sonofabitch! You want to try 'em
again?
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
He hits the brakes again, harder.
Earl's tongue
protrudes from his lips, choking.
His face is red.
JEFF
How about an emergency stop? You
want to try that, Earl? Where is
she?
EARL
I don't know!
JEFF
Fuck you, you don't!
He slams the brakes again. Earl's eyes bulge
sickeningly. He is being choked to death.
EARL
Stop!
JEFF
Is that what you want? You really
want me to stop? 'Cause I bet
this baby stops on a dime!
CUT TO:
Traveling in the opposite direction, Sheriff Boyd is
returning toward town. As he rounds a bend in the road,
he sees --
The sheriff reacts.
SHERIFF BOYD
What the hell?
Jeff glances in the rearview mirror. The cruiser is on
their tail, SIREN WAILING, lights flashing. He swears
and pumps the brakes in a series of rapid bursts.
JEFF
End of the line, Earl! How about
it? You gonna tell me?
EARL
She's with Billy.
JEFF
Yeah?
Where's that?
EARL
I don't know!
Driving around!
Jeff hits the brakes again.
Sheriff Boyd jerks the wheel to avoid a collision with
the pickup as it slows and accelerates in rapid spurts.
SHERIFF BOYD
(on radio)
Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge
Ram pickup. Request back-up,
repeat, request back-up!
Boyd reacts in amazement to what he sees --
SHERIFF BOYD
Jesus Christ --
(on radio)
Dispatch! Suspect identified as
one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat,
Jeffrey Taylor!
Boyd taps his brakes, falling back behind the pickup.
Jeff is wild-eyed.
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Where were you taking the money?
EARL
(losing it)
To the truck stop...
JEFF
Where?
EARL
Main highway... Texaco...
Jeff has the information he needs.
He slams on the
brakes!
Sheriff Boyd swerves to avoid a crash as the RAM
SCREECHES to a halt in front of him!
Earl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight
around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his
limbs.
He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff
ordering Jeff down on the ground.
By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to
tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the
duct tape from his knees.
The tape is still wrapped tightly around
his neck,
pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws
at the tape, but
it won't come free. Finally, with both
hands, he reaches
behind his head and yanks the read rest
from the seat.
He reaches into his boot for something...
Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the
asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.
The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.
Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint
as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a
HOWLING blur.
Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
and holds firm.
As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
expression on his face.
Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two.
The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.
The PETERBILT THUNDERS over a patch of highway that is
being graded for paving.
81.
Red glances in the side mirror at the road behind him as
he drives, unaware of Jeff's presence.
Deputy Carver speaks on a phone extension while the
DISPATCHER sits nearby.
DEPUTY CARVER
It's no good. He's not talking.
You better mobilize your boys.
The troopers stare back.
They look like they have a
score to settle.
CUT TO:
and looks around, amazed.
Everywhere around him there
are stolen goods.
Matching luggage sets... a rack of women's coats... a
table piled with cameras... a crate filled with car
phones...
A stack of windshields... two sets of golf clubs... three
child safety seats... a ten-speed bicycle...
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
Several dozen "COMMERCIAL VEHICLE" license plates are
scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South
Dakota...
As Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside.
Al dismounts from the moving truck. Billy climbs out of
the Firebird. They are travel-sore, stretching. Red
shuts the door behind them.
AL
Man, if I never see another couple
from Massachusetts it'll be too
soon.
RED
Tell me about it.
You get any
word on Earl?
BILLY
(shakes head)
There's reports of an accident up
Five Mile, but that's about it.
Red grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers
a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes.
Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole.
JEFF'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE
The men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage,
photography equipment, miscellaneous items. Inside the
moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible,
partially covered with a tarp.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
BILLY
I told you we shoulda gotten rid
of 'em like that couple up in
Utah. Nice and clean.
RED
So it got a little fucked up -- so
what? We stay out of the area for
a while, things will cool off.
There is a HAMMERING noise, O.S.
Red looks over,
irritated.
RED
Dammit, Al, what the hell you
doing?
Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of
Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red.
AL
Figured I'd get started on the
jewelry.
RED
Fuck that, you can work on it
later. Help us with the girl.
Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the
knothole.
Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of
the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal
box, similar to a drawer in a morgue.
They lift the metal lid, revealing --
CANVAS SACK
The sack is stained and ripped.
Red pokes at it.
The
sack doesn't move. Red shrugs.
RED
Must've died from the exhaust.
88.
Jeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded.
Moisture
forms in his eyes.
Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift
out the sack.
RED
I'll get some plastic. We'll bury
her before it gets light out.
Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly.
AL
(startled)
Aagh!
Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears
open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists
and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her
screams muffled.
We see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to
see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive.
Al gets to his feet, furious.
AL
Goddamn.
Scared me half to death.
BILLY
(chuckles)
Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be
more careful next time.
AL
Shut up.
(glaring at Amy)
Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her
head off right now.
ARLEEN (O.S.)
(muffled)
Warren? You in there?
Red reacts.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
RED
Shit, it's my wife. Help me get
her in the freezer.
(calling out)
Just a second, Arleen.
Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false
flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a
root cellar.
AMY
squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped,
face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is
visible in the knothole.
Their gaze meets... and holds...
RED
returns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her
by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red
peers into her terrified face.
RED
Don't
worry, honey. It's not as
bad as
it sounds. It'll take you
about
10 minutes to suck the air
out.
Probably won't even feel it.
Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no
match for the three men.
BARN HAYLOFT
Jeff watches helplessly as...
BARN GROUND FLOOR
The men disappear with Amy into the cellar. We hear a
METALLIC THUD, then a few moments later, the men reappear
without her. Red closes the trap door, secures it with a
heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring
over it.
RED
C'mon, let's go.
They turn, walk toward the door. Red opens it. Arleen
is standing there. Al and Billy greet her politely:
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
AL
BILLY
Howdy, Arleen.
Hey, Missus C.
ARLEEN
Well finally. Are you coming to
breakfast? I've been calling you.
RED
Sure thing, honey.
The barn goes dark as the men leave.
The barn door rolls
shut. A LOCK CLICKS.
Jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness.
He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He
swears, makes his way toward the...
Jeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the
padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent
whisper.
JEFF
Amy?
Amy, can you hear me?
No reply.
Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the
floor.
JEFF
(louder)
Amy?
Still no reply.
Jeff swears, glances around the dark room.
There is a
tool bench across the room.
JEFF
Hang on, baby. They're in the
house; I can't use the lights.
I'm gonna get you out.
He goes to
the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He
knocks over
a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill
across the
table. His hands run over an assortment of
tools.
He
locates a hammer, takes it.
Returning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the
padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
He strains, using all his strength.
Suddenly the handle
snaps! Jeff flies backwards.
JEFF
Fuck!
He gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over
and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a
crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the
shackle, twisting with all his might. After several
failed attempts, he swears.
JEFF
It's not working. If I make any
more noise, they'll hear.
Jeff mulls his options.
He sets his jaw, exhales.
JEFF
I'm going to get you out of there,
Amy.
He swallows, emotional, clearly torn.
JEFF
I love you.
(under his breath)
Please, God, let her still be
alive.
Jeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He
climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio,
but no luck -- the keys are gone.
He opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip
logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them
quickly.
Jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes
under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery.
He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol.
Jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar
with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The
clip is full of bullets.
He snaps the clip back in place.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
(under his breath)
Fuck you, asshole.
CUT TO:
Jeff lets the door close silently. There are VOICES
coming from a distant room. He passes a washing machine,
a hamper full of dirty clothes, and moves silently
down...
HALLWAY
toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from
a room off the hall. Jeff flattens against the wall,
peers into the living room.
Seated on the floor with his back
to Jeff, Deke is
playing Nintendo on a wide-screen
television.
Various
items are scattered about: stereo
speakers, a jukebox, a
brand new Nordic Track. There is
a rifle rack across the
room.
Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall
toward...
Red is in the middle of telling a story.
Arleen, Billy
and Al sit around the table.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
The plates are cleared away.
They are drinking beer.
RED
... So there I am, it's a howling
snow storm, I've got 2000 live
chickens that are supposed to be
in Denver days ago, and this cop
is busting my balls because I
haven't got chains...
Arleen and the men laugh heartily.
RED
So what happens but
this big old
rooster, damn thing
must've
weighed ten pounds,
he reaches out
toward that highway
patrolman...
Al glances toward the door, stops laughing.
Billy and
Arleen follow his gaze, go silent.
RED
... just reaches out with his
beak, see, and...
Red notices his audience is no longer paying attention.
He turns in his chair, sees --
REVERSE ANGLE - JEFF
Standing in the doorway. Aiming the pistol. His clothes
caked with blood and dirt. He sways slightly.
Nobody else moves.
JEFF
Give me the key.
RED
(placating)
Now hold on, mister. I don't know
who you are or what you want --
JEFF
Give me the fucking key!
There is silence.
RED
(a beat)
Mister --
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Don't mister me, you sonofabitch!
My wife is locked in a hole in
your fucking barn! You don't give
me the key, I'll blow your fucking
head off!
Arleen glances at Red, frightened.
ARLEEN
(clueless)
Warren? What's going on?
RED
I don't know, honey.
Just stay
calm --
JEFF
(to Arleen)
Your husband's a kidnapper and a
murderer is what's going on! Did
you know that about him? Huh?
(gestures)
Ever wonder where all this stuff
comes from?
Arleen looks up at Jeff, scared.
She starts to open her
mouth, when --
DEKE (O.S.)
Stick 'em up.
Jeff turns. Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff
from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands.
The boy's lip quivers.
The room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol
aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly:
JEFF
You don't want to do that, kid.
Just put the gun down.
RED
(firm)
Don't listen to him, Deke.
Keep
the gun on him.
JEFF
Put the gun down.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
DEKE
(voice quavering)
My daddy keeps his rifle loaded
all the time. He showed me in
case I needed to protect Mommy
when he's away.
JEFF
I understand that, Deke. I'm not
gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull
that trigger, there's a chance
I'll still kill your father.
RED
He's lying, Deke. He can't get
me. Just pull the trigger.
JEFF
No, Deke, don't listen to him.
He's wrong.
RED
Plug him, boy!
Do what I tell
you!
Deke looks at his father, fights back tears.
His finger
tightens on the trigger.
RED
That's right, boy.
Do it.
Don't
worry about me.
Deke whimpers, squeezes the trigger...
JEFF
Deke, no -- !
Suddenly, Billy bolts from the table. The RIFLE FIRES!
The recoil knocks Deke off his feet. The bullet rips
into Al's shoulder!
AL
Oww -- goddammit, you little shit!
Red is out of his chair. Jeff dives first and seizes the
rifle. He whirls, aims the pistol at Red.
JEFF
Don't fucking move!
Everyone freezes.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
Jeff sidesteps to the window. Billy is running across
the yard. Is he headed for the barn? Jeff swears, turns
back.
JEFF
Deke?
Deke?
Get on your feet!
Deke rises, tears streaming down his face.
JEFF
It's okay, kid. Go over there,
stand next to your mother. Hurry
up.
Deke obeys. Clutching his shoulder wound, Al glares at
the child as he passes.
Jeff deliberates. Where the hell was Billy going?
He
gnaws his lip, decides.
JEFF
Okay... on your feet.
Now,
everybody!
Red, Arleen and Al get to their feet. Deke stays at his
mother's side. Jeff aims the pistol at Red, holds the
rifle with his other hand.
JEFF
Let's go.
Out.
He herds them to the door.
Arleen looks to Red
nervously.
RED
Do like he says, Arleen.
He's
crazy.
CUT TO:
Jeff leads the group through the barn at gun-point.
He glances right and left, wired. The rifle is strapped
to his back. He keeps the handgun ready. He peers under
the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy.
They reach the trap door. Jeff circles it, constantly
keeping an eye on Red and Al. He hands the keys to Deke.
JEFF
Deke, I need you to open this.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
Deke looks at his father. He kneels, unlocks the padlock
and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow
staircase slanting into the cellar.
Deke looks down into the darkness and swallows.
JEFF
It's okay, Deke. There's a
freezer down there with a woman in
it. I need you to let her out.
Deke descends the steps, frightened.
DEKE (O.S.)
(voice quavering)
I can't see.
Jeff jabs the pistol at Red:
Tell him where the light
is.
RED
(a beat, to Deke)
The switch is on the right.
There's a CLICK and the light goes on in the cellar.
Deke lets out a yip of fear.
DEKE (O.S.)
Dad...
RED
It's all right, son.
Just ignore
that stuff.
Jeff crouches to peer into the cellar.
JEFF'S POV - CELLAR
Roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling. The
light is a bare bulb. There are several distressingly-
shaped garbage bags against the wall.
BACK TO JEFF
His gaze shifts back to Red.
JEFF
(to Deke)
Deke!
You at the freezer?
DEKE (O.S.)
Yeah.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Okay. You're almost done. Just
open it up, let the woman out.
We hear a FREEZER BEING OPENED.
DEKE
She's all tied up with tape.
JEFF
You got that Swiss Army knife your
dad gave you?
DEKE (O.S.)
Uh-huh.
JEFF
Good man. Use that.
Make sure
you don't hurt her.
They wait tensely while Deke works downstairs.
JEFF
(to Red)
You better pray she's all right.
DEKE (O.S.)
I got her --
AMY (O.S.)
Jeff!!??
JEFF
Amy!!!
AMY (O.S.)
I'm almost free!!!
JEFF
Amy, come up here!
Amy climbs the stairs quickly. Scraps of duct tape cling
to her wrists. She throws her arm around Jeff.
AMY
They were going to kill me.
JEFF
I know, baby. It's okay.
They
can't hurt you now.
While Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the
others. He gestures toward the cellar.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
(to Red, Arleen, and Al)
Okay.
Everybody in the cellar.
Nobody moves.
JEFF
Do it!
Arleen and Al descend the steps.
Red follows, then
stops, halfway down.
RED
Remember this moment, pretty boy.
'Cause whatever happens, no matter
how far you run, I will hunt you
down and kill you like a dog.
Jeff stares back.
A beat, then:
JEFF
Go to hell.
He boots Red in the chest, sending him backward down the
steps. He slams the trap door shut and locks the
padlock.
He looks around, sees a massive tool chest.
He tips it
onto the trap door -- crash!
Then he takes Amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for
Billy.
JEFF
Let's get out of here.
They run from the barn.
Jeff enters. The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl
furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about. A
tattered flag hangs on the wall. There's no one around.
JEFF
(shouting)
Hello? Anyone home?
Amy follows him inside, looks around. Jeff crosses the
room, snatches up a phone and dials 911.
JEFF
C'mon, c'mon...
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
While he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against
the wall. She notices a set of car keys hanging by the
door.
JEFF
(re: keys)
Take it. We may need to get out
of here --
(into phone,
suddenly)
Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm
reporting an emergency... I don't
know the address, the house
belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean,
Warren something... No, I don't
know his name!
AMY
(suddenly hearing
something)
Jeff --
A DEEP RUMBLE is approaching, GETTING LOUDER by the
second...
JEFF
No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's
locked in a barn... Jeffrey
Taylor. If you contact the police
in --
Amy pulls a curtain aside, reacts to what she sees --
AMY
(panicked)
Jeff!
Suddenly, the ROAR is DEAFENING --
The PETERBILT EXPLODES through the wall of the trailer
home!
JEFF AND AMY
dive out of the way.
Inside the truck cab, we catch a glimpse of Red behind
the wheel, shouting something inaudible. Fragments of
debris cling to the grille.
103.
The rickety structure spins 360 degrees!
Jeff goes flying. A TELEVISION somersaults across the
room and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall.
The speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the
trailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound!
The trailer home is suddenly open to the sky.
Red puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another
run at the devastated trailer.
Jeff struggles to his knees.
JEFF
Amy?!
Amy is crawling over the debris. Jeff pulls her to her
feet. He grabs the rifle and car keys.
JEFF
C'mon!
They stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer.
Red sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the
utility pickup. He throws the Peterbilt into a turn.
YARD
Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an
aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted
toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder.
IN FORD
Jeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips
around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side.
AMY
Jeff, go!
Go!
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
Jeff turns the key. The ENGINE CATCHES!
He throws the
Ford in gear and floors the gas.
The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path!
HIGHWAY
The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road,
spewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't
maneuver well.
IN FORD
Jeff mashes the gas pedal. The ENGINE STRAINS,
BACKFIRING. Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining
the road.
AMY
Can't this thing go any faster?!
A SHOTGUN BLAST SHATTERS the passenger WINDOW! Amy
screams as glass showers the cab. Jeff swerves wildly.
JEFF
What the fuck?!
He swivels his head right, sees --
FIREBIRD
kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford
on the right-hand shoulder.
The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the
window.
JEFF
cranks the wheel.
JEFF
Get down!
IN FIREBIRD
Billy triggers a BLAST!
105.
AMY
yelps as the passenger-side MIRROR DISINTEGRATES!
She
whips around, sees --
CADILLAC DEVILLE
pulling even with them on Jeff's side. The drive, Al,
leers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford --
CRUNCH!
JEFF
raises the PISTOL and FIRES!
HIGHWAY
The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird
as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the
rear.
JEFF
lets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac. Blood
flows in a trickle down his neck. Amy sees it,
panicking.
AMY
Jeff!
JEFF
It's glass!
Use the rifle!
Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out
the window and aims at Billy. She FIRES wildly -- BANG!
BILLY
grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads
the SHOTGUN, snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM!
HIGHWAY
The BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox.
The door
flies open. Tools scatter on the road!
106.
BILLY
veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power
tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.
The front end of the extension ladder comes free from the
lumber rack and hinges into his path, SMASHING the
WINDSHIELD!
BILLY
Sonofabitch!
Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He
glances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol.
The PISTOL FIRES!
Billy slams backward against the headrest, hit in the
face. There's blood everywhere. The car careens toward
the shoulder.
HIGHWAY
The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air
and lands with a CRASH!
IN PETERBILT
Red sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and
pulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford.
IN FORD
Amy sees the Peterbilt advancing. Whipping her head to
the other side, she sees Al raising a pistol.
AMY
Look out!
Al jacks the trigger -- BLAM!
BLAM!
ON PETERBILT
a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to
the trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air!
IN PETERBILT
Red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up
ahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes.
There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
RED
Sonofabitch --
He realizes:
The trailer's got no brakes.
HIGHWAY
The Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID-
FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down
on the Ford.
IN FORD
Amy turns in the seat, terrified. The truck looms
closer. Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor.
JEFF
Hang on!
They are flying into a hairy curve.
IN PETERBILT
Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies
the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.
The Peterbilt races into the curve.
Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk
jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road
altogether.
He hits the brakes!
HIGHWAY
The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking,
cab and trailer folding at right angles!
Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!
IN CADILLAC
Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees
the trailer come untethered from the cab.
Now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly
back and forth across the blacktop.
Al tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him.
Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!
108.
HIGHWAY
The trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge
IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap
metal!
And just as this is happening...
PETERBILT
blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with
a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!
JEFF
slams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the
dashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the
Peterbilt.
HIGHWAY
The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed
as they hurtle down the grade.
JEFF
jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and
FIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille.
The GUN CLICKS empty.
IN PETERBILT
Red hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are
meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding
sideways.
Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.
HIGHWAY
The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big
truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come
unlocked.
The FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH!
The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away,
SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the
opposite railing!
109.
INSIDE ROAD
Jeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing
has broken away. Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of
the gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air.
Jeff looks at Amy.
She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes
wide.
JEFF
You all right?
Amy looks back at him.
She expels a long breath and
nods.
Jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window
and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.
JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The
engine is dead. STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator.
One tire is shredded.
There is blood on the broken windshield.
BACK TO JEFF
sitting in the driver's window. He squints toward the
truck, searching for any sign of Red. There is none.
AMY (O.S.)
Jeff...
JEFF
Yeah?
AMY (O.S.)
Jeff... I can't get out...
Jeff drops back into the cab. The dashboard is crushed
against Amy's legs. She tries to wriggle free.
JEFF
What is it?
AMY
(wriggling)
It's just... I can't get out...
JEFF
What do you mean?
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
AMY
I mean I can't get out!
Jeff blinks. He climbs out of the Ford, runs around to
Amy's side and yanks the door. It comes open with a
CREAK of METAL.
Behind Jeff on the bridge, a MOTOR KICKS OVER.
He
whirls.
JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
EXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks. Red is behind the
wheel. His face is covered with blood. He stares
hatefully.
With a RASP of GEARS, the Peterbilt lurches forward.
BACK TO JEFF
He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death
urgency.
JEFF
C'mon, Amy, push!
Amy struggles and struggles to free her legs.
JEFF
Push, goddammit!
Amy glances toward the Peterbilt, terrified.
PETERBILT
creeps toward the Ford. The truck's grille is smashed.
One wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt. It gains speed.
IN FORD
Jeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs.
She winces as the metal cuts into her skin. Jeff
strains.
AMY
(turning, reacting)
Jeff!
111.
PETERBILT
rams the rear of the FORD -- CRASH! It jars the pickup
farther through broken concrete guardrail.
IN FORD
Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact. The
Peterbilt's ENGINE ROARS. It's pushing them over the
edge!
IN PETERBILT
Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
the pickup farther through the broken railing.
FORD
lurches through the widening gap in the railing.
Concrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang
over the void.
IN FORD
Jeff strains against the dashboard. It won't give.
He
whips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford.
AMY
(panicked)
Jeff?
ON BRIDGE
Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side
running board, grasping the door handle.
Red heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's
head with a crack! He falls backward to the ground.
IN PETERBILT
Red presses the gas, yelling over the ENGINE ROAR. The
railing is giving way. He sees Jeff struggling to his
feet.
RED
You think you can come into my
life and fuck with me? Nobody
fucks with me!
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
He looks down.
Jeff is no longer visible.
Red frowns.
Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff
surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!
They grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's
face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!
The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck
inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.
Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering
wheel continues to move counter-clockwise...
ON BRIDGE
The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.
Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up
and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the
Ford under its massive weight.
IN PETERBILT
Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.
He glances up
for a second, reacts, but it's too late.
ON BRIDGE
The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the
Ford, using the pickup like a ramp!
IN FORD
Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
under the Peterbilt's weight!
ON BRIDGE
For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang
in the air... then the truck is falling!
IN PETERBILT
Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still
flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first
into the gorge.
Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air!
113.
ON BRIDGE
The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
railing.
The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!
IN PETERBILT
Jeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.
Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.
They grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,
forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are
inches apart.
RED
You think you can fuck with me?!
He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from
Jeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another
blow when...
... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the
cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.
Jeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to
the center support column. His legs dangle over the
hood.
Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the
steering wheel at the last instant.
The windshield sails away into the gorge.
ON BRIDGE
The iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under
the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.
ON PETERBILT
Jeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield
wiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.
Red is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff
with his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.
Jeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the
corner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and
seizes the handle.
114.
ON BRIDGE
The REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford.
As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the
edge.
ON PETERBILT
Jeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger
side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.
REBAR
gives away once more and --
JEFF
scales the cab, finding more handholds.
He climbs past
the passenger door.
Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same
manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the
cab.
Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.
Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release
button.
The passenger door flies open!
Red falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the
open passenger door, suspended over the gorge.
IN FORD
Amy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to
the edge. She struggles to free her legs from the
dashboard.
AMY
Oh God... Jeff...
JEFF
climbs higher. The Peterbilt slips again.
Below, Red
loses his grip and almost falls.
Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
exertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
The Ford teeters precariously. Any move could send it
over the edge. Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over
the void.
JEFF
C'mon, Amy, it's all you now...
you can do it...
With a huge effort, Amy frees herself from the dashboard
and reaches for Jeff's outstretched hand just as --
PETERBILT
comes free from the rebar!
AMY
takes hold of Jeff's hand.
PETERBILT
plummets into the canyon!
RED
screams!
PETERBILT
seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge
EXPLOSION!
ON BRIDGE
Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road. Down below,
secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon. Jeff takes Amy in
his arms.
AMY
Don't let me go, Jeff...
JEFF
I won't, baby... I won't ever let
you go...
He looks into her eyes.
Their lips meet in a kiss and
we --
DISSOLVE TO:
116.
