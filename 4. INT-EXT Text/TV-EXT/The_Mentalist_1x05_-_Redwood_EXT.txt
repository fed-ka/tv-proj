      We're deep in the hills of the northern coast.  TOWERING 
      REDWOODS line the road, making a deep green canyon, along 
      which JANE, LISBON and CHO follow SHERIFF NELSON (50's).

                                  NELSON
                    The girls were last seen leaving  
                      Sullivan's Tavern, one o'clock this 
                    morning.  A truck driver saw their 
                    car around five-thirty and called 
                    it in.  I only have four deputies 
                    and only a couple of 'em have ever 
                    seen a body killed in anger.  If 
                    what we have here is a homicide, I 
                    need help.        

                                  LISBON
                    Just to be clear?  Except in 
                    special circumstances, we don't 
                    help.  We take over.  You need to 
                    be okay with that.

                                  NELSON
                    Oh-kay.  I guess.

                                  JANE
                          (apologetic to Nelson)
                    She's not a morning person.  
                    She'll improve.

                                  LISBON 
                    Names of the missing women?

                                  NELSON 
                    Nicole Gilbert and Kara Palmer.   
                    Local girls.  Both twenty-one.  
                    Work together at the hunting store 
                    in town.  Last night was Nicole's 
                      engagement party.    

      Amidst the deep shade of towering Redwoods, we come upon the 
      crime scene -- POLICE WORK-LIGHTS illuminate an abandoned '92 
      VOLKSWAGEN JETTA, parked off the road in grass and brush, on 
      an uneven patch of land, leaving the vehicle a bit skewed.  
      Both doors left open and trunk open.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       2.

      Various Police and Ranger Personnel gathered.  DEPUTY PARKER 
      (40's) and his snuffling BLOODHOUND go around and around the 
      Jetta; seemingly unable to pick up a scent trail.

      Lisbon and Cho don rubber gloves.

                                  LISBON
                    The car was found exactly like 
                    this?

                                  NELSON
                    Yup.  Well, no.  Doors were open 
                    just like that.  We popped the 
                    trunk.  

      JANE'S POV -- Two WOMEN'S PURSES.  CAR KEYS in the ignition.  
      A pink MP3 player hooked up to the stereo.  A VERY LARGE 
      BLOODSTAIN on the driver's seat and more blood pooling in the 
      well of the car.  A pair of high heels.  In the back, there's 
      a lot of one particular brand of cosmetics scattered around.

      Lisbon starts going through the stuff in the car, turns the 
      key in the ignition.  Battery's dead.  

                                  NELSON (CONT D)
                    Yup, dead as a dodo.  No gas 
                    either.  They must have left it 
                    running.

      JANE'S POV -- The hound-dog going in circles around and 
      around the yellow tape that surrounds the car.     

                                  CHO
                          (points out)
                    There's a different set of tire 
                    tracks here that pulled off the 
                    road.  Still fresh.  A truck or a 
                    big SUV looks like.    

      Lisbon has a look.

                                  LISBON
                    Nice and crisp.  Probably the 
                    trucker that reported the car.
                    Make sure forensics gets a mold.

                                  PARKER
                    He's confused somehow.  This 
                    behavior?  He's sayin', hey look!

                    Under the car?  Of course we looked 
                    under the car.

      Nelson looks to Parker, who grimaces.  Nelson rolls eyes, 
      deflates.  Shit.  Goes to his knees.  Looks under the car.

                                  NELSON (CONT D)
                    Oh, crap.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A SEARCH PARTY of LOCAL COPS and CIVILIAN VOLUNTEERS plus 
      Jane and Lisbon in motion along a dirt logging road.  The 
      Bloodhound is working now that he isn't distracted by the 
      dead body.  Jane and Lisbon are with Sheriff Nelson just 
      behind Parker and his dog.

                                  PARKER
                    Good boy, Dexter.  Got 'er on lock 
                    now.

                                  JANE
                    Is there any way to tell from her 
                    scent trail how fast Nicole is 
                    moving?

                                  PARKER
                    Oh sure.  Dexter's detecting skin 
                    cells?  They fall off your body all 
                    the time at a pretty much constant 
                    rate.  So the faster you move, the 
                    thinner the trail you leave. 

                                  JANE 
                    So are we following Nicole on foot 
                    or Nicole tied up in the back of a 
                    truck?

                                  PARKER
                    I don't know.

                                  JANE 
                    You said you could tell how fast 
                    they were moving.

                                  PARKER
                    Dexter can tell.  I'm just walking 
                    behind him.

                    who'll say a bad word of Kara 
                    Palmer.  Good churchgoing family.  
                    No trouble at all.

                          (in other words...)
                    Meaning Nicole Gilbert was trouble.

                                  NELSON
                    Nicole, well, she's had her 
                    problems.  Drugs and drug related 
                      foolishness mostly.  Theft, petty 
                    fraud.    

                                  LISBON
                    Any violent offenses?  

                                  NELSON
                    No.  She's more of a troubled soul 
                    than a real bad person.  Tough 
                    life.   Mom died when she was 
                    seven.  Dad brought her up on meth 
                    and hot dogs.  He's in prison now.  
                    Drug dealing.  Kara and her family 
                    was pretty much all the stability 
                    Nicole ever had.  

                                  JANE
                    So she and Kara were good friends.  
                    Odd match up.   

                                  NELSON
                    Real close since they were little.  
                    In small towns like this, you don't 
                    choose your friends.  They're the 
                    same age, they're female.  That's 
                    enough.  

      A quartet of PARK RANGERS join the group.  KYLE's their 
      leader.  They're all pookah beads and native American tattoos 
      on bulging muscles under their uniforms.

                    Who knows what others are capable 
                    of?  She sure had built up a lot of 
                    bad karma.  But I don't know.  
                    She's been turning her life around.  

                                  LISBON
                    Bad karma doesn't have an 
                      expiration date.

                    Actually it does, according to 
                      traditional Buddhist teaching.  
                    I'm counting on it.


      Jane, Lisbon and the Sheriff pause while the Dog searches for

                    We've come what, five miles?  
                    Nicole would have been barefoot, 
                    probably drunk.  It was a dark 
                    night.  No way she covers that much 
                    distance.  Someone must have her in 
                    a vehicle and Dexter lost the 
                    trail.

      Coming down off SIGNAGE to JASON O'TOOLE as he comes storming 
      out of the tavern with a brown bag of liquor and a wired 
      expression.  His hair is wild, his face dirty and scratched, 
      and he's black with mud up to his armpits, as if he's been 
      wading in a swamp.  He digs deep in his pocket for his car 
      keys, stops at his beaten up OLD TRUCK AND LOOKS UP --  

      -- to find CHO and RIGSBY leaning against it.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you, Sheriff Nelson.

      Jane takes a beat to scan the crowd and fix their attention 
      on him.

                    Look at me, all of you.  Listen 
                    closely.  I want you all to raise 
                    your hands in the air like this.  
                    Both hands.  You too, Sheriff.    
                    And you, Agent Lisbon.

      Everyone does as they're told because the Sheriff is 
      (reluctantly) doing it.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Good.  Very good.  One of you, one 
                    of you here, killed Kara Palmer and 
                    abducted Nicole Gilbert.  I want 
                    that person to lower their right 
                    hand now. 

      Nobody moves a muscle.  Everybody stares at Jane with their 
      hands in the air, silent.  Awkward.  Jane smiles sheepishly. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      An emotional wreck.  Dry heaves.  Kara yells from inside the

      Nicole and Kara are momentarily blinded when they are 
      abruptly bathed in the HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK that pulls up, 
      facing them on the roadside.

      engine and clouds of exhaust smoke create an instantly  
      sinister vibe.

      The light still preventing US or her from seeing him.

                    glasses.  Mid-thirties.

                                  LISBON
                    That's it?  That describes half the 
                    men in California.  

                                  JANE
                    That's it.  But we know it wasn't 
                    her that killed Kara, at least. 
                    And it wasn't Rulon Farnes. 

                                  LISBON
                          (angry)
                    Nice work.  For this you illegally 
                    abducted her from the Sheriff's 
                    custody.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes, I was going to tell you, but I 
                    figured, seeing as it's illegal,  
                    best to keep you out of it.  So 
                    that you have deniability.  

                                  LISBON
                    That's very considerate of you.
                    Listen carefully and do exactly 
                    what I tell you.  Take her back to 
                    the hospital right now and 
                    apologize sincerely to Sheriff 
                    Nelson.  

      Lisbon shuts her phone.

                                  KYLE
                    Wow.  What was that about?

                                  LISBON
                    My bad karma.  


      It's a wet down.  With the help of local UNIs, Jane, Lisbon, 
      Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt load up the CBI Suburban and Sedan.  
      Nicole finds Jane...

                                  NICOLE
                    Was hoping I'd find you here.  

                                  JANE
                    We're about to hit the road.

      Nicole gives Jane a hug.  In the BG George Palmer EXITS the 
      Sheriff's Headquarters carrying the BOX of EVIDENCE. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       51.

                                  NICOLE
                    Thank you.

                                  JANE
                      Eventually you'll remember the good 
                    stuff.

      Nicole nods, wanting to believe that.  George approaches, 
      goes to Lisbon.

                                  GEORGE
                    It goes without saying...

                                  LISBON
                          (heartfelt)
                    You're welcome.

                                  GEORGE
                          (to Nicole)
                    You ready to go?

      Nicole shakes hands with Lisbon.  

                                  LISBON
                    Bye.

      George and Nicole walk off.  Jane and Lisbon walk back to the 
      CBI vehicles, kind of blue.  Lisbon looks for a cheery 
      subject... 

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you believe that guy fell for 
                    the old cellphone gag?

                                  JANE
                    What d'you mean, the old cellphone 
                    gag?  I invented that there and 
                    then.  Rather brilliantly I 
                    thought.

                                  LISBON
                    Please.  I've seen that done a 
                    dozen times.

                                  JANE
                    What do you mean?  Where?

                                  LISBON
                    On TV.

                                  JANE
                            (dismissive)
                    Oh, on TV.

                    Anything can happen on TV.  This is 
                    real life.  Where have you seen 
                    that done in real life?

      They get in as do Van Pelt, Cho and Rigsby, and drive off.  
      We CRANE UP to a GORGEOUS PANORAMA of forests and mountains 
      and low rainclouds.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
