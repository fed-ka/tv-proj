      GITA pulls up outside Ocean's house in the Bloomin' Lovely
      van.  Gets out with a bouquet of flowers.  Casually notes
      Mister Dread's black Humber - and Sarah Jane's car beyond
      it.

      She's heading up the drive - as CLYDE runs towards her.

                                    GITA
                    Hello.  Is Sarah interviewing Ocean? 
                    I knew she'd see there was a story
                    there.

                                      CLYDE
                    I need a body!

      FX SHOT: ANDROVAX bursts out of Clyde's body.

      Clyde falls senseless to the ground and Gita's eyes pop. 

                                    GITA
                    You!

      FX SHOT: Androvax takes Gita's body.

      She drops the flowers.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLYDE is regaining consciousness as MISTER DREAD, RANI and
      SARAH JANE appear.

                                    RANI
                    Clyde!

                                      CLYDE
                    What happened?

      Mister Dread aims his weapon, as Rani goes to Clyde.

                                      SARAH JANE
                          (to Mister Dread)
                    Don't shoot!  That's Clyde, not
                    Androvax!

                                      CLYDE
                    Rani, he took your mum!

      And Rani sees the bouquet lying nearby.

                                    RANI
                    Mum!

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Oh, no.

                                      CLYDE
                    He switched bodies.  Thought it
                    would slow us down.

      Mister Dread is ruthless.  We hear the sound effect of the*
      hand being re-attached.*

                    It will do him no good.  My
                      associates will be waiting at the
                    vault.

                                    RANI
                    They'll kill my mum!

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    But we will save your planet.

      And Mister Dread gets into the black Humber and pulls away.

      Clyde touches anguished Rani's arm.

                                      CLYDE
                    I'm sorry, I should've done
                    something to stop Androvax.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    This isn't your fault, Clyde. 
                    It's mine.  I should've kept
                    Androvax in that containment vortex. *

                                      RANI*
                    We've got to find mum before they*

                    We will!*

      And determined Sarah Jane rushes to the car, followed by
      Rani and Clyde.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The Bloomin' Lovely van pulls up outside the asylum gates.
      GITA gets out of the van, and staggers slightly.

      She speaks - but with Androvax's voice.

                                      ANDROVAX*
                    I'm running out of energy. And
                    time.

      She starts to make her way stealthily towards the asylum.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sarah Jane's car racing against the clock.

      And the car come to a stop at traffic lights.  Two lanes
      of traffic.

                                                                            CUT TO:SJA 4 Ep 4 Shooting Script 22/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 5




      SARAH JANE - clearly anxious behind the wheel as she waits
      for the lights to change.  RANI beside her, CLYDE in the
      back.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax is desperate to save his
                    species before the viper poison
                    kills him.  But however good his
                      intentions, he's as dangerous as
                    he ever was.

                                    RANI
                    You were doing what you thought
                    was right.  We were trying to help
                    him.

                                      CLYDE
                    Some people you just can't help.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well we're going to help Gita. 
                    He's taken her body because he
                    needs it to survive.  But we're
                    going to save her.

                                      CLYDE
                    And what about Androvax and his
                    people?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Gita is Rani's mum.  And Earth is
                    our planet.  My people come first. 

      And in the other lane, a couple of cars ahead - the black
      Humber.  MISTER DREAD behind the wheel.

                                    RANI
                    Look.  There.  It's Mister Dread.

      As the lights turn to green.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Those old cars - they can conk out
                    just like that.

      And Sarah Jane fires the sonic lipstick at the Humber.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And the Humber dies with a loud clunking noise and burst
      of steam - as Sarah Jane drives by - CLYDE giving MISTER
      DREAD the loser sign out of the rear window.

      Mister Dread tries to get the car going again.  No luck.

      And behind him - a blue van.  Complete with VAN DRIVER
      leaning on the horn and out of the window.

                                    VAN DRIVER
                    Oi!  Mate!  Get a move on!

      Mister Dread gets out of the car.

                                    VAN DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    Come on!  Shift it!

      Mister Dread walks towards the van.

                                    VAN DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    You need a new motor, mate.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Thank you.  I'll take this one.

      Mister Dread rips the van door off - as the Van Driver
      does a runner.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sarah Jane's car pulls up behind the Bloomin' Lovely van.

      RANI leaps put of the car with SARAH JANE and CLYDE.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Quickly. 

      And they run towards the asylum.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sarah Jane's car, pulls onto the drive.  SARAH JANE, RANI,
      GITA and CLYDE get out.

                                    GITA
                    Oh, that was such a good laugh.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Good.  I'm glad you're feeling
