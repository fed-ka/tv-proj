      ...Alicia, on her cell, charging along train tracks:

                                  ALICIA
                    It s me.  Cross National is throwing 
                    an insurance drug test at us, for 
                    Underwood.  Can you check it out?

                                  KALINDA
                    Sure, tomorrow.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- why?  What s up?

      Kalinda pauses, decides-- what the hell?  Intentionally stilted:

                                  KALINDA
                    Diane asked me to do further work 
                    on Sheffrin-Marks.

                                  ALICIA
                          (odd)
                    She--?  What?  

    But Kalinda hears applause, sees Overby, finished, starting 
    out of the meeting room.

                                  KALINDA
                    Gotta go.

      Kalinda hangs up.  Alicia pauses, knows she was just told 
      something, but not sure what.  She sees Linda tending to a 
      track-side memorial: three small CROSSES, three framed 
      photographs.  Flowers in the fence.  Seeing her approach:

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD
                    I can tell from your face it s not 
                    good.

                    The company has a drug test.  It 
                    says Jimmy had amphetamines in his 
                    system.

      Linda stares at her, stunned, doesn t move.  A stoic quiet...

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD
                    For the longest time I didn t think 
                    there was evil.  I just thought there 
                    were people doing good and bad things.  
                    But now, I...
                          (stops)
                    Sorry.  This is the kind of 
                    conversation Jimmy and I would have.

      Alicia nods, moved.  But needs to get to the point.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Linda, I have to ask, did you know 
                    about this?  

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD 
                    Alicia.  Jimmy nevertook drugs.  
                    There s nothing to know about.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then do me a favor: go through your 
                    medicine cabinet.  Bring me every pill 
                    he s ever taken, every pill he might 
                    have accidentally taken of yours.  Can 
                    you do that?

                                  LINDA UNDERWOOD
                          (nods)
                    Are we gonna win?

                                  ALICIA
                    We re gonna fight.

      A baby laughing.  Three months old.  In an infant swing on the 
      front lawn of a pretty suburban house.  Sarah Conley hides her 
      eyes again, then-- surprise.  The baby laughs.

                                  ALICIA
                    How old?  

      Sarah turns to see Alicia approaching.  Frowns, to herself:

                                  SARAH
                    I m so stupid.  I should ve just shut 
                    up.  I should ve just... kept walking.

                                  ALICIA
                    But that would ve been wrong.  

                                  SARAH
                    I thought you d be different.  I 
                    thought after what you went through-- 
                    with your family-- 
                          (the worst part)
                    And you come here?  To my house?  

      Alicia nods.  She s right.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry.

                                  SARAH
                    Then go.

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t.  There are three mothers who 
                    are widows now, Mrs. Conley--

                                  SARAH
                    That is not my fault!

                                  ALICIA
                    But it s somebody sfault.

      Sarah is silent.  Looks at her son.  Frowns.

                                  SARAH
                    What do you want?

      Alicia eyes her.  Nods.  Empathizing:

                                  ALICIA
                    I looked into Newbury Heights.  I 
                    can t find a thing.

                                  ALICIA (CONT'D)
                    I ve gone back fifty years.  
                    There s never been an accident 
                    there. 

                                  SARAH
                    Because it wasn t one. 

      Alicia takes out a pen and notepad.  Sarah frowns at this.  
    It all becomes more real with a pen and pad.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    I watched you on TV.  I liked you.  
                    Standing there like that.  When 
                    people would say you knew about it, 
                    about the prostitutes-- I d defend 
                    you.  I d say they re in love.  
                    That s why she s doing it.  

      Alicia studies her.  Doesn t want to correct her.  Waits.  

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    It wasn t an accident; it was a 
                    near-miss.  And it wasn t one of 
                    our trains.


      ...Malcolm Overby, leaving his elegant residence, picks up 
    the Chicago-Tribunefrom his stoop, flops it open, starts 
      toward his car, reading, watched by...

      ...a nonchalant Kalinda.  Parked in her car.  She s good at her 
      job, never seeming like she s following you as she s following 
      you.  She watches, as...  

      ...HONK-- a perky car honk comes from a parked luxury Buick
    up the street.  He smiles, starts toward it.  A friend?  A 
      workmate?

      Kalinda gets out of her car, starts in that direction, 
      crossing the street.  She pauses at another car door, 
      pretends to be looking for her keys.  Eyes Overby in a car 
      mirror, seeing...

      ...him lean down, kiss the driver in the other car.  

      Interesting.  Kalinda, her back to the scene, unzips her coat, 
      slips out her CAMERA, tucks the long telephoto lens under her 
      arm, pointing it inconspicuously back toward Overby.  She peers 
      down at the camera s fold-out LCD, zooms in on...

      ...the two kissing.  Overby s face blocking the lover.  And--

      --click-- click-- Kalinda snaps photos, waits... waits... for 
    the kiss to end.  Finally it does and Kalinda sees the person 
      being kissed is...

      ...Diane.  

    Oh shit.  Kalinda lifts her eye from the camera.  Suddenly 
      gets it.  She starts to put her camera away, when...

      ...her phone bleets.  Fuck.  Kalinda shuts it off, but... 
      Diane looks over, sees her.  Frowns.

      Kalinda zips up her camera bag, starts away discreetly toward 
    her car-- walking, faster.  Forty feet away, she starts to 
      smile, grin, laugh.  To herself, sing-song fashion:
