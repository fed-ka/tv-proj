      WHITNEY (28, SMART, GOOFY, FREE THINKER) AND ALEX GREEN (30, 
      EASYGOING, SMART, HANDSOME WITHOUT TRYING) GET READY IN 
      MATCHING ROBES. 

      QUICK CUTS OF THEIR ROUTINE OVER HAPPY TOGETHER  BY THE 
      TURTLES:

      -WHITNEY UNCEREMONIOUSLY POPS A ZIT IN THE MIRROR AND ALEX 
      SPRAYS ON AEROSOL DEODORANT. AFTER HE SPRAYS HIS UNDERARMS, 
      HE SPRAYS WHITNEY IN THE FACE. SHE LAUGHS AS SHE DUCKS OUT OF 
      FRAME.  

      -ALEX SHAVES HIS FACE. WHITNEY SITS ON THE TOILET AND PEES 
      WHILE CLEANING HER EARS WITH A Q-TIP.  

      -WHITNEY USES TWEEZERS TO PLUCK HER EYEBROWS, THEN A HAIR 
      FROM ALEX S BACK. 

      -ALEX IS NOW IN A SUIT. WHITNEY SPRAYS ON PERFUME. AFTER SHE 
      SPRAYS HERSELF, SHE SPRAYS ALEX WITH IT. ALEX MOVES AWAY EVEN 
      THOUGH IT S CLEAR HE S USED TO THIS. 

      -ALEX GARGLES MOUTHWASH. WHITNEY USES A RAZOR TO SHAVE HER 
      MUSTACHE. 


      ALEX AND WHITNEY CALL BACK AND FORTH FROM THE BEDROOM TO THE 
      LIVING ROOM. 

                                  ALEX

                We re gonna be late. I ll get online 

                and order them something from the 

                  registry. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Another present? We got them a present 

                when they got a house, when they got 

                engaged, and now we have to get them a 

                wedding gift? Why do I have to buy a 

                present every time they make a 

                mistake?

                                  ALEX

                I m the one buying it.                                                                                       2.


                                    WHITNEY

                Oh. That s fine then. 

      WHITNEY COMES OUT IN A DRESS AND CASUAL HOODIE. 

                                  ALEX

                Hurry up and do your hair and make up. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I did do my hair and make up. 

                                  ALEX

                  Seriously, stop screwing around. Get 

                ready. 

      BEAT. WHITNEY S EYES NARROW. ALEX REALIZES SHE S SERIOUS.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)

                I feel like this is a good time to 

                remind you that I pay the rent. 

                                    WHITNEY
                      (SMILES)

                Idiot.  

      ALEX INDICATES WHITNEY S HOODIE OVER THE DRESS. 

                                  ALEX

                You re gonna wear a hoodie to a 

                wedding? It s a little...

                                    WHITNEY

                A little what? 

                                  ALEX

                Helena Bonham Carter at Trader Joe s.

                                    WHITNEY

                What about with no hoodie? 

      WHITNEY TAKES OFF THE HOODIE TO REVEAL A WHITE DRESS WITH 
      TINY FLOWERS ON IT.                                                                                      3.


                                  ALEX

                I m pretty sure you can t wear white 

                to a wedding. It s like a rule. 

                                    WHITNEY
                      (REALIZING SHE S IN WHITE)

                Ugh. That is so dumb. Does the bride 

                think the groom is going to get 

                confused and marry me by accident? 

      WHITNEY WALKS INTO THE BEDROOM. ALEX FOLLOWS. 


      WHITNEY GOES THROUGH HER CLOSET. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I don t have any dresses left! They re 

                all at the cleaners because all we 

                ever do is go to weddings. I can t 

                remember the last time I sat down to 

                eat without a place card in front of 

                me. 

                                  ALEX

                Just because your parents got divorced 

                three times doesn t mean marriages are 

                bad. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Just because your parents have been 

                together for thirty years doesn t mean 

                all marriages are good. 

      WHITNEY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET IN A YELLOW DRESS. THE PRICE 
      TAG HANGS OFF THE BACK.  

                                  ALEX

                The tag is showing. Want me to rip it 

                out?                                                                                      4.


                                    WHITNEY

                No way. I m not keeping this thing.  

      THEY MOVE TOWARD THE DOOR.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                  Okay...phone?

                                  ALEX

                Got it. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Keys?

                                  ALEX

                Got em.

                                    WHITNEY

                My purse?

                                  ALEX

                I m not that whipped. 

      THEY RE OUT THE DOOR. 

                                    WHITNEY (V.O.)

                I can t believe we re missing Shark 

                Week. 


      WHITNEY AND ALEX PICK UP THEIR FRIENDS ON THE WAY TO THE 
      WEDDING. FIRST IS A COUPLE, LILY (26, TRADITIONAL, SWEET, 
      UPBEAT) AND NEAL (32, SENSITIVE, COOL, METROSEXUAL, IN A 
      STYLISH CROPPED SUIT.) 

                                    WHITNEY

                Hey. 

                                  LILY

                Hi! Hi! (THEN) Neal, do you have my 

                purse?

                                  NEAL

                Got it.                                                                                       5.


      NEAL HOLDS UP THE PURSE. HE IS THAT WHIPPED. ONCE THEY GET IN 
      THE CAR IT S EVIDENT THAT LILY AND NEAL ARE MATCHING. 

                                  ALEX

                Are you two matching?

                                  LILY

                Cute right?

                                    WHITNEY

                Maybe if you re going figure skating 

                later. 


      THEY PICK UP ROXANNE (33, TIRED, BLUNT, NO BULLSHIT, 
      DIVORCEE.) SHE S WEARING PANTS. 

                                  LILY

                Roxanne, you can t wear pants to a 

                wedding!

                                    ROXANNE

                Lily, get off my balls. It was either 

                this or a slanket. I m a thirty-three 

                year old woman who pays alimony to an 

                  ex-husband who does spoken word for a 

                living. I can wear pants. (THEN) Why 

                are we even going to this wedding? 

                Hasn t Jeff been married before? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Yeah, he must hate money.

                                  LILY

                I think it s romantic. 

                                    ROXANNE
                      (TO LILY AND NEAL)

                If your outfits were planned, you two 

                should kill yourselves.                                                                                       6.



      THEY PULL UP IN FRONT OF A POLICE STATION. 

                                  NEAL

                Why are we picking up Mark at his work 

                when he lives in the same building as 

                you?

                                  ALEX

                He doesn t have a car. He just uses 

                the police car when he s on duty.

                                    ROXANNE

                And he s a loser. Don t forget that 

                part. 

      MARK (33, BLUE COLLAR, CEREBRAL ETERNAL BACHELOR, COP) GETS 
      IN AND GIVES FIST BUMPS ALL AROUND TO MIXED RECEPTION. 

                                  MARK

                Ohla! Alex, Whitney. Shalom. Neal, 

                Lily. (THEN) Roxy! Love the side boob. 

                                    ROXANNE

                That s armpit fat. 

                                  MARK

                It all feels the same in the dark. 

                (THEN) So, I Facebooked all the 

                  bridesmaids and if their childhoods 

                were half as bad as their taste in 

                music, I m getting some lady hole 

                tonight. 

                                  NEAL

                The fact that you re a police officer 

                is very disturbing.

      ROXANNE SNIFFS THE AIR IN MARK S DIRECTION.                                                                                       7.


                                    ROXANNE

                I didn t realize they still made 

                Drakkar Noir. 

                                  MARK
                      (TO ALEX)

                See dude! Designer Impostors smells 

                exactly the same! 


      ALEX, IN PAJAMAS, SITS ON THE BED AND PLAYS WITH HIS IPHONE. 
      WHITNEY HANGS HER DRESS UP, INSPECTING IT FOR STAINS. 

                                  ALEX

                You think Abbey s still mad about the 

                yellow dress thing? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Doesn t matter. Now that she s married 

                I ll never see her again anyway. 

                Marriage is like the Bermuda triangle.  

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT'D)

                Except you get an extra set of 

                parents. 

      ALEX CHUCKLES. WHITNEY LOOKS AT HIM FOR A BEAT.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Why aren t we having sex? 

                                  ALEX

                Your hair is up and I ate pork. 

                                    WHITNEY

                What do you mean my hair is up? 

                                  ALEX

                When your hair is up, you don t want 

                to be touched. Or talked to. 

                                    WHITNEY

                That s true. When s the last time I 

                wore my hair down? 

                                  ALEX

                Two years ago?

                                    WHITNEY

                What?! That s what girls do when we 

                throw in the towel! Have I thrown in 

                the towel? 

                                  ALEX

                I m not exactly sure, but you do 

                always leave your wet towels on the 

                bed, which is really annoying. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I m serious!                                                                                     15.


                                  ALEX

                Is this about what that woman was 

                saying at the wedding? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Well, it made me realize that we ve 

                gotten kind of platonic. I mean, I 

                wasn t even jealous when that girl was 

                hitting on you.

                                  ALEX

                Oh, right. Her hair was down. Doooown.

                For a second I thought you weren t

                being alive. (THEN) Did you just go  

                the gym? 

                                    WHITNEY 

                Nope. This is what I look like.  

                                  PATTI 

                Have you talked to your father? His  

                voice mail is full and he owes me a  

                check. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I don t know. I think he s traveling.  

                                  PATTI 

                You know what that means. Whores.  

                                    WHITNEY 

                Mom, I can t talk about whores right  

                now. Alex and I are kind of in the  

                middle of something- 

                                  PATTI 

                You ve been together for five years.  

                It s not like you re having sex.  

                                    WHITNEY 

                What is that supposed to mean?!                                                                                     17.


                                  PATTI 

                It s normal. I mean, read the news.  

                Look at the TV or the Internet on your  

                candle or whatever. It happens to  

                every couple. I mean look at you.  

                You re in sweatpants.  

                                    WHITNEY 

                So what?!  

                                  ALEX 
                      (INTO THE IPAD WITH A  
                        COMPUTER VOICE)

                The battery is dead! Beep boop beep  

                  weerreewooop. 

      HE CLOSES OUT THE ICHAT WINDOW WITH PATTI IN IT.  

                                    WHITNEY

                See?! I told you! We re not having sex  

                enough!  

                                  ALEX 

                Please don t take anything your mom  

                says seriously. It always ends in you  

                being upset or wanting to move to  

                Canada.  

                                    WHITNEY 

                It s not just my mom! Roxanne went  

                through this, that lady at the wedding  

                went through it...it s a thing!  We re 

                in a rut! This is your fault.  Think 

                about it.  


      ALEX INTENSELY PLAYS A VIDEO GAME ON THE TV. WHITNEY SNEAKS 
      UP, WRAPPING HER ARMS AROUND HIM, KISSING HIS NECK.                                                                                     18.

                      (TO THE TV T.V.)

                Left! Up! Up! Damn you space monkey! 

                You re not going to take my banana!

      HE JERKS FROM SIDE TO SIDE, WITH WHITNEY ON HIS BACK. HE 

                                  ALEX (CONT D)

                YES!

      ALEX SUDDENLY RISES AND WHITNEY FALLS TO THE FLOOR. 


      WHITNEY AND ALEX LIE IN BED. WHITNEY GOES TO KISS ALEX. WHILE 
      KISSING HIM, SHE REACHES TO TURN THE LIGHT OFF. 

                                  ALEX

                Wait, one sec. Before you turn off the 

                light let me do this real quick. 

      ALEX PICKS UP A NAIL CLIPPER AND STARTS CLIPPING HIS TOE 
      NAILS IN THE BED. DISGUSTED, WHITNEY ROLLS OVER. 


      WHITNEY AND ALEX WATCH T.V. IN BED. WHITNEY LOOKS AT ALEX AND

                      (TRANSFIXED ON THE T.V.)

                Whoah. Scarlett Johansson is really 

                pretty. 

      WHITNEY SCOFFS, PUTS HER SHIRT BACK ON, AND ROLLS OVER. 


      Whitney looks at Alex: see? 

                                  ALEX

                It s not always my fault.  


      WHITNEY LIES IN BED, READING A MAGAZINE. ALEX GETS INTO BED 
      AND GOES TO KISS HER.                                                                                      19.

      COVERS UP TO HER CHIN. 

                                    WHITNEY

                It s so cold in here!

      ALEX SLITHERS TOWARD HER. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Get away from me! Your feet are 

                  freezing!  

      WHITNEY ROLLS OVER AND BURROWS IN THE BED. ALEX GIVES UP. 


      ALEX LIES IN BED. WHITNEY WALKS TOWARD THE BED IN HER PAJAMAS 
      AND STARTS GETTING IN. ALEX TAKES HIS SHIRT OFF AS WHITNEY 
      GETS UNDER THE COVERS. AS ALEX SEXILY GRABS AND KISSES HER, 
      WHITNEY FARTS AND PULLS THE COVERS OVER ALEX S HEAD AND LOCKS 
      HIM UNDER IN A  DUTHCH OVEN.  SHE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY AS ALEX 
      SCREAMS. 

                                  ALEX

                  Chipotle! Nooooooooo!




                                    WHITNEY

                Fine, it s both of our faults. I mean, 

                we don t even have plans for our five 

                year anniversary. Your parents went to 

                Fiji for their anniversary. No wonder 

                they ve been together so long. 

                                  ALEX

                Then let s go to Fiji.                                                                                     20.


                                    WHITNEY

                I can t get on a plane. The germs 

                  and...people. But, we are going to do 

                  something awesome. For now, you get in 

                that bed because a storm of sexy is 

                about to come your way. 

      BEAT. WHITNEY THINKS ABOUT HOW TO BE SEXY. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                  Lingerie! Right! 

      WHITNEY RUSHES INTO HER CLOSET. SHE OPENS HER LINGERIE 
      DRAWER. SHE PULLS OUT HER  LINGERIE : A SPORTS BRA, LARGE 
      COTTON PANTIES, UNSIGHTLY SPANX, BIKING SHORTS, A HUGE T 
      SHIRT.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Hmm. 

      WHITNEY WALKS BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AND GETS IN BED. 

                                  ALEX

                What just happened in there? 

                                    WHITNEY
                      (GETTING IN BED, ANNOYED)

                Well, my closet looks like it belongs 

                to a female basketball coach, so the 

                storm of sexy will be heading this way 

                more like tomorrow-ish. 

      WHITNEY GETS IN BED AND TURNS HER LIGHT OUT. OVER BLACK:

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Scarlett Johannson is pigeon toed. 

      BEAT. 

                                  ALEX 
                      (like that matters)

                So?

                                    WHITNEY

                Lily, careful with the cleavage. 

                You re a food critic, not a Real 

                  Housewife of New Jersey.  

      LILY SQUISHES HER BOOBS DOWN. WHITNEY LOOKS THROUGH THE 
      PHOTOS ON HER CAMERA. 

                                   WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Lil, do you and Neal ever go like four 

                or five days without having sex? 

                                  LILY

                What? No way. I work really hard to 

                keep our sex life good. I do kegels 

                every day. I m doing them right now. 

                                    WHITNEY
                      (TMI)

                That s dark. 

                                  LILY

                I also text Neal pictures of my you-

                  know-what when we re not together. 

      LILY POINTS TO HER CROTCH AREA. WHITNEY STARES AT HER.

                                  LILY (CONT D)

                                    WHITNEY

                I know what you re talking about. I 

                just want to see how long you ll point 

                to your vagina in public. (THEN) So, 

                what s the point of that exactly? 

                                  LILY

                The sexy photos are like saying 

                 here s what s waiting for you at

                If I was going to do a  here s what s 

                waiting for you at home  photo shoot, 

                I d take some pictures of the dirty 

                dishes.

      ROXANNE WALKS IN AND SITS DOWN. SHE SITS DOWN AND HEAVILY 
      EXHALES. 

                                  LILY/WHITNEY

                Hey. 

                                    ROXANNE

                Blah blah blah hi. (CALLING TO A 

                  WAITRESS) I ll have a vodka vodka.

                                    WHITNEY

                Double vodka. This is gonna be good. 

                                    ROXANNE

                Sobriety is just not an option 

                anymore. Being a single woman today is 

                  embarrassing. That guy I was trying to 

                end things with? Chris? He s in 

                therapy, so he s using all his therapy 

                jargon on me. 

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    23.

                                    ROXANNE (CONT'D)

                Every time I try to break up with him 

                he tries to tell me I have  intimacy 

                issues.  

                                    WHITNEY

                You do have intimacy issues. 

                                    ROXANNE

                I don t have intimacy issues! I m just 

                not delusional about relationships 

                anymore. I m thirty three. I m tired. 

                I have a sciatica from ten years of 

                faking orgasms. I make my own money. I 

                don t need a man. If I want a diamond 

                ring, I ll buy it myself. If I want a 

                baby, I ll order one online. 

                                  LILY

                That s a terrible thing to say. 

                                    WHITNEY
                      (TO HERSELF)

                I should start faking orgasms. 

                                    ROXANNE

                Do whatever you have to do to make it 

                work, because you can t go back out 

                there. It s a war zone: guys put 

                smiley faces in their text messages. 

                They drink smoothies. I dated a guy 

                with calf implants. Remember when men 

                were men? They chopped wood and did 

                cocaine? I dated a guy who had a 

                screen saver of a baby on his computer 

                and it wasn t even his baby.                                                                                      24.

      That s sweet. That s a pedophile. 

                                    ROXANNE (CONT D)

                Just lock your men down. That s all 

                I m saying. 

                                  LILY

                Well, Neal and I are for sure getting 

                married. Whitney, don t you want to 

                marry Alex? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Look, I m not afraid of commitment. 

                I m just not completely sold on 

                  marriage: the whole pick-which-friends-

                      I-like-the-best-and-force-them-to-go-

                  to-a-party-I-can t-afford thing. 

                                  LILY

                But at some point you have to make 

                your relationship official. I want to 

                spend the rest of my life with Neal 

                and I want the whole world to know.

                  family...

                                    ROXANNE

                You don t have to worry about STD s. 

                                  LILY

                You get to take Alex s last name. 

                                    ROXANNE

                If he cheats on you, you get half of 

                his stuff. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Roxanne, why are you backing this? I 

                thought you were against marriage.

                                    ROXANNE

                I m trying to be supportive here. 

                Trust me, I ll never get married 

                again. There s a reason marriage is 

                called an institution. It s for crazy 

                people. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I can t even think about marriage 

                right now. The most important thing is 

                that I have a great five year 

                  anniversary and that we get our sex 

                life back on track. 

      ROXANNE LOOKS AT LILY.

                Lily are you doing that think where 

                you squeeze your cooch to make it 

                  stronger?                                                                                     26.

                 bride  on the back.

                                    WHITNEY

                That s perfect if you want to say  I 

                just committed to one person for the 

                rest of my life, but damn it, I am 

                still a slut!  


      A YOUNG FEMALE EMPLOYEE (25, HEAVILY TATTOOED AND PIERCED)

                Is there anything I can help you with? 

                                    WHITNEY

                I need to have mind blowing sex on my 

                five year anniversary. Preferably with 

                my boyfriend. 

                                  EMPLOYEE

                I highly recommend role play. You 

                dress up in sexy costumes and pretend 

                to be other people. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Role play. 

                                    ROXANNE

                It s like being with other people, but 

                you re with the same freaking person 

                and he s dressed like an idiot. 

      LILY HOLDS UP SOME COSTUMES.  

                                  LILY

                Sexy maid?

                                    WHITNEY

                I don t want to put the idea in his 

                head that I d ever clean the house. 

                                    ROXANNE

                You can t do the maid fantasy. You 

                don t speak Spanish. 

      LILY HOLDS UP A SHORT SEXY NURSE COSTUME.  

                                  LILY

                Sexy nurse?                                                                                    29.


                                    WHITNEY

                If I was going to do the nurse fantasy 

                for Alex I d just make him wait in the 

                living room for an hour and have him 

                read Highlights magazine.

                Mark, you have to stop trying to start 

                fight clubs in public. First of all, 

                it s insane. Second of all, you know

                That s actually a good point,

                from Mark.

                Neither are fake boobs but you love

                But, Whitney and I are basically 

                married. She s just not into the whole 

                marriage ordeal since her parents are 

                0 - 3. 

                                  MARK

      THE GIRLS HOLD VARIOUS SLUTTY COSTUMES AS THE EMPLOYEE HOLDS 
      UP A SKI MASK. 

                                  EMPLOYEE

                One of our most popular costumes is 

                the  stranger fantasy.  It s our best 

                seller. Couples can t seem to get 

                enough of it. 

      WHITNEY AND THE GIRLS NOTICE A GIDDY COUPLE SHOPPING 
      TOGETHER. THEY RE POINTING AT COSTUMES AND KISSING AND

                Okay. I can get into that. If other 

                couples are wearing masks and mugging 

                each other, so will we.

                It ll help you with the acting. A 

                cowboy would probably have a gun. It 

                would help you get into character-

      WHITNEY ENTERS THE APARTMENT, CARRYING HER BAGS FROM THE SEX 
      SHOP. SHE SETS THEM DOWN AND PULLS OUT A SKANKY COSTUME. SHE 
      HOLDS IT UP AGAINST HER BODY AND CHECKS HERSELF OUT IN THE

                That s for you to wear, moron! She 

                wants to do the stranger thing! Girls 

                love it when a guy is dangerous and 

                takes control. Put on the mask and as 

                soon as she walks in the door, punch 

                her in the face.

                This may come as a shock to you, but 

                I m not gonna punch my girlfriend in

      ALEX ISN T MOVING. SHE TAKES THE SKI MASK OFF HIS HEAD. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D) 

                Come on, I can see you breathing. Our  

                counter isn t even real granite.  

      SHE SHAKES HIM. HE ISN T WAKING UP. NOW SHE S REALLY WORRIED.  

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D) 

                ALEX!  

      SHE SCRAMBLES TO PICK HIM UP OFF THE FLOOR AND DRAGS HIM OUT  
      OF THE APARTMENT A LA WEEKEND AT BERNIES.  

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    36.



                                  ACT 3


      MEDICS ROLL ALEX THROUGH THE ER ON A GURNEY. WHITNEY RUNS 
      ALONGSIDE IT, FRANTICALLY TALKING TO NURSE (35, HAD IT.) 

                                    WHITNEY

                He s gonna be okay right?!

                                  NURSE

                We ll take care of him, ma am. Now, 

                what is your relation to this man? 

                                    WHITNEY

                He s my boyfriend.

      THE NURSE STOPS WHITNEY AS ALEX IS ROLLED PAST THE DOUBLE 
      DOORS. 

                                  NURSE

                I m sorry, but you re not allowed back 

                here unless you re a spouse or 

                  immediate family. Visiting hours are 

                tomorrow from four to six. 

                                    WHITNEY

                What?! We ve been together for five 

                years! We re basically married. 

                                  NURSE

                You re either married or you re not. 

                                    WHITNEY

                He s seen me take a deuce. 

                                  NURSE

                That s disgusting. And that s coming 

                from an ER nurse.                                                                                     37.


                                    WHITNEY

                Sorry. I just really need to be with 

                him. He s like, my whole life. Please?

                                  NURSE

                I can t let you back there. I m sorry. 

      THE NURSE WALKS AWAY. WHITNEY IS LEFT THERE, GUTTED. 


      LILY AND ROXANNE WAIT WITH WHITNEY. WHITNEY S HEAD IS IN HER 
      HANDS. SHE S MISERABLE. NEAL APPROACHES HOLDING A BAG.

                                  NEAL

                Whitney, I made you some cinnamon 

                waffles in case you were hungry. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Neal, you re the coolest, but I can t 

                eat. I m too nervous. And I just 

                crushed like three bags of Combos. 

                                    ROXANNE
                      (TO NEAL)

                Give it. 

      ROXANNE TAKES THE BAG AND STARTS EATING THE WAFFLES.   

                                  LILY

                Don t worry. The nurse said it s just 

                a mild concussion. 

                                    WHITNEY

                He s not fine! He s in there all 

                  alone...I m sure they re giving him 

                bad food chock full of dairy. He s a 

                Jew. He can t have diary.                                                                                     38.


                                    ROXANNE
                      (MOUTH FULL)

                Did you keep the receipt for that ski 

                mask? You should get your money back.

                                    WHITNEY

                And his CoQ10! He doesn t have his 

                pills! He needs them for his heart or 

                brain or whatever. 

                                  NEAL

                Heart. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Same thing. (THEN) Where s Mark? 

                                  LILY

                Nobody talks to Mark except you and 

                Alex. If he wasn t your neighbor, we d 

                never see him. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I ll ask him to get the key from our 

                landlord and get Alex s pills.   

                                    ROXANNE

                You re letting Mark into your home?

      BEAT. 

                                  NEAL

                I ll go. 


      NEAL AND WHITNEY WALK TOWARD THE EXIT. WHITNEY HANDS NEAL A 
      KEY. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Neal, you re the best. They should be 

                in the top drawer- 

      PATTI ENTERS.                                                                                     39.


                                  PATTI

                Parking is twenty dollars?! Alex 

                better be dead. 

                                  NEAL

                That your mom? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Yeah. How did you know? 

                                  NEAL

                She has the same...eyes. 

      NEAL EXITS. PATTI AIR KISSES WHITNEY, MISSING HER FACE BY AT 
      LEAST A FOOT. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Hey, mom. Alex is gonna be okay, but 

                I m just really freaked out right now  

                because Alex has a concussion.   

      PATTI HUGS WHITNEY, SYMPATHETIC. 

                                  PATTI
                      (I knew it)

                He cheated? 

                                    WHITNEY

                What? No.

      WHITNEY PULLS AWAY. 

                                  PATTI

                Well, let this be a lesson to you. You 

                should have married Alex. If he did 

                die, you d inherit a lot of money. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Mom! I don t view marriage as a 

                  paycheck.                                                                                      40.


                                  PATTI

                You know what? That s actually pretty 

                smart since you make your own money. I 

                mean, you don t want to be stuck with 

                him for the rest of your life. 

      BEAT. THIS HITS WHITNEY. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Yeah, I do. I do want to be stuck with 

                him for the rest of my life. That s 

                exactly what I want. 

                                  PATTI

                Now you re not making any sense. 

      WHITNEY IS LOST IN THOUGHT. PATTI STARTS PUTTING ON LIPSTICK. 

                                    WHITNEY

                What are you doing?

                                  PATTI

                  Emergency rooms are a great place to 

                meet newly single men. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I can t believe that at one point you 

                were responsible for my survival. 


      WHITNEY PACES BACK AND FORTH IN THE WAITING ROOM.  

                                    WHITNEY

                Rox, how did your ex husband propose? 

                                    ROXANNE

                He needed health insurance. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I mean how did he do it?                                                                                     41.


                                    ROXANNE

                He got down on one knee.

                                  LILY

                That s so sweet. 

                                    ROXANNE

                Not really. Right as I said yes I 

                noticed that he had a bald spot. 

      MARK COMES OUT OF THE DOUBLE DOORS IN HIS POLICE UNIFORM. 

                                  MARK

                Yo. The doc said Alex is going to be 

                fine. 

                                    WHITNEY

                What are you doing?! How did you get 

                back there?!

                                  MARK

                I m a police officer. I can go 

                wherever I want. 

                                    WHITNEY

                You were with Alex this whole time?

                                  MARK

                Calm down. We were playing Uno. 

      THE NURSE COMES OUT. 

                                  NURSE

                Miss Morris, you can come see Alex 

                now. 

      WHITNEY RUSHES PAST EVERYONE TOWARD ALEX S ROOM. 


      WHITNEY RUSHES IN AND DIVES ONTO THE BED AND SMOTHERS ALEX 
      WITH KISSES.                                                                                     42.


                                    WHITNEY

                Oh my God! I m so sorry! Are you in 

                pain? You mad? Please don t leave me. 

                                  ALEX

                Of course I m not going to leave you. 

                I love you. And I hate moving. 

      THEY KISS. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I don t ever want us to be apart 

                again. I realized that I want to be 

                stuck with you. I want to be stuck 

                with you for the rest of my life. 

                (Beat) So. I have an idea. 

      WHITNEY GETS ON ONE KNEE. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Alex, will you marry me? 

                                  ALEX

                No.

                                    WHITNEY
                      (EXHALES)

                THANK GOD!

                                  ALEX

                I love you so much I m not going to 

                marry you. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I love you so much I m not going to 

                marry you, too. 

                                  ALEX

                I know marriage scares you, so we ll 

                just wait until it doesn t anymore.                                                                                     43.


      WHITNEY HOLDS BACK TEARS. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I was so worried that I was going to 

                lose you. (THEN) I ate Combos.  

                                  ALEX

                Yeah, I can tell. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I never want us to be us to be 

                  separated again.

                                  ALEX

                Then how about you never punch me in 

                the head again? 

                                    WHITNEY

                That s kind of a big commitment...

                                  ALEX

                So, are we done dressing up like 

                  transvestites? 

                                    WHITNEY

                I just want us to stay together. 

                                  ALEX 

                We re gonna stay together, okay?  

                Forget your mom, forget random  

                divorced strangers at parties, forget  

                  everything else. (TAKES HER FACE IN  

                HIS HANDS) This is me and you. You can  

                wear sweatpants or your hair up or  

                down or whatever. I don t care.  

      WITH HER FACE STILL IN HIS HANDS, WHITNEY TAKES A RUBBER BAND  
      FROM HER WRIST AND QUICKLY PUTS HER HAIR IN A PONYTAIL.                                                                                      44.


                                    WHITNEY 

                Oh my God that s much better.  

      ALEX JABS HIS FINGER IN WHITNEY S RIBS AND THEY LAUGH.  


      ALEX AND WHITNEY WAIT IN LINE FOR A CARRIAGE RIDE. AS A 
      CARRIAGE PULLS UP, ANOTHER COUPLE GETS OUT. THE GUY GETS OUT 
      FIRST, GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND PROPOSES. THE GIRL SQUEALS. 

                                  GIRL

                OF COURSE I WILL!

      WHITNEY AND ALEX STEP AROUND THE ELATED, HUGGING COUPLE AND 
      AWKWARDLY GET INTO THE CARRIAGE.  

                                    WHITNEY
