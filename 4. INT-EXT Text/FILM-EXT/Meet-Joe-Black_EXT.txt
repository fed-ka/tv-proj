A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.
BACK
FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.
The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
speakers, lights.
Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
relishing every moment.
A Painter approaches.
PAINTER
The big tent, Miss Allison --
ALLISON
Paint is rust and moss green.
Medieval colors -- Daddy's like
an old knight.
A Florist stops her.
FLORIST
The head table --?
ALLISON
What about it?
FLORIST
The flowers, ma'am--?
ALLISON
Freesia, freesia, everywhere.
Daddy
loves freesia -- and you, over there,
lights.
Not too bright.
I'm looking
for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
dance twenties.
Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
ing the activity outside through the windows.
He checks his
watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
passes.
PARRISH
What do you think of all this, May?
MAY
It's going to be beautiful.
And
Miss Allison says the President may
come.
PARRISH
Oh, the President's got better
things to do than come to my
birthday party.
MAY
(smiling)
What?
Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.
ALLISON
Daddy!
PARRISH
Hi, Allison --
ALLISON
Have you got a minute?
PARRISH
Not much more.
Big day in the big
city.
What's on your mind?
ALLISON
Fireworks.
Update -- we're con-
structing the number '65' on the
barge, archers from the State
College at New Paltz will shoot
flaming arrows at it, when it
catches fire it will give us the
effect of a Viking funeral with none
of the morbidity... The Hudson River
Authority says, for you, they'll
make a special dispensation - of
course there'll be an overtime bill
for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
PARRISH
Allison, I trust you.
This is your
thing.
ALLISON
But it's your birthday.
Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.
SUSAN
Good morning, Dad.
PARRISH
Hi, honey.
ALLISON
(to Susan)
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
SUSAN
(smiling)
Drew called from the AStar, they're
still two minutes away.
PARRISH
Drew's aboard?
SUSAN
He wanted to ride back down with
you. Now sit and relax, get some-
thing in that flat tummy of yours --
But Parrish only pours coffee.
SUSAN (cont'd)
(to Allison)
You coming?
ALLISON
You've got patients waiting, I've
got three hysterical chefs, one
loves truffles, the other hates
truffles, the third one doesn't know
what truffles are.
I'd better drive
down.
Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
in intensity.
PARRISH
(unconsciously)
I hate parties --
ALLISON
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
going to love it.
PARRISH
Isn't it enough to be on this earth
sixty-five years without having to
be reminded of it.
ALLISON
No.
Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.
SUSAN
Will you relax?
I know it is a big
deal day --
PARRISH
How did you know?
SUSAN
Drew told me.
PARRISH
Does Drew tell you everything?
SUSAN
I hope so.
PARRISH
You like him, don't you?
SUSAN
Yeah.
I guess so.
A moment.
PARRISH
I don't like to interfere.
SUSAN
...Then don't.
The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.
SUSAN (cont'd)
-- Here comes our boy now --
Shall we?
A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.
En route
they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.
QUINCE
...This shit's not bad.
AMBROSE
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
Quince, a possibility for dessert.
QUINCE
(pointing to another
bottle)
And that?
AMBROSE
Pinot Grigio.
We're considering it
for the appetizer.
Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
in a bucket.
QUINCE
What do you do that for?
AMBROSE
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
QUINCE
9:30's almost 10:30.
Where I come
from, the sun's over the yardarm,
m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
hailed by Allison.
ALLISON
Quince!
Everybody's waiting!
Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
approaches Parrish and Susan.
DREW
(to Susan)
Hello, Beautiful.
SUSAN
Hi.
Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.
PARRISH
Good morning, Drew.
Thanks for
coming out.
DREW
Well, it's a big day.
Wanted to
line up a few ducks before kickoff.
Any thoughts?
Last minute refine-
ments or variations?
PARRISH
'Thoughts'?
Not a one -- but I did
hear a voice last night.
DREW
A voice?
PARRISH
In my sleep.
DREW
What'd it say?
PARRISH
'Yes'.
DREW
'Yes' to the deal?
PARRISH
Maybe, who knows?
You know how
voices are.
Let's go.
Quince comes running up now.
QUINCE
Hi, Bill --
PARRISH
Good morning, Quince.
QUINCE
How're you doing--?
PARRISH
I'm doing great.
You ready?
QUINCE
I am, this is it.
B Day.
PARRISH
How's that, Quince?
QUINCE
Bontecou Day.
Going to close
with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
all cool as a cat and over at
Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
in his pants.
ALLISON
(to Quince)
Honey, please.
QUINCE
Okay.
All aboard - New York, New
York!
ALLISON
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner
in the city at Daddy's.
You too,
Drew.
We've still got some loose
ends --
PARRISH
Not my birthday again?
SUSAN
You're only six-five once.
PARRISH
Thank God.
Now could we go?
Let's
get this day started.
Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.
The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
rushes to open the door and unload the bags.
The passengers,
Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.
They exit the building.
SUSAN
(to Parrish)
Are you okay?
PARRISH
A-Okay.
Got my gloves on, my ears
pricked.
I'm ready for action.
SUSAN
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
PARRISH
Yer damn right.
Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
Quince looks longingly after them.
Susan, blowing a kiss
goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
cab.
The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.
A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in
the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.
The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out
onto the street.
Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and
vulnerable.
SUSAN
I've got to go --
YOUNG MAN
Did I say something wrong?
SUSAN
No, it was so right it scares me.
YOUNG MAN
I've been thinking... I don't want
you to be my doctor.
Because I
don't want you to examine me.
SUSAN
Why?
YOUNG MAN
Because I like you so much.
(a moment)
You have coffee here every morning,
don't you?
If I came by, could you
give me the name of a doctor?
Another moment.
SUSAN
Sure, I'll give you the name of a
doctor.
(a moment)
...And I don't want to examine you.
YOUNG MAN
Why not?
SUSAN
Because I like you so much.
Now
I've got to go.
She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching
her.
Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.
ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN
She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN
He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens,
now he turns and walks on.
ON SUSAN
She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
in the opposite direction, his back to her.
She turns the
corner and continues on.
ON THE YOUNG MAN
Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again,
but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street
and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane,
HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as
his body arcs through the air.
Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies
crumpled, still.
CUT TO:
Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
linen, dusting picture frames.
He nods and greets them as
he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
and Luisa.
Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.
Parrish
senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
top of corporate high-rises.
PARRISH
You know, I got to thinking last
night -- with you here, and seem-
ingly occupied, how's your work
going - uh - elsewhere?
A flicker from Joe.
He has heard what Parrish has said, his
eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
he is concentrating on Parrish's words.
JOE
When you were shaving this morning,
you weren't just shaving, right?
PARRISH
What do you mean?
JOE
You were hatching ideas, making
plans, arriving at decisions, right?
PARRISH
I guess so.
JOE
So you understand the concept then.
When you're busy here, your work,
what your task is, is being executed
elsewhere.
PARRISH
Of course.
JOE
So you've grasped the idea.
Con-
gratulations.
Now multiply it by
infinity and take it to the depth
of forever, and you still will
have barely a glimpse of what I
am talking about.
Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.
PARRISH
Joe --?
JOE
Yes, Bill.
PARRISH
How about giving a guy a break?
JOE
Make an exception?
PARRISH
There's one to every rule.
JOE
Not this.
They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:
PARRISH
-- I don't deserve this.
I'm still
young, this is not my time --
JOE
That's what everybody says.
PARRISH
I'm not everybody.
JOE
That's what everybody says.
Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe.
PARRISH
I want to live.
JOE
I understand.
A moment.
JOE (cont'd)
But you can't.
A sudden silence between them.
Parrish's shoulders appear
to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-
ing these issues has vanished.
PARRISH
What's it like?
JOE
What do you mean?
PARRISH
What's it like where I'm going?
JOE
Can you keep a secret?
PARRISH
Yes.
JOE
So can I.
They turn into Parrish's office building.
A large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
coffee and half-eaten pastries.
The Board of Parrish
Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.
DREW
...I know you're all as uncomfor-
table as I am to be meeting without
Bill, but I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.
Not only is he
still interested, he is sweetening
his offer.
(a moment)
Although it pains me to say it, in
my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
us peremptorily in dismissing any
deal with Bontecou.
Therefore, I'm
sorry to say that if we are to exam-
ine this new offer responsibly as
the Board of Directors of Parrish
Communications, we must do so with-
out its Chairman.
(another moment)
Oh yes, there is one additional
element: Bontecou is so anxious to
get us, he said he'd take Parrish
Communications with our Chairman or
without.
The Board falls silent.
Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
fidgets.
Drew milks the moment.
DREW (cont'D)
It's no surprise if I suggest to you
that the Bill Parrish we know is not
the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
You heard that speech -- some strange
emotional rationale to buttress a
knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
offer.
Does it not strike you that
something is possibly affecting this
man's judgement?
More specifically
-- his judgement to make a critical
business decision?
Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.
DREW (cont'D)
It's not pleasant to say the follow-
ing, but I would be remiss, in this
crisis, if I did not.
When we pre-
sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
offer, and if he refuses to let us
consider it -- once more makes an
adamant or emotional rejection -- we
will have no choice but to seek an
alternative.
SLOANE
And what would that be?
DREW
Bill's birthday is the day after
tomorrow.
There is a provisory by-
law in our charter.
Per the discre-
tion of the Board, Corporate off-
icers can be retired at age sixty-
five.
SLOANE
You're taking this too far, Drew.
DREW
Am I not obligated to?
Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves
the room.
DREW (cont'd)
How did this all come about?
Crisis
-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
pany, crisis for us.
I came about
with the arrival on the scene of --
Mr. Joe Black.
Mr. Joe who?
Joe
Black.
He attends our Board meet-
int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
sides in his office.
Never leaves
his side.
And, in my opinion, is
always in his ear.
Telling him what
to do and Bill is listening.
Who is
Joe Black?
What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish?
And most important,
what is behind his influence on our
Chairman?
SLOANE
You're building this thing up too
much, Drew.
He's had advisors be-
fore.
Nobody tells Bill what to do.
The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-
prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.
DREW
Thank you for coming.
SLOANE
Hello, Quince.
QUINCE
Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
everybody was going to be here, what
a nice surprise.
What's the big
confab?
SLOANE
(acidly)
This is a secret meeting.
DREW
(to Quince)
I hope you'll respect its nature --
What we're trying to do here is
gather our thoughts -- in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
-- and make an appropriate presenta-
tion to him as to how we think the
company might proceed.
Won't you
share with our Board the information
you gave me last night?
Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
Board.
QUINCE
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
good news.
As I was telling Drew,
I've been making a little hay while
the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
possibly three new and boiling hot
prospects for merger.
DREW
How did Bill react to the leads
you've developed?
QUINCE
He was interested.
DREW
(prompting)
-- But he was concerned about the
timing?
QUINCE
The timing -- yes.
He says it's up
to Joe.
DREW
'It's up to Joe'?
QUINCE
That's what he said.
Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
around at the Board members.
They are stunned, Sloane in
shock.
Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
sink in.
Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator,
is greeted as usual:
JENIFER
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
PARRISH
Good morning, Jennifer.
JENIFER
The Board is waiting.
PARRISH
What?
JENIFER
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
knows better than to press the point.
JENIFER (cont'd)
Yes, the members are waiting.
They
are in the Board room now.
Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
Joe right beside him.
Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders
with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city,
he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows.
He
stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
caught his eye, he steps inside.
Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.
Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of
peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers.
The Korean
Clerk runs out after him.
CLERK
Change!
Change!
Joe stops, uncomprehending.
The Clerk hands Joe bills and
coins.
JOE
Why are you giving me money?
CLERK
Change.
JOE
I am who I am.
I cannot change.
Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk
refuses it.
CLERK
You change!
JOE
That's impossible.
You're wasting
your money.
I couldn't change even
if I wanted to.
The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language
and returns to the store.
Joe continues on down the street.
A bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington
Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan
Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of
activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.
The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.
The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and
Joe disembark.
Following the Butler, they make their way
through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.
Parrish
and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
to one another.
Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
there is a distance between them.
They walk on past chan-
deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
through their branches.
Adding to the confusion, the AStar
lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
from the blast of the rotors.
May, the housekeeper, appears.
MAY
(to Parrish)
Telephone call, sir.
Mr. Sloane
from New York.
Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe
right at his side.
Parrish stops.
PARRISH
Excuse me.
Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,
and Parrish strides away.
Joe does not follow.
Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she
catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-
like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making
lightning decisions.
Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
letter.
A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected
lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.
ALLISON
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
PARRISH
It's starting to grow on me.
But
what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
ALLISON
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
the Sea is serving up caviar.
The
'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for
Petrossian.
Of course, they also
stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
PARRISH
Do they, m'dear?
ALLISON
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a
balalaika coming from The Russian
Tea Room.
I've dressed him in a
Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson
Eddy songs.
Parrish shakes his head.
PARRISH
You are amazing.
Why, oh why,
Allison, are you doing all this?
But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's
sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away
now, daughter and father, alone.
ALLISON
I do it because I love you.
Because
everybody I loved you.
Mommy -- wher-
ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the
people who work for you, everybody
who's ever known you.
PARRISH
Yeah?
And what about my enemies?
ALLISON
They respect you.
Isn't that a kind
of love?
Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's
forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he
blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.
ALLISON (cont'd)
Above all, you've been a wonderful
father.
PARRISH
I haven't been the father to you
that --
ALLISON
That you've been to Susan?
PARRISH
I wasn't going to say --
ALLISON
But that's what you were thinking.
And that's okay.
Because I know you
love me.
Not like it is with Susan,
the way your eyes light up when she
comes in the room and the way she
always gets a laugh out of you, as
opposed to me when I walk in a room
and that look comes over your face,
"What does she want now?"
A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th
Infantry Regiment
"C" (Charlie) Company.
ALLISON (cont'd)
I already feel I've had everything I
could have wanted for my birthday --
PARRISH
Hey, there's lots to come.
(gesturing to me
activity)
A little excess -- like you love.
The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate
plans coming to fruition.
PARRISH
You know, darling, this is going to
be a wonderful party.
ALLISON
(gently)
Yes, it is.
Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her
go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.
Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check
of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the
activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni-
forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.
QUINCE
Give me a Seagrams and '7'.
Ambrose looks at him blankly.
QUICNCE (cont'd)
No got?
Okay a double V.O., water
back.
AMBROSE
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.
Quince.
QUINCE
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
AMBROSE
Red or white?
QUINCE
Both.
Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting
up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his
traps past on a little cart.
Joe doesn't seem to know where
he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this
oasis.
Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.
QUINCE (cont'd)
(to Joe)
Red or white?
JOE
No, thank you.
Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of
each into one glass.
QUINCE
C'mon, have a drink.
You look like
you need one bad as me.
JOE
Do I?
I'm a little confused.
QUINCE
Confused, huh?
About what?
JOE
Love.
QUINCE
'Love'?
Oh, man, I've got troubles
of my own.
JOE
You love Allison, don't you?
QUINCE
Oh yes, I do.
JOE
How did you meet?
QUINCE
I was a world-class loser and she
was a happy, little rich girl --
and for some reason she took me in.
JOE
But she loves you?
Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.
JOE (cont'd)
How do you know?
QUINCE
Because there's nothing we don't
know about each other and it's okay.
I mean the deeper, darkest secrets
-- they don't matter.
JOE
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
QUINCE
Yeah, it's like you know every inch
of each other's souls -- and then
you're free.
JOE
What do you mean 'free'?
QUINCE
Free to love each other.
Com-
pletely.
Totally.
No fear.
Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.
QUINCE (cont'd)
All that hoopla up there reminds me
how I will never measure up to a man
like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.
He drains his wine.
QUINCE (cont'd)
Do you like me, Joe?
JOE
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
QUINCE
What would you say if you knew
it was me who brought down Bill
Parrish?
(a moment)
I told Drew and the Board that Bill
depended on you.
Drew led me on,
but I had no business telling him
in the first place.
He was setting
up Bill from day one.
Drew and
Bontecou are going to chop up the
company and sell it off for parts.
Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.
Inside.
And I was the fool who made
it all happen.
Oh God, what do I do?
Joe regards Quince.
JOE
Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
everything.
He'll forgive you.
Quince drains one more glass of wine.
QUINCE
You think so?
How do you know?
JOE
Because that's the kind of man Bill
Parrish is.
A moment.
QUINCE
Well, maybe... I guess you know him
better than anybody.
Another moment.
JOE
-- Getting to.
The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks,
getting close.
QUINCE
Do you think I should wait to tell
him 'till after the party?
JOE
No.
Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.
They look on
as the pre-party activities swirl on around them.
The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
being directed into adjacent fields.
Susan cuts past a re-
ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
event on which the curtain is just about to rise.
Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
by a fountain, Joe.
He looks up towards her, he knows she
has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
prearranged but which they intuit.
Susan slants through the
guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",
"What a party",
"You
look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.
Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.
The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
front of them.
SUSAN
I like you in a black tie.
JOE
I love you in an evening gown.
SUSAN
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
He smiles.
SUSAN (cont'd)
Daddy told me you might be leaving?
JOE
Yes.
Your father and I, our time
together has come to an end.
SUSAN
Where are you going?
Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.
SUSAN (cont'd)
You won't tell me?
JOE
Well -- I --
SUSAN
And you can't tell me who you are.
Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.
SUSAN (cont'd)
I'm in love with a man, I don't know
who he is, where he's going or when.
JOE
I can tell you the when part.
Tonight.
SUSAN
It gets worse.
JOE
No worse than it gets for me.
I'm
in love with a woman whom I don't
want to leave.
SUSAN
Then don't.
A moment.
JOE
We know so little about each
other --
SUSAN
We know all that we need to know --
JOE
But there's so much to tell you --
SUSAN
Don't.
That will come later.
JOE
Will it?
SUSAN
Lightning struck.
We caught it in
a bottle.
Don't let it out.
I want
to be with you, Joe --
Another moment.
JOE
What will we do?
SUSAN
'Love will find out the way'.
JOE
'Love will find out the way'?
SUSAN
It's a saying.
JOE
I believe that, don't you?
SUSAN
Yes, that's why I said it.
They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
some declaration when Allison is heard --
ALLISON (O.S.)
There you are!
Allison appears.
ALLISON (cont'd)
What's going on here?
Tete-a-tetes
on my big night?
(to Susan)
C'mon honey, you're needed.
(to Joe)
Can it wait?
But before he can answer --
ALLISON (cont'd)
Glad to hear it!
(to Susan)
Let's go.
She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.
The
curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.
Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a
weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself
until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
party.
He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan,
couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.
SUSAN
Hello, Joe.
What'd you know?
She smiles.
SUSAN (cont'd)
There's something so indescribably
sexy about you in a crowd.
I could
make love to you right here.
He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.
SUSAN (cont'd)
If you're going to tell my future,
you're on the wrong side.
A moment.
JOE
There is something I do want to tell
you --
He stammers into silence.
SUSAN
But you can't.
Joe is about to respond but doesn't.
SUSAN (cont'd)
Just then -- when you hesitated --
the way you shift from foot-to-foot,
I've always found endearing but just
now -- I got a chill.
But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.
SUSAN (cont'd)
Remember that morning in the coffee
shop?
You said 'What's wrong with
taking care of a woman, she takes
care of you --"
JOE
Did I say that?
SUSAN
And I said you'd have a hard time
finding a woman like that.
Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.
SUSAN (cont'd)
Well, you've found one, Joe.
JOE
The 'coffee shop' --
SUSAN
-- That was the place... and you were
the guy.
Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.
SUSAN (cont'd)
And you said you didn't want me to
be your doctor because you didn't
want me to examine you --?
(a moment)
Well, I got to examine you after
all --
Joe blinks, at a loss.
SUSAN (cont'd)
I could come with you --
JOE
I - uh --
SUSAN
You want me to wait for you, you'll
be back --
Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.
SUSAN (cont'd)
Why do I want this night to last
forever?
JOE
Don't you know, that's what I want
more than anything.
He touches her face.
SUSAN
You said before you couldn't tell me
who or where, only the 'when' -- Is
when now?
A moment.
JOE
May I kiss you?
She waits.
He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.
SUSAN
That felt like a goodbye.
Joe's silence is heavy.
SUSAN (cont'd)
What's going on, Joe?
I feel like
we're lifting off --
JOE
I'm still here.
SUSAN
But you're not.
You're somewhere
else.
(a moment)
You're someone else --
Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he
drifts into a long silence.
Susan is beside herself, her
emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.
SUSAN
Tell me you love me -- tell me
you love me now --
JOE
I love you now, I'll love you
always --
SUSAN
Hold me --
He holds on tight to her.
They are desperately entwined
until finally she releases him.
JOE
Susan --
SUSAN
-- Yes?
JOE
Thank you for loving me.
She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.
An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades
stop spinning.
Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens
it and Drew steps out.
Quince leads the way through the
lights and MUSIC.
Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for
himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the
irony.
DREW
This is damn big of Bill, I also
think it's smart.
QUINCE
He had no choice.
You're a
formidable adversary.
DREW
He said that?
QUINCE
Well, you've got him by the short-
hairs.
DREW
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.
The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
with Allison.
An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.
He pauses over the
cake, now blows the candle out.
APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
crowd.
Joe observes from the fringe.
PARRISH
(to the guests)
I thought I was going to sneak away
tonight...
YELLS of "No!"
"Never!"
PARRISH (cont'd)
...What a glorious night, every
face I see is a memory.
It may not
be a perfectly perfect memory --
sometimes we had our ups and downs
-- but we're all together, and
you're mine for a night.
(a moment)
-- And I'm going to break precedent,
and tell you my one-candle wish --
that you would have a life as lucky
as mine, where you can wake up one
morning and say "I don't want
anything more."
(another moment)
Sixty-five years - don't they go by
in a blink?
Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.
Quince
grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.
Now
Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
by a surge of guests.
Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
there is a tinge of sadness about her.
He heads towards her,
they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.
SUSAN
What a night.
PARRISH
I'm having a helluva time.
A moment.
SUSAN
You were right about Joe, he is
going somewhere --
PARRISH
(gently)
I'm sorry.
Susan is examining Parrish very closely.
SUSAN
Are you relieved?
PARRISH
Yes, but --
Parrish hesitates.
SUSAN
But what?
PARRISH
I want you to know how much I love
you.
That you've given a meaning
to my life that I had no right to
expect, and that no one can ever
take from me.
SUSAN
Daddy --
PARRISH
No -- I love you so much and I want
you to promise me something.
I
don't want you to ever worry about
me.
If anything should happen, I'm
going to be fine and everything's
going to be all right.
(a moment)
-- And I have no regrets.
Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.
PARRISH (cont'd)
And I want you to feel that way,
too.
SUSAN
I love you, Daddy --
PARRISH
That's why it's okay.
They drift into silence.
PARRISH (cont'd)
No regrets?
After a moment.
SUSAN
'No regrets'.
A long silence, Susan smiles.
PARRISH
It's a good feeling, isn't it?
Silence again.
SUSAN
Everybody's saying goodbye...
They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
understanding.
PARRISH
I'm still here.
(a moment)
Would you like to dance with me,
Susan?
SUSAN
Oh, yes --
He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.
PARRISH
If you don't mind dancing with an
old fogey like me.
SUSAN
Oh, Dad, you're not old.
You'll
never be old.
He takes her in his arms and they dance away.
ANOTHER ANGLE
On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.
His eyes are on
Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.
WAITER
Can I get you anything, sir?
Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.
JOE
Do you have any peanut butter?
The Waiter hesitates.
WAITER
I don't think so, sir.
JOE
Thank you, anyway.
The Waiter moves off.
Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.
ANOTHER ANGLE
On the dance floor.
PARRISH
What was that?
SUSAN
The fireworks are about to start.
Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.
SUSAN (cont'd)
(to Parrish)
Shall we?
PARRISH
You go ahead, honey, I'm going to
catch my breath.
Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.
She looks at
him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
smiles back.
Now she heads out with the crowd for the
fireworks.
When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
and heads up towards Joe.
Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.
JOE
Happy Birthday, Bill.
PARRISH
Thank you.
They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
Joe's gaze lingers.
PARRISH (cont'd)
Did you say goodbye?
JOE
Not exactly.
PARRISH
I guess you have your reasons.
JOE
Yes.
Silence.
PARRISH
Now that we have a moment, would you
mind if I expressed my gratitude for
what you did for Susan?
Joe waits.
PARRISH (cont'd)
I never heard her speak of any man
as she spoke of you -- It was always
what I wanted for her -- but what
happens to her now?
JOE
I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
These things have a way of working
out.
Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:
JOE (cont'd)
And would you mind if I expressed my
gratitude...?
Parrish waits.
JOE (cont'd)
For you.
For the time you've given
me.
For the person you are.
A moment.
PARRISH
Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
ruin my autopsy.
Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
crowd below, searching.
PARRISH (cont'd)
It's hard to let go, isn't it?
JOE
Yes.
PARRISH
That's life.
What can I tell you?
A silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.
They set off now away
from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
the river.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
fireworks display.
Among them is Susan, but her interest
isn't there.
Not something pulls her attention, an over-
powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.
Some-
thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
fireworks.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.
PARRISH
I'm getting a little dizzy, I can
feel my heart pumping --
But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
with him.
PARRISH (cont'd)
Should I be afraid?
Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.
JOE
Not a man like you.
Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
out again, Joe right with him.
In tandem they continue
on and disappear over the crest of the hill.
A barrage
of fireworks lights up the sky.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
up towards the hill.
There is nobody there.
She hesitates,
now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
walks up towards the hill.
Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
pulled by a magnet.
Now she stops again.
It is a man, he
keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.
SUSAN
Joe...?
He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
appealing.
They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
close.
SUSAN (cont'd)
You're here...
He is trying to get his bearings.
JOE
-- You bet.
Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.
SUSAN
Where did you go?
Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
time and place.
JOE
I don't know -- y'know, I don't know
-- it's all blurred up and hazy.
And
would y'know what I mean if I said I
don't think it's worth figuring out?
Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
lightheaded.
JOE (cont'd)
...But now I'm back.
Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
answer.
SUSAN
(gently)
That's it?
JOE
Well, I don't know what else to say.
It's a helluva party --
SUSAN
You think so?
JOE
Yeah...and you're the prettier
thing here.
Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
with the last moments fades away.
Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
a sudden intake of breath.
YOUNG MAN
Hey, you all right?
His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
support.
SUSAN
The coffee shop --
The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.
YOUNG MAN
I asked you if I said something
wrong and you said it was so right
it scared you.
Susan holds herself very still.
YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
And forgive me for saying this --
but then you said -- and it's been
with me ever since --
SUSAN
What has --?
He hesitates.
YOUNG MAN
You said you liked me.
SUSAN
No --
YOUNG MAN
Y'didn't?
A moment.
SUSAN
I said I liked you so much.
She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
revelations.
The Young Man senses her discomfort which
is on the edge of pain.
YOUNG MAN
Hey, everything's going great --
don't y'think?
She doesn't answer for a moment.
YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
Don't you feel that way?
SUSAN
...We know so little about each
other.
YOUNG MAN
But we've got time.
She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
completely vulnerable, waiting for her response.
A long
silence, the words come out haltingly:
SUSAN
I wish you could've known my
father...
Another moment.
YOUNG MAN
Me, too.
Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
completely intent on each other.
SUSAN
...What do we do now?
A long silence.
YOUNG MAN
It will come to us.
Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
up from below, the night fills with light.
The Young Man
searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
they start back towards the party.
