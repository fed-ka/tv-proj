      BROODING MUSIC swells as THREATENING CLOUDS roll along in 
      TIME LAPSE. The CREDITS begin. 

 

      POV through the windshield on the broken stripes rushing 
      by, emerging from the darkness and vanishing under the car 
      in the glow of the headlights.

                        But tonight I won't have anyone& 

 

      The car passes a sign reading "NO GAS OR SERVICES   75 MI." 

 

      The car continues along a winding mountain pass, 
      illuminated by the full moon.

      The TIRES SQUEAL as the car continues. 



      Ellen's car SLAMS into the rear of the Buick. 

 

      VARIOUS ANGLES as the car goes SKIDDING across the pass, 
      bounces back off the railing and just barley avoids a 
      nosedive off the end of the cliff. 

 

      BRUCE faces us from across a table at a trendy sidewalk 
      eatery. He seems a few years younger than Ellen, handsome 
      and rugged, with a devilish flirt in his eyes. There is a 
      charming energy and even humor in his voice. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                      I learned that when I was a kid. I 
                        also learned you gotta roll with the 
                        weirdness. 

      REVEAL a slightly younger, happier-looking Ellen sitting 
      across from him. She listens intently. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        You know? Because to me, the world is 
                      a pretty fucked-up place, Ellen. 

      Ellen nods. Bruce gives a small smile. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Sometimes it just makes me want to go 
                        out there and shoot all these 
                        assholes. 

      They share a LAUGH. She eyes him seductively, a flirty grin 
      on her lips. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        So I guess you don't think the meek 
                        shall inherit the earth? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        What, this? 

      He glances around the caf . 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Nah. They can have it. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        It's not so bad& 
                              (smiles) 
                        If you don't think about the price of 
                        gas and the commuter traffic. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You see now, that's fucked-up part. 
                        The gas, the traffic. You know, people 
                        are getting mad about it too. They 
                        are. If you ask me, one of these days, 
                        the whole thing's just gonna blow up. 
                                (beat) (more) 

 4                                       BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                      I mean, did you know that in Thailand, 
                        you can sell your baby, your 5-year 
                        old kid, to a sex shop? I mean, you 
                        can do the same thing here. The only 
                        difference is that you can't advertise 
                        for it. 

      Ellen gives a seductive half-laugh. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Are you always this charming on a 
                        first date, Bruce? Or do I just look 
                        like a girl who's really interested in 
                        what's going on in Thailand? 

      She plays with her hair and smiles. Bruce smiles back. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Sorry. I get a little worked up 
                        sometimes. I apologize. 

      She nods. They share a long look. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Do you wanna get outta 
                        here? 

      Bruce smiles. 

 

      There is a FLASH OF LIGHTENING and a CLAP OF THUNDER as 
      Bruce's FOUR-BY-FOUR pulls to a stop in front of his cabin 
      nestled in the woods. RAIN POURS DOWN. 

                                      ELLEN (V/O) 
                        Wow. God, this place is awesome. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        Yeah. My dad built it when I was 
                        little. We used to come up here every 
                        summer and go hunting. 

      POV through the windshield on Bruce and Ellen. The WIPERS 
      SLOP back and forth. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Man, it's really coming down. God, I 
                        hate the rain. 

      The driver's door opens and he hops out into the pouring 
      rain. 


 5                                       BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                              Whew! Oh, man! 

      Ellen does the same, letting out a playful SCREAM as the 
      rain soaks her. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Ah! 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Oh, Jesus! 

      Bruce dashes up the stairs for shelter beneath the front 
      porch awning. They both LAUGH. Ellen spreads her arms wide, 
      letting the rain soak her through. 

                                       ELLEN 
                        Oh! I love the rain! 
                                (beat) 
                        Oh, I love it. 

      She takes in a deep breath and spreads her arms again. 
      Bruce makes his way down the stairs. She LAUGHS. He moves 
      close to her and looks into her eyes. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Well, you look really good 
                        in it. 

      She smiles. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Well, thank you. 

      They share a beat of tense silence. He cups her face in his 
      hands and pulls her to him. They kiss. 

      The LIGHTNING CRASHES as we CUT TO-- 

 

      CLOSE ON the rear license plate of her car, which reads 
      "Oregon   RNI 8H4." 

      ANGLE ON the driver's door as Ellen gingerly gets out. She 
      spots the Buick behind her. Its lights are on and it 
      doesn't appear to be seriously damaged. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, great. 

      She glances around in the darkness. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Hello? 

      She shines her flashlight towards the Buick. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Are you okay? 



 7       Cautiously, she approaches. The driver's door is partially 
      ajar. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Hello? 

      She moves up to it to find that the car is empty. She 
      glances up to the treetops. An odd, SCREAMING SOUND is 
      heard perhaps animal, perhaps human. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Hello? 

      She turns back to the Buick and pulls open the driver's 
      door. Her eyes widen at what she sees. 

      REVEAL a BLOOD-SPATTERED garment on the passenger side and 
      MORE SPATTERS on the driver's seat. Ellen shines her 
      flashlight down and finds a THICK SWATH OF BLOOD. It TRAILS 
      from the car across the pavement to a steel railing. 

      Ellen stands at the railing. She shines her flashlight down 
      the CLIFF. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Hello? 

      ELLEN'S POV looking down the mountain. A steep dirt incline 
      leads about fifty feet into a thick forest. Halfway between 
      the trees, a DARK FIGURE lumbers through the brush. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Are you okay down there? It was my 
                        fault! I-- 

      There is no response from the approaching figure as it 
      comes into better view. He is large and wears a LONG CLOAK 
      and a WIDE BLACK HAT that obscures his face. We see now 
      that the lumbering gait is caused not by a limp, but by the 
      heavy object he drags behind him. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        My phone doesn't work! I can't call 
                        for help. 

      The Figure shuffles up the incline toward her. Ellen 
      narrows her eyes and shines her flashlight for a better 
      look. The Figure continues towards her, stumbling but 
      determined. Suddenly, she GASPS. 

      ELLEN'S POV on the bloodied, slashed-up face of a YOUNG 
      WOMAN as it drops out from behind the shuffling Figure. She 
      stares straight at Ellen with a look of horror. 


 8                                       YOUNG WOMAN 
                        Help me! 

      Ellen's eyes go wide. At just this moment, the Figure lifts 
      his head and doffs his hat to REVEAL himself. 

      This is MOONFACE. He boasts an ENORMOUS BALD HEAD, CHALKY 
      WHITE SKIN, and BLOODSHOT EYES. He GROWLS at Ellen, 
      REVEALING a set of wicked SILVER CAPPED TEETH. 

      Suddenly, in a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Moonface wields his razor-
      sharp hunting knife and slashes at Ellen, sending her 
      stumbling back onto the pavement. Her cellphone skitters 
      across the road. 

      Ellen backpedals on her feet and hands, GASPING. We see now 
      that she is dressed in a skirt and high heels. 

      Moonface GROWLS as he leaps onto the railing and is framed 
      by the light of the ENORMOUS FULL MOON. He LANDS on the 
      pavement with a THUD. 

      He moves in on Ellen, who leaps to a crouching position. 
      She glances this way and that. She spots the phone, but it 
      is out of reach. 

      Moonface slashes the air before her. She leaps up and 
      throws herself over the railing, the blade cutting air just 
      past her head as she vanishes into the void below. She 
        half-nosedives/half-tumbles down the hill, rolling and 
      stumbling, but finally managing to right her forward 
      flight. 

      ANGLE ON Moonface as he glares down the incline, GROWLING 
      after her. LIGHTNING strikes, illuminating his features for 
    a brief second. 

      CUT TO-- 

 

      Ellen GASPS and PANTS as she barrels through trees and 
      underbrush in a full-on terrified panic. LIGHTENING FLASHES 
      as she runs. Moonface races behind her. 

      QUICK CUTS as the chase continues. Ellen's breath comes 
      short and ragged. Moonface GROWLS. FLASHES OF LIGHTENING 
      providing momentary illumination through the dark branches 
      and foliage. 




 9       Ellen races along. Suddenly, she TRIPS over a root and 
      STUMBLES to the ground. She GASPS. Recovering herself, she 
      glances behind her and finds nothing. She leans against a 
      tree and catches her breath. 

      CUT TO BLACK 

      Bruce's voice begins. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        You've always got to expect the 
                          unexpected, and do the unexpected. 

      CUT TO-- 

 

      Bruce and Ellen jog over a SUSPENSION BRIDGE in a beautiful 
      canyon on a summer day. Both dressed in trail running gear. 
      Bruce jogs backwards so that he can face Ellen as he 
      speaks. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        See, that's what'll save you when some 
                        wacko who wants to put the hurt on 
                        you. You act just as crazy as they 
                        are, and they don't know what the fuck 
                        to do with you. 

      They stop in the middle of the bridge. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        And what happens if crazy doesn't 
                        work? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Oh, crazy always works. 

      He wraps his arm around her and pulls her close. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        But if it doesn't& 

      She smiles. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Yeah? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You fall back and you fight with 
                        whatever's available to you. 

      He looks up. 

 10                                       BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        You see it? 

                                      ELLEN 
                        What? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        This. 

      ANGLE ON the lovely rippling water and towering trees 
      surrounding them. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        All this wilderness. You can really 
                        use it to your advantage, you know? 

      She smiles. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh yeah? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Yeah. You could take a tree and rig a 
                        sling, or you can pick up a sharp 
                        stick and gouge someone's eye out. 

      She laughs. He strokes her cheek. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        My point is, as long as they don't see 
                        it coming, then you've got the edge. 
                        Okay? 

                                      ELLEN 
                      I think you've got to catch them 
                        first. 

      He moves in for a kiss. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Yep. 

      She wrests free and races off. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        You do. 









 11                                       BRUCE 
                        Really? 

      She gives a PLAYFUL SCREAM as she charges across the 
      bridge. He races after her. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        You did not just call me out like 
                        that. I'm going to get you, woman! 

      She giggles. 

 

      Ellen runs up to a large field set before the cabin, 
      laughing. Bruce runs after her and catches up quickly. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        I'm right behind you! Yeah! 

      He tackles her and they tumble to the grass together. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                      I guess I'm too fast for you, huh? 

      Bruce rolls on top, pinning her to the ground. She smiles 
      up at him. 

                                      ELLEN 
                      I let you catch me. 

                                      BRUCE 
                      I don t think so. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Yes. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        No. 

      They stare into each other's eyes for a beat. She smiles. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Let me up. 

      Bruce stares into her eyes. His own expression has 
      darkened, and there is a coldness to him that we haven't 
      seen before. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Bruce, let me up. 


 12       He does not respond. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Let me up. 

      She grabs his jacket and tries to pull herself up, but he's 
      got her pinned. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Let me up. 

      He grabs her hand and helps her up. She looks into his eyes 
      as he studies her intently. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        What? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        It's time to do the 
                          unexpected. 

    A small smile tugs at his lips. He reaches into his pocket 
      and fishes something out. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        What do you say? 

      Ellen stares at Bruce's hand, speechless. REVEAL a 
      beautiful DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING, glinting in the 
      sunlight. He waits for her reply. 

      CUT TO-- 

 

    A FLASH OF LIGHTENING illuminates Ellen's teary eyes. She 
      leans against the tree. Her breathing is RAPID. 

      ANGLE ON Moonface as he crunches through the brush, paces 
      away. 

      Ellen grits her teeth. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Do the unexpected. 

      FLASH OF LIGHTENING illuminates her purse nearby. 

      Moonface's boots strike the ground, very close now. Ellen 
      breaks cover, pounces on her purse and hits the ground 
      running. He follows. 



 13       BERSERK POV SHOTS as they run. Ellen's feet slam into the 
      ground, slogging through wet muck and leaves, while 
      Moonface follows at a terrific pace, narrowing the gap 
      fast. 

      Ellen happens upon a series of fallen trees, all overgrown 
      with heavy brush and vine and leaves, completely blocking 
      her path. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, shit! 

      She turns and her eyes go wide. She SCREAMS. 

      REVEAL Moonface not 10 feet away, his fists clenched, his 
      silver teeth bared. He GROWLS. 

      Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she loses her footing and 
      stumbles back against the mass of trees. Moonface pulls his 
      KNIFE. It WHOOSHES as he SPINS it in the air and catches it 
      by the blade. He waits a beat, then HURLS it straight at 
      Ellen's head. There is THWACK as it lands in a tree, just 
      inches away from her. Moonface charges towards her. 

      She squeezes through the fallen trees. In a flash, he rips 
      the knife out of the tree and comes after her. They crawl 
      beneath the vines and briars on their bellies, Moonface 
      quickly narrowing the gap. He takes a savage stab at her 
      legs with the knife. She SCREAMS and kicks back at him. His 
      face falls into the dirt. 

      She struggles out of her coat and squeezes under another 
      thick branch, leaving it behind. She scrambles up to a 
      thin, low-hanging branch. She grasps it and tests it 
      tension. She grows calmer, as if she now has an idea. 

      She jams her hand into her purse and fishes out a pair of 
      cosmetic scissors. Moonface GROWLS behind her. She SNAPS 
      the branch in two and jams half of it into the ground. She 
      then fits the finger holes of the scissors into the 
      abutment she has created, blades pointing out. She sets 
      this contraption against the second half of the branch. She 
      grabs her purse and races off. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Eat that, you motherfucker. 

      ANGLE ON Moonface. He finds his knife in the dirt and 
      continues to wriggle along on his belly. 

      He crawls up to her booby-trap and grasps the branch, 
      sending the scissors FLYING. 



 14       Ellen proceeds through the woods. She stops mid-flight as 
      she hears Moonface SCREAM. She waits for a beat, hears 
      nothing more, then continues along. 

      Moonface GROANS as he wrenches the scissors from his eye. 
      He CLAPS a hand over his wound and GASPS. 

      Ellen races along. LIGHTENING FLASHES and THUNDER CLAPS. 
      She stops short at a large, natural DEPRESSION in the earth 
      about five feet deep. She teeters precariously at its edge, 
      her eyes wide. 

      CUT TO BLACK 

      Bruce's voice begins. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        When everything else fails you, try 
                        anything. 

      CUT TO-- 

 

      Ellen FIRES A PISTOL three times. REVEAL her TARGET. She 
      hits it handily, but misses the vital areas. 

      Satisfied with her own work, she removes her EAR PROTECTORS 
      and turns to Bruce with a smug smile. Bruce examines her 
      work. 

                                      BRUCE 
                      I really thought you'd be better then 
                        that by now. 

      Ellen laughs. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Well, we all can't be as rough-and-
                        ready as my darling husband now, can 
                        we? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You know what? That's exactly the kind 
                        of thinking that's going to get you 
                        hurt. 

      She nods. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        All right? You're pulling your trigger 
                        and that's why your shots are all 
                        going wild. 


 15                                       ELLEN 
                        Okay. It's getting late. I told John 
                        and Aimee we'd meet them in town for 
                        dinner tonight. 

      Bruce loads his gun. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        All right. We'll see. 

      He FIRES, putting each of nine shots directly in the center 
      of the TARGET'S HEAD. Ellen looks to it, unnerved. 

      CUT TO BLACK 

      Bruce's voice begins. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        Balance is everything. Nature is 
                        balance. 

 

      CLOSE ON Ellen's shoe as it comes down on a medium-sized 
      TREE BRANCH, cracking it in half and creating an almost 
      perfect spear-like edge. She jams it, point up, into the 
      pit. 

 

      She rips HUNKS OF FOLIAGE from the nearby bushes and tosses 
      them overtop the depression, creating a camouflaged 
      DEADFALL TRAP. 

                                      ELLEN 
                                (whispers) 
                        Okay. Okay. 

      She hikes up her skirt and slip off her UNDERPANTS. She 
      quickly tears out the ELASTIC WAISTBAND. She dumps her 
      purse out and rifles through the contents. She finds a HAIR 
      ELASTIC, then paws around for something else. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Where are you? Where are you? Where 
                        are you? 

      She finds what she is looking for--a mean-looking NAIL 
      FILE. She holds it in her mouth as she wraps the elastic 
      around a long twig, then slides the nail file beneath the 
      elastic. She quickly tears off a long piece of the hem from 
      her skirt. 

      She threads the elastic from her underpants across the 
      abutment of a small tree, then grabs the swatch from her 
      skirt and ties it around another long twig. Moonface GROWLS 
      behind her. 

      She holds back the elastic with the long twig and positions 
      the nail file in front of it. She trails her skirt hem 
      along the ground and ties it to a stake, fashioning a 
      TRIPWIRE. 

      She ducks behind a tree and waits in silence. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Come on. 
                                (whispers) 
                        Come on. 

      LIGHTNING FLASHES. 



 18                                       ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Come on, you bastard. Come and get me. 

      ANGLE ON the silent, motionless trees. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Come on, you bastard. 
                              (raises her voice) 
                        Come and get me! 

      Finally, the foliage CRACKLES ahead of her. Ellen GASPS and 
      crouches low. 

    A DARK FIGURE lurches towards her. A FLASH OF LIGHTENING 
      REVEALS that it is Moonface's victim, the Young Woman. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, no. 

      She whimpers as she holds out her duct-taped wrists and 
      proceeds towards the pit, oblivious to her surroundings. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        No! No! No! No! No! 

      Ellen leaps towards the Woman. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        No! No! No! No! 

      There is a LOUD CRACK as the camouflage gives way. The 
      Woman plunges straight down. She hits bottom with a THUD 
      and SCREAMS. 

      Ellen clamps her hand to her mouth in horror. POV into the 
      pit on the Woman. She CRIES OUT. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING 
      REVEALS the stake below, driving right through her upper 
      thigh. She HOWLS in pain. 

    A conflicted Ellen considers this for a beat. Sensing 
      something, she whirls around to find Moonface right behind 
      her, his knife drawn. He GROWLS. 

      Before she can move, he grabs her right by the throat. She 
      GASPS. ANGLE ON the booby trap she has constructed, the 
      nail file GLEAMING in the moonlight.  Moonface stumbles 
      backwards, tripping the skirt hem and sending the nail file 
      flying. 

      Surprised, he lets go with a GRUNT. She looks down to find 
      that the file has impaled her shoulder, six inches deep. 
      She SCREAMS, then breaks the twig off.  


 19         Disoriented, he glances over his shoulder to see the now-
      tripped booby-trap. Ellen stumbles off into the woods. 

                                      YOUNG WOMAN 
                                (screams) 
                        Help me! 

      Moonface looks to the pit. 

                                      YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, God! Help me! 

      She CRIES and SCREAMS. POV into the pit as a FLASH OF 
      LIGHTENING illuminates her horrified expression. She 
      SCREAMS. 

      CLOSE ON Moonface as he looks down on her. Slowly, he draws 
      his finger to his lips. 

                                      MOONFACE 
                        Shh. 

 

      GASPING AND PANTING, Ellen staggers out of the thick woods 
      and crashes to her knees in the middle of what appears to 
      be a road or a clearing. She catches sight of something O/S 
      and SCREAMS. 

      PAN UP an odd construction of a BODY wrapped in BURLAP and 
      BARBED WIRE, tied to an ENORMOUS CRUCIFIX. A ROTTED, almost 
      SKELETAL FACE looks down at her. 

      Ellen stumbles to her feet and looks around. She finds 
      another of these grim scarecrows next to the first, then 
      another, and another, and more after that, lined up along a 
      road that stretches about fifty feet to a smallish log 
      cabin, from which a weak light emanates. 

      Ellen stumbles down this "Crucifix Road," hyperventilating 
      and crying. She rushes towards the house and stumbles up 
      the porch, where she finds herself face-to-face with a 
      ROTTED CORPSE in a wheel chair on the porch. She CRIES and 
      SCREAMS, flailing this way and that. 

      She heads for a path, but not two feet along, finds herself 
      at the CLIFF'S EDGE, overlooking churning RIVER fifty feet 
      below. PAN UP the opposite side of the cliff to REVEAL 
      another cabin. 




 20       She turns to double back, but stops short at the sight of 
      Moonface. He stands before her, SNARLING and HISSING, the 
      Woman's body at his side. 

      Ellen SCREAMS. QUICK SHOTS of the CRUCIFIED BODIES, which 
      are illuminated with intermittent FLASHES OF LIGHTENING. 
      Ellen CRIES and SCREAMS. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        No! Please! 

      Moonface lumbers towards her. Suddenly, she loses 
      consciousness and passes out, slumping limply to the 
      ground. 

      CUT TO BLACK 

      Bruce's voice begins. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        You're weak, Ellen. You've always been 
                        weak. I knew it the first time I met 
                        you. 

 

      In her hiking gear, Bruce and Ellen march up to the front 
      of the cabin. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Pitiful. You were born weak. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Then why the hell'd you marry me, 
                        Bruce? What the hell are we doing 
                        here, huh? What's the fucking point of 
                        any of this? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Because I want to teach you something. 
                        Look at me when I'm talking to you. 
                        Look at me Ellen. 

      She turns to him. He points at her. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                      I wanted to make you strong. 
                                (beat) 
                        And I know you've got potential. I 
                        know you do. I know it's in you, and I 
                        will not let you prove me wrong. 

      She shakes her head. He pulls his knife. 


 21                                       BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Show me. 

      He holds it out to her. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Are you kidding? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        Take the knife. 
                                (beat) 
                        Please. Take the fucking knife. Do it 
                        for me. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, come on. 

                                      BRUCE 
                              (shouts) 
                        Take the fucking knife, Ellen! Show me 
                        what you've got. Come on. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        So it all comes down to this? 

      His eyes are steely. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You bet your life. 

        Exasperated, Ellen grabs for the knife. He yanks it away 
      from her in mockery. She eyes him, grabs it again, and 
      attempts his wrist-flicks. She manages a couple of good 
      throws before it tumbles to the ground. She SIGHS. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        That was pathetic. 

      She stares at the ground. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Pick up the knife. 

      She moves for it, eye still fixed on the ground. He slaps 
      at her wrist. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Don't take your eyes off me. 

      She glares at him, then crouches into a practiced "sweep-
      and-clear" fighting pose. She sweeps her leg at him. He 
      hops back from it. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Whoa! 

 22       She leaps up and stares him down. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        All right. 
                                (beat) 
                        You want to cut me? Come on! Come on! 

      She lunges for him. He ducks her easily, then grabs her and 
      pins her arms behind her back. He whispers into her ear. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        See? I knew you could do so much 
                        better. 

      He gives her butt a firm slap and shoves her away. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                                (gestures to his face) 
                        Come on. Come on, cut me. 

      She takes several swipes at him with the blade, all of 
      which he dodges successfully. He grabs her arm. She reaches 
      out and SLAPS him across the face. Aghast, his eyes go 
      wide. He lets go of her. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        Give me that knife. 

      He reaches for it. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        No. 

      As she leaps back, she SLICES his hand. He grasps it, 
      shocked. They share a long silence. At last, Ellen takes a 
      deep breath and shakes her head 

                                      ELLEN 
                        I'm leaving you. 

      On a speechless Bruce. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                      I can't do this anymore, Bruce. 
                              (beat) 
                        I'm sorry. 

      She holds the knife out to him. 

                                      BRUCE 
                          Everybody's sorry for something, 
                        Ellen. 
                                (beat) 
                        I'll survive. 


 23       He moves off. She stares after him for a beat, then emits a 
      small SIGH. 

      CUT TO BLACK 

      Bruce's voice comes up. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                        Ellen, you can survive anything. 

      FADE IN: 

 

      All is silent. A FULL MOON hangs above the cabin. 

      CLOSE ON the moon. 

 

      Ellen moves away from the cabin with steely resolve, the 
      crowbar in hand. She moves alongside the crucifixes. An OWL 
      HOOTS. Her face tenses. She turns to check behind her. 
      Finding nothing, she continues along. 

 

      CLOSE ON the KEYS, which dangle from the ignition. Ellen 
      turns them, and the engine SPUTTERS to life. 

      Behind the wheel of the car, Ellen heaves with relief. 

      She gets out and goes around to the front of the car, where 
      the hood is propped open. She closes it.  

      She finds that the Buick is still there, door still open. 
      She whips around to look behind her. All is still and 
      quiet. 

      She moves around to the back of her car and pops the trunk. 
      Her face is partially illuminated as she gazes down into 
      it, an inscrutable expression upon her face. ANGLE ON the 
      trunk to REVEAL  

      The DEAD FACE of Bruce stares straight up at her, a look of 
      confused horror in his wide eyes. His body has been jammed 
      into the trunk. He is eerily lit by the moon. 

      An icy Ellen stares down at him. 

      SHOCK CUT TO-- 

 

      All is silent. 

 

      Mounted high on the crucifix, "Uncle Brucey" now rests amid 
      the other grim scarecrows. 

      The lamenting MUSIC from the opening credit sequence 
      begins. 

 40                                       SONG 
                        It's good to hear your voice 
                        It's good to hear your breathing& 

 

      The rising sun peeks over the mountain. 

      Ellen's car drives along. 

                                      SONG (CONT'D) 
                        I'm running out of hours 
                        I'm running out of reasons&
