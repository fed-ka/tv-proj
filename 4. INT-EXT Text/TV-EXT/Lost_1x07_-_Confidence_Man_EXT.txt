    A LONE FIGURE walks down the beach.  We re nowhere near the 
      WRECK.  This is straight up PRISTINE.  And the figure is --

    -- KATE.  Carrying canvas bags overflowing with BANANAS as 
    she comes upon A PILE OF CLOTHES, folded neatly beside A PACK 
    OF CIGARETTES and a worn PAPERBACK of WATERSHIP DOWN.

      Curious, Kate kneels to examine the book -- then, a SHOUT --

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Helluva book.*

      Kate stiffens, turns to the WATER.  Finds SAWYER, bare-
      chested as he wades back to land.  Smiles --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    It s about bunnies.*

      Sawyer emerges from the water, walking toward her.  The look 
    on Kate s face says it all as he steps into frame to reveal --

    -- he s BARE-ASS NAKED... and yeah, he could put his clothes 
    on, but nope, he s gonna stand here, waiting for a reaction.

      Kate just looks at him -- and he just looks at her.  Daring 
    her eyes to drop.  Finally:

                                  KATE
                    Water s cold, huh?

      Ouch.  But Sawyer GRINS --

                                  SAWYER
                    You bet.  How  bout you come a 
                    little closer and warm me up?

      Okay, she reviles the guy, but damn if there isn t chemistry 
      here.  Not that she d ever cop to it.

                                  KATE
                    Does this ever actually work?

                                  SAWYER
                    Depends on what you mean by  this?

                                                                    SAWYER
                        KATE
      This.  This macho...--  Macho?   Ain t heard that 
                                                  one in awhile.  Makes me 
                                                  wanna grow a mustache.

      Kate just shakes her head.  Why fucking bother?

                                  KATE
                    You sure know how to make a girl 
                    feel special, Sawyer.

    We PUSH IN TIGHT ON SAWYER as Kate walks off --


      SAWYER -- hair still wet and a smile on his face.

      He walks through the jungle.  Off the beaten path.  It s  *
      dark.  SECLUDED.  Hears a NOISE up ahead and he tenses up.

      The sound has triggered an alarm.  ANIMAL INSTINCT takes 
      over.  Sawyer RUNS -- bursting through the BRUSH to find --

    A fellow CASTAWAY (RICHARD, 50 s.)  Rifling through some 
      SUITCASES - tossing aside booze, cigarettes, sunscreen...

      ...this is a CACHE OF BOOTY from the plane crash.  And 
      there s no doubt it belongs to --

                                  SAWYER
                    What re you doing in my stuff, son?

      Richard JUMPS at the sound of Sawyer s voice from behind him. 

    A SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH PRE-LAPS into --

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    This is gonna hurt.


      WAVES CRASH as we find a more sparsely-populated BEACH.  Many 
      of the castaways have moved to the caves...

      ...but not CLAIRE, who wears her FLOPPY HAT and sits in her 
      disembodied PLANE SEAT as she writes in her JOURNAL.  So 
      engrossed, she doesn t see --

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Morning delivery!

      CHARLIE, offering TWO BOTTLES OF WATER.  She smiles.  There s  *
    a nascent connection between these two, and yeah, even hints 
      of ROMANCE.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re sweet.*

                                    CHARLIE
                    Figured in your condition, y know 
                    with the extra  baggage ...

                                  CLAIRE
                    I can still walk, you know.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Barely.  Anyway, I worry about you.  *
                    Out here.  It s very... sunny.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thus my hat.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Right.  Hat.  Sun hat.  Brilliant.*
                          (then)
                    Lots of hats at the caves.  And hey 
                    -- we ve got a doctor, too.  
                    That ll come in handy, eh?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (giggles; but)
                    I like the beach, Charlie.

      Claire smacks her leg.  Something just BIT her.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Who wouldn t want to spend 
                    their day with sand fleas?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I want to be here, Charlie.
                          (serious; believing)
                    For when we get rescued.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Right.  For when we get rescued.

      And OFF CHARLIE, knowing full well that ain t gonna happen...


      Sawyer sits and smokes just outside his TENT on the beach,  *
      doing something we haven t seen him do since the PILOT -- *

      Reading his LETTER.

      Worn.  Creased.  A mystery.  But whatever it says, it 
      provokes a strong, emotional reaction in Sawyer - and it 
      looks a lot like PAIN.  But Sawyer s reverie is broken as he  *
      hears a question -- posed more as a guttural threat: *

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Where is it.*

      Sawyer quickly folds up the letter, but he does not get up.

                                  SAWYER
                    Hey, Doc.  Long time, no see.

                                  JACK
                    Where is it?

                                  SAWYER
                    Where s what?

                                  JACK
                    The woman s asthma medication.   
                    Her inhalers.

                                  SAWYER
                    Oh.  That.

                                  JACK
                    You attacked a man because he was 
                    trying to help his sick wife.

                                  SAWYER
                    No -- I whooped a thief  cause he 
                    was going through my stuff--*

                                  JACK
                    Yours?  What makes it yours, man?  
                    You think because you take it out 
                    of a suitcase --*

                                  SAWYER

                    Commie sharefest you re runnin  
                    over in Cave Town -- but down here, *
                      possession s nine tenths and a 
                    man s got a right to protect his 
                    property.

      Jack s had just about enough of this shit.

                                  JACK
                    Get up.

                                  SAWYER
                    Why?  You wanna see who s taller?

                                  JACK
                    Get.  Up.

                                  SAWYER
                    You sure you wanna make this your 
                    problem, Doc?

                                  JACK
                    Yeah.  I m sure.

      And so, Sawyer gets up.  Jack takes a step toward him -- so 
      ready to fucking rumble that he misses the arrival of --

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    What s going on.

      -- Sawyer turns to see KATE.

                                  SAWYER
                    We were just exchangin  recipes. *

      Jack REACTS to Kate s presence.  FUCK.  Doesn t want to kick  *
      Sawyer s ass in front of her.  Eager to take advantage of  *
      this, Sawyer flashes that GRIN --*

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)*
                    Sorry we couldn t work things out, *
                    Doc.*

      And as Kate wonders what she just stepped into, we STAY WITH  *
      SAWYER as he walks off -- CLOSING in and once we re TIGHT,  *
      PAN DOWN to see his fist closed tightly around THAT LETTER.

      And off that image we SMASH INTO:


      Jack storms down the beach, fucking FRUSTRATED.  Kate trails. *

                                  KATE
                    That won t get us the medicine.

                                  JACK
                    Maybe not.  But it ll feel good.

                    Okay.  So what s stopping you?*

      Jack looks at Kate -- SURPRISED.  She s serious.  He thinks  *

      Let me talk to Sawyer.
                                                  -- What?

                                  JACK
                    This guy doesn t know reason.

                                  KATE
                    Maybe not.  But my plan is still 
                    better than yours.

      Jack looks at her.  Fortunately, he likes Kate more than he 
      hates Sawyer.  Smiles despite himself.

                                  JACK
                    What makes you think he ll listen?

                                  KATE
                    He says we have a connection.*

      And although he s probably not aware of this consciously, 
      Jack might just be a little JEALOUS when he says:

                                  JACK
                    Do you?

                                  KATE
                    Please.

      And as we can t help but notice that wasn t exactly a 
      denial...


      An AXE slams down into a piece of WOOD, splitting it in half.

      REVEAL SAWYER, sweating as he tosses the pieces into a PILE.  
      He reaches for another piece of DRIFTWOOD AS --

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    So what do you want?

      Sawyer glances to see KATE, but just keeps on chopping:

                                  SAWYER
                     Scuse me?

                                  KATE
                    What do you want, Sawyer?

                    tick.  What do I want?

      CRACK.  Splits another piece of wood.  Then, turns to Kate.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    A kiss ought to do it.

                                  KATE
                    What?

                                  SAWYER
                    A kiss.  From you.  Right now.

      Kate just stares.  He can t possibly... but he stares back.  
      Yeah.  He s serious.  Kate shakes her head, ANGRY now --

                        KATESAWYER
    I don t buy it.
                                                  -- Buy what?

                                  KATE
                    The act.  You try too hard, Sawyer.  
                    I ask you to help a sick woman and 
                    you want me to kiss you?  No one 
                    can be that disgusting.

      ON SAWYER, getting pissed.  Why?  Because maybe Kate s a 
      little close to the mark here.  And she s not done --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I ve seen you, y know.

                                  SAWYER
                    Seen me what?

                                  KATE
                    With that piece of paper.  The one 
                    you keep in your wallet.  I ve seen 
                    your face when you read it.  And 
                    the way you fold it up so 
                      carefully.  It means something to 
                    you.  So play your games all you 
                    want -- but I know there s a human 
                    being in there somewhere.
                          (beat: compassionate)
                    Give me the medication.  Please.

      And that just sits there for a few beats.  Just let it sink 
      in.  Did she actually get through to him?  Then:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     17.

                                  SAWYER
                    You think you understand me?

                        KATESAWYER
      Yeah.  I think I --
                                                  -- Shut up.

      Kate recoils.  The pure VENOM in Sawyer -- not the playful 
      rogue we re used to.  No.  This is serious.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Wanna know what kind of human being 
                    I am?

      And he reaches into his pocket.  Removes the ENVELOPE.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Read it.

      Kate takes a few steps back -- scared -- but he grabs her 
      wrist.  TIGHT.  Stuffs the letter into her other hand.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Read it.

      He lets go of her, but doesn t step back.  Let there be no 
        misunderstanding here -- Kate better fucking do what he says.

      So she unfolds the letter.  A beat.  Then:*

                                  KATE
                     Dear Mr. Sawyer.  You don t know 
                    who I am.  But I know who you are.  *
                    And I know what you done.  You *
                    slept with my mother...
                          (beat; slower now)
                    And then you stole my dad s money 
                    all away.  So he got angry and he 
                    killed my mother.  And then he 
                    killed himself, too. 

                                  SAWYER
                    Don t stop now.  You re gettin  to 
                    the good part.

      Kate looks at him.  Trying to process all this.  Not wanting 
      to continue, but not really having a choice.







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     18.
      (CONT'D): (3)1111


                                  KATE
                     All I know is your name.  But one 
                    of these days I am gonna find you 
                    and I am going to give you this 
                    letter so you ll remember what you 
                    done to me.
                          (beat)
                    You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer. 

      And that s it.  Sawyer waits a moment.  Hoping Kate s eyes 
      will come back up to meet his...

      ...but she can t.  He reaches out, snatches the letter and 
      gets in real close -- his voice part whisper, part GROWL --

                                  SAWYER
                          (more a vitriolic  fuck *

                    Now how  bout that kiss.*

      But of course Kate is just frozen -- stunned -- and so, after  *
    a long beat.*

                    ...I didn t think so.*

      And Sawyer turns and walks away.  But we re settling into an  *
      ECU OF KATE -- stricken.

      And as her eyes finally come up to him go...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

      The sun rises on another DAY.  Those remaining on the beach  *
      doing their morning routines.  And we find --*


      Charlie and Claire, hanging WET CLOTHES on a makeshift  *
      CLOTHESLINE strung between two pieces of wreckage -- *

                                  CLAIRE
                    Warm, clean towels.  Like when they 
                    first come out of the dryer.
                          (then)
                    Your turn.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Banoffi pie.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You said that already.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (can taste it)
                    The toffee and cream.  And crumbled 
                    biscuits.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Is food the only thing you miss?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     24.
      (CONT'D):1717


                                  CHARLIE
                    Forgive me if the practicality of a 
                    clean towel eludes me.  For God s 
                    sake, you re a pregnant woman!  
                    Don t you crave anything?  Pickles?  
                    Ice Cream?  Fried Chocolate -

                                  CLAIRE
                    - Peanut butter.  I m the only 
                      Australian who loves peanut butter.

      Charlie processes this for a moment.  Then, with a smile:

                                    CHARLIE
                    I can get you peanut butter.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Right.  Sure you can.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Indeed... and when I provide you 
                    with your revered peanut butter, 
                    you must vacate this sandy strip of 
                      depression and move to the caves.
                          (puts out his hand)
                    Deal?

      Claire laughs.  Doesn t quite think he ll get any peanut 
      butter, but still likes this guy.  Puts her hand in his.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re on.

      And OFF CHARLIE, wondering where the hell he is going to find 
      fucking PEANUT BUTTER, we drop right into the middle of:


      HANDHELD.  INTENSE.  Jack & Sayid, fierce determination, 
      literally DRAGGING an unconscious Sawyer off the beach.

      FIND KATE riding in their wake --

                                  KATE
                    What are you doing?

                                  SAYID
                    We re solving a problem.  Do not 
                    concern yourself.

                                  KATE
                          (catching on)
                    You re going to torture him?

      Jack s eyes FLASH.  But he says nothing.  Ain t happy about 
      it, but COMMITTED to it.  He and Sayid have now reached the 
      TREE LINE.  Kate reaches out, grabs him by the arm --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Jack -- if you do this...
                          (beat)
                    You re no better than he is.

                                  JACK
                    This was his choice.  Not mine.

      And with that, he gently pulls his arm out of her grasp and 
      disappears into the JUNGLE.  OFF KATE --


      We find CHARLIE, man on a mission, nipping at HURLEY s heels. *

      Hurley stops dead in his tracks.  Turns back.

                    before you ll wanna give me a  *
                    piggyback ride.*

      Hurley shakes his head, starts walking again.  Charlie 
      follows, feeling like quite the shit --

                                    CHARLIE

      WATER SPLASHES INTO THE FACE OF --

      SAWYER, his lip bleeding -- ROUSED AWAKE with a blast of 
      water to the face.  COMING TO -- sputtering, spitting - gets 
      his bearings and sees...

      SAYID, standing over him, tossing aside the empty plastic 
      pail that held the water.

      BACK ON SAWYER, recognizing, as he pulls at them, his HANDS 
      are tied behind his back, around the trunk of a tree.  He 
      shakes his head and glares at Sayid.

                                  SAWYER
                    Well, ain t you the brave one?  
                    Jumping a guy when he s nappin --

      Sayid crosses away, revealing -- JACK, standing a short 
      distance behind him, his arms crossed.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Huh.  Well now we got ourselves a 
                    party.  Couple more fellas, we can 
                    deal a little stud.

      Jack doesn t say a word, just stares at Sawyer.

      SNAP -- a dry CRACK brings Sawyer s attention back to Sayid 
      who has just BROKEN OFF A BAMBOO STALK.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                          (faux frown)
                    Uh oh.  I m in trouble, ain t I?

                                  JACK
                    We gave you every chance to do the 
                    right thing, Sawyer.  All we wanted 
                    was the asthma medicine.  Just tell 
                    me where your stash is.  Where the 
                    medicine is.  And we ll stop.

                                  SAWYER
                    Stop what, Chico?

      SNAP!  Jack looks over as Sayid breaks off another piece of 
      BAMBOO.  Turns back to Sawyer --

                                  JACK
                    It doesn t have to be this way.

      Sawyer s smirk is gone, replaced by STEELY RESOLVE --

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah.  It does.

      Jack and Sawyer stare at each other, then...

      CLOSE as Sayid kneels down beside Sawyer, just behind him, 
      close enough to speak into his ear.  Begins to strip CHUTES 
      from the bamboo --

                                  SAYID
                    We do not have bamboo in Iraq, 
                    though we have something similar.  
                    Reeds.  But their effect is the 
                    same when the chutes are inserted 
                    under the fingernails.

      Sawyer turns his head a bit to face Sayid --

                                  SAWYER
                    Know what I think, Ali?  I think 
                    you ve never actually tortured 
                    anybody in your life.

      Sayid takes that in, then...

      HE GRABS Sawyer s hand on the other side of the tree.  BENDS 
      THE FINGERS BACK.

      ON SAWYER, chuckling, despite himself...

                                  SAYID
                      Unfortunately for us both, you re *
                    wrong.

      And this all happens mercifully BELOW FRAME as --

      Sayid JAMS A CHUTE under one of Sawyer s fingernails.  Sawyer 
      GRUNTS -- let s out a sharp hiss of PAIN.

      ON JACK, standing by, averts his eyes.  Conflicted.  And 
      Sawyer?

                                  SAWYER
                    That s it?  S all you got?  
                      Splinters?  No wonder we kicked 
                    your ass in the Gulf War.

      And Sayid pushes the chute in deeper...

      PUSH IN ON JACK, an agonized expression on his face, as 
      Sawyer SCREAMS OUT in pain...


      The CAMERA pans off various beach dwellers, reacting to the 
      DISTANT SCREAMING coming from the jungle, looking at each 
      other, perplexed... We HEAR a couple ad-libs --  Oh my god.  
      and  It s about time someone did something about him.  as we--

      PAN OVER to CLOSE-UP ON KATE, staring off into the jungle 
      knowing all too well what that sound it... *


      ON JACK, still suffering through this as he hears SAWYER S 
      SCREAMS.  Finally, he moves towards them --

                                  JACK
                    Sayid...
                          (not hearing him)
                    SAYID!

      ON SAYID as he looks up at JACK --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Let him catch his breath.*

      ON SAWYER, his head lolls, exhausted from his punishment as 
      his screams...

                                  SAWYER
                    Don t... Don t stop now... Think my 
                    sinuses are finally clearin ...

      And Jack s had enough -- lunges at Sawyer -- GRABS his head  *
      and holds it face to face with him as he demands:

                                  JACK
                    What the hell is wrong with you?!  
                    Why are you making us do this?!  
                    Just tell us where the medicine is.

                                  SAWYER
                    More bamboo!  Let s go!  C mon!  
                    C MON!!!

                                  SAYID
                    Enough of this --

      And Sayid slides up next to Jack -- and he s got LOCKE S 
      HUNTING KNIFE.  Brings it within an inch of Sawyer s eye --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     34.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Perhaps losing an eye will loosen 
                    your tongue...

                      SAWYERJACK
      Man, you re just a big, 
      walking cliche, ain t you?-- Sayid, this isn t--

      But Sayid is moving the knife even CLOSER.  MACRO-CLOSE.  And 
      he s actually gonna fucking do it --

                                  SAWYER
                    Okay!  Okay, you win.

      Sayid holds the knife steady --

                                  SAYID
                    Where is it?

    A beat.  Then --

                                  SAWYER
                    Only person I ll tell --
                          (directly to Jack)
                    Is her.

      Jack knows exactly who  her  is.  Sayid looks at Jack, his 
      knife still poised at Sawyer s eye.

                                  JACK*
                    ...Kate?*

                                  SAYID
                    He s stalling...

                                  SAWYER
                    That s the deal.*
                          (serious)
                    Take it or leave it.

      ON JACK, actually considering Sawyer s offer as we hear a 
      GRAVELLY VOICE --

                                  KILEY (PRE-LAP)
                    Tell me, Sawyer - do you want to 
                    die?


      We came back OUT OF SAWYER S HEAD to find --

      JACK standing, looking down at Sawyer -- arms still trussed 
      behind the tree.  His eyes come up, full of VENOM for Jack.  
      But what Jack offers in return is CURIOSITY --

                                  JACK
                    What s your problem, Sawyer?

      And that just hangs there for a few moments.  And we re 
        anticipating Sawyer s response when -- NOISE from the 
      surrounding jungle.  Jack turns to see --

      SAYID returning.  Behind him, KATE.  And as soon as she sees 
      Sawyer tied up like an animal -- no matter what she thinks of 
      the guy -- There s a flash of VULNERABILITY.

                                  SAYID
                    Okay.  She s here.  Now tell us.

                                  SAWYER
                    Uh uh.  No.
                          (beat)
                    I want to talk to her alone.

      Jack uncrosses his arms -- PISSED -- Sayid already moving 
      back towards Sawyer --

                                  SAYID
                    You are through making requests...

                                  KATE
                    Stop.
                          (then)
                    I ll be okay.  Just go.  Let s get 
                    this over with.

                                  SAWYER
                    You heard the lady.  Scram.

      Man... Jack want to YANK this guy s head off, but --

                                  KATE
                    Jack --
                          (he looks at her)
                    I ve got it.

    A BEAT.  Jack turns his look to Sawyer, who offers up this 
      shit-eating GRIN.  Back to Kate --

                                  JACK
                    We ll be close.

      And as Jack and Sayid (grudgingly so) walk off into the 
      jungle, CAMERA DROPS DOWN on the OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE to 
      find --

      SAWYER twisting his wrists around inside the bungee rope *
      binding them -- starting to working himself free. *

      Kate oblivious to this as she approaches him.  Matter-of-fact 
      tone undercut by concern --

                                  KATE
                    What did they do to you?

                                  SAWYER
                    Nothin .  Just got a manicure.

                                  KATE
                          (shakes her head; then)
                    So I m here.  Where is it?

                                  SAWYER
                    Happy to tell you...
                          (beat)
                    Soon as I get that kiss.

                                  KATE
                    What? -- Are you serious?

                                  SAWYER
                    Baby, I m tied to tree in the 
                    Jungle of Mystery and I just got 
                    tortured by a damn spinal surgeon 
                    and a genuine I-raqi.*
                          (beat)
                     Course I m serious.

      Kate just looks at him.  Not knowing quite WHAT to think.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)

      ON KATE.  Yeah.  It s fucking ridiculous... But dammit if he 
      doesn t make a compelling argument.  And dammit if there 
      isn t a strong contingent of women out there watching this 
      show who WANT her to do it.

      And we can see the moment in which she makes up her mind.

                                  KATE
                    Okay.

                                  SAWYER
                    Okay.

      Kate approaches him.  Squats down on her haunches.  Gets 
      close.  Looks into his eyes.  He looks back.

      And her is the first kiss on LOST.

      What makes it interesting is that even though it starts out 
      as a chore -- a necessity -- somewhere about three or four 
      seconds in, it becomes something ELSE.  And just before it 
      actually goes from something else to REAL...

      Kate pulls away.

      And we milk this delicious moment afterward for all it s 
      worth.  And despite the insanity of the circumstances under 
      which it happened, both of them felt something.  Finally --  *
      and when Sawyer talks to her now, it s softer -- that kiss *
      did something to him -- some of his swagger is gone -- he s *
      just a man now --*

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I don t have it.

                    What?

                                  SAWYER
                    The medicine.  I don t have it.  
                    Never did.

      WHAT?  Kate s head is spinning --

                                  KATE
                    Your book -- they said you got it

      SLAP!  We didn t even see Kate s hand move.  Sawyer s face 
      rocks to the side.  Damn -- she hit him hard.  Sawyer turns 
      back to her, blood trickling from his lip --

      But she s already walking away.


      Kate strides up to JACK AND SAYID --

                                  KATE
                    He doesn t have it.

                    What?

                                  SAYID
                    He s lying.  He...

                    No.  He s not.  Not about this.

      Jack can t believe it.  It makes no fucking sense.  But while 
      he s stymied...

      Sayid is fucking INCENSED.  And he UNSHEATHES his KNIFE as he 
      heads back the way Kate came as we CUT BACK TO --


      SAWYER.  Working through the pain, he keeps his eyes on the 
      prize - loosening the bonds around his wrists. *

      -- and they re coming free - not a moment too soon - as  *
      Sawyer looks up to see -

      SAYID arriving at the clearing - knife in hand - just as the 
      cord finally comes undone-- Sawyer pulls his arms out and he-- *

      Throws himself at Sayid, holding out his arm to block Sayid s 
      knife.  Sayid twists, THUMPS Sawyer in the KIDNEY but --

    - Sawyer LUNGES for Sayid s KNIFE HAND, grabs his wrist --  *
      the two in close quarters -- GRAPPLING as --*

      JACK arrives at the clearing, Kate right behind him -

      HAND-HELD -- DIRTY as Sayid and Sawyer ROLL ON THE GROUND,  *
      PLAYING FOR FUCKING KEEPS and suddenly -- *

      SAWYER LETS OUT A CRY OF AGONIZING PAIN. *

      Sayid instantly freezes -- looks down to see his white shirt  *
      STAINED WITH BLOOD --*

      But Jack is here and he s pushing Sayid aside because - *

      The knife is literally STICKING OUT OF SAWYER S ARM -- lodged  *
      deep in his BICEP -- and it is fucking GUSHING BLOOD -- *

                      SAYIDJACK
      -- He... he got loose -- 
      attacked me ---- You hit an artery -

      Sawyer in PAIN, but in some degree of SHOCK too.  KATE  *

      And Jack, medical instincts kicking in, wraps his head around  *
      the hilt and --*

      Sawyer CRIS OUT IN PAIN - clenches down his teeth as Jack 
      sticks his hand into the wound - trying to find the artery as 
      Sawyer reflexively SQUIRMS --*

                    Stay still, dammit!

      Sawyer s fist clench around the earth - his fingernails 
      digging into the ground as Jack does his grim duty -- SHIT --  *
      Jack s hand -- already SOAKED with Sawyer s blood... *

      And off these two men -- one literally holding the other s  *

      Kate is here, but it s JACK who s holding Sawyer s artery 
      closed with his bare hand -- Sawyer completely dependent on 
      Jack and hating every fucking second of it. *

                                  SAWYER

                     cause that s what you do.  You fix 
                      everything up all nice.
                          (looks to Kate)
                    Tell him to let go, Freckles.  We 
                    already made out -- what I got left 
                    to live for?

      Jack REACTS to this.  Looks to Kate -- her adverted gaze 
      answer enough that Sawyer isn t completely full of shit. *

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Hey, Jack?  You should know *
                    something -- Right now?  Tables 
                    were turned?
                          (blinking to stay 
                            conscious)
                    I d watch you die.

      And Sawyer barely manages a smile as his eyes finally CLOSE.  
      And after a moment of COMPLETE DARKNESS --


      CLAIRE dozes.  Peaceful.  Lovely.  Astrology Book by her 
      side.  Charlie arrives.  Trying not to wake her, he starts to 
      fold and pack her clothing.  As she does, Claire wakes up --

                                  CLAIRE
                    What... what re you doing?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Packing your stuff.

      He reaches for her Astrology Book.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I m guessing you ll be taking this 
                    with.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Where?

                                  CHARLIE
                    The caves.
                          (off her look)
                    You re moving.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (a beat; gets it)
                    You didn t -- Peanut butter?

      Charlie nods.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                          (psyched)
                    No way.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Just like you ordered.

      Charlie reaches into his bag.  Before pulling his hand out --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    There s one thing, though.  It s 
                    extra smooth.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That s okay.

      And finally, Charlie produces... An EMPTY GLASS JAR.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                          (disappointed)
                    It s... it s empty.

      He unscrews the cap, digs his fingers in, swirls them around.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What?  No it s not.  It s full, 
                    see?  Full to the top with stick to 
                    the roof of your mouth, god, it 
                    makes you want a glass of milk so 
                    bad, extra smooth...

      Lifting his fingers out, popping them in his mouth.  Ecstasy.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     53.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Best sodding peanut butter I ve 
                    ever tasted.  Want some?

      She s looking at him like he s crazy (so are we.)  Doesn t 
      want to play along.  But the sheer brilliance of Charlie s 
      ploy can t be denied.  Claire dips her fingers in.  Takes a 
      taste.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Good, isn t it?

      Claire considers.  Then, despite her reluctance, just plain 
      CHARMED with Charlie s gesture, plays along --

                                  CLAIRE
                    No.  It s great.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (re: Astrology book)
                    So... you ll be wanting this with 
                    you?  In the caves?

      Claire NODS.  Ready to leave the beach.  OFF that, we go to:


      Kate sits alone - her mind still spinning from the events of 
      the day - when a shadow falls upon her.  She turns to see -

    - SAYID, walking over, head downcast, a bag slung over his 
      shoulder, loaded with supplies.

                                  KATE
                    Sayid?

      Sayid looks at Kate for a moment, then:

                                  SAYID
                    I can t be here.

                                  KATE
                    What do you -- ?

                                  SAYID
                    I m going off.*

                                  KATE*
                    ...What?*





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     54.
      (CONT'D):3838


                                  SAYID*
                    I m leavin.  I don t know for how *
                    long.*

                                  KATE*
                    Sayid, you can t -- we don t know *
                    what s out--*

                                  SAYID*
                          (turns, strong)*
                    -- What, it s too dangerous?*
                          (beat)*
                    No more than staying here.
                          (then)
                    I have worse things to fear than 
                    what s in the jungle.
                          (off her look)
                    What I did today - what I almost 
                    did... I swore never again.  Never 
                    again.
                          (almost to himself)
                    If I can t keep that promise, I 
                    have no right to be here.

                                  KATE
                    But there s nowhere to go.

                                  SAYID
                    Someone has to walk the shore.  Map 
                    the island.  See what else there 
                    is.  Find a means of escape.
                          (beat)
                    I can t think of a better person to 
                    do it then the only one I trust.

      Kate looks at Sayid - she knows better than to try to talk 
      him out of it, so she merely nods -

    - and Sayid returns the nod.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I hope we meed again.  Under...  *
                    happier circumstances.

      And with that he s gone.  Kate turns back to the beach, takes 
    a deep breath, and that s how long it takes for her to 
      realize that a tear is dragging down her cheek.

      Off the moment, as Sayid moves farther and farther away down 
      the beach...

      MUSIC COMES UP --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     55.

      LOST MONTAGE

      QUICK POPS AS MUSIC PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING IMAGES --


      SAWYER sits on the beach, off in the distance, ALONE.  Holds 
      up his LIGHTER to the letter -- But he can t bring himself to 
      burn it.  Can t let it go.  So he folds it up and places it 
      back in his pocket...

      And we END the MONTAGE as --


      Sayid looks back over his shoulder, far, FAR down the beach, 
      the skeleton of the fuselage almost lost in the distance.  
      And as he keeps going...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:
