          Johnny is driving, Sarah in the passenger seat and JJ in
          the back, playing Gameboy.  The kid does not look happy.

                                        SARAH
                        This was not a good time for my
                        car to die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It must be nice to have your dad
                        move back to Cleaves Mills.

                                        SARAH
                          "Nice"--that's one way to describe
                        it.

          Sarah checks her watch.  Johnny notices.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wasn't happy about leaving
                          Florida?

                                        SARAH
                        He didn't have any choice.  With
                        Mom gone and him suffering his
                        second stroke, the doctors said
                        it wasn't a good idea for him to
                        live on his own.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about your place?

                                        SARAH
                        He wouldn't even discuss it.

          She checks her watch again.

          She catches Johnny watching her.

                        I told him I'd be there at ten. 
                        I don't want to be late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's funny, when we were going
                        out, you were always late.

                                        SARAH
                        I was not.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, you were.  I missed the first
                        twenty minutes of every movie we
                        saw.  How did ET get to Earth?  I
                        don't know.  Why did the Empire
                        need to strike back?  Beats me.

                        Way to go, Mom.

                                        SARAH
                        Now you're ganging up on me.
                                (seeing the turn off)

          perfect house with a manicured lawn and wide front porch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This looks fantastic.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you think, JJ?

          Sarah gathers herself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You okay?

                                        SARAH
                                (covering)
                        I'm fine.  Let's go.

          She gets out, Johnny and JJ follow...



          They ENTER into the large foyer with a large floral
            arrangement--TALL STALKS OF FOXGLOVE--in the center. 
          Several elderly residents walk past in conversation. 
          Johnny notices a look on JJ's face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong?

                                        JJ
                        It smells in here.

                                        SARAH
                        Smells like what?

                                        JJ
                        Old people.

          Johnny stifles a laugh, then gets a stern look from Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He said it.

          Johnny spots a UNI-SEX RESTROOM (they have these in
            converted houses, unlike what you might find in a
          commercial hospital).

                                        JOHNNY
                        You guys go on, I'm going to visit
                        the little old persons' room.

          JJ laughs.  Sarah isn't amused.  Johnny points at JJ as
          he moves away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's him, not me.



          Johnny's at the sink, washing his hands.  He goes to touch
          the soap dispenser and--WHOOSH.          DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - TEASER - 4/27/05 - PINK     4.



          As Johnny opens the door to head out, there's a Little
          Old Lady standing there with her back to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me--

          She TURNS as Johnny finds himself looking straight into
          the face of the very same Woman he just saw in his vision --
          dead as a doornail.

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        I'll never get used to these co-
                        ed water closets.

          She enters the bathroom, closing the door behind her. 
          OFF Johnny's look,

          Johnny hesitates as he sees Sarah talking to a younger
          looking woman.  MARY JANE STAMPWELL, she wears gardening
          gloves and hat, she carries a basketful of freshcut
            FOXGLOVE.  She's friendly but there's something odd about

                        them.

          It's kind of creepy, the way she sniffs at the flowers,
          caresses them as she arranges them in a vase.

          JJ laughs.  But Mary Jane just stares at him.

                        The house is restricted to senior
                          citizens only.

          Johnny looks at Sarah, then...

                        No, I realize that, I was just...

                        To be perfectly frank, I don't
                        believe a younger man would fit
                        in here.

          Now it's Sarah that stifles the laugh, as Johnny gives
          up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, you're probably right. 
                        I don't know what I was thinking.

          Awkward BEAT, then....

                                        MARY JANE
                        Well, I should check on lunch. 
                        It was nice meeting you.

                        it must be nice to have him close?

          Sarah nods and forces a smile, as the OLD MAN clears his
            throat...

                        You have to shout at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (louder)
                        I said it looks like you're walking
                        really well!

                                        BRUCE
                        It's something the patients made
                        up.  Some 'thing' that walks the
                        halls at night snatchin' up
                          peoples' souls.

                                        JJ
                                (suddenly interested)
                        That sounds cool.

                                        SARAH
                        It sounds terrible.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, we better finish our walk.

                                        MR. COLBERT
                        Huh?

                                        BRUCE
                        LET'S GO!

          Bruce shrugs and walks away helping the old man.  Mr.
          Colbert stops and looks back at them.

                                        MR. COLBERT
                                (in a serious tone)

                        us all.

          The old man shuffles away up the corridor.

  1212THEY ROUND THE CORNER,

          as Sarah STOPS and SEES...

          MARTY

          Sarah's dad, 75, a gruff looking man with white hair and
          a slightly frail body.  At the moment, he's getting a
          lesson in how to play the DRUMS from SPYDER, early 20s, a
          heavily tattooed rocker type in scrubs who works at the
          home.  Marty, his back to Sarah and Johnny, is banging
          the drum sticks on the table top.  He's enjoying himself.

                                        SPYDER
                        That's pretty good.

                                        MARTY
                        I used to play a little when I
                        was young.  Always dreamed I was
                        the next Gene Krupa.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey, Dad!

          He suddenly stops drumming, his expression shifting
            slightly.

                                        MARTY
                        That's enough for today.

          It's an awkward moment.  When it's obvious Marty isn't
          going to make introductions, Sarah sticks her hand out to
          Spyder.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm Sarah, the daughter.

                                        SPYDER
                        Spyder.  The orderly.

          As Sarah shakes his hand, Johnny looks at the tattooed
          snake crawling ominously up Spyder's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Drummer, huh?

                                        SPYDER
                        Yeah.

                                        JJ
                        You got a band?

                                        SPYDER
                        Yeah.  Mostly we play in my garage. 
                        We're trying to get enough cash
                        to cut a demo tape.  Studio time
                        costs big money.

          Another awkward lull, then...

                                        SPYDER
                        Well, I guess I better go see if
                        anybody fell down.

          He walks away.  Johnny steps forward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Bracknell.  Remember me?

          Marty glances up at Johnny.

                                        MARTY
                        I'm old, not stupid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No sir, I didn't mean...

                                        MARTY
                          I certainly remember my daughter's
                          husband.

                                        JJ
                          Husband?  Johnny's not...

          Sarah stops him with a touch.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt is my husband, Daddy.  Johnny
                        was my boyfriend back when Mom
                        was...

          She stops herself, as Marty cuts her a look.  He looks at
          Johnny again, then...

                                        MARTY
                        You used to climb our oak tree.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smiles)
                        That's right.

          It seems like everything might settle down, then...

                                        MARTY
                        You kids ruined my back yard. 
                        Tore up the bushes and ruined the
                        grass.

          So much for happy memories.  Sarah tries to switch gears...

                                        SARAH
                          I brought JJ.  Say hi to your
                          grandfather.

          JJ freezes, as Johnny finally gives him a little push

          from behind. 

                                        MARTY
                        What's the matter?  Cat got your
                        tongue?

                                        JJ
                                (matter of fact)
                        Are you going to die soon?

          Sarah is mortified.  Johnny looks away...

                                        SARAH
                        JJ!  Daddy, I'm sorry...

                                        MARTY
                        Don't get your curlers in a bunch. 
                        About time someone mentioned the

                        You ever hear about the Korean
                        War?

          JJ shakes his head no.

                                        MARTY
                        May 25th, 1952.  Raid on Agok. 
                        We were surrounded.  Our ammunition
                        was running out, when...

          Marty suddenly stops and looks over at Johnny and Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        We're gonna take a little walk. 
                        You two take your time.

          Sarah hesitates, then walks away.  Johnny looks at Marty,
          all he sees is a stone wall, then he follows Sarah out.

                                        MARTY
                        Where was I?

                        1952.  Surrounded.  No ammunition.



          Johnny is talking to Walt in his office.  Walt is busy
          with some paperwork.

                                        WALT
                        You're sure the old lady was dead?

                        I'm sure.

                                        WALT
                        No sign of violence?  Or a

                        She was just sitting there...
                        dead.

                                        WALT
                        Let's face it, John, everybody
                        who goes to live at one of those
                        retirement places, ends up dying
                        there.  It's the ultimate one-way

                        You can't always tell.  I knew a

                        That's a heartwarming story.

            Something else is troubling Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Has Sarah talked to you about her
                        father?  Why they don't get along?

                                        WALT
                        She's always kept that part of
                        her life private.  I get the
                        feeling she and her dad were never
                        close.  Her mom was the buffer,
                        and when she died the relationship
                        just got worse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's strange, because when we
                        were kids, Sarah and her dad were
                        very close.  I remember wishing
                        my father and I could be more
                        like them.

                        When her mom died, Sarah and I
                        had broken up for a few months. 
                        She was 'finding' herself.

                        that.



          Marty is playing cards with some other RESIDENTS, including
          Bebe.  Johnny and Sarah stand in the doorway.  Johnny
          holds a picnic basket.

                                        BEBE
                        Don't you look pretty as a picture?

                                        SARAH
                        Thank you.
                                (beat)
                        Dad, I made a picnic lunch.  I
                        thought we could eat out on the
                        lawn.  It's such a nice day.

                                        BEBE
                        That sounds lovely.  Go have lunch
                        with your daughter, Marty.

          Marty doesn't look up from his cards.

                                        MARTY
                        I'm down a dollar and a half.

          Sarah is crestfallen, as Bebe notices her reaction.

                                        BEBE
                        Don't be silly.  It's only nickels
                        and dimes.

                                        MARTY
                                (flares)
                        Easy for you to say.  The pension
                        Joe left you could choke a horse.

          Even Bebe is taken aback by his attitude.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If it's money, I can lend you...

                                        MARTY
                                  (irritated)
                        I don't want your money.  I just
                        want to be left alone.  Why is
                        that so hard for everyone to
                          understand?

          He gets up and walks away.

                                        BEBE
                        I'm sure he didn't...

          Sarah turns and rushes away in the other direction.

                                        BEBE
                        Sarah?

          Johnny considers Bebe, then goes after Sarah.



          Johnny looks for Sarah, when he runs into Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Just the man I've been looking
                        for.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you seen Sarah?

                                        BRUCE
                        No.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny starts away, as Bruce grabs him by the arm.

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa, hold on!  You can't leave
                        yet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                        BRUCE
                        It's Live Entertainment Tuesday,
                        and the Great Boudini's van broke
                        down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Great Boudini?

                                        BRUCE
                        I pick up a few bucks booking
                        talent for the residents.  Every
                        Tuesday there's a live performance. 
                        Today it was going to be a
                          magician. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's this got to do with me?

          Off the moment, we...

                                                                                CUT TO:



          All the residents, including Marty, Bebe and Mr. Colbert
          are gathered on chairs in front of the makeshift stage. 
          Mary Jane stands at the back.

                                        BRUCE
                                (holding a microphone)
                          Jonathan the Mysterious will now
                        choose an object from the box and
                        astound you with his supernatural
                        powers.

          Johnny shoots Bruce a glare, then sticks his hand in a
          box and pulls out a small silver locket.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's now searching the darkest
                        corners of his mind. 

          Johnny puts his hand over the mic and leans in close.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        If you don't stop that, Jonathan
                        the Mysterious is leaving.

          Johnny hesitates, but Bruce can't help himself.

                          Jonathan the Mysterious needs
                          complete silence.
                                (beat, Johnny starts
                                to speak)
                        Total stillness.

                          Absolute quiet.

          Johnny rolls his eyes, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is there a Mrs. Pforzheimer? 
                        Iris Pforzheimer?

                                        MRS. PFORZHEIMER
                        Yes!  That's me!

          Johnny concentrates, then...

                        This locket was given to you by
                        your mother on your fourteenth
                          birthday.

          An elderly woman gasps...

                                        MRS. PFORZHEIMER
                        That's right!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (without looking)
                        There's an inscription on the

                        Thank you!  Thank you!

          Even Bruce is impressed by the moment, as Johnny reaches
          into the box again.  He pulls out a captain's sailing
          cap, then looks around and steps up to a large man, MR.
          JOHNSON.

                        I am.

                        It burned.  A mysterious fire
                        while it was docked.

          Mr. Johnson is clearly uncomfortable with the direction
          this is heading.

                                        MR. JOHNSON

          He quickly exits the room.  Johnny shoots Bruce a look
          like "Anymore pal?".

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, it looks like that's all

                        What about the Shadow Man?

          Johnny turns as the residents begin to get anxious.

          They start to crowd Johnny, ad libbing "Tell us."  Mary

          Everyone applauds, as Johnny turns and finds Bebe standing
          in front of him.  She's holding a gold bracelet.

                        I was wondering if you might touch

          Before he can react, she puts the bracelet in his hand,

                        bed.

          FADE IN:



          Johnny and Sarah rush up as Bebe's body, covered by a
          sheet, is being wheeled out of her room on a gurney. 
          Mary Jane speaks with DR. MARTIN.

                        Oh, Sarah, I'm glad you came. 
                        Your father is very upset.  He's
                        in his room.

          Sarah turns to Johnny.

          She hurries away, as Johnny hesitates, then steps up to

                        Doctor, I recently met Mrs.
                          Anderson.  I was wondering if you
                        could tell me how she died?

                        Well, I can't be sure until we do
                        an autopsy.  If you want my
                          professional opinion, it was sudden
                        cardiac arrest.  She passed in
                        her sleep.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          As Johnny takes this in he turns to see Mr. Colbert
          standing across the hallway.

                                        MR. COLBERT
                        It was the Shadow Man.  He took
                        her just like he's gonna take the
                        rest of us.

          There's something dark and disturbingly obvious about his
          tone.

            Post-service, black-garbed MOURNERS stand in little groups,
            including Marty, Mr. Colbert, Johnny, Sarah, Bruce.  A
          closed distinctive PINK COFFIN sits at the front of the
          room, a PHOTO of Bebe next to it.

                          Something doesn't add up. 

          Bruce notices that Mary Jane is deep in conversation with
          a man in a dark suit, MR. WARREN.

          CROSSING SHOT

          Spyder crosses as Sarah passes him to where Marty is
          sitting alone, his cap in his hands.

          He turns to see Sarah, his momentary lapse of memory
          corrected.

                                        SARAH
                        Daddy, are you okay?

                        I want to go back to my room.

                                        SARAH
                        I was thinking, before we go,
                        maybe we could visit Mom.

          Marty considers the graveyard, then...

                                        MARTY
                        She's not here.

          Puts his cap back on.

                                (firm)
                        There's nothing more to talk about.

          Sarah has had it.

                                        SARAH
                        Fine.

          She turns and walks past Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

          She just keeps walking.  Marty turns to look as he and
          Johnny connect for a moment, eye-to-eye.  For a instant,
          there's a look of humanity and compassion in the old man's
          eyes.  Something he won't or can't offer his daughter.



          Mary Jane comes out of Bebe's room.  Johnny is here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is Marty in there?

                                        MARY JANE
                        He's just sitting on her bed
                        staring at the wall.  It's
                          difficult on the residents when
                        one of them passes.  It reminds
                        them of their own mortality.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd like to talk to him.



          Johnny steps into the room.  Marty sits on the edge of
          the bed, his back slightly to the door.

                        I think coming back here has

                          somebody who cares a great deal
                        about you.  You're just too full

                        You might be able to see things

          Johnny and Bruce walk into the room.

                        And they both had numbers written

          Several PHOTOS of past residents.

          One particular picture catches Johnny's attention.  It's
          the African-American man from his previous vision.

          Johnny notices some of Bebe's personal items in a box. 
          He picks up several items and then a small framed photo
          of a much younger MARTY, HIS WIFE, BEBE AND HER HUSBAND.

          Sarah, home-cooked goodies in tow, looks in to see Marty,
          sitting alone, staring out the window, lost in his own
            thoughts.

          Wanting to help him, not knowing how, she looks at her
          father, fighting back tears.

                        I can't do this... not now.

          He heads out of the room.  Hold on Sarah for a beat, gut-
          punched, mind racing.  She sits down on the edge of the
          bed.  BEAT.  Then we see Johnny pass the door, then
          reappear and enter the room.

          Sarah, hair pink, Doc Martens, punked-out like Johnny
            described her in this era, rushing out as her roommate,
          STACY, babydoll dress, calls to her.

                          supposed to go shopping.  She
                        hates it when I'm late.

                        As if.



          Johnny flashes out of the vision,

                                        SARAH
                        I need some air.

          Sarah exits, as Johnny's about to leave when he notices
          the scarf on the floor and reaches for it, WHOOSH



          VISION JOHNNY is standing in Sarah's mom's kitchen.  He
          looks out the window, sees SARAH'S MOM standing out front,
          dressed up, wearing the SCARF he's getting the vision off
          of.  Checks her watch, looks up and down the street--
            obviously waiting on Sarah, who's late. 

          VISION JOHNNY watches her a beat, happy to see her again...
          it's been a long time, and he was always fond of her.

          The phone rings.  Sarah's mom hears it, is coming back
          into the house.  But the machine has already picked up.

                        at the library--study, study,
                        study.  Know I'm late--but I'm on
                        my way.  See you soon... Oh, I
                        love you!  

          Sarah's mom SMILES to herself, then reaches for a framed
          photo of Sarah.

                                        SARAH'S MOM
                        I love you, too, Sarah.

          She gently touches her finger tips to Sarah's mouth and
          sets the picture down.  She walks out of the room.  Johnny
          holds a beat, thinking about how he wants grownup Sarah
          to let herself off the hook, then he's startled by the
          sound of an O.C. THUD!

          As JOHNNY quickly rushes back towards the kitchen

          IN THE DOORWAY

          Sarah's mom's legs are seen splayed out lifelessly, her
          unseen body laying dead on the kitchen floor.  



          Johnny comes out of the vision and gently drapes it over
          a framed wedding PHOTO of her and Marty.



                                        MARTY

          Sarah and Johnny are confronting Marty.

                        You're not listening to me. 
                        There's a very real chance if you

          and Johnny exchange a freaked-out look, move slowly towards
          it, where they notice a door marked "COLD STORAGE".

          Johnny pulls open the door to find Bebe's distinctive

                                (setting down the box)
                        May I present Mrs. Bebe Anderson.

          Johnny reaches out and picks up the box -- WHOOSH



          Out of vision, Johnny seems a little thrown as he looks
          at Bruce and Mr. Warren.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.
                                (to Bruce)
                        Let's go.

                        What did you see?

          Johnny grabs him by the sleeve...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Later.

          He drags Bruce out of the room.



          Bruce and Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        I still don't get it.  Why would
                        someone replace Bebe's ashes with
                          a dog's?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good question.  This is the only
                        place between here and Bangor
                        that has an animal crematorium.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's the connection between
                          Foxglove, the funeral home, and
                        the animal shelter?

          Johnny suddenly spots something in the distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think he just walked out the
                        back door.

          Bruce looks off, as...

          CAMERA REVEALS - THEIR POV SPYDER

          Coming out of the shelter.

                                        BRUCE
                        Spyder?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Apparently, it takes three minimum-
                        wage jobs to make a living in
                        this town.

          They watch as ANOTHER STEP VAN drives into the darkened
          lot and parks end-to-end with Spyder's van.  A YOUNG MAN
          gets out and greets Spyder with a hand shake. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Who the hell is that guy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Beats me.

          They watch as some paperwork and cash exchanges hands,
          and then each man opens the back of their respective vans
          and what appears to be a COVERED BODY is slid out of
          Spyder's van into the back of the step van.  Another
            handshake and each man climbs back in his truck and drives
          away.

                                        BRUCE
                        That wasn't what I think it was...
                        was it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  Follow him.

                        The other guy.

          As the step van drives off, Bruce discreetly tails him,

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny is just ahead of Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        We've been walking for ten minutes
                        and it's nothing but trees and
                        bushes.

                                        JOHNNY
                          A little further.

                                        BRUCE
                                (sniffs)
                        What is that smell?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That can't be good.

          Bruce takes several steps forward and stumbles over
            something and hits the ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You alright?

                                        BRUCE
                          I ripped my pants.  What the hell
                        did I trip over?

          When Bruce shines his flashlight around behind him, they
          both see what he tripped over:

          IN THE LIGHT

          A FOOT attached to a hairy leg sticking out from behind a
          tree, THE NUMBER 839 written across the ankle.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:



          Marty and JJ.

                                        MARTY
                        Your mother said that?

                                        JJ
                        Kinda.

          Marty considers things.  He knows there's no monster, but*
          things just aren't right.  Starting with Bebe's sudden*
          death, the behavior of the other residents and his*
          grandson's obvious fear and apprehension.*

                                        MARTY
                        I might be crazy, but I know when
                        somebody's yankin' my chain. 
                        There's no such thing as a demon
                        that snatches peoples' souls. 
                        Not in this world anyway.  Maybe
                        we should...

            Suddenly, they hear FOOTSTEPS in the hall outside, then
          an ominous SHADOW passes under the door and STOPS.*

          JJ steps quickly behind his grandpa as they both watch as*
          someone or something jiggles the door handle, then MOVES*
          ON.  Marty looks back at JJ who's frozen with fear.*

                                        MARTY
                        That's about enough of this*
                          nonsense. *
                                (to JJ)*
                        You stay here.*

          Marty crosses to the door and quietly OPENS it.  He looks*
          back at the kid.*

                                  (whispers)*
                        Lock this door behind me.  And*
                        don't open it to anyone but me--
                          understand?

          JJ nods.  Marty's about to go, when he has another thought. 
          He looks around, then reaches up and grabs an iron bookend*
          off a shelf.  He checks its weight to use as a weapon,*
          then he steps over to JJ and hands it to the kid.*

                                        MARTY
                        Just in case I'm wrong.

          Marty pats him on the top of the head and EXITS the room. 
          JJ quickly locks the door behind him and considers the
          bookend in his hand (he should mimic whatever we just saw*
          Marty do with it) -- hoping to God that he won't need to*
          use it.



          Marty heads off on the trail of the receding footsteps,
          just catching a glimpse of a DARK FIGURE disappearing
          around the corner...

                                        MARTY
                                (to himself)
                        What the hell...?

          He picks up the pace as he FOLLOWS around the corner...*



          Marty comes around a corner and sees a light on beyond a
          door marked "TRASH ROOM."

          He peers around the doorjamb and sees Mary Jane slip off*
          a dark, hooded robe, bundle it and shove it into the back*
          of an upper shelf.*

          Marty steps out to confront her.

                                        MARTY
                        It's you.*

          Mary Jane jumps...

                                        MARY JANE*
                        My Lord, Marty, you nearly scared*
                        me to death.*

          He suddenly stops, puts a hand to his chest.  Short of*

          Marty slumps against the wall.  Mary Jane rushes to him.

          Mary Jane leads an ORDERLY down to the place where she

          Johnny and Bruce are locked in a creepy, empty, windowless

          Walt notices Johnny across the room.

          As Sarah tries to open the door, Mary Jane comes up.

                        had to find a way to keep them in
                        bed.  I didn't mean any harm.

                                        SARAH
                        You made them believe there was
                          something trying to steal their
                        souls?

                                        MARY JANE
                        No, I would never... That was
                          something they created themselves. 
                        I was just trying to help...

          As she breaks down, an ORDERLY rushes up.

                        They saw someone outside.

                                        SARAH
                        You better hope nothing happened
                        to my father.

          Sarah hurries off with the Orderly, followed closely by
          Mary Jane.  A BEAT, then a CLICK of the lock as JJ OPENS
          the door.  He cautiously leans out to make sure the coast
          is clear, then HAULS BUTT up the darkened corridor,
          dropping the heavy bookend to the floor as he RUNS...
