      We SMASH into a high-octane POLICE PURSUIT, a dozen LAPD 
      SQUAD CARS and DETECTIVE VEHICLES flying down Washington and 
      surrounding streets.

                                  POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.)
                    All units.  Vehicle proceeding 
                    westbound toward boardwalk.  
                    Suspect is armed and dangerous.

      We WHIP PAN 100 yards ahead, landing on

      THE PERPETRATOR

      a menacing badass driving a windshield-bashed sedan.  He 
      FISHTAILS into a BEACH PARKING LOT, pummeling the hapless 
      ATTENDANT, who is sent flying into the side of the vestibule.

      The Perp SKIDS to a stop and exits his car, GUN in hand.  To 
      the horror of nearby BEACHGOERS, he turns and starts FIRING 
      at the fast-approaching police units.  BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.  
      One unit swerves out of control, CRASHING into a lightpost.

      In response, numerous UNIFORMS and DETECTIVES fly out of 
      vehicles, guns at the ready.  One detective,  HANDSOME  BILLY 
      SANDS, boldly starts running toward the perp, who turns and 
      SPRINTS to the nearby BOARDWALK, teeming with TOURISTS.

      We STAY WITH BILLY, who lands in the MOB of people and pushes 
      his way through, his eyes DARTING in search of the perp.  On 
      the move, concentrating intently, he answers his RINGING CELL.

                                  BILLY
                    Yeah?

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    I got eyes on him.

                                  BILLY
                          (mystified)
                    What re you talking about?  I m  
                    the one who just ran like a gazelle 
                    after the guy.


      The Perp passes a SIDE-ALLEY, oblivious to the beater VOLVO 
      pulling to a stop.  Out slips a power-walking MOM in old 
      sweats and a blouse, oversized PURSE on her shoulder, bed 
      head, but despite herself still a MILF.  It s of course the 
      woman behind the voice we ve heard, our unassuming heroine...

      DETECTIVE LAURA DIAMOND.

      She falls in line BEHIND THE PERP, keeping pace.  When an 
      approaching family passes and bystanders are at a momentary 
      minimum, she seizes the moment and DRAWS HER GUN, shouting--

                                  LAURA
                    LAPD!  On the ground!

      People RUN FOR COVER as the startled PERP TURNS.  He gets one 
      look at the house frau and practically rolls his eyes as he 
      GRABS a dreadlocked RASTA MAN and puts a GUN TO HIS HEAD.  

                                  VENICE BEACH PERP

                    Excuse me.  It s Detective.  And I 
                    really think you should put the gun 
                    down.  I'm a little Type A and--

                      --practice all the time with this 
                    thing. 

      We see the Boardwalk has cleared, people hovering in 
      storefronts watching the unlikely stand-off.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/133.


                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Now I'm going to count to three...

                                  VENICE BEACH PERP
                          (laughs, derisive)
                    Is that right.

                                  LAURA
                      One.....Two....

      Suddenly outraged, the Perp JAMS HIS GUN into the side of his 
      panicked hostage s head, screaming--

                                  VENICE BEACH PERP
                    BLOW ME, BITCH!

      Wild-eyed, he cocks the gun, ABOUT TO FIRE!  Laura sighs.

                                  LAURA
                    Three.

      BAMMM.  She shoots the perp's EAR OFF, SPLATTERING BLOOD and 
      SKIN across Rasta Man s face.  The PERP drops, SCREAMING.

      Laura promptly GRABS THE PERP S GUN, CUFFS him, then digs 
      into her purse, pulls out a pack of BABY WIPES, and cleans 
      off hyperventilating Rasta Man's face, venting to him--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    They never believe me.

      Rasta Man glances down at the bloody mess of a perp below.

                          (gentle, motherly)
                    Look away.

      Finally other COPS DESCEND ON THE SCENE, an incredulous Billy 
      leading the way.  Laura is casually matter-of-fact.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Got him.


      Entering the sprawling, sunlit BULLPEN, Laura gets a hero's 
      welcome --  high-fives and backslaps -- from her fellow cops.

                    There you go.

      She makes her way to her mess of a CUBICLE, as cluttered as 
      her car.  Still fielding compliments, she tosses down her 
      purse and searches through a pile of junk, finally uncovering 
      half a BURRITO.  She takes a bite, as--

      An incensed Laura drags the adorable, filthy boys out of the

                    you are.  I d completely forgotten.

      He smiles and sneaks in a KISS, which after all these years 
      still gives Laura a pang of excitement, try as she might to 
      ignore it.  Then he bolts for the door, shouts to the boys--

                    Later, gators!      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1310.


      And he s gone.  We hang on Laura for a beat.  Now what?  She 
      bee-lines for the 

      KITCHEN

      and dials a number on the PHONE.  Ring.  Ring.

                                  SAMMI (O.S.)
                    Hey!

                                  LAURA
                    I m screwed.  Can you babysit?

      Laura is looking out the WINDOW at the unit ACROSS THE 
      COURTYARD, where SAMMI -- 25ish, super cute actress-singer-
        waiter-tarot card reader -- now appears IN HER OWN KITCHEN.  
      The women see each other through their windows, as--

                                  SAMMI
                    Depends.  Any objection to the pups 
                    and I rocking Real Housewives?

                                  LAURA
                    Wouldn t have it any other way.

                                  SAMMI
                    In.

                                  LAURA
                    God bless you.


      A stunning, sprawling gated mansion.  Laura and Captain 
      Hauser each exit their cars, Laura futzing with her CELL.

                                  LAURA
                    No bars?  Really?  What if my 
                    sitter needs to reach me?

      A servile Latina housekeeper, MARGARITA, 25, leads Laura and 
      the Captain down a sleek hallway lined with art -- Laura has 
      to dodge the protruding arm of a statue -- then into 

      THE DINING ROOM

      A small DINNER PARTY is in progress.  Just five people.  An 
      uber-skinny fashionista, DEEDEE WALDEN, 35ish, and her 
      preoccupied husband ERIC WALDEN, 45ish, techie-chic, stand.  
      AD LIBBED introductions are made, then Deedee regards Laura.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                      A middle-aged female detective.  
                    Just like on SVU.  I love that.

                                  LAURA
                          (smiles, faux-gracious)
                    How awkward of you to say.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                    Thank you both for coming.  I feel 
                    a bit silly causing all the 
                      commotion, but Deedee insisted we 
                    take this seriously.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    What s not serious about a death 
                    threat?  I m afraid for us to be in 
                    the house alone.  We ve entertained 
                    every night for a week.  My chef s 
                    at his wit s end.

                CAPTAIN HAUSERLAURA
      I m sure he is.That is a tale of woe.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (indicates)
                    This is Richard Levine, my 
                    attorney. ... Our dear friend, 
                    Lisa.  .... And my brother, Ned.

      More AD LIBBED greetings between the cops, douchey-slick 
      RICHARD, 40ish, another skinny-fashionista, LISA, 35ish, and 
      sad-sack NED, 50ish.  Deedee addresses the new arrivals--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    Can I offer you a glass of wine or 
                    a piece of chocolate cheesecake?

                                  LAURA
                          (immediately)
                    Yes and yes.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1312.


      She takes an open seat, explaining to no one in particular--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Left my Hot Pocket at home in the 
                      microwave.

      98-pound Lisa pushes her untouched cake wedge over to Laura.

                                  LISA
                    Take mine.  I m watching my gluten.

                                  LAURA
                    And it shows.

      She unabashedly digs into the cake, Walden placing a glass of 
      wine in front of her.  He then turns to the Captain.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (indicates bottle)
                    Captain?

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (hands up in protest)
                      I shouldn t.

                                  LAURA
                          (takes a gulp of hers)
                      I shouldn t either.

      CRASH.  The groups turns to see Eric has DROPPED the wine 
      bottle, now in pieces on the stone floor, wine everywhere.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    My floor!  Damn it, Eric!

      Her husband looks suddenly tense, overwhelmed.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                        Sorry....Just...thinking about 
                    work, I suppose.

                                    RICHARD
                    You look like hell.  Go to bed.

      Eric nods agreement.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    We ll check your room.

      He eyes Laura, who s now powering down the rest of her cake.

      Deedee tosses a napkin over the wine disaster, calls out--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                      Margarita!


      Laura and the Captain return to an oddly morose Walden.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                      Everything seems secure.

                                  LAURA
                    If you don t mind my asking, Mister 
                    Walden, any reason somebody would 
                    want you dead?

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (beat, oddly distant)
                    I m no saint.  Even the best of us 
                    can make terrible mistakes.  

      Laura didn t expect such a raw outpouring from the guy.  

                                  LAURA
                    You wanna elaborate on that?

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                      I just....I d give anything to have 
                    my life back the way it was.  
                    Anything.

                                  LAURA
                    Sir, ten minutes ago you were 
                      apologizing for wasting our time.  
                    What s going on?

      He waves her away, slumps into a love seat.  Weird.  The cops 
      exchange curious glances.  Hauser turns back to Walden--      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1314.


                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    We ll let you get some rest.  I m 
                    putting two officers right outside 
                    the door.  You need anything 
                    further, call anytime.  I ll give 
                    you my card. 

      He does and the cops AD LIB their goodnights, exchanging 
      another look on the way out.  Odd duck.


      Laura and the Captain meander back to their cars.

                                  LAURA
                    Turns out you can be a captain of 
                    industry and a drama queen.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                      Multi-talented.  Thanks for tagging 
                    along.  Jake watching the boys?

                                  LAURA
                          (gimme a break)
                    What do you think?

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    That he pulled rank and isn t even 
                    paying for the sitter.

                                  LAURA
                    Oh he ll pay.  I stole his ATM card 
                    last week.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    You certainly seem over the guy.  
                    And yet I still see a wedding ring 
                    on your finger.

                                  LAURA
                            (dismissive)
                    Haven t gotten around to taking it 
                    off.  I really should hock it for 
                    something useful.  Probably could 
                    trade for a pretty snazzy vibrator.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (smiles, but it fades as)
                    No pressure from me.  Haven t taken 
                    mine off either...Probably never will.

                                  LAURA

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    For a guy who buried his wife a 
                    month ago, I m doing okay.... 
                    Therapist says I should stop driving 
                    by the bend where her car went over, 
                    but for me that is therapy.

                          (nods, beat)
                    The universe can be a real 
                      sonofabitch.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                            (dismissive)
                    Universe had nothing to do with it.
                          (chuckles, softening)
                    Sorry, cynical widower alert.

                                  LAURA
                    You re entitled.

                    Captain!

      Startled, they turn to see a UNIFORM OFFICER waving them back.


      The detectives RUSH THROUGH THE HOUSE with the frazzled cop.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER
                    We were right outside the bedroom 
                    door, didn t move an inch since you 
                    walked out.  All of a sudden we hear 
                    yelling, a struggle.  We try the 
                    door -- it s locked -- we bust in...

      They reach the BEDROOM, bolt in to find a SECOND UNIFORM 
      OFFICER standing in shock next to the loveseat, where ERIC 
      WALDEN is slumped over, blood trickling from his neck, DEAD.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Makes no sense.  How in the hell?

      Deedee rushes in right behind the stunned cops.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                          (falling apart)
                    Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

      OFF the Captain, Laura -- how in the hell, indeed.

      The CORONER S VAN and a half-dozen SQUAD CARS crowd the 
      driveway.  Laura and Billy approach to find douchey-lawyer 
      RICHARD LECTURING a UNIFORM COP guarding the gate.

                                  BILLY

                          (smarmy smile)
                    Actually, there is.  Your 
                      subordinate is telling me I can t 
                    leave, and I m telling him this 
                      technically constitutes false 
                      imprisonment.  I d hate to have to

                    But it may come to that if I can t 
                    get home to prepare for an 
                      international conference call I 
                    have in six hours.  

                                  LAURA
                    That sounds important.  

                                    RICHARD
                    Very.

                                  LAURA
                    Tell you what.  How about you either 
                    go back inside for questioning, or 
                    we ll be happy to swing by your 
                    house, pick up whatever items you 
                    need, and you can prep all night 
                    long in lockup with the gangbangers 
                    and the meth heads.  It s very safe.  
                    We provide condoms.  

                                  BILLY
                    Actually I think we re out of 
                    condoms.

      Richard stares uneasily at the detectives.  Both just smile 
      pleasantly.  Finally, he turns and heads back to the house.


      Deedee, Richard, Ned, Lisa, Margarita, and CHEF JEAN LUC, 30s 
      -- sit and stand around the luxurious breakfast table, 
      emotional and anxious.  Laura pokes around the room and 
      adjoining PANTRY as the Captain and Billy face the group. 

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Folks, we re terribly sorry for 
                    your loss.  But at the same time, 
                    you re unfortunately all suspects 
                    now in a murder investigation.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    This is outrageous!  We re talking 
                    about my husband!  I loved this 
                    man.  We all did!

                                  LAURA
                          (chimes in from sidelines)
                      Respectfully, ma am, I m gonna go 
                    on a limb and say someone in here 
                    loved him not so much.

      In our next series of RAPID-FIRE JUMP CUTS, we variously see 
      Laura and Billy INTERROGATE THE SUSPECTS:  Jean Luc and 
      Margarita, Lisa, Ned, Richard, until we finally SLAM INTO--

      LAURA AND BILLY questioning a weepy DEEDEE

                                  LAURA
                    Just to clarify my time line, when 
                    we left the dining room, you 
                       supervised  Margarita s clean-up 
                    of the wine, went to take your 
                    Xanax, then sat on the deck with 
                    Richard, where no one else saw you.

      Deedee nods, wipes away a tear.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    One last thing.  Your husband made 
                    a strange comment about not being a 
                    saint, terrible mistakes....Any 
                    idea what he was talking about?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                          (beat, speculating)
                    He was a tough businessman.  People 
                    were angry about him not sharing 
                      technology for the new cell phone 
                    he s launching, but to kill a man?
                          (then)
                    The irony is, this was the best 
                    year of our lives.  Eric and I...we 
                    were happy.  I was a lucky woman.

                                  BILLY
                          (warm, hint of flirtation)
                    I m guessing he was the lucky one.

      Deedee smiles through her tears.  Laura just stares at Billy.


      Laura and Billy walk down the entry HALLWAY.  Laura pokes her 
      head into the GUEST BATHROOM, gives it a once-over, as--

                                  BILLY
                    It s good form to compliment the 
                    widow.  That s Police Work 101.

                    Wait for it.  Here he comes.

      We WIDEN to see Laura, Billy, and the Captain viewing 
      SECURITY FOOTAGE being cued up by the Uniform.  

      ONSCREEN, a teenage SKATE PUNK in a hoodie, FED EX envelope 
      in hand, approaches the gate.  

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Hello.  Oh, look, a police car.

      Sure enough, the Punk seems to spot the squad car in the 
      driveway, at which point he turns and bolts off.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    And b bye.  

                                  LAURA
                    Somehow I don't think that kid 
                    works for Fed Ex.

                    Pull a screen shot.  Maybe we can 
                    get an ID.


      The Captain, Laura, and Billy confer with the other UNIFORMS.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    No smoking gun, we re not making an 
                    arrest tonight.  Send  em all home.

      The Uniforms nod, walk off.  Hauser turns to his detectives.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1320.


                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER (CONT D)
                    Where are we with alibis?

                                  LAURA
                    Lisa the dinner guest was in the 
                     potty  with  digestive issues.   

                                  BILLY
                    I doubt she can lift a syringe, let 
                    alone inject a guy.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    How about the chef or housekeeper?

                                  LAURA
                    Both in the kitchen.  And not giving 
                    off the co-conspirator vibe.  Unlike 
                    Deedee and Richard Le Douche.

                                  BILLY
                    I m getting a vibe off of brother 
                    Ned.  Found him snooping around the 
                    guest house before questioning.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Let s put a tail on all three.
                          (then to Laura)
                    Sorry, kiddo.  Looks like your 
                    drive-by turned into a front page

                    And I m out of oatmeal and Target

                    March 3rd, found in school office 
                    shredding Mrs. Hwang's US 
                      Citizenship papers.

                                  LAURA
                          (chimes in, clarifying)
                    I don't think that was political.  
                    They can't read a word.

      The Principal just stares at her.  A beat.  He turns back to 
      his list, about to continue, when JAKE BURSTS IN the room.

                                  JAKE
                          (smooth, all smiles)
                    Principal Bellinkoff, how are you, 
                    sir?  I like that suit.  Armani?

                                  WESTMONT PRINCIPAL 
                          (immune to the schmooze)
                    I ll cut to the chase.  Enough is 
                    enough.  Your boys are no longer 
                    welcome in the Westmont community.

                                  LAURA
                          (suddenly panicked)
                    I don t need them to be welcome.  I 
                    just need to drop them off at eight 
                    and pick them up at five....Isn t 
                    there some kind of detention hall?

                    They are expelled.  Done.  Gone.

      OFF Laura, Jake--


      Out on the school s FRONT LAWN, the unfazed boys use their 
      unfazed dad as a HUMAN JUNGLE GYM, while a very fazed Laura 
      tries to drive home the gravity of the situation.  

                                  JAKE
                    Whatever.  It s Pre-K.

                                  LAURA
                    Pre-K equals childcare and now we 
                    have none!  We re screwed.

                                  JAKE
                    So we find a new school.

                                  LAURA
                    In the middle of the semester?  We 
                    need a place to put them tomorrow.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1322.


      As the boys splinter off, chasing each other--

                                  JAKE
                    You ll figure it out.  You re very 
                      resourceful.  That s why I love you 
                    so much.  And know why you love me?

                                  LAURA
                    Because you're unhelpful and 
                      completely detached from reality?  

                                  JAKE
                    Because I'm calm under pressure.

                                  LAURA
                    Yeah, that's what I hate about you.  

                                  JAKE
                    And your sense of humor.  Love, 
                    love, love.  I have to run.

                                  LAURA
                          (reeling, riled)
                    Good, run.  If you re not gonna 
                    share in the work or the worry of 
                    this three-alarm fire, I m not sure 
                    what you re even doing here.  You 
                    should just go home, sign the 
                    divorce papers, and get officially 
                    out of my life once and for all!  
                          (calls out)
                    Boys, we have to go!

                                  JAKE
                    What if I don't want to sign the 
                    papers?

      Laura stops in her tracks, thrown by Jake s question.

                                  LAURA
                    It's not in your  nature  to be 
                      monogamous, remember?  Or did your 
                    weekly afternoon delights with 
                    Jenny the acupuncturist cause some 
                    sort of amnesia?

      He moves in close, holds her waist.  She tenses, but can t 
      bring herself to pull away, still warming to his touch. 

                                  JAKE
                    Laura, come on.  The cheating, the 
                    leaving.  We re talking about the 
                    biggest mistakes of my life.  It s 
                    out of my system.

                    It s stuck on my finger, okay?  
                    Probably because of all my stress

                          (then matter-of-fact)
                    I don t have time for this 
                      conversation.  I have to find a pre-

                    Excuse me!

      Annoyed Laura turns to see a WOMAN at the school entrance.

                                  LAURA
                    WHAT?

                    other.

      And, we see, they are.  OFF Laura-- 


      With both boys on her lap (sharing earbuds, watching a show 
      on an iPad), Laura clicks through MUG SHOTS of skate punks, 
      Billy next to her.  Meredith sits nearby.

                                  LAURA
                    Don t see Fed Ex boy.

                                  BILLY
                    Me neither.  I ll have Maxy widen 
                    the search to County.

      Seeing the boys squirming uncomfortably, Billy picks one up--

      C mere, buddy--You don t wanna--

                    That s weird.  Captain and I had no

                    Sounds like Ned found himself a

      Hipster POOL PARTY, jam-packed with barely clad beautiful 
      people, DJ music pumping.  We pull back to LAURA AND BILLY at 
      the RED ROPE, stopped by a fey, fashion-forward BOUNCER.

                                  DAY CLUB BOUNCER
                    Guest list only.

                    Am I on the list now, skinny jeans?

      But Billy, taking note of the curious glances they draw from 
      every passing guest, takes his partner aside.  

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    What?  The tail said Ned s

                    Yeah.  And we can bust our way in 
                    and make a scene....Or we can blend 
                    in and see what he s up to. 

                                  LAURA
                    How exactly do we blend?  


        All-business Laura quickly sorts through the skimpy SWIMWEAR, 
      grabs a bikini and bee-lines for the waify, bored SHOP GIRL.

                    I could pick this up for thirty 
                    bucks at Target.

                    I doubt Target carries Prada.

                    I bet.

      A beat.  Laura hands over her credit card.


      BIKINI-CLAD LAURA finds Billy among the throngs at the pool.    
      He can t help but check out his sexy partner.

                                  BILLY
                    Damn.

                                  LAURA

                                  BILLY
                    Just rolling in my boxers.

      Laura nods -- good call.  They split up.  We FOLLOW LAURA to 
      the deck-top HOT TUB overlooking the party.  She considers, 
      then -- what the hell -- gets in, immediately in ecstasy.

                                  LAURA
                    Oh my god yes.

      Meantime, DOWN BELOW, Handsome Billy makes the rounds, making 
      flirty eye-contact with one sexy babe after another.  

                                  BILLY
                      Hey....How are ya....Solid thong...

      Finally, he SPOTS NED seated with a shifty-looking MAN.  
      Billy takes out his phone to dial, but it starts to RING.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Got eyes on him?

                    Yep.  Wait for it....

      We PUSH IN as Ned discreetly hands off the SMART PHONE to the 
      guy, who in exchange hands over an ENVELOPE, then takes off.  

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Move in.  I ve got Ned.

      They SPLIT UP, Billy pursuing PHONE GUY while Laura -- wet 
      and, well, jiggly in her bikini -- races ACROSS THE GROUNDS--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)

      IN THE LOBBY

      Laura, catching stares in her wet, dripping suit, finally 
      closes in on Ned, GRABBING ONTO HIM.  He startles seeing her.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Hey Ned.  You come here?

                                  NED
                    Lemme go!

      He tries to pull away.  Laura performs a clunky but effective 
      KARATE move and FACEPLANTS him, then notices a TOURIST FAMILY 
      gawking uncomfortably at the dripping bikini babe asskicker.

                    year s worth of mac and cheese, but 
                    not exactly enough to kill a guy.

                          (calls out, overhearing)
                    Of course I didn t kill my brother.  
                    I just sold the phone to pay off a 
                    football bet.

      He pulls out a crumpled piece of PAPER.  Billy inspects it.

                                  BILLY
                    You gave the Jets plus three?  Are 
                    you an idiot?

                    Yeah.  Caught him in the act.

      Laura SIGNALS Billy and he accompanies her back into

      THE HOTEL GIFT SHOP

      Laura casually REACHES IN HER BLOUSE, starts wriggling, as--

                    Bam.  Motive and a cover-up.  Deedee

                    And probably our killer. 

      Her hands reappear holding the DRIPPING WET BIKINI, which she 
      tosses down on the counter in front of incredulous SHOP GIRL.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)

      Margarita leads Laura and Billy out to the POOL, where Deedee 
      and Richard are conferring on lounge chairs.  The cops murmur--

                                  BILLY

                    lives, happy happy...and you found 
                    Eric humping someone in your bed?

      Deedee wasn t expecting that.  A beat.  

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    That incident was completely out of 
                      character.  Eric was a devoted 
                    husband.  I'm not about to sully 
                    his legacy with irrelevant gossip.

      Richard places a gentle hand on Deedee's wrist to calm her 
      down.  Laura takes note of the affectionate touch.

                      from...behind.

      Laura watches Richard grab his LAPTOP with his LEFT HAND, 
      then slide a DOCUMENT into a GREEN SUEDE FILE CASE we see 
      lying on a table in front of DEEDEE.  As Laura observes--

                    I ll walk you out.

      The detectives regard the pair as they WALK OUT OF EARSHOT.

                    It s Deedee s, not his.  We need to 
                    see what s in there.  Guessing it 
                    has less to do with corporate 
                      housekeeping and more to do with her

      MEREDITH CROSSES to her cubicle, spots Laura.

                                  MEREDITH
                    She returns.  Does this mean Max 
                    can pick up lunch already?

                                  LAURA
                      Detective, Max is an investigative 
                    aide, not a personal assistant.  

                                  MAX
                    You want a kindergarten update?

      Meredith smirks, taking note.  Laura downplays.

                      unaccredited ones on Craig s List?

      Max nods, hands over his LIST OF SCHOOLS, cross-out marks 
      through all of them.  OFF Laura, not to be denied--


      Laura pulls up to a cute school building.  With her antsy 
      boys in tow, she heads straight for the STAFF PARKING LOT.  
      Standing in front of a ROW OF CARS, she DIALS MAX on cell.


      Laura stands at the FRONT DESK, her tired boys sitting at her 
      feet.  After a beat, platinum blonde NURSE CULP approaches.

      RICHARD smacks a ball at the DRIVING RANGE.  WHIP PAN out to 

      THE PARKING LOT

      Billy loiters by Richard s CAR, places a call to Laura.  

                                  BILLY
                    He left the girly file case in his 
                    car, which is locked at Riviera.

                                  LAURA
                    Some  appointment.   Don t they 
                    have valet?  Get it unlocked.

                                  BILLY
                    How am I supposed to do that 
                    without a warrant?


      Laura exits her car and bee-lines past Billy, lets down her 
      hair and throws on lipstick.  Instant sexy.  She approaches 
      the VALET, on a dime kicking into damsel-in-distress mode.  

                                  LAURA
                    Excuse me?  I am such a dummy.  I 
                    left a work folder in my 
                      boyfriend's car.  He already thinks 
                    I'm always forgetting things, and 
                    if I have to interrupt his golf 
                    game it'll be humiliating.

      ANGLE ON BILLY, watching from a distance.  He shakes his head 
      in awe as the valet hands Laura the car keys.


      As Billy keeps an eye on Richard hitting balls at the DRIVING 
      RANGE, Laura slips into the car and digs into the FILE CASE, 
      where she finds a LEGAL DOCUMENT.  As she quickly peruses--

                                  BILLY
                    What is it?

                                  LAURA
                    The Walden s unfiled divorce 
                    papers.  And Eric s the Petitioner.  
                    He accuses Deedee of infidelity!

      She SNAPS PHOTOS of the pages, then finds Richard s LAPTOP on 
      the floor and quickly opens it.  Billy sees Richard finish up.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1335.


                                  BILLY
                    Empty bucket.  We gotta bounce.

      Laura clicks on RECENT DOCUMENTS.  A file pops open entitled 
          WALDEN-PRENUP-REVISED.  She snaps more photos.


      Power-walking Laura tosses the KEYS to the Valet with a WINK 
      and bolts off just as an unsuspecting RICHARD exits the club.


      Laura faces off with an unnerved Deedee.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    Eric threatened to divorce me but 
                    never filed...How do you know that?

                                  LAURA
                    Unnamed witness.  Who also says 
                    you ve been tweaking your pre-nup.  
                    Seems a bit unethical-slash-illegal, 
                    given that you re already a widow.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    I have no comment.

                                  LAURA
                    Didn t ask for one.  Though I am 
                    curious about big Rich gently 
                    stroking your hand earlier.  Know 
                    what I think?  Rhetorical.  I think 
                    you ve been nailing your dead 
                    husband s lawyer and changing your 
                    share of the estate.  Makes you a 
                    pretty good candidate for murder.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    Look.  Richard and I had been... 
                    involved.  But it was over.

                                  LAURA
                    So you were cheating, Eric was 
                      cheating....Why d you lie to me?

      Deedee looks away, welling up with tears.  Finally--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    When we married, Eric made me sign a 
                    pre-nup that gave me nothing if I 
                    was unfaithful.  I was fine with it.  
                    I loved him so much I would ve 
                    signed my life away.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN (CONT'D)
                    Then irony of ironies, I catch him 
                      cheating....I slept with Richard to 
                    get back at Eric.  But we made up -- 
                    he broke it off, swore she was out 
                    of his life for good.  And he agreed 
                    we d revise the pre-nup.  That's 
                    what Richard was working on.  

                                  LAURA
                    So you lied to protect your money?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    I was a partner, a confidant, a best 
                    friend to my husband.  I deserve my 
                    share.  Yes, I messed with the 
                    papers.  If I didn t and it came out 
                    that I d had an affair, the estate 
                    lawyer might have voided my entire 
                    stake.  But I am not a murderer.

                                  LAURA
                    Who can back you up, besides Rich?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    No one else knew, other than Eric s 
                    mistress.  

                                  LAURA
                    Too bad you can only identify her 
                    ass cheeks.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                      Detective, I loved this man.  There 
                    is no way I could kill him.  You 
                    have to believe me.  You have to.

      OFF Laura, despite her suspicions, connecting with Deedee, 
      believing her unlikely story--


      Laura confers with Hauser, Billy, and Max.  Meredith hovers.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Sounds bogus.  No name for this 
                    supposed mistress?  No description?   

                                  MAX
                    Also no paper trail.  At least not 
                    one I ve uncovered yet.

                    look for the weapon, chemicals...

                                  LAURA
                          (in Meredith s face)
                    Are you on this case?
                          (then to Captain)
                    Deedee and Richard are a theory.  
                    But not the only theory.  We re 
                    still looking for skate punk and we 
                    need to find the mistress.  For all 
                    we know she could ve had the 
                    Walden s gate code.  Jilted lover, 
                    plants herself inside the house, 
                    kills Walden, slips out.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (rolls eyes, dismissive)
                    Longshot.  Knock yourself out.  But
                    put in for the warrants.

      As the others peel off, Billy hangs back.

                                  BILLY
                    Not that I m ruling out Deedee s 
                    story, but why do you buy it?

                                  LAURA
                    Just have a gut feeling it s the 
                    truth.  If you'd ever been in love 
                    with an a-hole, you'd get it.

                                  BILLY
                    Can't say I didn't warn you.  I 
                    could see Jake was a dog from a 
                    mile away.

                                  LAURA
                    Not like I had a lot of options.

                                  BILLY
                    You know that s not true.

      Billy stares her down.  And we suddenly sense there's a  what 
      might have been  aspect to this partnership.

                                  LAURA
                    What can I say?  Blind spot.

      OFF LAURA, regarding her partner as he gets back to work--

                    Tell your super the gate s stuck.

      He sits beside Laura, pulls a dozing boy onto his lap, smiles.

                          (to Jake)

                    We both are.  Homicide.  Separate

      Laura rolls her eyes.

                    And separate homes.  How...modern.
                    Boys, what is your favorite book?

      The groggy boys just stare back at her.  Laura is dying.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1340.


                                  LAURA
                    What do you say, guys?  
                          (can t think of a book)

                    Sorry, it s past their bed time.

                    I have a tummy ache.

                                  JAKE
                    What ya have for dinner, pal?

                                  NICHOLAS
                    Cough medicine.

                                    ELEANOR CALDECOTT
                    Well.  This has been illuminating.

      She stands to go.  Surprising herself, Laura starts to cry.

                                  LAURA
                    Look, these are good boys--

                                    ELEANOR CALDECOTT
                    I m sure they are.  But we focus on 
                    the whole family, and this one is 
                    frankly unfit for my school.

      Jake loses his shit, scaring the hell out of Eleanor.

                                  JAKE
                    HEY! I may not be Father of the Year, 
                    but this woman works her ass off and 
                    still is there for our sons!  She s 
                    the best mom you could hope to have 
                    in your stupid school, you snobbish, 
                      judgmental...pre-K Nazi queen!

      The horrified woman bolts out the door.  A beat.

                                  LAURA
                    And there goes pre-school.

                    Should I spend the night?

      Laura stares at him in disbelief, the touching moment 
      suddenly evaporated.

                                  LAURA
                          (obviously)
                    No!

      Jake shrugs.  It was worth a try.  A beat.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                      I appreciate your rant.  But like I 
                    said, you're detached from reality.  
                    I'm a terrible mother.

                                  JAKE
                    You re not so bad.

      He kisses her on the forehead, kisses the boys, then--

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    I ll make a few calls.  We ll 
                    figure this out.

      And he too leaves.  A beat.  Laura regards her wedding ring, 
      checks how easy it'd be to remove.  Still stuck.  She sinks 
      back in the couch, her two boys snuggled asleep on her lap.


      Kids play video games, skee-ball, etc.  Laura, feigning 
      nerves, approaches a GANGLY DUDE at the PRIZE COUNTER.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    I m looking for Skank.

                                  GANGLY DUDE
                    He s out.  You need something?

                                  LAURA
                          (leans in, discreet)
                    Just a small baggie.  And maybe one 
                    of those brownies....I don t usually 
                    do this but it s that time of month.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1343.


      The Dude stares her down for a beat.

                                  GANGLY DUDE
                    You a cop?

                                  LAURA
                          (laughs aloud)
                    Do I look like a cop?

      Fair point.  The Dude pulls out his wares for Laura, when--

      SKANK ENTERS

                                  GANGLY DUDE
                    Yo.  Soccer Mom s looking for you.

      Sensing trouble, Skank TAKES OFF, Laura on his heels.


      Skank tosses down his SKATEBOARD and speeds away.  

                                  LAURA
                    Why is everyone making me run this 
                    week?!

      She sprints after him, shouting into her CELL--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    ALLEY!

      The chase serpentines along the back of an APARTMENT 
      BUILDING, Skank knocking down LAUNDRY LINES and crushing 
      CHICKEN COOPS, Laura shocking the kid by relentlessly keeping 
      up with him.  She may run like a girl, but a fast girl.  

      His lead narrowing, Skank s about to break for the STREET 
      when BILLY S CAR SCREECHES INTO THE ALLEY, cutting him off. 
      Laura TACKLES SKANK, then PUNCHES HIM IN THE THROAT.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    That s for selling weed out of an 
                    arcade.  No room at the playground?

      Skank GAGS, having a very hard time catching his breath.  
      Laura leaves the gasping punk with Billy, returning to help a 
      startled BARRIO MAMA REHANG all her strewn clothing. 

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Lo siento.


      Laura and Billy face off with scared, bruised SKANK.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1344.


                                  SKANK
                    I don t know nothing about Walden 
                    getting killed!  He liked his bud!  
                    You call in, deal is I come in 
                    thirty minutes or less.

                                  BILLY
                          (has to admit)
                    That is impressive.

                                  SKANK
                    Other night, I show, see the black 
                    and whites, and got the hell out.

                                  LAURA
                    Skank, we got you in front of Judge 
                    Wong. Her pot-head son just totaled 
                    the family minivan.  She s gonna 
                    love you.  Wanna catch a break, get 
                      reassigned?  I need a lead.  Ever 
                    meet any of Walden s friends?  
                          (Skank shakes his head)
                    See him with anyone? 
                          (another head shake)
                    Deliver to him anywhere else?

                                  SKANK
                          (beat, thinks on it)
                    Yeah, actually.  Month ago, he made 
                    me haul my ass up near Santa 
                    Barbara to some hotel.  He was 
                    yelling at his girlfriend -- took 
                    him forever to answer the door.

      Laura and Billy exchange a look -- holy shit.

                                  BILLY
                    How do you know it wasn t his wife?

                                  SKANK
                    Cause this lady was saying she d go 
                    nuclear if he didn t leave his wife.

      Finally armed with a real lead, Laura bolts into--


      A gorgeous inn tucked into a forested hillside.  


      Laura speaks with a gaggle of MAIDS in very mediocre SPANISH.  
      A few make eyes with Handsome Billy.  We SUBTITLE--

                                  LAURA
                    First I am giving you much 
                      congratulations.  You are the 
                      cleaningest hotel I am ever 
                    visiting.  The toilet in the lobby?  
                    Very washed and pretty.  If anyone 
                    has a good idea for taking--
                          (mimes picking her nose, 
                            then resorts to ENGLISH)
                    --boogers out of grout, por favor 
                    let me know.

      A mix of confused looks and a few grateful smiles.  Laura 
      flashes the PHOTO of Walden.  Back to SPANISH--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    This man, Mister Walden, stays here 
                    last month.  Who is remembering?

      The women look to one MAID in particular.  Laura notices the 
      visibly nervous maid oddly COVER ONE HAND with the other.  

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    You washed this man s room?
                          (off her nod)
                    He is with a woman.  You see her?

      The maid speaks perfect English.

                                  HOTEL MAID
                    No.  They were very private.  I saw 
                    him one time only.  But never her.

      The maid s still covering her hand.  Curious, Laura 
        accidentally-on-purpose SPILLS her mint water.  As the maid 
      instinctively cleans up, Laura LOCKS ON a diamond-encrusted 
      platinum WEDDING RING the woman wears on her finger.  A beat.

                                  LAURA
                    Beautiful ring.  You know, I've 
                    been looking to upgrade mine.  
                    Where can I get one like that?

      Laura stares the woman down.  A tense beat.

                                  HOTEL MAID
                    I don t know....      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1348.


                                  LAURA
                    No, you don t.  It belongs to the 
                    woman I m looking for.  Doesn't it?

      Billy -- thrown by the seemingly unfounded accusation, is 
      doubly thrown when the maid, now weeping, NODS.

                                  HOTEL MAID
                    I found it in the room after they 
                    checked out.  I was just holding it 
                    until they called.  They never did.

      OFF Laura, wheels turning--


      Exiting, Billy looks to his visibly perplexed partner.

                                  BILLY
                    How d you know it was the mistress s 
                    ring?  And why do you have your sick-
                      to-your-stomach face on?

                                  LAURA
                    I ve seen that ring before.  But it 
                    can t be....


      DING DONG.  Margarita the housekeeper answers the door.  We 
      REVERSE to reveal Laura and Billy.

                                  MARGARITA
                    Missus no is here.

                                  LAURA
                    Better.  We ll be in and out.

      She and Billy walk right in, passing Margarita.

                    What re we doing?

      Billy follows Laura into

                                  LAURA (CONT D)

                    We escort him into the bedroom,

                    slouches into the love seat, 
                    goodnight goodnight--


      Laura and Billy exit the bedroom, closing the door, as--

                                  LAURA
                    We station the uniforms right at 
                    the door, then we head out.

      They start down the hall, when from behind we hear a CRASH, 
      then another, as if someone is being attacked in the bedroom.  

                                  BILLY
                    What the hell?!

      Startled and racing back 

      INTO THE MASTER BEDROOM

      Billy is confused to find it perfectly intact.  Which is when 
      he notices the sounds are emanating from LAURA'S CELL PHONE, 
      resting on the dresser.  Laura holds up the cell, deadpans--  

                                  LAURA
                    Forgot my phone.

      Billy recognizes the look on his partner s face.  

                                  BILLY
                    You know who did it.  

      Laura nods.  

                                  LAURA
                    And I know how.

      A hundred well-to-do MOURNERS -- all of our SUSPECTS included

                    arrest the wife, soon as we 
                    convince the DA we have a case.

                                  POLICE CHIEF
                    And do you have a case?

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                      Everything but the weapon.  Hit a 
                    snag because she turned out to be 
                    diabetic, which supposedly explains 
                    away the syringe we found in her 
                      car....We ll put it to bed quickly.  

                                  LAURA
                      Whatayasay we put it to bed now?

      The Captain and Chief both look to Laura in confusion.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (off surroundings, firm)
                    Laura, it s not the time for more 
                    fishing.

                                  BILLY
                    She s not fishing.  She solved the 
                    murder.

                                  LAURA
                    Actually, two murders.

                    Then for god s sake, tell everyone.

      They turn to see an adamant Deedee eavesdropping.        MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1352.

                    I will not spend another minute 
                    enduring suspicious glares from 
                    people assuming I killed Eric.

      She marches to the LECTERN, speaks into the MICROPHONE.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN (CONT D)
                    Detective Laura Diamond from the 
                    LAPD has an important announcement.

      Laura looks to Billy -- should I do this?  He shrugs -- go 
      for it.  She hesitantly approaches the mic, her tone serious. 

                                  LAURA
                    Good morning. 
                          (gets FEEDBACK, adjusts)
                    Whoa.  Hot mic.  Okay, where to 
                    begin?  How about this -- Deedee 
                    Walden did not kill her husband.

      We see Deedee exhale in vindication.  Nearby, the Captain and 
      Chief look disconcerted.  Laura forges ahead.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    The person who did kill Eric Walden 
                    committed a nearly perfect crime.  
                    It was the work of an obviously 
                    brilliant mind.  I suspected Eric s 
                    brother at first--
                          (looks to Ned)
                    --but then I got to know you 
                    better.

      Ned s not sure whether to be relieved or insulted.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    So who else was in the house?
                          (indicates to)
                    There s neighbor Lisa, she of the 
                    size zero waistline and the 
                       digestive issues. 


                                  LAURA
                          (to a cowed Lisa)
                    Little advice?  If you re gonna 
                    toss your cookies, the cookies 
                    don t have to be gluten free.
                          (moving on)
                    The Walden s housekeeper, 
                      Margarita, and their chef, Jean 
                    Luc, were present that night.

      We see them seated, looking quite uneasy at the moment.


                                  LAURA
                    Unless the condom I came across--
                          (whoops)
                    --poor choice of words --the condom 
                    I found on the pantry floor was for 
                    squeezing out cake frosting.
                          (turns her attention to)
                    Also present was Richard Levine, 
                    Eric s attorney and Deedee s...
                          (how to put it)
                    ...buddy.  But Deedee vouches for 
                    Richard s alibi and he s a lefty, 
                    which the killer isn t.

      Richard looks relieved to be off the hook.  Deedee chimes in.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    Then who?!  No one else was in the 
                    house.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1354.


                                  LAURA
                    No?  I was....  
                          (then, pained to say)
                    So was my boss.

      A sullen Laura, and everyone else, turn to a stone-faced 

      CAPTAIN HAUSER

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    He tragically lost his wife Karen 
                    last month in a car accident....Or 
                    was it an accident?  Her car went 
                    over a cliff on her way back from a 
                    tryst with her lover, Eric Walden.

      Deedee and the crowd are stunned by this revelation.  But 
      Laura, scrutinizing the Captain s face, sees only guilt.


      Pot-dealer Skank stands outside, hearing ANGRY VOICES inside.

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    Eric tried to break it off with 
                    Karen that day.  They fought.

      We CUT TO DEEDEE at the precinct, insisting to Laura--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    He swore she was out of his life 
                    for good.


      Laura eyes the Captain, torn between sympathy and anger.

                                  LAURA
                    Tell me if I m off.  You knew about 
                    the affair.  When Karen died, you 
                    suspected Eric was responsible.  


      Outside Walden s house, we again see Hauser tell Laura--

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER

                                  LAURA
                          (still to Captain)
                    It must have eaten you up inside 
                    when you saw her in the morgue and 
                    she didn t have her ring on.  She 
                    lost it in the hotel room.

      Laura holds up the RING.  The Captain is visibly shaken.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    I always loved this ring.  Loved 
                    that you had a matching one.


                                  LAURA
                    But he didn t say a word.  And 
                    that s when you knew for certain -- 
                    Eric killed your wife.


                                  LAURA
                          (to the Captain)
                    He was pleading for mercy, offering 
                    to buy your silence.  But you were 
                      determined to get revenge.        MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1356.



                                  LAURA
                    That was clever.  But not as clever 
                    as planting some kind of device in 
                    the room on a timer--


      Laura still stares down the inscrutable Captain.

                                  LAURA
                    --and that was that.

      Every person present now stares accusingly at THE CAPTAIN.  A 
      beat.  He suddenly TURNS AND RUNS.  

      Billy and Laura SPRINT after the Captain, her BULKY PURSE 
      BOUNCING all over the place.  

      Chasing him ACROSS THE MANICURED LAWN, Laura signals  back 
      off  to Billy as she pulls ahead and TACKLES Hauser.  They 
      ROLL and roll, until he RIPS AWAY HER PURSE, then stands and 
      pulls out HIS OWN GUN.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1357.


      Billy hangs back, hand on his holster, but knows better than 
      to deny Laura this moment.  Hauser waves his gun alternately 
      at both detectives, as--

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    I m a better shot than Billy, 
                    Laura.  Don t be stupid.

      She lays into her boss, incensed.

                                  LAURA
                    Why not?!  You obviously wanted me 
                    to be a complete idiot the night 
                    you decided to use me as your dupe!

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    It wasn t like that...

                                  LAURA
                    No?!  How exactly was it?!  You 
                    were my mentor!  How dare you take 
                    advantage of my loyalty, my 
                      friendship?!  And what -- now 
                    you're gonna shoot me?  Screw you!

      Humiliated, desperate, the Captain begins to fall apart--

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    That sonofabitch murdered Karen!  

                                  LAURA
                    And if you d come to me, I would ve 
                    helped you put him away!  We coulda 
                    proved he ran her off the road -- 
                    his Bentley s in the goddamn body 
                    shop with a bashed fender!  

      We sense this isn t news to Hauser.  And Laura realizes--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    You knew that.  You didn t want to 
                    arrest him.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Rich guys like Walden don t go to 
                      prison....And I m sure as hell not 
                    going to either.  I m sorry, Laura, 
                    I am, but now, you both have two 
                    choices.  Let me disappear...or 
                    we're gonna have a problem.

                                  LAURA
                    Then we have a problem.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1358.


      Undaunted, she reprises her ultimatum from Venice Beach. 

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    I m going to count to three, then 
                    I m coming for my handcuffs.
                    If you want to pull the trigger, 
                    that's up to you.  

      Reeling, beyond desperate, Hauser cocks his gun, aiming back 
      and forth between the cops--

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Don t do this, Laura!

                                  LAURA
                      One....Two....

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    I mean it!

                                  LAURA
                    Three.

      She matter-of-factly approaches.  Panicked, the Captain 

      PULLS THE TRIGGER.  

      Click, empty chamber.  Now really pissed, Laura FACEPLANTS 
      him with a suckerpunch.  Billy rolls his eyes at the Captain.

                                  BILLY
                    She took your bullets, jackass.
