      Man.  A fish crawls out of water, continues up through animal 
    and Neanderthal stages, reaching Modern Man, who is diving 
      back into the water, labeled,  Intelligent Design Pool .

      WIDER TO REVEAL

      Cartoon is being drawn by a cynical old coot named WHITLEY.  
      Kolchak approaches his drafting board.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Excuse me, Mr. Whitley?  I m sorry 
                    to bother you, but I was wondering 
                    if I might ask for a favor?

                                  WHITLEY
                    Would it involve me drawing? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Actually, it would.

                                  WHITLEY
                    Then forget it.  If there s 
                    anything I hate to do -- it s draw.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... you do it for a living.

                                  WHITLEY
                    You call this living?  Who are you, 
                    anyway?  How d you get in here?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Uhm, well ....

                                  WHITLEY
                    You re the guy that writes all 
                    those cockamamie stories, right?  I 
                    love your crap!  What do you need 
                    me to draw?  Not a monster?!

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Well, I have a description of an 
                    unknown creature --

      With a dramatic flourish, Whitley sweeps away his current 
      work, and eagerly grabs a fresh sheet of paper.  Kolchak 
      hands him his open notebook, which Whitley consults.

                                  WHITLEY
                    Say no more!  Just give me a couple 
                    minutes.  Hey, hold on -- does this 
                    thing have one eye or three?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Split the difference.  Give it two.


      A nice, pleasant female reporter, ANN, types at her desk, as 
      Reed approaches, like one does with a colleague you ve met, 
    but rarely interact with.

                                  REED
                    Hi, you re Ann, right?  With the

                    crime.  I was wondering if you 
                    could provide me with a contact 
                    about mountain lions.  I m working 
                    on the attack story.

                                  ANN
                    Sure.  I just talked to this guy at

                    story -- what to do if you re ever 
                    attacked, safety precautions, etc.

    She jots down a name and number, and hands it to Reed.

                                  REED
                    Thanks, I appreciate it.

      Reed heads towards her desk, and Ann resumes typing for a 
      beat, before Kolchak appears.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  9.

                    animal would you say this most 
                    resembles?

      Kolchak hands her Whitley s drawing.  It s a fairly accurate 
      likeness of the Monster, but it s depicted as wearing a top 
    hat and monocle, and devouring several tiny picketers.

                                  ANN
                    Why s it wearing a top hat?

                    It s supposed to represents big 
                    business, devouring labor unions -- 
                    look, just ignore that part.

                                  ANN
                    It sort of looks like a horned 
                    lizard.  Most people call them 
                    horny toads.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Do they ever get to be man-size?

                                  ANN
                    Uhm, no.  They re more like this.

    She holds out her hand, as if holding one in it.  She then 
      proceeds to shake her head to Kolchak s following questions:

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Do they attack humans?  Are they 
                    poisonous?  Are you sure they don t 
                    ever get to be man-size?  Okay ... 
                    well, thanks for your help.

      Kolchak considers this.  He nods his thanks, moving off.


      Reed and Kolchak sit across from Vincenzo, vetting their 
      stories.  He runs a red marker through a line in Reed s copy.

    He hands her back her copy, with only the one sentence red-
      lined.  Vincenzo picks up Kolchak s piece, and immediately 
      starts red-lining, much to Kolchak s consternation.

                    there.  Here s our proof.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  20.



      Vincenzo squints, trying to decipher the images.

                                  VINCENZO
                    These look like a five year old 
                    took them.  

                                  MCMANUS
                    Hey, even Robert Capa s D-Day 
                    photos were a little blurry.  I was 
                    under attack!

                                  VINCENZO
                          (re: bloody shirt)
                    What the hell -- ?  Are you okay?

                                  MCMANUS
                    Yeah, I m fine.  I don t actually 
                    have any wounds or anything.

                                  VINCENZO
                    Where d all this blood come from?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Hey -- maybe that s the monster s 
                    blood!  It might have shot some out 
                    its eyeballs. 

      Vincenzo stares at Kolchak.  A long, silent pause.  Slowly, 
      carefully, Vincenzo backs away.  He continues walking 
      backwards, eventually turning the office corner, and exits.  
      Kolchak resumes right where he left off.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Don t wash that shirt.  We need to 
                    get that blood analyzed.

      Reed enters, carrying a folder.

                                  REED
                    The police just i.d. d that body 
                    you guys found --
                          (sees photo)
                    Is that what I think it is?

                                  MCMANUS
                    Maybe.  

                                  REED
                    None of the pictures came out?

                                  MCMANUS
                    All except this one.

      McManus clicks up a photo of Guy sitting on the toilet.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  21.



                                  REED
                    Who is that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We thought we had cornered the 
                    monster.  It turned out to just be 
                    this guy.

                                  REED
                    Get a load of his tie.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Tie?  Look at that jacket.  Yikes.

      Reed opens her folder, and pulls out a photograph.

                                  REED
                    This is a photo of one of the 
                    victims found at the mountain 
                    trail.  It looks like they re 
                    wearing identical ties.  

                                  MCMANUS
                    Could be just a coincidence.

                                  REED
                    Sure, but ... am I imagining it, or 
                    ... wasn t this guy there, at the 
                    crime scene that morning?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t recall seeing him.

                                  REED
                    Why would you -- you weren t 
                    looking for anything with just two 
                    eyeballs.
                          (to McManus)
                    Can you print me this picture?
                          (to Kolchak)
                    I want to go show this to that Park 
                    Ranger.  See if it triggers 
                    anything.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s not a bad idea.  Can you 
                    also show him the sketch.  That 
                    might trigger something, as well.

      Kolchak tries to hand her the monster sketch, but she just 
      looks at it, before looking straight back at Kolchak.

                                  REED
                    No.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  22.




    In a plain, simple, all-American home, Reed, displaying the 
      photo of Guy, and Kolchak, displaying his sketch, sit across 
      from the slightly befuddled Park Ranger.

                                  RANGER
                    Why is it wearing -- ?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Ignore that.

                                  RANGER
                    Okay.  So ... you re asking me if I 
                    was attacked by a giant horny toad?

    The Ranger looks at Reed for help.  She holds up her photo.

                                  REED
                    Perhaps you ve seen this man 
                    before, on the trails?

                                  RANGER
                    It s not ringing any bells, but ... 
                    wait a second -- are you telling me 
                    this is the guy that killed all 
                    those people?  

                                  REED
                    He s merely a person of interest.

                                  RANGER
                    It s hard to believe someone who 
                    looks like this, could be such a 
                    monster. 

                                  REED
                    You know, if you re at all open to 
                    the idea, I d love to come back 
                    sometime, for a longer interview 
                    about what it s like to survive an 
                    attack by a serial killer, who s 
                    still on the loose.

                                  RANGER
                    Oh, sure, anytime.  It really has 
                    affected me in ways I --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What did you do with your bloody 
                    shirt?

                                  RANGER
                    What bloody shirt?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  23.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    The night you were attacked.  Your 
                    shirt had blood all over.

                                  RANGER
                    I ... threw it away.  I didn t want 
                    any reminders of that awful night.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The police didn t want it as 
                    evidence?

                                  RANGER
                    Evidence of what?  The blood was 
                    obviously from that poor hiker that 
                    was killed next to me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not necessarily.  That blood might 
                    have come out the monster s 
                    eyeball.  

    The Ranger stares at Kolchak like he s a crazy person.  
      Kolchak looks to Reed for help, but she s looking at him 
      exactly the same way.  After an awkward, crazy-filled pause --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I ll wait outside.  Thanks for your 
                    time, sir.

      Kolchak gets up and leaves.

                                  REED
                    I m sorry for that.  He s ... 
                    really more of an intern.


      Kolchak, alone, cruises down the same back alleys and streets 
    as in the previous Act, listening to his police scanner.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    The pursuit continues.  The night 
                    providing cover for the inscrutable
                    creature, hiding somewhere in our 
                      subconscious.  But morning sheds 
                    light on even the most elusive.


    The more-than-slightly seedy motel manager is dipping a 
      washcloth into a bottle of rubbing alcohol.  Wincing, he dabs 
    the cloth on one of several minor cuts on his face, and then 
      takes a hit of the bottle, as Kolchak enters.

                                  MANAGER
                    Sorry, we re full.  No vacancies.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What about the room the guy who did 
                    that to you was staying in?  I hear 
                    he s skipped off.

                                  MANAGER
                    That room needs repairs now, and -- 
                    hey, who the hell are you, anyway?

                    any charges, and I don t want no 
                    publicity from this, so please, go.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  26.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    There was mention of a  monster ?

                                  MANAGER
                    He had the nerve to call me that, 
                    right before he conks me on the 
                    head with a chair. I only asked him 
                    to pay his bill.  That makes me a 
                    monster?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Of course not.

                                  MANAGER
                    Obviously.  Now, please -- go away 
                    or I ll kill you.


      Amongst general dishevelment, an upended chair lies next to a 
      shattered, full length mirror.  Kolchak enters, taking a 
      closer look around.  From the night table, he picks up a pill 
      bottle, prescribed to  Guy Mann  by a Dr. Rumanovitch.  He 
      pockets it, and notes a crumbled bag from  Monster Donut .

      Kolchak approaches the mirror.  After studying a shard, he 
      sticks his head through the frame, finding a crawl space 
      behind the wall.  As Kolchak steps  into  the mirror --


    The crawl space is tall enough to stand erect in, but is so 
      narrow that Kolchak must shuffle sideways to navigate it.  

      After shuffling down this claustrophobic corridor, Kolchak 
      arrives at another mirror.  This provides a direct view into 
      another motel room, where a half-naked Babycat is getting 
      dressed, while  her  CLIENT (TOM SANCHEZ) sleeps in bed. 

      Kolchak continues on, and reaches the end of the crawl space, 
      where he finds a door handle.  As he turns it -- 


    At the front desk, the Manager turns around, and is 
      unpleasantly surprised to see Kolchak stepping into the back 
    of the office, through the crawl space door.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  27.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Carl Kolchak, L.A. Beacon.  

                                  MANAGER
                    What the hell were you --?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Relax, sir.  I m a news reporter.  
                    This ain t news.  When people check 
                    into a place like this, they expect 
                    the manager to be a peeping tom.  
                    It s part of the amenities.

                                  MANAGER
                    That s a ... a security feature --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Of course, my loyal readers down at 
                    the police station might find this 
                    story interesting, but me -- I m 
                    more into ... human interest.

                                  MANAGER
                    Would this interest you enough?

    He tries discreetly sliding some $20 dollar bills towards 
      Kolchak, who stops the slide with the prescription bottle.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m interested in this  Guy Mann,  
                    the guest you got in the fight 
                    with.  What really happened?

                                  MANAGER
                          (pause)
                    You won t believe me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Try me.


      Standing in the crawl space, the Manager looks through the 
      two-way mirror, watching Babycat and her client sleep.

                                  MANAGER (V.O.)
                    Early this morning, I was checking 
                    on ... the security of my guests.

      Sidestepping down the crawl space, the Manager comes to 
      another mirror.  He peers into a much darker room.  A 
      rustling occurs under the bed cover.  Suddenly, from the 
      bottom of the bed where the feet should be, an appendage 
      sticks out.  Could it be ... a claw?!        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  28.



    The Manager squints, trying to make out the body, as it 
      crawls -- literally -- out of bed, and across the floor, to 
    the window.  The body reaches up, parting the blinds.  A beam 
    of morning sunlight bursts through, illuminating the 
      monstrous image of ... the Monster!

    The Manager SHRIEKS in horror, as the Monster SHRIEKS in 
      pain.  The Monster closes the blinds, and writhes across the 
      floor, towards the mirror, going out of view.  The Manager 
      cranes his neck, hoping to get another look at this thing.

      Suddenly, a claw SLAMS against the mirror.  It tries grabbing 
      hold, but slides down and off, out of view again.  A pause, 
    as the Manager stands motionless, frozen in fright.

      Suddenly, a human hand SLAMS against the mirror.  The hand 
      grabs a hold of the frame, supporting a human man, who, 
      wobbly, rises to his feet.  The man staggers back to the 
      window, and opens the blinds again.  The light revealing -- 
      GUY.  He appears to be in pain, but of the metaphysical sort.

                                  GUY
                    Why?  Why?!  Why?!?

    He shakes his fists at the heavens, knocks a few things over, 
      then, like an enraged animal, runs to the bathroom, going out 
    of the Manager s view. 

    The Manager anxiously awaits for Guy to re-appear.  He waits 
    for quite a while.  O.s., various INDISTINGUISHABLE NOISES, 
      along with some GRUNTS and GROANS, make the wait seem 
      interminable.   

    Guy re-appears, but his demeanor has completely transformed.  
      Fully dressed, with a cup of coffee in his hand, he crosses 
    to the door, opens it, brings in the complimentary copy of 
    the L.A. BEACON, sits down and starts reading.  

      Perplexed, the Manager watches this guest, who so recently 
      appeared to be some kind of monster, now sits sipping his 
      morning coffee like any normal person.  

      Suddenly, Guy re-erupts in psychotic fury.  He punches his 
      newspaper, and tosses his coffee across the room.  He upends 
    the table, and starts trashing his room.  Just as suddenly, 
    Guy freezes.  He s looking straight at the Manager.

    The Manager becomes unsettled, as Guy slowly stalks towards 
      him, with a look filled with pure hatred.

      REVERSE ANGLE reveals that Guy is staring at his own 
      reflection.  He touches his own face in revulsion.           NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  29.



                                  GUY
                    Why?

    He suddenly grabs the chair, and hurls it at the mirror.  The 
      Manager SCREAMS as the chair SMASHES through, and CRASHES 
      into him.  Guy stares in stunned surprise, as the bleeding, 
      semi-conscious Manager falls forward into the room.

                                  MANAGER
                    Monster!  Help me, he s a monster!

    As Guy dashes out of the room -- 


      Disturbed by simply recounting the incident, the Manager 
      downs another gulp of rubbing alcohol.  Kolchak shows him the 
      monster sketch, and the photo of Guy.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Is either one of these what you saw 
                    in that room?

    The Manager looks over both pictures.

                                  MANAGER
                    They are one and the same!

                                  ACT FOUR


                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m a monster.  At night, when the 
                    moon comes out, I turn into ... a 
                      lizard-like monster that feeds on 
                    human flesh.

      Kolchak sits in an examination room that doesn t look 
      entirely hygienic, much like its physician, DR. RUMANOVITCH.  
      Elderly, perpetually sweaty, and with an Eastern European 
      accent, his role models were Sigmund Freud and Peter Lorre.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Hmmm, it must be going around.  
                    Just the other day, I saw a patient 
                    suffering a similar affliction.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Really?  Who was this person?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Some nut.  I m afraid I can t  
                    discuss my other patients.  You ll 
                    just have to wait for my book.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Dr. Rumanovitch, would it be 
                    possible for me to contact this 
                    person?  To ... start a support 
                    group --

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    I don t believe in group therapy.  
                    You must confront your demons -- or 
                    in this case, your monsters -- 
                    alone.  With a therapist.  Which 
                    reminds me of what I told this 
                    other patient.
                          (pause)
                    It s an old fairy tale about a 
                    constable, whose village is being 
                    tormented by a dragon.  He tries to 
                    kill this creature, but nothing can 
                    stop it.  Finally, he visits a 
                    gypsy witch doctor, who tells him 
                    the only way to kill this monster 
                    is to take a lance of green glass, 
                    and stab it in its appendix.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  31.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why glass?  And why it s appendix?  

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    These old myths, the monster must 
                    be destroyed by some form of 
                      penetration -- a wooden stake, a 
                    silver bullet.  Our ancestors were 
                    as concerned about male potency as 
                    we are.  Now, please, no further 
                      interruptions.  He makes this lance 
                    of green glass and confronts the 
                    monster, stabbing it in its 
                    appendix.  But as the monster 
                    starts to die, the constable 
                    realizes ... he s been looking at a 
                    mirror!  He was the monster all 
                    along, you see!
                          (pause)
                    As fairy tales go, it s imbecilic.  
                    But illustrates my point.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Which is?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    It is easier for us to believe in  
                    monsters, than believe monsters are 
                    in us.  Specifically, the 
                      cerebellum.

      Grabbing a model of the human brain, he removes the cerebral 
      cortex, only to reveal a pill bottle inside.  After 
      swallowing a couple pills, he points to the neuroanatomy.

                                    RUMANOVITCH (V.O.)
                    The cerebellum regulates our bodily 
                    functions, and is sometimes 
                    referred to as our reptilianbrain.  
                    You see where I m going with this.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not really.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Our reptilian brains still cause us 
                    to do things -- base, animalistic, 
                    things -- that our  higher  minds 
                    can t comprehend.  Thus, we create,  
                    like our myth-making forefathers, 
                    excuses for our own abhorrent 
                    behavior.

                                    RUMANOVITCH (cont'd)
                     Oh, no, it wasn t Iwho gave that 
                    little girl a lobotomy, it must 
                    have been some terrible monster!   
                    But there are no monsters out 
                    there.  There never have been.  
                    They ve always resided in here --
                          (taps his brain)
                    -- and possibly here --
                          (touches heart)
                    -- and maybe here.
                          (points to his appendix)

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not everything can be reduced to 
                      psychology.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    That s what you think.
                          (after snide giggle)
                    You know, Mr. Vincenzo, you strike 
                    me as someone suffering from any 
                    number of delusions but this 
                    turning into a monster is not one 
                    of them.  Yes?

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (pause)
                    I m trying to find this other 
                    patient.  I figured you wouldn t 
                    give me access to his files, so --

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    You posed as a fellow sufferer, 
                    hoping I d provide information on 
                    him, yes?  But I saw through the 
                      subterfuge!  
                          (after triumphant giggle)
                    Here s his file.

      Rumanovitch tosses a file to Kolchak, who is momentarily 
      taken aback by the gesture, but he quickly scans it.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    This is useless.  Hardly any 
                      information has been filled out.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    This is a free clinic.  Our 
                    clientele is not the most 
                      forthright.  Did you really think 
                     Guy Mann,  wasn t a pseudonym?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  33.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Can you at least offer a possible 
                    suggestion where I might find him?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    I recall he was obsessed with 
                    death, as these types usually are.  
                    He probably habituates places 
                    associated with death:  cemeteries, 
                    funeral parlors, the free clinic.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You mean, here?  This free clinic?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Did I say,  the free clinic?   Talk 
                    about your Freudian slips!


    Guy takes a bite out of a cream-filled donut, while sitting 
    at a booth, piled high with various donuts.  He is being eyed 
    by Reed, who is at the counter, speaking on her cell phone.

                                  REED
                    Kolchak, I can t believe I m about 
                    to utter the following words, but:  
                    I ve found your lizard-man.  He s 
                    at the Monster Donut on Gower.

                                  KOLCHAK (O.S.)
                    Can you stall him  til I get there?

                                  REED
                    It looks like he ll be here a 
                    while, but I ll try my best.

      Reed closes her phone, and approaches Guy.

                                  REED
                    Excuse me, I m sorry to bother you, 
                    but I just had to tell you how much 
                    I love that tie.  

    Guy stares up at her in confusion.  He absentmindedly wipes 
    his mouth with his tie, then holds it out.

                                  GUY
                    You mean this thing?

                                                                            CUT TO:      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  34.




      Kolchak enters, only to find no one there, and the place 
      trashed.  Donuts, coffee, food trays, etc., litter the floor.  
      After Kolchak takes a moment to take this in, the DONUT CLERK 
      nervously pops his head up from behind the counter.  Then 
      Reed peeks out from below the booth s table.

                                  REED
                    Is he gone?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Is he gone?!  You were supposed to 
                    keep him here.  What happened?

                                  REED
                    I was having a polite conversation 
                    with him, when he suddenly threw a 
                    fit, and ran out of here.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

                                  REED
                    That s what he kept screaming: 
                     Why?!  Why?! 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why didn t you follow him?  He s 
                    our story!

                                  REED
                    No, Carl, he s yourstory.  I just 
                    got a call from Vincenzo.  The 
                    police have announced a press 
                    conference -- the rumor is they ve 
                    arrested the murderer in this case.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How could they have done that when 
                    the killer was just here?  And you 
                    let him slip through your fingers!

                                  REED
                    Carl, there s something you don t 
                    seem to understand.  I m a crime 
                    reporter, not a crime-fighter.  My 
                    job isn t to solve crimes, it s to 
                    write about them.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  35.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Sounds to me like you re a crime-
                      stenographer.

                                  REED
                    I d be more insulted by that if it 
                    wasn t coming from someone chasing 
                    a horny toad man/monster, who just 
                    threw a tantrum in a donut shop.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Which way did he go?

    As Reed points off --


      Wearing apron, hat, and phony smile, Guy serves a PATRON.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    And I found one right away.  By 
                    day s end, I was manager.

                                  GUY
                    Thank you.  Have a nice day!


      Guy, wearing only white briefs, eats donuts and drinks beer 
      while watching TV. (On the screen -- STOCK FOOTAGE of people 
      engaged in some stupid physical activity, like a tug-of-war.)  

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    At first, I watched a reality show 
                    about people who had been on other 
                    reality shows, competing with each 
                    other to get on a new reality show.  
                    But then I found something less 
                      pornographic:


    Guy watches PORN.  Empty beer bottles are littered about.  He 
      gets up out of bed, and stumbles to the door.


      Sunlight streams through the blinds, onto a body in bed, 
      completely under the covers.  The ALARM CLOCK RINGS.  A 
      clawed monster hand pokes out of the blankets, and pounds on 
    the clock, but the alarm continues.  The claw retracts under 
    the covers.

    The body rolls over, tossing off the blankets to reveal an 
      entirely human Guy.  He shuts off the alarm, yawns, and sits 
    on the bed groggily, like any human starting his day.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Inescapably, I fell into the 
                    routine of human existence, even 
                    though I understood none of it.


    Guy shaves his face, howling in pain after each razor stoke.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why shave hair that was just going 
                    to grow back again?

    Guy applies roll-on deodorant under his arms, then continues 
    on, rolling it across his chest, down his belly, around his 
      back, up his neck, over the top of his head.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why cover your natural scent with 
                    some other manufactured scent?

    Guy sits on the toilet, unraveling some toilet paper.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why ... well, why bother?


      Sitting in a chair, now fully dressed, Guy reads the Beacon.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why read the morning paper?  To 
                    find out what happened to people I 
                    didn t know, doing things I didn t 
                    care about, in places I d never be?

    Guy is behind the counter, all smiles and friendliness, 
      filling an order for a ANOTHER PATRON.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I went to work.  Having previously 
                    been obsessed with getting a job, 
                    now that I had one, all I could 
                    think about was quitting.  Finally, 
                    the conflict resolved itself.

                                  GUY 
                    That s it -- I quit!  Make your own 
                    damn coffee!

    Guy suddenly explodes in a furious rage, tossing several 
      trays of donuts, before ripping off his apron and hat (which 
    he punches), and climbs over the counter.


    Guy sits listening to Dr. Rumanovitch, who is displaying his 
      brain model.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I realized I needed help.  I sought 
                    medical attention, but all I got 
                    were useless meds, and ancient 
                    myths about Dragon-men and the 
                    Super-Ego.  It was all so 
                    humiliating, that I then became 
                    consumed by a feeling I had never 
                    before known -- revenge!  I wanted 
                    to kill the son of a bitch that did 
                    this to me!

    Guy suddenly tosses his chair across the room, then SCREAMS 
    at the heavens in a vengeful rage.  Rumanovitch pulls out a 
      hypo-needle, but Guy flees by leaping out the open window.  
      Rumanovitch shrugs, then injects himself with the sedative.  


                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    You d think there d be a limit to 
                    how long a man can watch strangers 
                    fornicate, but you d be wrong.  
                      Mercifully, night finally fell.

      Watching porn in bed, Guy points the remote, and notices his 
      hand is transforming.  Zapping off the TV, he lays his head 
    on the pillow.  With a relieved smile on it, Guy s face 
      transforms into the Monster s.  Immediately, he begins 
      SNORING peacefully.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      (Reprising Act Three) Guy is trashing his room.  He hurls the 
      chair at the mirror, causing the Manager to fall into the 
      room.  Guy dashes out.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Unmercifully, morning rose again.    
                    I found a man was living behind my 
                    mirror.  Why?  I didn t bother to 
                    find out -- things were weird 
                    enough already.


      Guys sits at his booth, suicidally eating donuts.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  48.



                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Needing to clear my head, I went 
                    and got some donuts.  Maybe it was 
                    the cream talking, but I couldn t 
                    help but think:  what was the point 
                    of Life, if living it only made you 
                    want to be dead?  That s when I 
                    decided to end mine.  But as I 
                    contemplated how, and began 
                      considering the doctor s story 
                    about green glass and appendixes, a 
                    strange thing happened .... 

      Reed approaches Guy s booth.

                                  REED
                    Excuse me, but how d you like to 
                    take these donuts back to my place, 
                    and show me what these holes are 
                    for?

      Sticking her finger through the hole of a glazed donut, she 
      takes a seductive bite.  Cue the bass-heavy PORN MUSIC:


      Reed and Guy theatrically hump on the couch.

                                  REED
                    Oh my god -- you re an animal!  
                    Don t stop!  Don t stop!!  DON T -- 


      Dejected, Kolchak shuffles through McManus  out-of-focus 
      pictures, like if he looked at them enough, the whole thing 
      would finally make sense.  Vincenzo approaches.

                                  VINCENZO
                    You missed the press conference 
                    today, Kolchak.  Lucky for me, Reed 
                    was there to cover your ass.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What was the big announcement?

                                  VINCENZO
                    The victim found in the alley, and 
                    the ones on the mountain trail, 
                    were all killed by the same person.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We already knew that!

                                  VINCENZO
                    But we didn t know that s what they 
                    were going to say.  That s why it s 
                    important to go to these things.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I guess there isn t any, but ...

                                  VINCENZO
                    Don t, Carl.  I knew this monster 
                    thing was just a phase you needed 
                    to get through. Now that you have, 
                    you can focus on this serial killer 
                    piece.  It s a big, juicy story a 
                    good reporter like you can really 
                    sink his teeth into.

      Kolchak s eyes suddenly widen.  He hurriedly flips through 
    the pictures, finding the one he s searching for -- an 
      extreme close-up of ... a bite mark?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s it!  I couldn t see it 
                    before, because I didn t know what 
                    I was looking at.  It s a bite 
                    mark!  You can even make out the 
                    space in the two front teeth.

                                  VINCENZO
                    Looks more like a butterfly to me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If he was telling the truth, he was 
                    bit by the Park Ranger!

                                  VINCENZO
                    The Park Ranger?  Reed is out on an 
                    interview with him right now.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Tony, call the cops!  Send them 
                    over there!

      Kolchak sprints towards the elevators.

                                  VINCENZO
                    Why?!

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Exactly!


      Kolchak rushes in, but suddenly stops.  Before him is a 
      tableau of criminal arrest:  Several police officers have 
      their guns aimed at the Park Ranger, squirming face down on 
    the floor, as Reed restrains his arm behind his back, while 
      grinding her knee into his spine.  The Sheriff is cuffing 
      him.  McManus stands off to the side flashing pictures.

      Everyone freezes, and looks over at Kolchak.  He pauses, 
      before pointing at the Ranger.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    He s the killer.

      A beat, then everyone resumes their actions.  The Police lift 
    the Ranger off the floor, and start escorting him out.  As he 
      passes by Kolchak --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why d you do it?

                                  RANGER
                    Why?  Why not?

    As they remove him, Kolchak approaches Reed, who is jotting 
      down notes, and  kissing  the cuts on her knuckles.

                                  REED
                    It s like I was telling you all 
                    along, Kolchak -- it wasn t some 
                    weird monster that was killing and 
                    devouring these people, it was just 
                    a normal, human being.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I had Tony call the cops when I 
                    figured out he was the killer.

                                  MCMANUS

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How d you figure out he did it?

                    We got the tests back from that 
                    shirt you stole.  The blood on it 
                    came from the victim found in the a

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Well, that s not figuring it out -- 
                    that s hard evidence.  That s 
                      practically cheating.

                                  REED
                    I kept my appointed interview with 
                    him, and started pinning him down 
                    with some innocuous question.  Just 
                    before the police arrived, he 
                    figured out I was on to him, and he 
                    went after us.

                                  MCMANUS

                          (shrugs modestly)
                    A reporter can t be content just 
                    writing about crime.  Sometimes, 
                    you got to bust some heads.  

                                  MCMANUS
                    Hey, how d you figure out he was 
                    the killer?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It only occurred to me after 
                    interviewing the monster.

                                  REED
                    You finally found him, huh?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Yeah, and wait  til you hear his 
                    story.  He was already a --

                    Save it, Kolchak.  I ve got an 
                    exclusive to write.  Besides, this 
                    stinks of human interest to me. 

    She struts out, and McManus, throwing more karate chops, 
      follows her, leaving Kolchak in the room alone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
