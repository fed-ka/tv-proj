      MIKE TALKING HEAD (LIVING ROOM)

      CLOSE ON MIKE BURNABY as he talks directly to camera.

                                    MIKE
                    My name is Mike Burnaby.  I was lead
                    anchor of the WNBC 5 O'Clock News
                    until I stepped away five years ago. 
                    The great thing is, now I get to
                    spend more time with my fam-- 

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    Dad, you're moving too much.  I've
                    got to zoom out and start again.    

                                    MIKE
                    You could shoot me from across the
                    street and it still wouldn't matter.

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    Maybe if you had gotten me a phone
                    with an image stabilizer...  

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah, that would cure it.

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    Can you sit on your hands or something?

                                    MIKE
                    Then my legs just go.  Are you new?

      IAN TALKING HEAD (GRAHAM'S OLD ROOM)

      An annoyed IAN BURNABY (19, smart, driven, overly confident)
      addresses the camera in a tiny Lego-themed kid's room.

                                    IAN
                    Why do I have to state my name?

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    Ian!

                                    IAN
                    There.  It's on the record now.
                          (off Eve's look, then)
                    Fine.  How would I describe Dad? 
                    He's from Pennsylvania, not as funny
                    as he thinks he is, he's read every
                    book ever, wears hats like they just
                    fell off a shelf in a store and
                    whatever way it landed on his head
                    he just keeps it like that--
                          (off Eve's "Come on!")
                    What?  Oh yeah, he's got Parkinson's.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  2.

      LEIGH TALKING HEAD (LEIGH'S APARTMENT)

      LEIGH BURNABY (39ish, narcissist, always single and jobless) 
      sits on a couch in her perfectly nice one bedroom apartment.

                                      LEIGH
                    Do you have a soft filter on that?
                          (looks off camera, sighs, then)
                    Mike's a generous big brother.  To a 
                    point.  Like he helps me pay rent on 
                    an apartment in the building, but 
                    it's in the basement.
                          (points to half-windows behind her)
                    They don't let any light in, but 
                    pervs can watch me walk around nak-- 
                    Why haven't I seen anyone lately?

      As Leigh reacts, disappointed... 

      ANNIE TALKING HEAD (CRAFTING ROOM)

      ANNIE BURNABY (40s, tough, loyal, goofy side) grades papers 
      on a crafting table as GRAHAM (8, old soul, self-possessed, 
      not precocious) uses dowels to make walrus tusks nearby. 

                                      ANNIE
                    What about Dad?  
                          (smiles, with clear affection)
                    He's been my husband of... Shit, has 
                    it been twenty years?
                          (JUMP CUT TO ANOTHER TAKE)
                    Mike has always been about family. 
                    So much so that he kept lobbying me
                    to have a third.  Of course, he was
                    working sixteen hours a day, so most
                    of the parenting fell to me.  But I
                    went back to work last fall, 
                          (re: Graham knocking over papers)
                    so now this is all him.

      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Mike makes dinner in a lived-in, comfortable Upper West Side 
      apartment.  Annie hurries in from the foyer.

                                      ANNIE
                    Sorry, there was a never-ending staff 
                    meeting after school.  

                                    MIKE
                          (gives Annie a sweet kiss)
                    And now you're all better.

                                      ANNIE
                    Not really.  But thanks.

      EVE (15, whip-smart, unconventional, games the system) enters.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  3.


                                    MIKE
                    Great, we're all home at the same 
                    time.  We can have an actual sit-down 
                    meal--

      Eve takes a bite of pasta right out of a serving bowl.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    No.  No more standing meals!  For 
                    one second we're going to unplug and--

      Ian hustles in, interrupting Mike.

                                    IAN
                    Garlic bread.  Good.  Mom, hit me.

      Annie tosses Ian a piece of garlic bread and he takes a bite.

                                    MIKE
                    I know I'm saying words... Am I a 
                    ghost?  Someone take a swing at me.

      Graham enters and uses the door of the dishwasher as a seat.  

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Really?  There's a dining room just 
                    steps away.  I'm looking at it now.

      It's useless; Mike joins in as they pass food back and forth.

                                      ANNIE
                    How's your English project coming, Eve? 

                                    EVE
                    Why do you have to teach at my school?

                                      ANNIE
                    The question is why do you go to my 
                    school?  On paper you should be at 
                    military school by now.

                                    EVE
                          (not taking bait, to Ian)
                    What'd you do for the King Lear 
                    project when you had Mr. Diaz?

                                    IAN
                    Huh.  I'm not sure I can remember--
                          (whimsical laugh)
                    It was actually pretty clever.  You're 
                    familiar with venn diagrams, right?

                                    EVE
                    Stop.  Can I copy it or not?

                      MIKE/ANNIEIAN
        No./No!No one will believe you 
                                                    did it.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  4.

      Leigh enters, dressed in a trendy, sexy outfit. 

                                      LEIGH
                    Let's go, Evie.  The concert's in an 
                    hour and this lady needs to pre-game.

      We can't see Leigh's chest, but everyone REACTS to it.

                                    MIKE
                    Whoa, there are young children here.

                                    IAN
                          (smiling)
                    Hey, Aunt Leigh.

                                      LEIGH
                          (hands over her chest)
                    You catch more flies with honey. 

                                    MIKE
                    Are you trying to give the flies 
                    diabetes?

                                    EVE
                    I'll let you borrow a bra, Aunt Leigh.

                                      LEIGH
                    You're cute.  That'd be like trying 
                    to catch a missile with a butterfly 
                    net.  I'll grab one on the way out.  
                          (starting off)
                    And stop calling me "Aunt Leigh."  
                    Tonight we're sisters.

                                    MIKE
                    You girls better be home by 10:30.

      Both Eve and Leigh GROAN like teens as they exit.  Mike turns 
      back to eat, but Annie and Ian are already walking off.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                      Seriously?!  It's been three minutes.

                    ANNIEIAN
        This skirt is cutting They're trading in Tokyo.  
        me in half.

      As everyone disappears, a frustrated Mike sits on the 
      dishwasher door next to Graham.

                                    MIKE
                    At least we can enjoy a meal together.

                                      GRAHAM
                    I already ate.

      Then the dishwasher door collapses. 

                                  END OF COLD OPEN      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  5.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

      Annie stalks down the hall, on a mission.

                                      ANNIE
                    LET'S GO!  Why do I have to do this 
                    every morning?  Why are you making 
                    me be this woman?

      Annie throws Eve's door open but Eve just MOANS and burrows 
      deeper into her bed.  Then Annie stalks into Ian's old room, 
      where Graham lazes about on a comfortable queen-sized bed.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Sorry, there's just so much bed.

                                      ANNIE
                    LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!!!

                                    IAN (O.S.)
                    STOP YELLING!   

      INT. GRAHAM'S OLD ROOM - SAME TIME

      Ian sits on a race car bed as he tries to work on a laptop.

                                    IAN (O.S.)
                    THIS IS A WORKPLACE!  

      Ian sees Mike pass by the doorway.

                                    IAN (CONT'D)
                    You never had to drag me out of bed, 
                    Dad.  These kids have no work ethic.

                                    MIKE
                    Said the college drop-out.

      IAN TALKING HEAD (GRAHAM'S OLD ROOM)

      A cramped Ian struggles to set up a printer/fax, to camera:  

                                    IAN
                    I didn't "drop out."  Drop-outs don't 
                    have business plans.  I opted out of 
                    college so I could revolutionize the 
                    search engine. 

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    What's wrong with Google?

                                    IAN
                    What's wrong with asbestos?  Wait 
                    and see.  Just wait.

      Ian knocks over a Lego robot.  As he tries to rebuild it:       MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  6.

                                    IAN (CONT'D)
                    After freshman year, I interned at
                    Bing -- to learn what not to do.  I
                    got back two weeks ago to find out
                    my parents let Graham take over my
                    room.  It's big, it's got an actual
                    desk, and it's at the end of the
                    hall where a man can self-incubate a
                    start-up in peace.
                          (getting into playing Legos)
                    Where's a three-by-two?  I need an 
                    orange three-by-two.

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Annie drags Graham out of his room as he clings to his 
      brother's sheets.  Mike approaches, proud.  

                                    MIKE
                    He's badger-strong, right?  

                                      ANNIE
                    I need you to take the kids to school.  
                    I've got thirty poems to grade before 
                    Senior English.

                                    MIKE
                    How do you grade poems?

                                      ANNIE
                    Harshly.  The world doesn't need more 
                    terrible poetry.  I'm the firewall.

                                    MIKE
                    To give wings to dreams.

                                      ANNIE
                    See, that sucks.  I'd give you a D.

      Annie gives Mike a quick kiss and rushes off.  Eve approaches, 
      still groggy, in Carhartt coveralls and bright red lipstick.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you going to get dressed for 
                    school, or...
                          (Eve punches him, playful)
                    How could you hit a man in my condition?

      MIKE TALKING HEAD (LIVING ROOM)

                                    MIKE
                    I'm actually doing much better now. 
                      Medication has improved dramatically,
                    or at least I've found a cocktail
                    that seems to work for me.  Of course,
                    if there's a long line at Starbucks,
                    I might amplify things a little.

      Mike picks up a Starbucks coffee cup and takes a sip.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  7.

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

      As they get ready to go, Mike puts on a baseball cap, paying 
      no attention to the awkward way it sits on his head. 

                                    MIKE
                    Okay, let's boogie.

                                    EVE
                    So you're gonna just let it...

                                    MIKE
                    What?

                                    EVE
                    Nothing.  

      EXT. VARIOUS UPPER WEST SIDE LOCATIONS - LATER

      On AMSTERDAM, random passersby recognize Mike as he walks 
      with Eve and Graham.  A CONSTRUCTION WORKER shouts out: 

                                      CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                    Mike Burnaby!  5 O'Clock news!  Love 
                    you, bro!

      Mike flashes his affable smile, then tries to connect with 
      Eve (typing on her phone) and Graham (playing a video game).  

                                    MIKE
                    What do you have first period, Eve?  
                    French, right?  Oui?  Non?  

      Eve ignores Mike, taking a photo of the street with her phone.

                                    EVE
                    I've got to Instagram this.

                                    MIKE
                    Of course.  What would the world do 
                    without an old-timey photo of a dirty 
                    hot dog bun?

                                    EVE
                    It's a metaphor.

                                    MIKE
                    For why we should've never given you 
                    a phone?

                                      GRAHAM
                          (amazed, re: video game)
                    My guy just can't be killed.  And 
                    his head is like, off.

                                    MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mike Burnaby!  World's greatest man.

      Mike turns, assuming it's another fan, to see HARRIS GREEN 
      (47, his friend and former boss) exiting BARNEY GREENGRASS.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  8.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, Harris.  

                                      HARRIS
                          (re: kids on their phones)
                    Aren't you worried they're going to 
                    fall into a couple open manholes?

                                    MIKE
                    Then I don't have to pay for college.

                                      HARRIS
                          (mussing Graham's hair)
                    You're getting tall, Graham.  Like 
                      not-Mike's-son tall... I'm worried.  

                                    EVE
                          (off Mike's elbow prompt)
                    Hi, Harris.

                                      HARRIS
                    Evie.  
                          (re: her coveralls)
                    I see you're trying to bring all the
                    boys to the yard.

                                    EVE
                    Come on, this is cool.  And I can
                    also drive an ice road truck.

                                      HARRIS
                    I'll walk with you guys.  I've got to
                    get downtown.  There's a press
                      conference at ten.  The city's trying
                    to ban foot-long sandwiches now.

                                    MIKE
                    I saw that.  Do me a favor and don't
                    just show a bunch of obese pedestrians
                    with their faces blurred out.  It's
                    creepy.  Pull tape on the special we
                    did in '05.  That was journalism.

      THROUGH LINCOLN CENTER, Mike's still energized by work talk: 

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Know what else you've got to change? 
                    Susan's new sign-off.  "Find Your
                    Happy?"  Is she selling yoga retreats? 
                    We used to cover wars.

      A passing MUSICIAN carrying a violin case calls out:

                                      MUSICIAN
                    Mike Burnaby!  Miss you!  Keep fighting!  

      Mike smiles and puts up his dukes.  Eve rolls her eyes; this
      happens all the time when she's out with her dad.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  9.

                                      HARRIS
                    He's not the only one who misses 
                    you, Mike.  We all do.  You should 
                    come back to work.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you forgetting why I left?  
                    Remember the rolling chair thing?

                                      HARRIS
                    You're way better now.  Plus, I sprung 
                    for wheel locks.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't want a pity job.  We both 
                    know if I come back, NBC's going to 
                    milk it for ratings by showing me in 
                    slow motion with lame uplifting music.

                                      HARRIS
                    As long as I'm news director, that
                    will not happen.  Just think about
                    it.  We need you, Mike.  No one
                    watches the news anymore.  We got
                    beaten by Craft Wars last night. 
                    That's literally watching paint dry.

      Before Mike can respond, he's hugged by a FEMALE MTA WORKER.

                                    MTA WORKER
                    Mike Burnaby!  You're a brave man.

                                    EVE
                    Would a "brave man" set his grown 
                      daughter's curfew for 10:30?

                                    MTA WORKER
                          (glares at Eve, hands Mike paper)
                    Could you sign this?  My grandma has 
                      Parkinson's.

      EVE TALKING HEAD (EVE'S ROOM)

      Eve films herself in a messy, impulsively decorated room.

                                    EVE
                    Yes, my dad is a celebrity and people
                    love him, blah, blah, but why does
                    everyone have to stop and tell him
                    about another person who also has
                      Parkinson's?  Alcoholism is a disease. 
                    Do people go up to Joe Namath and
                    tell him about their crazy uncles?

      INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

      MR. DIAZ (late 30s, handsome, good teacher) settles down his 
      10th grade English class.  Eve goofs-off in the back.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  10.

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    Time for King Lear updates.  Eve, 
                    where are you?

                                    EVE
                          (caught off guard)
                    Sophomore English?

      A few kids LAUGH.  Eve doesn't mind; it's the role she plays.

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    Please tell me you started your project.

                                    EVE
                          (a beat, stalling)
                    Of course I have.  I am doing a video...

      Eve sees Annie pass by in the hall and gets an idea.

                                    EVE (CONT'D)
                    On another tragic family: The Burnabys.  
                          (off Diaz' look, pouring it on)
                    I just think if I could compare my 
                    Dad's struggles to King Lear's, it 
                    could be a way to start the healing.

      Students comfort Eve; she looks to see if Diaz is buying it.

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    Sounds good.  It's due Thursday.  

      As Mr. Diaz calls on another student, Eve cracks a smile.

      EVE TALKING HEAD (EVE'S ROOM)

      Eve props her iPhone on her desk, then sits down to address 
      the camera.  NOTE: This is how Eve recorded the talking heads 
      we've seen so far, which were all filmed after this point.

                                    EVE
                    King Lear is driven to madness.  And
                    his children suffer as a result.  As
                    we all know, my father has a "brain
                      sickness," too.  One that has torn my
                    family apart-- nah, not buying it. 
                          (JUMP CUT, another take)
                    It's ironic that this project is on 
                      Shakespeare, because "shaking" is a 
                    daily reality in my house-- hacky.

      We hear BANGING:

      INT. GRAHAM'S OLD ROOM - SAME TIME (LATE NIGHT)

      Ian pounds on the wall he shares with Eve as he tries to 
      sleep in the race car bed.  His legs dangle over the edge. 

                                    IAN
                    Some people have to work in the 
                    morning!      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  11.

      INT. IAN'S OLD ROOM - SAME TIME

      Graham pauses his X-Box game and crosses to a mini-fridge, 
      where he gets a Gatorade and takes a long, satisfied sip.

      INT. MIKE AND ANNIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

      Mike sits in bed with an iPad, watching a YOUTUBE CLIP of 
      his last broadcast as anchor of the 5 O'Clock News: 

                                    MIKE (ON VIDEO CLIP)
                    If Parkinson's has taught me anything,
                    it's that you can't control everything. 
                    So for all of you: try to face each
                    challenge with optimism, because if
                    you spend time worrying about the
                    worst case scenario and it happens,
                    you've lived it twice.  And with that,
                    I leave you the same way I have every
                    night for the last eleven years: Stay
                    informed, New York.  

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    That so kills "Find your happy."

      ON THE VIDEO, Mike rolls completely off camera in his chair. 
      Annie heads out of the bathroom to see what Mike's watching.

                                      ANNIE
                    If you're "definitely not going back," 
                    why do you have that thing on repeat?

                                    MIKE
                    I'm just driving up the number of 
                    hits.  Did you know a Levitra ad 
                    plays in front of it now?

                                      ANNIE
                    What's Levitra?

                                    MIKE
                    I love that you don't know.

                                      ANNIE
                    So you said no?  Just like that? 

                                    MIKE
                    I'd just be a feel-good story to
                    them.  Do I really want to be the
                    guy who gets standing ovations at
                    work everyday?

                                      ANNIE
                    Uch, standing ovations.  The only
                    thing I hate more than standing
                    ovations are hot stone massages.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                          (before Mike protests)
                    It just seems like you've been going
                    a bit stir crazy lately.  

                                    MIKE
                    That's because no one's ever around! 
                    When I left, the silver lining was
                    spending more time with the family. 
                    But then you started teaching again
                    and the kids got their own things. 
                    Now I'm just alone up here, waiting
                    on deliveries.

                                      ANNIE
                    I hear your complaint, and I honor
                    it.  New paragraph: you have to be
                    home from eleven to six to sign for
                    a new dishwasher.  Someone tried to
                    use the old one as a chair.

                                    MIKE
                    See?  All I do is sign for stuff.

                                      ANNIE
                    It's not just signing.  You've got
                    to make sure they connect the water
                    line to the main furnace line, not
                    the sink filter, but they're housed
                    in identical PVC tubing, so--
                          (off Mike's panicked look)
                    I'll leave you a note.

                                    MIKE
                    Why do you make me do these things?

                                      ANNIE
                          (flirty)
                    I can make it up to you.  
                          (kisses him, then pulls back)
                    When was the last time you took your 
                      medication?  

                                    MIKE
                    Not since this morning.

                                      ANNIE
                    Great, I don't have to do all the work. 

      Annie kisses Mike as they get under the covers.  

      INT. KITCHEN - NEXT AFTERNOON

      Annie and Leigh try out different looks with Leigh's hair. 

                                      LEIGH
                    I don't know, it feels like bangs 
                    are for heavy people.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  13.

                                      ANNIE
                    I have bangs.

                                      LEIGH
                    You're the exception that proves the 
                    rule.  Although this is always your 
                    biggest season, if I'm just being real.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Mike observing this.  Eve's there, too, 
      filming everything with her iPhone camera.

                                    MIKE
                    This is why I have to stay home?  So 
                    you can babysit a haircut?

                                      ANNIE
                    I'm going for moral support.

      ANNIE TALKING HEAD (MIKE AND ANNIE'S ROOM)

                                      ANNIE
                    Some people escape by watching trashy 
                    reality shows.  I watch Leigh.  Same 
                    train wreck, but she's on every day 
                    of the week.

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                      LEIGH
                    This isn't just some haircut.  It's 
                    a symbol of my mortality.  At the 
                    concert last night, some idiot asked 
                    if I was Eve's mom.  

                                    MIKE
                    Did this idiot have eyes, ears, and 
                    the ability to process information?

      As Leigh rambles, Mike struggles to open a jar of pickles. 

                                      LEIGH
                    I know it's hard for you to step
                    outside your charmed life and see
                    other people's challenges, but I'm
                    about to turn thirty-nine.  I mean,
                    five-- whatever I've established...

      When Graham crosses in, Mike pulls him over with his leg and 
      hands him the pickle jar.  Without saying a word, Graham 
      opens it and Mike sends him off with a pat on the butt.

                                      LEIGH (CONT'D)
                    ...I have less eggs inside me than a 
                      Bennigan's.  Because they don't serve 
                      breakfast, Mike!  Are you even 
                    listening to me?

                                    MIKE
                    No.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  14.

      Before Mike can get it, Leigh grabs the only pickle in the 
      jar and takes a bite.  As she heads out with Annie, Leigh 
      tosses the rest of the pickle in the trash.  Then, judgmental:

                                      LEIGH
                    You guys should really compost.

                                    MIKE
                          (sighs, then re: Eve filming)
                    What're you doing this for again?

                                    EVE
                    School.  But I'll totally stop if you 
                    don't want me to apply myself.

      INT. LIVING ROOM/FOYER - LATER

      Mike reads the paper and drinks a soda.  The DOORBELL RINGS.  

                                    MIKE
                    Hello?  Is anybody going to get that?
                          (a beat, another DOORBELL RING)
                    Why, yes, that would be you, Mike.  
                    And now you're talking to yourself.

      Annoyed, Mike sets his soda down and goes to open the door.  
      It's two RUSSIAN DELIVERY GUYS, with a new dishwasher.

                                      RUSSIAN DELIVERY GUY
                    Mike Burnabies!  "Stay Informs!"

      Mike leads the guys inside, leaving the front door ajar.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Mike searches for something as the delivery guys follow him.

                                    MIKE
                    Where's that note?  She left a note.

      Mike passes by where he was sitting and we see he set his 
      soda on Annie's note -- the whole thing is wet and smudged.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                          (as he strains to read note)
                    Does that say "gravy?"  Why would it 
                    say "gravy?" 

      MIKE TALKING HEAD (MIKE AND ANNIE'S ROOM)

                                    MIKE
                    I have advanced degrees, I've won 
                    awards, I've been to Tikrit.  But 
                    this stuff makes my head explode.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

      Mike picks up a landline and starts to dial.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  15.

                                    MIKE
                    I'll try her cell.  That's my Peabody.
                          (points to award, then into phone)
                    911?  What?  No, there's no emergency.  
                    I was trying to dial 917 but I'm 
                    waiting for my drugs to kick in, so-- 
                    No!  I'm fine!  Never mind.

      INT. FOYER/KITCHEN - LATER

      TWO COPS enter through the open front door.  They head into 
      the kitchen to see Mike squirming under the sink.  The Russian 
      delivery guys stand over him. 

                                    MIKE
                    I give up!  I GIVE UP!

      Chaos breaks out as the cops draw their guns and advance on
      the delivery guys.  As they AD LIB confrontation in English
      and Russian, Mike hops up and brokers a peace:

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Stop!  Nyet!  I'm fine!  I said I
                    was fine on the phone!

                                    COP
                    Doesn't matter.  We gotta respond. 
                    Better safe than sorry.

                                    MIKE
                    I called forty five minutes ago.  If
                    there was an actual emergency, we're
                    squarely in the "sorry" category.

                                    COP
                    It's not us, it's the new call system. 
                    This is what a two billion dollar
                    upgrade gets you.  Thank you, Mr.
                    Mayor.  But since we're already here,
                    you mind signing an autograph?  My
                    uncle's got Alzheimer's.

                                    MIKE
                      I actually have Parkinson's.

                                    COP
                    Either way.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

      Mike makes another call, carefully dialing with a pencil
      this time.  Then, into phone:

                                    MIKE
                    Harris.  It's Mike.  Talk to me about
                    these wheel locks.

                                  END OF ACT ONE      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  16.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Leigh and Annie drink wine as Mike makes dinner.  Graham
      drinks a Gatorade as he helps his dad.  Eve is filming again.

                                      LEIGH
                          (playing with her hair)
                    I just feel lighter, you know? 
                      Emotionally and physically.

                                    MIKE
                    You got your hair cut?  It's exactly
                    the same.

                                      LEIGH
                          (hurt, to Annie, re: Mike)
                    How did you marry him?  Does he ever
                    tell you you're pretty? 

                                    MIKE
                          (ignoring this, calls off)
                    Ian, come in here!

                                    EVE
                    Ooh, do that again, but say "Ian, I
                    need help!"  And shake it up a little.

      As Mike reacts to this, Ian enters and sees Graham's Gatorade.

                                    IAN
                    Is that from my mini-fridge?

                                      GRAHAM
                    I thought it came with the room.

                                    MIKE
                    Okay, I've got to tell you all
                      something, but I don't want you to
                    get angry, or scared, or confused.
                          (then, delicately)
                    I'm thinking about going back to work.  

                                    EVE 
                    Awesome.  When do you start?

                                    MIKE
                    I said I'm thinking about it.

                                    IAN
                    With two salaries coming in, you
                    could probably help me rent an office.

                                      GRAHAM
                          (as he eats from a serving bowl)
                    Is Mom gonna start making dinners?  
                                      (MORE)      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  17.

                                      GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    Dinners that aren't pasta?  It's
                    always pasta.

                                    MIKE
                    No one's even a little upset?  I get
                    hugs on the street from strangers.

                                      ANNIE
                    Sorry, but we're kind of happy you're 
                    getting out of the house.  

                                      LEIGH
                          (also eating)
                    Kind of?

                                      ANNIE
                    You've been driving us all a little 
                    crazy lately.

                                    MIKE
                    What?!  That's nuts.

      As Mike takes a bite of food, he looks around and realizes 
      they're having another standing meal.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Damn it!  We're doing it again!  
                    Eve, spit that out.  

      EXT. NEWS STATION - NEXT MORNING

      Mike takes in the old building, unsure of what he's about to 
      do, until Harris hurries out.

                                      HARRIS
                    There he is!  
                          (giving Mike a big, dramatic hug)
                    Welcome home, my friend.

                                    MIKE
                    This is an exploratory meeting.

                                      HARRIS
                    Of course.  No one knows you're here.

      INT. NEWS STATION - CONTINUOUS 

      As they head inside, STAFF MEMBERS give Mike a STANDING 
      OVATION.  Mike waves to everyone, then shoots Harris a look.

                                      HARRIS
                    I lied.  They love you man.  The 
                    world just loves you.

      Mike AD LIBS greetings to a few COLLEAGUES until he's 
      approached by KAY (24, sweet, hardworking, emotional).      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  18.

                                    KAY
                    Welcome back, Mr. Burnaby.  I'm Kay, 
                    your new segment producer.

                                    MIKE
                    Potential new segment producer.

                                    KAY
                    Right.  I've got to earn it.  And I 
                    will.  Because being a part of this, 
                    to call it inspirational is just--

      Kay breaks off as she gets emotional. 

                                    MIKE
                    Are you crying?  Is she crying?

      As they start down a hallway, they pass MATT LAUER.

                                    MATT LAUER
                    There's the man of the hour.

                                    MIKE
                    Matty.  Why are you slumming it down 
                    here at the affiliate?  On your way 
                    to a teeth whitening?

      MIKE TALKING HEAD (LIVING ROOM)

                                    MIKE
                    Matt Lauer and I have always had a
                    rivalry.  We were both young, talented
                    mavericks who came up around the
                    same time.  Some of us still have
                    our hair.  Either guy could've gotten
                    the gig at The Today Show, but to
                    me, doing hard news was always more
                    important to me than talking about
                      guilt-free smoothies.

                    Matt Lauer has a private jet, Dad.  

                                    MIKE
                    I have integrity.

                                    EVE (O.S.)
                    Can your integrity fly us to Sao 
                    Paulo for dinner? 

      INT. NEWS STATION - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                    MATT
                      I actually just recorded something 
                    for your welcome back promo.

                                    MIKE
                    Potential welcome back promo, but 
                    that is thoughtful.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  19.

                                    MATT
                    Of course.  Great to have you back.

      Matt Lauer walks off, nice as can be.  Harris and Kay start 
      off down the hallway again.  Mike follows.

                                    MIKE
                    There's a promo?!

                                      HARRIS
                    Alright, fine: I was straight-up
                    assuming you'd come back.  I saw you
                    out on the street, basically mannying
                    your kids.  It was sad.

                                    MIKE
                      "Mannying?"  It's called fatherhood. 
                    And most men don't spend their lives
                    trying to avoid it.

                                      HARRIS
                    Over thirty years of lovemaking and
                    not one slip-up.  Not even a scare.

                                    MIKE
                    Pride comes before the fall.

                                      HARRIS
                    Things happen for a reason, Mike. 
                    Us running into each other at Barney
                      Greengrass?  And then you talking my
                    face off about work?  It was fate. 
                    News is in your blood, man.  You
                    need us just as much as we need you.

                                    MIKE
                    That's not true.

      They've arrived at the 5 O'Clock News set.

                                      HARRIS
                    Hey, it's your old anchor chair.  Go
                    ahead, give it a spin.

      Mike gives Harris a look -- he knows what he's up to.

                                      HARRIS (CONT'D)
                    Fine. 
                          (sitting in the chair)
                    Look at this.  Am I moving?  Not an 
                    inch.  Reaching for a pen, 
                      unnecessarily shuffling papers, 
                    throwing it to weather -- locked in...

      EXT. 86TH STREET - SAME TIME

      Annie and the kids enjoy donuts at a classic NYC coffee stand.  
      They can't eat fast enough; it's like they've been in prison.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  20.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Can we always eat breakfast here?

                                      ANNIE
                    If Dad starts going in early like 
                    this, probably.

                                    EVE
                          (sarcastic)
                    I'm really going to miss his "healthy 
                      scrambles."

                                    IAN
                    They're always over-salted.  
                          (mimes shaking salt)
                    He just shakes, and shakes.

                                    EVE
                    You're better than that.

                                    IAN
                    But he sure can scramble those eggs.

                                    EVE
                    There you go.

                                      ANNIE
                          (re: Ian drinking)
                    How can you chug hot coffee?

                                    IAN
                    How can I not?  I sleep in a baby's
                    bed!  I'm done, Mom.  I can't rethink
                      technology in a closet.  It's right
                    off the kitchen, the Legos are
                      distracting, and Eve's next door,
                    blasting her garbage music.

                                    EVE
                          (pointed)
                    You like Maroon 5.

                                    IAN
                    I like Adam Levine!  He's just got 
                    it.  He does.  End of story.
                          (then, back on Annie)
                    Either make Graham give me my old 
                    room back or let me take over your 
                    crafting room.

                                      ANNIE
                    But where would I craft?

      ANNIE TALKING HEAD (CRAFTING ROOM)

      Annie talks to camera in the well-stocked, medium-sized room.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  21.

                                      ANNIE
                    Every woman loves to craft.  In the
                    nine years I've had this room, I've
                    never actually made anything, but
                    just the idea of having it mellows
                    me out. 
                          (looks around)
                    Look at all this stuff.  If I actually 
                    liked to craft, I could make anything.

      EXT. 86TH STREET - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                    IAN
                    When was the last time you crafted?

                                      ANNIE
                    My hobbies are not on trial here. 
                    You decided to drop out.  When you
                    left for college, which we paid for,
                    you renounced all habitation rights. 
                    As a child who actually belongs in
                    the apartment, Graham has dibs.

                                    IAN
                          (a beat, to Graham)
                    I'll make you a 10% shareholder.

                                      GRAHAM
                    In what?

                                    IAN
                    My company.  YouSearch.  "Searching 
                    at the Speed of You."

                                      GRAHAM
                          (sweetly)
                    No thanks.

                                    IAN
                    Fine.  I'm off to work at the public 
                    library, like a drifter.

                                    EVE
                          (as Ian stalks off, to Annie)
                    It's always something with him, right?

                                      ANNIE
                    What about you?  I heard you signed-
                    out a TV for your presentation today.  
                    What sort of bullshit project did you 
                    talk Mr. Diaz into letting you do?

                                    EVE
                    Whatever happened to teacher/student 
                      confidentiality?

                                      ANNIE
                    That's not a thing.  It'll never be 
                    a thing.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  22.

      INT. NEWS STATION - LATER

      Mike meets with Harris and Kay in a room off the main studio.

                                    KAY
                    ...your first segment should be a
                    return to the kind of investigative
                    reporting you were famous for: out
                    on the street, hustling -- the guy
                    who always finds the story.
                          (catching herself, sweet)
                    That's if you're up for being on 
                    location.  Maybe you can do your 
                    stand-up sitting down.

                                    MIKE
                    Or you could just carry me.

                                    KAY
                    I'll wear sneakers.

                                      HARRIS
                    You can do anything you want, Mike. 
                    Like politics, or Panda at the Zoo,
                    or overcoming personal obstacles. 
                    Hey, overcoming personal obstacles. 
                    I'd do that one.

                                    MIKE
                    Harris, if I come back, it's for the 
                    news.  Not to exploit this.  

                                      HARRIS
                      I wouldn't have it any other way.

      In the b.g. a MONITOR begins to play Mike's WELCOME BACK 
      PROMO.  We see footage of his final broadcast, only now it's 
      in SLOW MOTION, accompanied by "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias. 

                                    MIKE
                    That's it.  I'm out.

                                      HARRIS
                    What?!  I brought in Lauer!

      As Mike stalks off, Kay bursts into tears.

      INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME

      Eve screens the end of her video project for her class.  On 
      a TV MONITOR we see a talking head she recorded in her room:

                                    EVE (ON TV)
                    Although my dad has experienced
                    enormous tragedy in his life -- just
                    getting out of bed each day is a
                    living miracle -- he bravely soldiers
                    on, and that makes him a hero.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  23.

      ON THE TV, Eve picks up a KEYTAR and starts performing "Hero" 
      by Enrique Iglesias.  Then we see a SLOW MOTION SHOT of Mike 
      trying to open the jar of pickles.  The BELL RINGS and 
      students APPLAUD.  Eve starts off with the others.

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    Eve, hang back a sec.
                          (as a satisfied Eve sits on a desk)
                    Great job editing that together. 
                    Those wipe transitions-- first you're
                    looking at one thing and it just
                    peels away and then you're looking
                    at something else.  Wow.

                                    EVE
                    Well, thanks for giving me the
                      opportunity to tell a story--

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    I'm failing you.

                                    EVE
                    What?

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    F.  That was a puff piece.  And it
                    had no connection to King Lear. 

                                    EVE
                    I called myself a modern day Cordelia.

                                    MR. DIAZ
                    Stop.  You had a chance to really
                    reflect on your family -- what your
                    dad's been through, what you've been
                    through -- but you just held up a
                    phone.  
                          (grabbing his bag)
                    Maybe I was wrong about the whole
                        smart-girl-who-could-be-amazing-if-
                      she-applied-herself thing.  Because
                    if you were really bright, you'd
                    know now's the time to apply yourself. 

      As Mr. Diaz exits, Eve notices that her video is still
      playing.  ON THE TV: Over POORLY TYPED CREDITS, Eve performs
      "One" by U2, with new lyrics:

                                    EVE (ON TV)
                    One dad.  One diagnosis.  One disease 
                    and guess what, destiny chose us!  
                    One dad, but he's still the same...

      Eve heads over and turns off the TV, ashamed.

                                  END OF ACT TWO      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  24.

                                      ACT THREE

      INT. CRAFTING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

      Annie works on a fall-themed centerpiece.  Mike enters.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, a gargoyle.

                                      ANNIE
                    It's not a gargoyle, it's a 
                      centerpiece.

                                    MIKE
                    For a table in a home?
                          (looking closer at centerpiece)
                    I'm seeing a lot of rape imagery 
                    here.  I know people call you "my 
                    rock," but you're clearly working 
                    out some issues.

                                      ANNIE
                    You're crazy...
                          (looks at it, chilled, then)
                    How was your meeting?

                                    MIKE
                    Awful.  They already cut a promo
                    showing me in slow-motion.  When
                    they run footage of you in slow-
                    motion, it means you're either dead
                    or under indictment. 

                                      ANNIE
                    Or you just lost American Idol.

                                    MIKE
                    They're only interested in "Mike the 
                    poor son-of-a-bitch," not "Mike the 
                    newsman."  I should've never gone 
                    down there.  
                          (off Annie not responding)
                    Right?  You're not saying anything.

                                      ANNIE
                    What do you want me to say?  Of course
                    they're going to pity you.  You've
                    got an incurable brain disease! 
                    People care about what's happened to
                    you, Mike.  Those hugs on the street
                    are real.  And if you think you can
                    manage how everyone expresses that,
                    you're going to have two diseases. 

                                    MIKE
                    You're supposed to say, "They suck, 
                    honey, I love you."      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  25.

                                      ANNIE
                    Do what you want, but it's not a promo
                    that's scaring you off.  You're just
                    not sure if you can do it anymore.
                    And I get that.  But aren't you always
                    talking about giving up control?

      As Mike considers this, Annie reexamines her centerpiece:

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, maybe the bauble looks like a 
                    head.  And these dowels could represent 
                    hands... Choking hands... Is that my 
                    face?  What's wrong with me?

      INT. GRAHAM'S OLD ROOM/INT. EVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

      Ian hears Eve next door, angrily playing her KEYTAR.  He 
      slides open the pocket door separating their two rooms.  

                                    IAN
                    Roof?

      EXT. ROOF - A LITTLE LATER

      Eve and Ian drop water-filled condoms off their building.   

                                    EVE
                    Why do we have to use these?

                                    IAN
                      I couldn't find any regular balloons.  
                    And they give these out like candy 
                    in college.  Getting 500 free condoms 
                    isn't preventative, it's pressure.  

                                    EVE
                          (drops condom)
                    Woman wearing a newsie hat.
                          (watches it fall, then)
                    It sucks they don't break.

                                    IAN
                    They did once.  When we were away at 
                    camp... Graham?

                                    EVE
                    Ew!  Can you imagine their skin?  
                    Are they just dressed in their clothes 
                    and then they like, start?

      As they keep dropping water condoms, Eve lets down her guard:

                                    EVE (CONT'D)
                    Diaz failed me.  For that video.

                                    IAN
                    Really?      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  26.

                                    EVE
                    It's not my first F, but this one 
                    kind of hurt.  He basically called 
                    me a phony.

                                    IAN
                      A "phony?"  Who are you, Holden 
                    Caufield?

                                    EVE
                    I know that's a Catcher in the Rye 
                      reference, but I only read the wiki 
                    summary.

                                    IAN
                    Ask Diaz for an incomplete.  Tell
                    him you want to prove him wrong --
                    he loves that crap -- then keep
                    working on it until you're proud of
                    what you've got.

                                    EVE
                    Okay, but then I'd have to film you 
                    a lot more...

                                    IAN
                    Take the F.
                          (re: another condom drop)
                    Right on a guy's soft pretzel.  You 
                    could tell he was going to enjoy that.

                                    EVE
                          (regards Ian for a beat)
                    Why am I talking to you about this?  
                    You're Mr. Perfect.

                                    IAN
                    That's where you're wrong.  Rebooting 
                    the search engine isn't the only 
                    reason why I'm back here.  

                                    EVE
                    I've got to start using that.  How 
                    do I find YouSearch again?

                                    IAN
                          (a beat, small)
                    Google it.

                                    EVE
                    Wait.  To get to your search engine 
                    you have to use another search engine--

                    I failed an Econ class last semester.  
                    It was graded on a curve and 
                      apparently everyone at college is 
                    smarter than me.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  27.

                                    EVE
                    But that's just one class--

                                    IAN
                    A curve is a mathematic formula 
                    designed to separate the very best 
                    from the people who used to be the 
                    best.  That's me now.

                                    EVE
                    Okay, but coming home?  Isn't that a 
                    little drastic?

                                    IAN
                    I'm a drastic person.

                    Nailed an old lady.  

                                    EVE
                    No, that's Aunt Leigh.

      Eve and Ian share a look, then race back inside.

      EXT. BURNABY APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT DAY

      A driven Mike hurries past an unexploded water-filled condom, 
      a little unnerved, as he talks on his cell phone.

                                    MIKE
                    Kay, it's Mike.  I'm back in.

                                    KAY (ON PHONE)
                    What?

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. SUBWAY - SAME TIME

      Kay rides a crowded above-ground train from deep in Brooklyn.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm "the guy who always finds the 
                    story," right?  Meet me at City Hall.

                                    KAY
                    I'm in Far Rockaway. 

                                    MIKE
                    I got us a meeting in an hour. 

                                    KAY
                    But I didn't reserve a news van.  Or
                    a crew!  Maybe if you hadn't spent
                    the whole night hemming and hawing,
                    but now we're boned!  Hard!

      A FAMILY looks over at Kay.  She quickly sobers:      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  28.

                                    KAY (CONT'D)
                      I apologize for that, Mr. Burnaby. 
                    I just want to do a perfect job for
                    a man who's given this world so much.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you starting to cry again?  I
                    can hear that.

      The MOTHER from the family hands Kay a tissue.

                                    KAY
                    No.  It's allergies. 

                                    MIKE
                    Listen, Kay: it's going to be okay. 
                    If a lady can have a baby in a tree,
                    we can handle this.

                                    KAY
                          (blowing her nose)
                    What?

      VARIOUS TALKING HEADS (BURNABY APARTMENT)

      In their respective rooms, each family member retells a story
      Mike has told them a hundred times:

                                      GRAHAM
                    There was a pregnant woman in 
                      Mozambique... 

                                    IAN
                    ...The day she went into labor, her 
                    village flooded.  As she was literally 
                    being taken away in the rolling 
                      currents...

                                      ANNIE
                    ...she climbed up into a tree and 
                    gave birth.  And she stayed in that 
                    tree, with her newborn baby, until 
                    she could be rescued.  So remember:

                                    EVE
                    However bad you think you've got it, 
                    a lady had a baby in a tree.

                    two billion dollars fails to upgrade

                    Let's boogie.

      As Mike puts an NBC news cap on, Kay holds back commenting.

      - Mike and Kay race uptown in the news van.  DV disks fall 
      on them as they're jostled around.  Kay looks nauseous.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Car sick, huh?  For me, this is 
                    perfectly still.

      - ON CAMERA, Mike does his stand-up next to a FAMILY.  In 
      the background, NYC FIREMEN put out a fire in a BROWNSTONE.

                    After waiting thirty-nine minutes 
                    for emergency services to arrive, 
                    one has to wonder what memories have 
                    been lost inside.

      The TEEN DAUGHTER uses her phone to sneak a photo of herself 
      with a hot fireman right behind her.

                    It's fine.  I'm used to it.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - A LITTLE LATER

      The fire is finally out.  Firemen clean up and help the family 
      sort through belongings.  Mike is on his cell phone:

                                    MIKE
                    We just wrapped.  Got some killer B
                    roll of the family looking through
                    burnt photo albums, too.  And the

                    That's awesome, man.

      As Harris pounds his chest respectfully, his date melts.

                                    MIKE
                    I gotta admit, it's pretty energizing 
                    being back out here, in the city again. 

      Off to one side, we see Kay VOMITING into a trash can. 

                                      HARRIS

                          (a beat, small)
                    Me?

                                      HARRIS
                    Matt Lauer cherry picked the story.  
                    Looks like you've been hating on the 
                    wrong guy.  So much for easing back 
                    in, huh?  This is big boy stuff.

      Mike doesn't respond as this sinks in.

                                      HARRIS (CONT'D)
                    Mike?  You alright?

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah, I'm just going through a tunnel.

                                      HARRIS
                    Aren't you on West End?

                                    MIKE
                    They just built it.  It's a flash 
                    tunnel.  I'm losing you.

      He hangs up.  STAY ON MIKE as he...

      INT. GUEST BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

      ...stands in front of a mirror, dressed in a sharp suit, 
      trying to adjust his tie.  Mike's hands are shaking more 
      than usual.  Annie enters, clocking this.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  31.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm just timing my meds so they kick 
                    in right before I go on.

      Annie heads over to Mike and helps him with his tie.  Then 
      she turns him towards her to get a look.  After a sweet kiss:

                                      ANNIE
                    Hey: a lady had a baby in a tree.

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Annie heads to the kitchen.  She passes by Graham's old room
      to see Ian and Graham struggling to squeeze Ian's queen-sized
      bed into the tiny space; it fills up most of the room.

                                      GRAHAM
                    I felt bad so I let him have his bed
                    back.

                                      ANNIE
                          (sits down on mattress)
                    I went to a club like this in the
                    80s.  Do not wear heels in here.

                                    IAN
                    The dresser can double as a standing
                    desk.  I'll make it work.  

                                      ANNIE
                          (smiles, proud)
                    You always do.

                                    IAN
                    Let me get some sheets.

      Ian musses Graham's hair as he heads off.  After a beat,
      Annie feels the mattress beneath her.

                                      ANNIE
                    You wet your bed, didn't you?

                                      GRAHAM
                    That fridge is full of Gatorade!

      INT. TODAY SHOW SET - LATER

      ACTUAL TODAY SHOW FOOTAGE, as Matt Lauer and SAVANNAH GUTHRIE
      sit with Mike in front of the street-level windows.  Behind
      them, fans CHANT Mike's name.  CLOSE ON MIKE as he closes
      his eyes and his body becomes still; he's ready.

                                    MATT LAUER
                    We have a very special guest this 
                    morning.  Mike Burnaby is here to 
                    introduce a segment he recently did 
                    for WNBC.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  32.

                                      SAVANNAH GUTHRIE
                          (grabbing Mike's hands, pitying)
                    It is so inspiring that you're here.

                                    MIKE
                          (slowly taking his hands back)
                    Always good to be with old friends.

      OFF TO THE SIDE: Annie and Harris watch Mike as he continues 
      to banter.  Eve's next to them, filming with her iPhone.

                                      HARRIS
                    Good to see him back, right?

                                      ANNIE
                    Yeah, it only took six months of us 
                    figuring out how to get him to "run 
                    into you" at Barney Greengrass.

                                      HARRIS
                    I mean, I like whitefish as much as 
                    the next black man, but it got a little 
                    facacta.  I still don't know why you 
                    didn't just have me call him.

                                      ANNIE
                    You know Mike.  This had to be his 
                    idea.

                                      HARRIS
                    So he has no clue?
                          (off her "no" nod)
                    So much for "always finding the story."

      A CAMERA MAN spots Eve filming her dad.

                                      CAMERA MAN
                    What's that for?  Do I need to call
                    my union?  

                                    EVE
                    No.  It's just a... project.

      BACK ON SET: Matt Lauer continues the broadcast.

                                    MATT LAUER
                    ...Before we hear from Mike, Al:
                    what's the reaction like out there? 
                    Does anyone like this guy?

      OUTSIDE: AL ROKER stands with NEW YORKERS holding "WELCOME
      BACK MIKE" signs.  INSIDE, Matt leans over to Mike:

                    AL ROKERMATT LAUER
        It's crazy out here. (whispering trash talk)
        Seems like the wholeSee if you can handle the
        city came out to welcomepressure now, Mikey.
        back their anchor.      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  33.

      As Mike reacts, Matt Lauer turns back to camera, all charm:

                                    MATT LAUER (CONT'D)
                    In his first segment back, Mike took
                    on the city's costly overhaul of the
                    emergency call system.

                                    MIKE
                    That's right, Matt.  

      Mike runs his fingers through his hair for Matt's benefit.

      INT. IAN'S OLD ROOM - SAME TIME

      Ian and Graham watch Mike on The Today Show on Ian's old TV.

                                      GRAHAM
                    He's still got it.

                                    IAN
                    Yeah... I thought we made him get
                    rid of that jacket.  He looks like a
                    ship's captain.  

      INT. TODAY SHOW - SAME TIME

                                    MIKE
                    Two days ago, I accidentally made a
                    911 call--

      Just as Mike begins, we hear a NEWS ALERT and we cut from
      his ONE SHOT back to a WIDE SHOT.  On a SCREEN behind them,
      touching footage of the family looking at photos FREEZES.

                                    MATT LAUER
                          (checking ear piece)
                      Unfortunately, we have to cut this 
                    short.  We have some breaking news.  
                    The Supreme Court is about to announce 
                    its decision on early voting.

      The CAMERAS TURN OFF and Matt Lauer slaps Mike on the back.  

                                    MATT LAUER (CONT'D)
                    That's the breaks. 

      Matt Lauer goes to get a coffee.  After a beat, a disappointed 
      Mike crosses to Annie, Harris and Eve (putting iPhone away).

                                      HARRIS
                    Should've done the overcoming personal 
                    obstacles thing.  You don't cut away 
                    from that gold.

                                      ANNIE
                    You okay, Mike?

      After a long beat, Mike puts on his trademark smile:      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  34.

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, you can't control everything.

      EVE TALKING HEAD (EVE'S ROOM)

      Eve sits down in front of her iPhone and takes a deep breath.

                                    EVE
                    What do I really think about Mike 
                    Burnaby?
                          (long pause, tearing up)
                    He was an award-winning news anchor, 
                    and an awesome dad, and then he got 
                    a stupid disease. 

      EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER

      MUSIC BEGINS and Eve's talking head BRIDGES THE CUT as Mike 
      walks with Annie and Eve.

                                    MIKE
                    Why don't we grab breakfast?

                                    EVE
                    Nah, I've got to shower before school. 

                                      ANNIE
                    And I have papers to grade.

      As Annie and Eve lead Mike back home: 

                                    MIKE
                    Huh.  I guess you really can't control 
                      everything.   

                                    EVE  (V.O.)
                    Of course he's not the same person 
                    he used to be.  With everything that's 
                    happened, how could he be?

      EXT./INT. BURNABY APARTMENT - LATER

      Mike, Annie and Eve arrive back home.  As Mike opens the 
      front door, Eve jumps in front of him and rushes inside.

                                    EVE
                    Wait!  Stay here.

      Eve slams the door closed and we hear sounds of PLATES 
      CLANGING and ARGUING inside.  Mike looks at Annie; she shrugs. 

                                    EVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Okay!

      Mike and Annie enter and walk through the foyer to find Eve, 
      Ian and Graham sitting around the dining room table.  In 
      front of them is a huge homemade breakfast.  Leigh rushes in 
      with a platter of sausages and sits, too.  Then:      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  35.

                                    KIDS AND LEIGH
                    Surprise!

      A beat as Mike processes what they're doing.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Sit down meal.  
                          (then, smiling)
                    Sit down, Dad.

      Mike smiles, touched.  He looks to Annie--

                                      ANNIE
                    Their idea.  

                                    EVE (V.O.)
                    The truth is, none of us are the 
                    same.  And we're still changing.  

                                    IAN
                    These are the idea of waffles more 
                    than actual waffles.  Sorry.

      Mike and Annie sit down, joining the others.

                                    EVE (V.O.)
                    But through it all, my dad has never 
                    stopped trying, never stopped being 
                    here -- a part of this family.  And 
                    that's what makes him amazing.

                                    MIKE
                    This is great, guys.  Thanks.  Who 
                    wants some eggs?

      As Mike reaches for a spoon and struggles to spoon eggs onto 
      his children's plates, the MUSIC CUTS OUT.

                                      ANNIE
                    Can you not have a personal victory 
                    right now?  We're starving.

      Annie grabs the spoon from Mike and takes over.  

                                      LEIGH
                    Yeah, and I'm having coffee with a 
                      skateboarder in a few, so... chop 
                    chop.

      Graham notices Annie's centerpiece on the table.

                                      GRAHAM
                    Somebody move that.  It's scaring me.

      As everyone enjoys sit-down breakfast, we PULL BACK AND OUT.

                                  END OF ACT THREE      MJF - Ep. 101 - 1.2.13  36.

                                          TAG

      EXT. AMSTERDAM AVENUE - MORNING

      Mike, Eve and Graham walk past BARNEY GREENGRASS.  Harris 
      sits at a table in the window.  CHYRON: "Six Months Earlier".

                                    EVE
                    Let's grab some bagels.

                                    MIKE
                    Why?  You just had a healthy scramble.

      Mike continues on.  Eve and Harris share a frustrated look.

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk.  CHYRON: "Four Months Earlier".  
      They pass right by Harris, but Mike is too busy texting.

                                    EVE
                    Can you put that down for one second?

                                    MIKE
                          (as he texts, continuing on)
                    Nope.  Graham taught me emoticons.  
                    "Crying face, winking face, pineapple, 
                      saxophone."  Just sent you that.

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk.  CHYRON: "Two Months Earlier".

                                    EVE
                    Fresh Nova?  For just $7.99 a pound?

      As Eve physically moves Mike to look at Harris, a BIKE 
      MESSENGER screeches to a halt right in front of them.

                                    BIKE MESSENGER
                    Mike Burnaby!  The man, the myth!

      - ANOTHER DAY, same walk, only Annie's there, too.  CHYRON: 
      "Last Week".  Annie pulls Mike toward Barney Greengrass.

                                      ANNIE
                    Hey, look, it's Harris Green.  Let's 
                    go say hello to him right now.

                                    MIKE
                    You're hurting my arm.  Slow down.

      They head inside to find Harris sitting at his usual table, 
      only he's busy talking to a HOT WOMAN sitting next to him.  

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Harris.

                                      HARRIS
                    Not now.  I'll get with you later.
