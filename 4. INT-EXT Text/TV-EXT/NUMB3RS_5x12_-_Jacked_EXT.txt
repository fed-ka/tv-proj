      A SIGHTSEEING BUS idles (the LOGO on the side reads 
       HOLLYWOODLINE TOURS ).  PANNING ACROSS  Walk of Fame  stars 
      WE FIND a PAIR OF GOOFY SHOES belonging to...


      The BUS DRIVER (40), who ushers TOURISTS on board the bus, 
      trying his best to make the 10,000th time he s done this seem 
      like the first --
                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Welcome to Hollywood, folks.  Watch 
                    your step.   Breakin  a leg  here 
                    doesn t mean good luck...

      A MOTHER (38) boards with her son, TODD (14) --

                                  TODD
                    This blows.  At least the hotel had 
                      video-games --

                                  MOTHER
                    You ve shot enough mutants today.
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    This is going to be fun.

      The Driver gives her a sympathetic look.  OTHER TOURISTS get 
      on, mostly couples.  A single male -- HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY 
      (JACK SHULER), 35 -- shoots the Driver a look...

                                  HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                    Hope your A/C s working.

      More TOURISTS board.  Among them... FOUR MEN WITH BACKPACKS 
      (BUCKLEY, KIROV, HAYS, CRAYPO), their packs bulging more than 
      you d expect for just a day-trip.  KIROV stumbles, an edgy 
      vibe.  BUCKLEY grabs his bag, helps him on.  The Driver gives 
      them the once-over.  BUCKLEY smiles it off --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     2.

                    Little too much partying last night.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Got his whole suitcase in there?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    We re staying at a hostel downtown.  
                    Didn t want our stuff walking out.

      The Driver nods.  The FOUR MEN grab seats.  An exchange of 
      looks between them tells us the Driver may ve bought the 
      story, but something here is definitely not right.  The LAST 
      TOURIST gets on.  OFF the Driver closing the doors, CUT TO:


      The BUS is on the move.  It ZOOMS BY, WHIPPING PAST...


        Surveilling.  COLBY in driver s seat, LIZ shotgun.  Headsets.

                                  COLBY

                    SWAT s moving in.


      TWO SWAT SUV S converge, block the street.  SIX SWAT GUYS get 
      out, take cover, as... the BUS approaches.


      COLBY S SPEEDOMETER increasing just as fast, as he and Liz 
      watch the bus accelerating, closing fast on the SWAT UNITS --

                                  LIZ
                    They re gonna blow right through  em!


      The SWAT GUYS scramble back into their SUVs.  Hit the gas, 
      pull away in the nick of time, as... the bus blows past them. 
    The TWO SWAT SUVs burn rubber, follow the bus in hot pursuit. 

                                  DON (ON RADIO)
                    Stand down, Granger.  SWAT s got  em.

      Colby and Liz pull to a stop, as... 


      The BUS, on the move.  TWO FBI SUVs following behind.        NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     10.  




      The BUS ZOOMS toward us, FBI SUVs in pursuit.  WHIPPING PAST, 
      as we CUT TO:


      On MONITORS: the STREAMED VIDEO from the bus; DASH-CAM VIDEO 
      from the SUV following the bus; the SATELLITE MAP showing the 
      RED DOT (BUS) moving, BLUE DOTS (SUVs) close behind -- 
      approaching a CLUSTER OF BLUE DOTS (MOBILE COMMAND VAN and 
      SUVs at the ROADBLOCK) --

      ANGLE ON DON, COLBY & KING standing at the back of a MOBILE 
      COMMAND VAN, studying the  monitor. (NOTE: everyone on 
      headset/mics) --

                      ...They re coming right to us.

      King nods to TWO SWAT SUVs pulling across the road, SIX SWAT 
      GUYS getting out and taking cover behind them (TWO POLICE 
      CARS positioning behind them) --





                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     20.

      He nods to SNIPERS in the windows of buildings overlooking --

                      ...Snipers are in position.


      The PATCHED PHONE LINE LIGHTS UP.  Don punches the speaker 
      (NOTE: he can see BUCKLEY via STREAMED VIDEO from the bus).

                    Four duffle bags, equal splits.  50s 
                    and 100s.  No consecutive serial 
                    numbers, no new bills, no marked 
                    bills.  No surprises in the bags.

      CLICK.  He hangs up.  Don punches off the speaker, troubled.  
      Colby looks down the road to see...  The BUS approaching.

                    You ready, Charlie?


      All watch as the BUS slows (the TWO SUVs trailing joined by 
      TWO POLICE CARS hemming in the bus as it stops).  Colby looks 
      at the STREAMING VIDEO, sees the bad guys start to react.

                                  COLBY
                    They know...

      They watch the STREAMING VIDEO, BUCKLEY dialing his cell...

                    No, you need to listen.

      As the bus stops, BUCKLEY grabs the MOTHER, holds a gun on 
      her.  Her kid SCREAMS.  We can hear it and see it on video.

                    Back off, re-start the engine.  Or the 
                    next sound you hear you won t forget.

      BUCKLEY yanks the MOTHER closer.  She begs for her life!

      BUCKLEY trains his gun on Shuler, unsure what to do, as... 
      Our guys watch the drama play out on the STREAMING VIDEO.

      A CAD  room,  filled with virtual furniture, lamps, etc...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    It allows designers to see what a 
                    space will look like from different 
                    angles, using different floorplans.

    The POV and the objects in the room now move around (and move 
      around Charlie) -- light, shadow and perspective changing...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    As the observer and the objects move 
                    around, the CAD algorithm calculates 
                    light, shadow, perspective...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     27.  

      CONTINUED: (2)3838

      FOCUS now on one object (a floorlamp) -- vectors and numbers 
      emerge from the light and shadow, calculating its position...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    ...Working backwards, those same 
                    elements can provide an exact 
                      measurement of an object s location 
                    in the room, down to the millimeter.

                    Using the streamed video and the bus 
                      manufacturer s specs, I could run a 
                    CAD program on the bus s interior.

                    It s always the same -- they ask for 
                    a police car, a chopper, an escort to 
                    the airport.  The longer we wait, the

      The SNIPERS (SIERRA TEAM) fire!  The BULLETS pierce the 
      painted windows of the bus.  Don orders the SWAT TEAM in!

                                  DON
                    Let s go!  Let s go!  Let s go!

      Don, Colby, King and the SIX SWAT GUYS storm the bus! --


      Don and Colby question the Bus Driver, off the bus, no bomb 
      belt.

                                  DON
                    What the hell happened?

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    After they took over the bus, they 
                    made me drive to an alley.  There was 
                    another bus there waiting, they 
                      transferred over the passengers.
                          (beat)
                    They knew about the panic button.  
                    They put the bomb belt on me, told me 
                    to push it, send the distress call.

                                  COLBY
                    They wanted us to follow you.
                          (then, to Don)
                    Only time we didn t have eyes on them 
                    was those first few minutes.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    They gave me the headset so they 
                    could radio me instructions...

                                  COLBY
                      ...Leading us on a wild-goose chase 
                    for the next two hours.

      Don and Colby step away to confer --

                                  COLBY (cont d)
                    They could be anywhere by now.

                                  DON
                    He played us.

                                  COLBY
                    And killed a cop... showing us he s in 
                    the driver s seat, we can t stop him.

      Don sees KING debriefing his SNIPERS.  Colby senses his mood. 

                                  COLBY (cont d)
                    You made the right call, Don.  There 
                    was no way to know.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     39.

                                  DON
                    Maybe we pushed him... if I hadn t 
                    called for the shot, he wouldn t have 
                    pulled the trigger.

                                  COLBY
                    You can t be inside the guy s head.

                                  DON
                    That s my job.
