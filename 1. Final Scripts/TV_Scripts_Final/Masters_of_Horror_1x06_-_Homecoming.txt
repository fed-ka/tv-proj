      FADE IN:  

      EXT. ROAD   NIGHT 

      OVERHEAD VIEW of a dark, hilly, tree-lined road in Northern 
      Virginia, fifteen or twenty minutes outside the nation s 
      capital.  A SPEEDING CAR approaches.  

      SQUEALING BRAKES as the car takes a hairpin curve at 50 MPH, 
      leaving a trail of burnt rubber behind it.  But it keeps the 
      road.  

      INT. CAR   MOVING   NIGHT 

      A GAUNT, LEGGY BLONDE WOMAN in the passenger seat stubs out 
      a cigarette in the ashtray, shakes out another, lights it.  
      The car is already full of smoke and the MAN AT THE WHEEL is 
      practically gagging.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Do you have to    

                                      JANE  
                        Just drive!  

      EXT. ROAD   NIGHT 

      A SQUASHED RACCOON, bisected by tire treads, lies on the 
      edge of the asphalt several hundred yards away.  The tip of 
      a CRUTCH stabs down, plants itself in the steaming innards.  

      The crutch belongs to a MOONLIT FIGURE who s just shambled 
      out of the woods.  He s moving slowly and with extreme 
      difficulty: one leg, obviously shattered, dangles uselessly 
      from his hip.  His left arm is missing altogether. 

      He seems to be wearing some sort of military uniform. 

      We can t see his face, because it s dark out, and because 
      his back is to us as he makes his way along the gravelly 
      shoulder of the road.  DISTANT HEADLIGHTS come into view 
      just as he passes a SIGN that reads:  

      WASHINGTON, D.C.  19  

      INT. CAR   MOVING   NIGHT 

      Jane is turned in her seat, staring through the rear 
      windshield, as if scanning the road for possible pursuers.   

      David squints at the straightaway up ahead . . .  


                                                2.  


                                      DAVID  
                        There s someone out there.  

      Jane s head jerks around.  She squints too.  

      EXT. ROAD   THAT MOMENT   NIGHT 

      As the car speeds toward the man on crutches, HEADLIGHTS 
      catch him full in the face.  In the instant before he throws 
      his one good hand up to shield his eyes from the glare, we 
      get a quick glimpse of the burned, puckered skin that covers 
      half of his almost-hairless skull.  

      INT. CAR   MOVING - NIGHT 

      Barreling toward the figure on crutches, who is now plainly 
      visible in the opposite lane up ahead.  

                                      JANE  
                        It s one of them.  

                                      DAVID  
                        I don t think s   

                                      JANE  
                        IT S ONE OF THEM!!  

      David s natural inclination is to swerve right, giving the 
      man on crutches a wide berth.  But Jane lunges at the wheel 
      and JERKS IT TO THE LEFT    

      EXT. ROAD   THAT MOMENT   NIGHT 

      -- and the car, at full speed, PLOWS DIRECTLY INTO the man 
      on crutches.  It s as if he s held together by pins and 
      baling wire: an arm hurtles off in one direction, a leg in 
      another.   

      The crutch flies upward, end over end ...  

      INT. CAR   MOVING   NIGHT 

      ... and SMASHES INTO THE WINDSHIELD of the car, leaving a 
      spiderweb of cracks behind it. As David struggles to regain 
      control of the wheel, the car hits the gravel shoulder of 
      the road and SKIDS OFF -   

      EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 

      -- slamming into a TREE at the edge of the woods.  




                                                3.  



      EXT. CAR - NIGHT  

      David is slumped over the wheel, stunned. He comes around 
      slowly, wincing, as the airbags deflate (assuming we can 
      afford airbags). He glances over at Jane -- who's badly 
      rattled, and sporting a cut on her forehead, but otherwise 
      instact.  

                                      DAVID  
                        You all right?  

                                      JANE  
                        I hit my h--  

      Before she can finish the sentence she glances at the 
      cracked windshield -- and lets out a piercing SHRIEK.  

      They have company.  The HEAD of the man on crutches seems to 
      have landed in the groove between the hood of the car and 
      the windshield.  In fact it s stuck there, practically face-
      to-face with Jane.  She squirms in her seat, SHRIEKS AGAIN, 
      pulls her legs up in front of her.  

      Then the head OPENS ITS EYES.  Stares at her.  Seems to 
      recognize her.  The mouth opens, as if to say hello.  

      She begins POUNDING HYSTERICALLY on the dashboard. David 
      turns on the windshield wipers -- dislodging the head, which 
      rolls off the hood and bounces off into the trees.  

      He grabs her by the arm to let her know that the head is 
      gone, and it's okay to stop screaming.  

                                      JANE   
                        Sorry.  I, uh ...  
                                (sheepishly)  
                        I think I knew him once. Where 
                        are we?  

      David opens the door and climbs out.  

      EXT. ROAD   NIGHT 

      As Jane gets out of the passenger side, wiping blood from 
      the cut on her forehead, she sees David leaning against the 
      car, clutching his side in obvious pain.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Jesus ... I think I broke a 
                        rib...  



                                                4.  



                                      JANE  
                        Suck it up. We've got to get out 
                        of here.  

      Their heads turn at the sight of the DISTANT HEADLIGHTS 
      rounding a bend, approaching on the straightaway. Jane pulls 
      off her heels and scampers, barefoot, to the edge of the 
      road.  

                                      JANE   
                        Honk the horn! Maybe they'll 
                        give us a ride.  

      She stands directly in the path of the oncoming headlights, 
      waving her shoes as if they were semaphore flags. The 
      vehicle slows and stops. It's big -- a truck of some sort.  

      CLOSEUP -- ON JANE  

      The headlights are shining right in her face; she holds up 
      one hand to shield her eyes. A truck door opens O.S. All at 
      once her face is full of apprehension...  

                                      JANE   
                        David...  

      Now she turns and runs, in a full-fledged panic.  

                                      JANE   
                        David! Jesus! Pop the trunk!  

      EXT. ROAD   ON TRUCK   THAT MOMENT  

      It appears to be a canvas-topped army troop transport.  And 
      it s carrying a load of passengers, several of whom have 
      already climbed out.  

      We can t see them well; they re still a good ways off.  But 
      there s enough moonlight to make out the occasional missing 
      arm or leg.  Some of them can t even walk without the help 
      of their comrades.  

      They re all wearing raggedy, tattered UNIFORMS.  

      EXT. ROAD   ON CAR   NIGHT 

      Jane rips a swath of cloth from her already-short skirt and 
      ties it around her bloody forehead bandanna-style.  From the 
      trunk of the car she pulls out a double-barreled shotgun and 
      a box of shells.  

      Wheezing, David stumbles to her side.  

                                                5.  


                                      JANE  
                        There s an automatic in the 
                        trunk.  

                                      DAVID  
                        What s the point, Jane?  

                                      JANE  
                        The point is, we are not giving 
                        up.  And we are definitely not 
                        giving up to a bunch of 
                        crippled, stinking, maggot-
                        infested, brain-dead zombie 
                          dissidents.  
                              (to the truck)  
                        COME AND GET IT!  COME AND GET 
                        IT, YOU PUSSIES!  

      She fires a shotgun blast into the air, then reloads.  

                                      DAVID  
                        What are we going to do?  

                                      JANE  
                        We re going to take their goddam 
                        truck right out from under them, 
                        that s what.  Now grab that gun, 
                        you chickenshit.  

      One of the fellows from the troop transport is tramping 
      slowly but steadily toward them.  With a feral gleam in her 
      eye, Jane lowers the shotgun slightly and fires.  Both 
      barrels.  

      The twin blasts knock the legs out from under this  zombie 
      dissident.   He hits the road HOWLING IN PAIN   and his 
      weird keening plaint is picked up by his comrades, one by 
      one, until the entire company is CATERWAULING in harmony.  

                                      JANE   
                        That s the trick, see ... aim 
                        low, take their legs out ... 
                        can t kill  em, but you can slow 
                         em up ...  
                              (firing again)  
                        GET UP, YOU PANSIES!  BRING IT 
                        ON!  

      David smiles ruefully at Jane, who is, in some bizarre way, 
      thoroughly in her element.  As she blasts away, he hobbles 
      to the trunk of the car and comes back with a .38.  



                                                6.  



                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I m truly 
                        sorry.  

                                      JANE  
                        Who cares?!  Shut up and shoot!  

                                      DAVID  
                        It s my fault, you know.  The 
                        whole damned mess. It s all my 
                        fault.  

      The undead troops are still advancing   no more than ten or 
      fifteen feet away now.  Jane can t reload fast enough to 
      hold them off.  

                                      JANE  
                        Holy Mother of Hip-Hop Jesus ...  

                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I never 
                        should ve opened my mouth.  

      He levels his gun at the back of her head and squeezes the 
      trigger.  SCREEN GOES BLACK.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        I remember the night the whole 
                        world went to hell.  It was the 
                        night I first met Jane.  

      SUPER TITLE:  Four weeks earlier   

      FADE THROUGH TO:  

      INT. CABLE TV STUDIO - DAY 

      The set of an interview show on cable news network WEDL.  On 
      the count of three a camera swings in toward grizzled host 
      MARTY CLARK, who is holding up a book; the cover shows an 
      angular blonde in a leather mini, arms akimbo, standing 
      before a bank of TV screens   one of which is turned to 
      Marty Clark Live!, the very show we happen to be watching.  

                                      CLARK  
                        We re back on Marty Clark Live!, 
                        with our guests   constitutional 
                        scholar Jane Cleaver, whose new 
                        book is Subversion: How the 
                        Radical Left Took Over Cable 
                        News   thanks for the plug, 
                        there, Jane ...  

                                                7.  


      ANGLE ON the flirty, overcaffeinated Jane in her leather 
      mini, long legs crossed, one foot swinging metronomically.  

                                      JANE  
                        You re very welcome, Marty.  

                                      CLARK  
                        And our good friend David Murch, 
                        former presidential speechwriter 
                        and high-priced campaign 
                          consultant.  Welcome, David.  

      David nods politely, as self-contained as Jane is fidgety.  

                                      CLARK 
                        With the election three weeks 
                        away the President is in full 
                        campaign mode.  This week, at a 
                        rally in Boulder, three 
                        protesters were arrested when 
                        they took off their coats to 
                        reveal antiwar t-shirts.  

      ON A MONITOR: video footage of Secret Service agents 
      manhandling a trio of tubby, superannuated HIPPIES   two 
      women, one man.  Their t-shirts read  NO BLOOD FOR OIL.   

                                      CLARK 
                        Now David, we ve seen several of 
                        these incidents.  The protesters 
                        say they have a right to free 
                        speech.  Does the President have 
                        a policy of suppressing dissent?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Look, Marty, the President has a 
                        First Amendment right to take 
                        his case to the American people 
                        without being shouted down.  But 
                        to answer your question, there s 
                        no  policy.   The Secret Service 
                        is there to protect the 
                        President.  They re gonna err on 
                        the side of caution.  

                                      CLARK  
                        I see Jane is about to jump out 
                        of her chair ...  






                                                8.  



                                      JANE  
                        Marty.  Please.  If you look at 
                        these  protesters  you see men 
                        with breasts and women with 
                        armpit hair.  They are ugly, 
                        stupid, clueless, they have 
                        nothing to offer but hate for 
                        our country, and they know that 
                        the only way they could ever get 
                        on TV is to defecate, in public, 
                        on our President and our 
                        troops    

                                      CLARK  
                        Now, Jane    

                                      JANE  
                        -- and you, Marty.  You are 
                        their collaborator.  You put 
                        these awful repulsive people on 
                        TV, which is all they want to 
                        begin with.  So like, thanks, 
                        Mission Accomplished!  

      While Jane is sputtering, a pleasant, plump-faced WOMAN 
      appears on a flatscreen behind Clark s desk.  

                                      CLARK  
                        We go live now to Altoona, 
                          Pennsylvania, where we ll be 
                        joined by Janet Hofstadter.  
                        Mrs. Hofstadter, welcome.  
                        You re what used to be called a 
                        Gold Star Mom.  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        That s right, Marty.  

                                      CLARK  
                        Your son, Cpl. Gordon 
                          Hofstadter, was killed in 
                        action?  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        July eighth of this year.  

                                      CLARK  
                        And you were detained by the 
                        Secret Service at a Presidential 
                        rally this past week    



                                                9.  



                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        That s correct.  

                                      CLARK  
                        -- for  heckling  the President.  
                        What exactly did you say to him?  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        I stood up and I asked him,  Why 
                        did my son die?   

                                      CLARK  
                         Why did my son die.   

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        And he didn t answer, and I 
                        asked him again.  And again.  
                        And then I was grabbed by the 
                        arms and taken out.  

                                      CLARK  
                        Why did you say that to the 
                        President?  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        Because no one else will.  
                                (beat)  
                        We were told there was a threat 
                        to America.  But the Weapons of 
                        Mass Destruction weren t there.  
                        The nuclear program wasn t 
                        there.  The threat wasn t there.  
                        And here s the President, 
                        surrounded by his supporters and 
                        his yes-men, talking happy talk 
                        about his war; and I have the 
                        right, Mr. Clark.  I have the 
                        right to ask him: why did my son 
                        die?  

                                      CLARK  
                        David, what do you say to that?  

                                      DAVID  
                        First of all, I would say: Mrs. 
                          Hofstadter, I honor you for your 
                        sacrifice.  I had an older 
                        brother who gave his life in 
                        Vietnam.  And believe me, if I 
                        had one wish, I ...  



                                                10.  



      David inexplicably FREEZES in mid-sentence.  His eyes seem 
      to glaze over; it s as if he s not even in the room.  

      The silence drags on   four, five, six seconds, an eternity 
      in TV time.  Jane stares askance at David; even old pro 
      Clark is getting nervous.  

                                      DAVID 
                        If I had one wish ... I would 
                        wish for your son to come ... 
                        back ...  

      David covers his face with one hand, as if stricken by an 
      especially potent migraine.  When the hand comes away, TEARS 
      are streaming down his face.  

                                      DAVID 
                        ... because I know he would tell 
                        us all ... how important this 
                        battle is to the safety and 
                        security of all Americans ... 
                        and how proud he is to have 
                        served his country.  

      Although David has regained his composure by the end of the 
      speech, the onlookers are uniformly stunned.  It s been 
      quite a spectacle.  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER  
                        Frankly, sir, I don t think you 
                        know my son well enough to --  

                                      CLARK  
                        We ll be right back after this 
                        message.  

      At the break, David is mobbed by crew.  Someone shoves a cup 
      of water into his hand.  MAKEUP PEOPLE dab at his eyes, 
      reapply pancake to cover the tracks of his tears.  

                                      DAVID  
                        I m fine now.  I m fine.  

      INT. BAR - NIGHT 

      A popular D.C. watering hole not far from the SBS studios.  
      A WAITER serves a second round of martinis to Jane and 
      David, who are at a booth in the corner.  

                                      JANE  
                        There is no way you re gonna 
                        tell me that wasn t planned.  

                                                11.  


                                      DAVID  
                        It wasn t planned.  

                                      JANE  
                        Come on.  I ve been hearing 
                        about you forever.  You re 
                        supposed to be the smartest guy 
                        in D.C.  

                                      DAVID  
                        The scary thing about D.C. is, I 
                        probably am. But look: the 
                        smartest guy in D.C. fucked up, 
                        okay?  
                              (shaking his head)  
                        I just blanked out.  On live TV.  
                        I never had it happen before.  

                                      JANE  
                        But it was great.  You were like 
                        ... crying.  And it was like ... 
                        moving.  That s the thing.  You 
                        have this credibility.  I mean, 
                        you and I are basically saying 
                        the same shit, but people treat 
                        me like some kind of circus act.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Do you believe in what you say?  

                                      JANE  
                        Yes!  Well ... you know.  Come 
                        on, it s words.  It s a game.  
                        You say whatever it takes to 
                        win.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Maybe that s your problem.  

                                      JANE  
                        Okay.  So you believe what you 
                        say?  You believe a soldier 
                        would come back and be like,  By 
                        the way, thanks for getting me 
                        killed ??  

                                      DAVID  
                        No, I don t believe that.  
                              (the start of a grin)  
                        Okay, there are a couple of 
                        small tricks I can teach you.  

      Jane rubs her hands together in anticipation. 

                                                12.  


      The waiter glides over with a fresh round of drinks.  

                                      DAVID (CONT.)  
                        That waiter keeps winking at 
                        you.  

                                      JANE  
                        I think I knew him once.  You 
                        were saying?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Okay.  Here s the thing.  You 
                        want the audience to see you 
                        thinking.  You get a question, 
                        you already know what you re 
                        gonna say, it s some dumbass 
                        talking point.  But you think 
                        about it.  Drag it out. You go, 
                        Wellllll, Marty, that s 
                          reeeeeeeeally innnnnteresting.  

                                      JANE  
                        Okay, ask me a question.  

                                      DAVID  
                                (imitating Marty Clark)  
                         Jane.  What color panties are 
                        you wearing tonight?   

      Jane scrunches up her face in thought.  

                                      JANE  
                         Wellllll, Marty ... I M NOT 
                        WEARING ANY PANTIES!   

      Since the third martini, Jane has been a little louder than 
      absolutely necessary, and this line draws stares and laughs 
      from the surrounding patrons.  Slapping David on the 
      forearm, she cracks up at her own dry wit.  

                                      JANE 
                        See?  I m fun.  I m so much fun.  
                        And the men in this town, 
                        they re such emasculated 
                        pussies, they re all afraid of 
                        me.  Why is that?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Maybe they just don t like you.  

                                      JANE  
                        No, seriously.  


                                                13.  


                                      DAVID  
                        Maybe it s the force of your 
                        intellect.  

                                      JANE  
                        But what can I can do about 
                        that?  
                                (gripping his forearm)  
                        You know why I like you?  I ve 
                        known you over an hour, and you 
                        haven t made a single joke about 
                        my name.  That s all I hear from 
                        these bozos.   Meat Cleaver  ... 
                         June Cleaver  ...  Beaver 
                        Cleaver  ...  

                                      DAVID  
                        That would be rude.  I hardly 
                        know you.  

                                      JANE  
                              (leaning in closer)  
                        We can fix that.  In a hurry.  

                                      DAVID  
                        What do you have in mind?  

                                      JANE  
                        Welllllll, Marty ...  

      INT. BEDROOM   NIGHT 

      TIGHT ON a cellphone, resting on a bedside nightstand.  It 
      RINGS   a custom tone, the first few bars of  Hail to the 
      Chief.   

                                      DAVID (O.S.)  
                        Sorry, honey, I have to take 
                        that.  

      WIDER: David s handcuffed to a four-poster bed with 
      clothespins on his nipples.  Corset-clad Jane is astride 
      him, lighting a candle.  

                                      JANE  
                        No.  

                                      DAVID  
                        It s POTUS.  That s my POTUS 
                        tone!  




                                                14.  



                                      JANE  
                                (suddenly excited)  
                        Oh, Jesus.  Can I listen?  

      He nods yes.  She flips the phone open and sets it on the 
      pillow beside his head.  By craning his neck he can almost 
      carry on a normal conversation.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Murch here.  

                                      VOICE ON PHONE 
                                      (FILTER)  
                        David!  Catch you at a bad time?  

                                      DAVID  
                        No, no, not at all.  

      Jane is leaning in close so that she can eavesdrop on the 
      conversation.  At the sound of the reedy drawl on the other 
      end of the line she glowers at David.  

                                      JANE  
                        That s not the President!  
                        That s Kurt Rand!  

                                      DAVID  
                                (stage-whispering)  
                        Same thing.  
                              (into phone)  
                        Sorry, Kurt, I -- had someone 
                        here.  

      INTERCUT: DAVID AND KURT RAND 

      RAND, pale, pudgy, bespectacled, is the political fixer 
      universally known as the President s Brain.  He s calling 
      from campaign HQ; coffee cups, soda cans, and pizza boxes 
      are scattered everywhere, and the walls are covered with 
      signage that does not mention a candidate's name -- it's all 
      generic slogans: "FOUR MORE YEARS."  "STAY THE COURSE." 
      "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED."  "RE-ELECT THE PRESIDENT."   

                                      KURT  
                        It s not Jane Cleaver, is it?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Uh, no.  





                                                15.  



                                      KURT  
                        Well, tell her hi if it is.  
                        Hey, we caught you today on the 
                        Clark show   POTUS was 
                          watching...  

                                      DAVID  
                        Yeah, I don t know what happened 
                        there, I just had some kind of 
                        brain fart    

                                      KURT  
                        Naw, listen, he loved it.  He 
                        was moved by it.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Moved by it?  

                                      KURT  
                        Hell yes.  That s why I called.  
                        That bit about the wish, and the 
                        soldier coming back   that s 
                        great stuff, man.  He wants to 
                        put it in his stump speech.  

      A bit of a coup.  Jane gets very excited   pumps her fists 
      in the air.  David, of course, doesn t have that option.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Jesus.  Be my guest!  

                                      KURT  
                        But here s the thing, see   he 
                        said it to you.  You just went 
                        on the Clark show and repeated 
                        it.  Okay?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Well, of course, Kurt.  Everyone 
                        knows what a silver-tongued de   

      He lets out a yowl of pain.  Jane has lit the candle and is 
      dripping hot wax on his naked belly.  

                                      KURT  
                        Something wrong?  

                                      DAVID  
                        No, everything s fine.  




                                                16.  



                                      KURT  
                        Well, good work.  You tell Janie 
                        bye-bye for me.  

                                      JANE  
                        BYE, KURT.  

                                      KURT  
                        Bye, Janie!  

      End of call.  Jane snaps the phone shut and replaces it on 
      the nightstand.  She hovers over David with a truly demented 
      gleam in her eye.  

                                      JANE  
                        Oh, I am so gonna make you 
                        scream.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        Henry Kissinger said power is 
                        the ultimate aphrodisiac.  In 
                        D.C., even second-hand power has 
                        its compensations...  

      INT. DAVID S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

      Late night: David sprawled on the sofa, Jane (now a regular 
      fixture) curled up beside him in t-shirt that reads  NO SEX 
      FOR OIL.   She s chain-smoking and eating popcorn as they 
      watch (offscreen) news footage of POTUS addressing a crowd.  

                                      JANE  
                        God, he s good.  They just adore 
                        him.  What is it?  What has he 
                        got?  

                                      DAVID  
                        It s a gift.  He s not stupid, 
                        but he has a way of making 
                        stupid people feel like they re 
                        just as smart as he is.  They 
                        love that.  

                                      JANE  
                        Shhh!  I think this is it!  

      She grabs the remote and cranks up the volume.  HOLD ON THE 
      TWO OF THEM as POTUS quotes David onscreen:  





                                                17.  



                                      POTUS (O.S., FILTER)  
                        I want you to know.  I suffer.  
                        I suffer when I see those 
                        numbers every day.  I see  em 
                        before you do.  And I tell my 
                        staff.  I tell  em all the time.  
                        If I could have one wish, one 
                        big wish, I would bring those 
                        brave young Americans back.  
                        Because   if they could come 
                        back   I think I know what they 
                        would say ...  

      David stares at POTUS with a free-floating anxiety he 
      couldn t explain if you asked him to.  Jane stares at David 
      with something that, had it originated in a human heart, 
      might be called love.  

      She points the TiVo remote at the TV screen and backs up the 
      President s borrowed speech so they can watch it again.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        He was wrong about that.  Dead 
                        wrong.  The first incident took 
                        place less than 48 hours 
                        later...  

      INT. HANGAR   DOVER AFB   NIGHT 

      Six spit-and-polish Marine pallbearers carry a FLAG-DRAPED 
      COFFIN into a hangar and place it on a temporary bier.  

      Several similar flag-draped coffins are already inside, 
      arranged in orderly rows.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        ... when the regular night 
                        flight arrived at Dover Air 
                        Force Base, carrying a brand-new 
                        batch of caskets from the war.  

      Having offloaded the last of the caskets, the PALLBEARERS 
      stand at attention, salute their fallen comrades, then march 
      out of the hangar in formation.  A Marine GUARD holsters his 
      walkie-talkie and gestures to his buddy, MARINE GUARD II.  

                                      MARINE GUARD  
                        We got another civilian taking 
                        pictures.  Last seen southwest 
                        corner by the storm fence.  



                                                18.  



                                      MARINE GUARD II  
                        Newspaper guys again?  

                                      MARINE GUARD I  
                        Don t know.  Main thing is, 
                        secure the camera.  

      Guard II exits behind the pallbearers.  Guard I ambles to 
      the open hangar door, scans the perimeter.  

      After a moment, his walkie-talkie SQUAWKS.  

                                      MARINE GUARD I   
                        Copy.  

                                      MARINE GUARD II  
                        I seen a figure.  Running around 
                        back of the hangar.  

      A sudden CLANGING noise from the opposite side of the 
      hangar - perhaps a door slamming.  Marine Guard I moves in 
      warily to investigate.  

      It s an open door, all right   flapping in the wind.  Guard 
        I unholsters his sidearm and looks for traces of an intruder 
      as he secures the door.  

      He turns suddenly at the sound of a muffled THUNK.  

      Three seconds pass.  Another THUNK.  And another.  

      They seem to be coming from the general direction of the 
      flag-draped coffins.  Guard I advances carefully ...  

                                      MARINE GUARD I  
                        SIR, YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON A 
                        UNITED STATES MILITARY 
                          INSTALLATION.  I SUGGEST YOU 
                        MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN.  

      THUNK.  He catches motion out of the corner of his eye.  His 
      head pivots.  One of the caskets appears to have been 
      moved   the others are in perfect rows, perfectly squared, 
      but this one is resting at an odd angle on its bier.  

                                      MARINE GUARD I   
                        SIR?  THERE ARE NO CAMERAS 
                        ALLOWED HERE. IT IS AGAINST THE 
                        POLICY OF THE U.S. MILITARY TO 
                        ALLOW --  



                                                19.  



      Behind him: THUNK.  THUNK.  The sound of fists pounding 
      against metal.  The guard turns suddenly.  Then:  

      CRASH.  

      His eyes bug out.  It appears that the metal lid of a coffin 
      has been forced open ... from inside.  The occupant is 
      sitting upright under the flag, which is draped around him  
      like a teepee on a tentpole.  

      Guard I is losing it now.  Whoever s inside the casket is 
      starting to climb out.  Transfixed by the spectacle, 
      training his gun on the moving flag, he backs into a second 
      casket    

      -- and WHANG!  The occupant of that casket forces the lid 
      open as well, almost smacking Guard I in the face!  

      He backs into a corner of the hangar, swinging his gun 
      wildly back and forth between the two caskets.  

      Someone   something   comes shambling toward him, freed of 
      its coffin, but still wrapped in Old Glory, like a child in 
      a sheet at Halloween.  

                                      MARINE GUARD I   
                        STOP.  STOP THERE.  Look.  I 
                        know you re alive ... we ll send 
                        for a medic ... just ... STOP.  

      The flag falls away just enough to reveal the gruesomely 
      disfigured face of a dead soldier.  The top of his skull is 
      missing.  Alive?  Not bloody likely.  

      And now a SECOND flag-draped creature is marching toward 
      him.   

      In a state of hysteria, he opens fire.  

      The dead soldiers are still advancing on Guard I, who s in a 
      state of hysteria, firing wildly.  The soldiers SHRIEK IN 
      PAIN with each hit   the unearthly, high-pitched KEENING 
      SOUND we heard in the opening   but whatever pain they may 
      be experiencing is not enough to stop them.  

      The bullets tear straight through their desiccated bodies, 
      leaving holes that drain not blood, but a thick, viscous 
      ichor.  Finally the dead soldiers CONVERGE on Guard I   
      flattening him against the wall as one of them wraps a bony 
      claw around his gun hand    



                                                20.  



      -- and this is the tableau that greets Guard II as he bursts 
      in through the door.  

                                      MARINE GUARD II  
                        Jesus Fuck.  FREEZE!  

      The dead soldiers turn in unison, stare at him.  He levels 
      his gun at them and empties the clip.  

      Unfortunately, since corpses don t offer much resistance, 
      the bullets wind up perforating Guard I, who is right behind 
      them.  The dead men step aside and Guard I, bleeding from 
      seven wounds, pitches forward.  He s dead before he hits the 
      hangar floor.  

      Guard II, horrified, drops to his knees.  He tries to put a 
      fresh clip into his automatic, but his hands are shaking too 
      badly.  He just can t.  He sits there watching helplessly as 
      one of the creatures shuffles toward him.  

      Guard II gasps in fear as the thing lays a hand on his head.   

      It opens its mouth and a strange rasping CROAK comes out   
      not really words at first; the vocal cords are not in 
      working order.  But eventually the creature manages to say 
      something that sounds almost like    

                                      DEAD SOLDIER  
                        At ease, soldier.  

      Then it turns and walks away, leaving Guard II to sob and 
      gibber on the floor.  

      MORE THUMPING from other coffins.  The two reanimated 
      soldiers remove a flag from atop a coffin and, working in 
      tandem, fold it neatly, according to regulations.  Then they 
      pop the lid of the casket open, freeing a THIRD DEAD SOLDIER

      DISSOLVE TO:  

      EXT. CEMETERY   ESTABLISHING - LATE AFTERNOON 

      David's car drives through ornamental gates, entering a 
      hillside cemetery in a D.C. suburb.  

      INT. CAR (MOVING)   THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 

      David at the wheel, with his MOM -- seventies, slightly 
      deaf, slightly fubsy -- riding shotgun.  There's a box of 
      chocolates and a vase of flowers in the back seat.  


                                                21.  


                                      MOM  
                        Peggy Pepper s daughter came and 
                        took us out to the Wounded 
                        Steer.  Have you tried that 
                        buffet?  I love those croutons 
                        they have ...  

      David s cell phone rings.   

                                      DAVID  
                        Sorry mom, gotta take this ...  
                              (into phone)  
                        Murch ... what?  Yeah, sure, I'm 
                        just dying to do his show again 
                        after he called me a dick on the 
                        air. Hey, let me call you back, 
                        I'm with my mom.  

      Mom s monologue has continued throughout the above.  

                                      MOM  
                        ... but his hip never really 
                        healed up from the truck 
                        accident. Slow down!  You drive 
                        so darned fast.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Sorry, mom.  

      David slows to a more leisurely pace, which is not at all 
      natural for him.  His cell rings again.  

                                      DAVID   
                        Murch ... He what??  Well, fire 
                        his ass.  You don t need me to 
                        tell you that.  Listen, I m with 
                        my mom, can I call you back?  

      EXT. CEMETERY   LATE AFTERNOON 

      David pulls over to the shoulder of the gravel road just 
      above a spreading chestnut tree.  He fetches his mom's 
      aluminum walker from the trunk, then opens her door and 
      helps her out. 

                                      MOM  
                        Patty Ranahan s boy came by to 
                        see her last night ...  

      She keeps talking as David reaches into the back seat for 
      the flowers and the chocolate.  



                                                22.  



                                      MOM   
                        He was standing outside the 
                        window.  In the moonlight, she 
                        said.  And she went out on the 
                        patio.  He just wanted to tell 
                        her goodbye.  

      David hasn't been listening very closely, and it's only now 
      that the penny drops:  

                                      DAVID  
                        Patty Ranahan.  
                              (pause)  
                        Isn t she the one ... wasn t her 
                        son killed in the war?  

                                      MOM  
                        Yes, that s him.  -- I thought 
                        it was odd when she told me.  

                                      DAVID  
                                (snorting)  
                        Well, what?  Is she off her 
                        meds?  

                                      MOM  
                        I don t know, honey.  Maybe I 
                        just got the details wrong.  

      Concerned, David helps his mom negotiate a hillside path 
      that leads to a gravesite with a MILITARY HEADSTONE:  

                              LANCE CPL. PHILIP W. MURCH 
                              May 6, 1951 - Oct. 22, 1971 
                                Beloved Son and Brother 

      Mom places the flowers in a small urn at the head of the 
      grave and adjusts them to her liking.  Then she sets a 
      single chocolate truffle at the base of the urn.  

                                      MOM   
                        He liked chocolates.  

                                      DAVID  
                        You re making some little 
                        squirrel very happy.  

      David helps Mom to her feet.  He gives her a truffle from 
      the box and has one himself.  As the two of them stare 
      wistfully at the grave his cell phone rings again.  Twice.  

                                      MOM  

                                                23.  


                        Oh, go on.  You can answer it.  

                                      DAVID  
                        No.  It s just my ... it s a 
                        woman I ve been seeing.  On and 
                        off.  

                                      MOM  
                        Oh.  Have I heard about this 
                        one?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Actually, it s Jane Cleaver.  

                                      MOM  
                        From TV??  Oh, you be careful, 
                        hon.  She s what we used to call 
                        a skank.  

      They walk up a gently sloping hill to the car, which is 
      parked on a gravel access road that snakes through the 
      cemetery.  As David is helping his mom into the front seat, 
      something peculiar catches his eye.  

      He squints off into the distance.  Downhill, maybe a hundred 
      yards away, a FIGURE is hunched over a grave, flinging dirt 
      clods into the air.  It s almost sunset and the light is 
      bad, but he's plainly not an employee of the cemetery.  For 
      one thing, he doesn t have a shovel.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Hey, mom?  Wait here a minute.  

      A drunk?  A fraternity prankster?  David starts down the 
      hillside to get a closer look.  

                                      DAVID   
                        Hey!  Buddy!  What the hell are 
                        you doing?  

      The hunched figure turns to stare at David.  There s not 
      much skin covering his skull.  It's a UNIFORMED CORPSE.  

      And all at once, the corpse is up on its feet, coming right 
      at David.  For an agonizingly long moment David finds 
      himself rooted to the ground.  Finally he turns ...  

      ... just in time to see a SECOND FIGURE coming over the 
      crest of the hill, working its way down toward the car.  
      Toward David s mom.  He sprints up the hill shouting:  

                                      DAVID   
                        MOM!!  LOCK THE DOORS!!  

                                                24.  


      Uniformed Corpse #2 has a game leg.  Just as Mom is leaning 
      over to lock the driver s side door, the creature loses its 
      balance.  He hops downhill, picks up speed, and SPLAYS 
      HIMSELF across the hood of David s car.  

      As David slides in on the driver s side, Mom lets out a 
      nice, full-throated SCREAM.  The thing on the windshield 
      matches it with one of the plaintive, unearthly WAILS we ve 
      heard before.  David gets the engine running with Corpse #2 
      still clinging to the hood.  

      He hits the gas; Corpse #2 slides off onto the gravel.  But 
      now Corpse #1 has arrived to block the road; and as David 
      slows, trying to weave around him --  

      -- Corpse #2 sticks his arm through the partially-open 
      window and GRABS DAVID around the throat!  

      Gasping, David raises the electric window until the corpse's 
      arm is pinned between the door frame and the glass.  He 
      pulls the creature's hand away from his throat and, by 
      leaning over as far as he can to the right, manages to stay 
      out of its grasp as he drives.  He floors the pedal again.  

      As they speed toward the cemetery gates, the hand continues 
      to open and close, groping at David.  Mom points out the 
      window and SCREAMS AGAIN ...  

      ... because they seem to have left Corpse #2 behind some 
      time ago.  Now there's just a SEVERED ARM dangling from the 
      window -- detached from its owner, but still, apparently, 
      alive!  

      EXT. CEMETERY GATES - ON CAR - CONTINUOUS 

      David lowers the window just enough for the detached arm to 
      fall out onto the road.  The two Uniformed Corpses come 
      shambling into view just as David s taillights vanish 
      through the cemetery gates.  

      INT. CAR (MOVING) - SUNDOWN 

      Mom uncovers her ears, opens her eyes, and looks to David 
      for an explanation   more confused than frightened.  

                                      MOM  
                        What happened?  Those men   they 
                        looked like they were    






                                                25.  



                                      DAVID  
                        Look, mom, I don t know wha   
                                (catching himself)  
                        I don t know who they were, 
                        but we re safe now.  So just 
                        relax.  

      As he massages his bruised throat, his cell phone rings - 
      "Hail to the Chief", the POTUS tone. David and Mom both jump 
      an inch out of their seats.  

                                      DAVID   
                                  (froggy-voiced)  
                        Murch.  

                                      KURT RAND (O.S., 
                                      FILTER)  
                        David, we got us a little 
                        situation developing here.  If I 
                        tell you what it is, you gon  
                        think I m crazy.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Try me.  

      CUT TO:  

      INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - DAY 

        A windowless hallway in a secure subterranean facility not 
      far from Washington.  Kurt and David ride a golf cart past 
      MILITARY GUARDS who are standing watch beside each door.  

                                      DAVID  
                        All vets?  

                                      KURT  
                        Veterans of the current 
                          engagement, to be precise.  You 
                        know that little speech of yours 
                        about the soldier coming back?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Yeah...  

                                      KURT  
                        That one is no longer in heavy 
                        rotation.  

      The golf cart stops.  Kurt shows his ID to a guard - who 
      unlocks a panel on the wall, revealing a retinal scanner.  


                                                26.  


      INT. LAB - DAY 

      A hydraulic door hisses open.  David s jaw drops as Kurt 
      ushers him inside.  

                                      KURT  
                        David, I d like you to meet PFC 
                        Bobby Earl Beeler.  
                                (turning)  
                        Well say hi, peckerwood.  

      WHAT DAVID SEES: a legless soldier strapped to an upright 
      gurney.  There's a crater where his left eye was.  His torso 
      is full of bulletholes, incisions, ragged stab wounds.  His 
      rotting flesh is festooned with electrodes and wires 
      trailing off to vast banks of telemetric equipment.  

      Yet the poor bastard is plainly alive, in his own way, 
      staring at Kurt and David with his one working eye.  

                                      KURT   
                        Oh, sorry; you can t say hi, can 
                        you?  No vocal cords.  Could 
                        wave, though, if you had any 
                        manners.  
                              (to David)  
                        Private Beeler here died on the 
                        operating table. After which he 
                        kicked up a hell of a fuss.  

                                      DAVID  
                        How many of these ... cases ... 
                        are there?  

                                      KURT  
                         Bout two dozen that we know of.  
                        Word's getting around, but the 
                        papers are afraid to touch it 
                        'cause it's so damn lurid.      

                                      DAVID  
                        They re on the streets, Kurt.  
                        There s no hushing this one up.  

                                      KURT  
                        I figure we have a day or two. 
                        After that we'll need a good 
                        solid lie.  

                                      DAVID  
                        But what's happening?  How can a 
                        dead soldier get up and --  


                                                27.  


                                      KURT  
                        Don t know, buddy-roe.  That s 
                        why we got this lab.  Thing is, 
                        you can t kill  em, and God 
                        knows we ve tried ...  

      Kurt picks a sidearm off a lab table and SHOOTS the living 
      corpse twice in the chest at point-blank range.  The 
      creature WRITHES in obvious agony.  

                                      KURT   
                        Here.  You wanna try it?  

                                      DAVID  
                        No thanks.  

                                      KURT  
                        Shoot  em, they keep coming.  
                        Cut  em up, the pieces keep 
                        coming.  We amputated his leg, 
                        and you know what it did?  Damn 
                        thing kicked a doctor square in 
                        the ass! 

      Gasping and wheezing, the creature clutches at the fresh 
      wounds in its chest.  It stares balefully at David.  

                                      KURT   
                        Not to be premature, but I m 
                        thinking supernatural.  

                                      DAVID  
                        He feels it, Kurt.  He feels 
                        pain.  

                                      KURT  
                        Hell, he volunteered.  

      Bobby Earl SNARLS at Kurt.  Kurt snarls back. Then he throws 
      a tarp over the gurney and the patient. He picks up a can of 
      air freshener and fires off a few random spritzes.  












                                                28.  



                                      KURT   
                        Something to think about, huh?  
                        Soldier who can t be killed ... 
                        takes a lickin  and keeps on 
                        tickin  ...  
                                (chuckling)  
                        I mean, shoot, our recruitment 
                        numbers are in the sewer.  If we 
                        could keep the same dead G.I. s 
                        out on the battlefield -- 
                        forever -- that s like the 
                        answer to a prayer.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Kurt?  Why do you think they 
                        came back?  - What do you 
                        suppose they want?  

      Kurt chuckles.  Until now he hasn t thought to wonder about 
      it.  In fact he s just as happy not knowing.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        A day later, when the story 
                        broke wide, we found out what 
                        they wanted.  And 
                          coincidentally, we found out how 
                        to kill  em.  

      INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING    DAY 

      A number San Franciscans on their lunch hour are lined up 
      under a sign that reads:  

      EARLY VOTING HERE  
      1. Check in with Registrar (ID REQUIRED)  
      2. Read Printed Instructions  
      3. Cast Ballot Here ---->  

      Another line is waiting at the Registrar s Desk, which is 
      laid out like a series of tellers  windows at a bank.  A 
      CITY OFFICIAL directs traffic to and from VOTING BOOTHS in 
      b.g.   

      Everything is proceeding in an orderly fashion until:  

      HEADS TURN at the sound of a SHRIEK.  There appears to be 
      some kind of commotion in the building.  

      A HULKING DEAD MARINE stumbles down the broad central 
      stairway into the basement voting area, with a SECURITY 
      GUARD clinging to him like a barnacle, trying and failing to 
      hold him back.  

                                                29.  


      In no time flat, early voters are SCREAMING and SCATTERING.  

      The Security Guard draws his gun.  The Dead Marine claps a 
      hand under his jaw, lifts him off his feet, and HURLS HIM 
      bodily out of the room.  

      By now, the place has just about emptied out.  The only 
      people remaining are a pair of REGISTRARS behind the desk   
      an elderly MAN and a young WOMAN, not much past twenty.   

      The elderly fellow gallantly interposes himself between Dead 
      Marine and young woman.  But the young woman, staring into 
      the Dead Marine s glassy, vacant eyes, lets out a GASP OF 
        RECOGNITION:  

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR  
                        Robert ... ?  Robert Buntin??  

      Slowly, with some effort, the Dead Marine cracks a smile.   

      The young woman steps out from behind her colleague.  

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR   
                        Why are you here?  What do you 
                        want, Robert?  

      He points at the sign on the wall:  EARLY VOTING HERE.   

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR   
                        You want to vote.  Do you have 
                        your ID?  

      The Dead Marine rips the dogtags from around his neck and 
      drops them on the desk.  The young woman gathers up a packet 
      of materials and a ballot and passes them over to the late 
      Robert Buntin.  

      His rancid aroma is almost enough to make her gag, but she 
      remains polite and professional throughout.  

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR   
                        Do you need instructions?  You 
                        know how to use the punchcard?  
                        Then you can go right over 
                        there.  When you finish, put 
                        your ballot in the envelope, 
                        seal it, then drop the envelope 
                        right there in that box.  
                                (beat)  
                        It s ... good to see you, 
                        Robert.  

      With a nod of gratitude, Robert turns and stumbles toward 

                                                30.  


      the voting booth.  The elderly registrar, who has been 
      shaking and sweating uncontrollably throughout the above 
      exchange, hightails it out of the room --  

      -- passing, on his way out, the SECURITY GUARD, who has 
      returned with an ARMED COP for backup.  The Guard shouts at 
      the Young Woman Registrar:  

                                      SECURITY GUARD  
                        Where is he?!  

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR  
                        Over there.  He's voting.  

                                      SECURITY GUARD  
                        He's what?!?  

      On cue, Dead Robert exits the voting booth and drops his 
      ballot in a box. He lurches across the floor toward the 
      panicky trio in the doorway. The cop draws his sidearm...  

      ... but before he can shoot, Dead Robert collapses to the 
      floor like a marionette whose strings have been cut.  The 
      guard kneels, lifts Robert s arm, lets it fall limply at his 
      side.  Whatever spark animated him is plainly gone.  

                                      SECURITY GUARD   
                        He's dead.  Really dead, I mean.  

      The Young Woman Registrar kneels to touch Dead Robert's 
      face.  

      In death he wears a great big smile of satisfaction.  

                                      YOUNG WOMAN REGISTRAR  
                        Look at his face. He died happy.

      We re on the set of the Marty Clark show.  Poole, who 
      represents the slobbering religious right, is balanced by 
      Jane Cleaver, from the photogenic secular right.

                        In addition to the San Francisco

                        in Boston, in Detroit, in the

                        Well, Marty, far be it from me 
                        to offend members of a loser 
                        religion, but if I m an 
                          Islamofascist right now, I have 
                        to take this as an omen.  I 
                        mean, talk about Our God Is 
                        Bigger Than Your God ...

                        I m sure our atheist liberal 
                        friends are looking for a 
                        different way to spin it.  But 
                        if you remember what our 
                        President said a couple of weeks 
                        ago -- how he wished that our 
                        fallen soldiers could come back 
                        and tell us --

      Not far off, watching Jane s performance on a playback 
      monitor, are David, Kurt, and a six-foot-tall Texan woman 
      from POTUS s inner circle, KATHY HOBART.

                        sacrifice they made in this 
                        great cause -- that s exactly 
                        what we re seeing now.  Not even 
                        death will stop the march of 
                        freedom.

      David looks vaguely nauseous, but Kurt and Kathy are 
      beaming.   

      Kathy pokes David on the shoulder --

                        Which raises another point.  The 
                        Marine in San Francisco, the 
                        late Sgt. Robert Buntin, went to 
                        an early voting center and 
                        apparently cast a ballot for 
                        president.  Now Jane ... is that 
                        legal?  

      Jane screws up her face.  Long pause.

                        questions here: one, are these 
                        soldiers legally dead?  Is 
                        undead the same as dead?  And 
                        two ... this man is a hero, who

      Practically bursting with glee, Kurt high-fives Kathy.

                        we could put that gal in office?  

      David s head jerks around suddenly.  He finds the notion too 
      bizarre and horrifying even to contemplate.

                        Yeah, like you care.  

      Their attention returns to the monitor, where Jane is about 
      to deploy the punchline to her entire schtick:  

                                      JANE (ON MONITOR)  
                        If you want to talk about 
                        precedent, Marty, in Chicago, 
                        dead people have been voting 
                        since time began.  

      This gets a huge yock from Clark, the Reverend, and the 
      entire CAMERA CREW -- not to mention Kurt and Kathy.  David 
      is the only one not laughing.

                        Well, it jumped, and it bit.  
                        The dead wanted to vote, all 
                        right.  They just didn t want to 
                        vote for us.

      INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

      Jane on the sofa with chopsticks, eating Chinese food from a 
      to-go container.  The TV, as always, is on in B.G.  

                                      JANE  
                        I saw one of those things 
                        today...I was at Caffeine City 
                        and I looked out the window and 
                        God! There it was...I mean, I 
                        always liked guys in uniform, 
                        but only if they had, like, 
                        skin...  
                              (taking a bite)  
                        I think he knew me.  

      David is reading the Capitol Street Register and eating from 
      him own individual to-go container when his cell phone 
      rings   

    - the POTUS tone. He answers, and his eyes widen --  

                                      DAVID  
                        WHAT?  

      He snaps his phone shut, dives for the remote and starts 
      flipping through channels.  

                                      JANE  
                        HEY! My segment's on right after 
                        the --  

                                      DAVID  
                        Not now! -- We got a talker.  

      He finds the channel he wants and turns up the volume.  

                                        NEWSCASTER (ONSCREEN)  
                        -- first-ever video footage, 
                        from a campaign rally in 
                          Pennsylvania, where a Q & A 
                        session with Senator Shelly was 
                          interrupted by a Deceased 
                        Veteran.  

      IN CLOSEUP: SGT. THEODORE ARBUCKLE, croaking into a 
      microphone. He's more presentable than most undead vets; he 
      has a neat little bullet hole in the middle of his forehead.  





                                                35.

                        Have you seen men killed ... ?  

      CUT TO SEN. LAWRENCE SHELLY, standing behind his podium, 
      swallowing hard. He's never been quizzed by a corpse.  

                                      SEN. SHELLY (ONSCREEN)  
                        No.  No, I ...

                                        (ONSCREEN)  
                        I ve seen men killed ... for a 
                        lie.  Women, children killed ... 
                        for a lie.  I ve seen my friends 
                        killed ... for a lie.  
                                (beat)  
                        I was killed for a lie.  

                                      SEN. SHELLY (ONSCREEN)  
                        What is it you want, Sergeant?  

                                      SGT. ARBUCKLE 
                                        (ONSCREEN)  
                        We want one thing.  We want to 
                        vote.  And we will vote for 
                        anyone ... who ends this evil 
                        war.  

      For a moment, David and Jane stare at the tube with 
      identical slackjawed expressions as offscreen spectators 
      APPLAUD. Their heads turn in unison. They stare 
      apprehensively at one another.  

                                      JANE  
                        Bastard!!  

      CUT TO:  

      CLOSEUP - REV. LUTHER POOLE 

      At the cable studio, in his usual seat across from Marty 
      Clark, wattles jiggling with evangelical fervor.  








                                                36.  



                                      REV. POOLE  
                        Marty, it s as if the bowels of 
                        hell opened up and disgorged 
                        these demons in our midst, this 
                        Satanic devilspawn walking among 
                        us ... the end is at hand, and 
                        we had best beg God s 
                          forgiveness for the sin and the 
                        immorality that brought this 
                        plague upon our once-great 
                        nation.  

      INT. CABLE STUDIO - TIGHT ON MONITOR 

      SHAKY HANDHELD FOOTAGE of six or eight SOLDIERS in full 
      combat gear trying to force an uncooperative UNDEAD G.I. 
      into an armored vehicle.

                        We re looking at, I believe, 
                        Baltimore here, and as you know 
                        the government today declared 
                        zombie soldiers a public health 
                        threat pending further tests.  
                        How about it, Jane?  Do these 
                        deceased veterans have rights, 
                        and are they being violated?

                        The fact is, Marty, they ve 
                        studied these creatures, and 
                        they have no higher brain 
                        function.  Their intelligence 
                        level is basically that of a 
                        liberal.

                        As I ve always said: you stand 
                        by the law.  The law says 
                        deceased voters are supposed to 
                        be routinely purged from the 
                        voting rolls.

                        On top of which, Marty, these 
                        ... things ... they re 
                        turncoats.  They ve betrayed 
                        their country and their 
                        government and their fellow 
                        soldiers, and they re giving aid 
                        and comfort to the enemy.

                        dead, maybe they re not 
                        responsible.  Maybe they won t 
                        go to hell.  I don t know.

                        So what s the solution?  

                                      JANE  
                        Monsters, traitors, there s one 
                        solution for both.  Mobs ... 
                        torches ... pitchforks.

                        The face of this war had always 
                        been ugly. We'd always tried to 
                        hide it from the public...but 
                        then they were among us, these 
                        dead young men, these "monsters" 
                        -- demanding only that we look 
                        at that face, and acknowledge 
                        what we had done.  

      EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET   NIGHT 

      A ZOMBIE SOLDIER stumbles down the street in a TORRENTIAL 
      DOWNPOUR.  The OWNER of a small mom-&-pop lunch counter, 
      sweeping out the entry to his store, watches him pass.  

                                      MR. BAKER  
                        Son ... ?  Son?  

      The rain-soaked zombie stops in his tracks and gapes at Mr. 
      Baker.  He s not used to being addressed by the living.  

                                      BAKER (CONT.)  
                        You ought not to be out in that 
                        rain.  






                                                38.  



      INT. LUNCHEONETTE   A MINUTE LATER   NIGHT 

      The zombie soldier sits at a side table next to a heat vent.  
      BAKER drapes a blanket around his shoulders as his mildly-
      terrified WIFE looks on from behind the counter.  

                                      BAKER  
                        You ll be warm here for a bit.  
                        Do you want something to eat?  
                        We have some coffee if you    

      The zombie soldier laboriously shakes his head no.  

                                      BAKER (CONT.)  
                        We know what you ve, uh ... we 
                        just want you to know that 
                        someone does appreciate you.  We 
                        have a boy ... our Jim, he s 
                        over there too.  

      Before he knows it, Baker is crying.  

                                      BAKER  
                        We don t complain.  We know that 
                        some are called to duty.  But 
                        every night we pray that he ll 
                        come back to us... alive ... and 
                        --  

      A small RAT TERRIER comes out from behind the counter and 
      YIPS at the dead soldier.  The soldier extends a hand for 
      the dog to sniff, then scratches it behind the ear.  

                                      BAKER   
                        That's Beulah.  That's his dog.  

      A BELL TINKLES.  Two CUSTOMERS wander in from the rain.  
      They take one look at the dead soldier, let out a yelp, and 
      BOLT.  

      The soldier, embarrassed, starts to get to his feet.  But 
      Mr. Baker pats him on the shoulder.  

                                      BAKER (CONT.)  
                        No.  No, it s all right.  You 
                        stay here as long as you want 
                        ...  
                                (beat)  
                        What is your name, son?  

      The zombie soldier reaches into his shirt and holds up his 
      dog tags for Mr. Baker to inspect.  

                                                39.  


                                      BAKER (CONT.)   
                        Michael.  

      Mrs. Baker marches out from behind the counter and extends a 
      hand to dead Michael.  

                                      MRS. BAKER  
                        Michael, I m Irene.  Irene 
                        Baker.  

      The hand that Michael offers is gruesome   the flesh grayish 
      and starting to flake off.  But Mrs. Baker is made of sturdy 
      stuff.  She takes his hand and clasps it between her own.  

                                      MRS. BAKER   
                        Are you from around here, 
                        Michael?  

      INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS   NIGHT 

      It s been a long night, and although David and Kathy are 
      ready to pass out, Kurt is a bundle of demonic energy:

                        Goddammit, why don t they do

                        Every time you grab one, another 
                        one pops up.  We don t have the

                        damn National Guard s overseas!  
                        Meanwhile ...  

      Kurt grabs the morning paper off his desk and waves it in 
      David s face.  The headline reads:  POLL: PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR

                        What are you now, the zombie-
                        rights advocate?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Why not?  How many are there? 

                                      KATHY  
                        What is it, a couple hundred 
                        now?  They ll max out soon.  

                                      KURT  
                        Not necessarily.  We got quite a 
                        few dead ones we re keeping off 
                        the books.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Even so: a few hundred votes are 
                        not gonna swing a national 
                        election.  

                                        KATHY/KURT  
                              (in unison)  
                        Florida!!  

                                      DAVID  
                        Point withdrawn.  

                                      KURT  
                        It s not just their damn votes.  
                        It s all the live people they re 
                        getting to!  
                                (beat)  
                        Tell me something.  The military 
                        vote is ours.  Always.  How come 
                        we don t have a single dead 
                        soldier on our side?  

                                                41.  


      A moment of silence from David and Kathy.  Then:  

                                      DAVID  
                        If they died for a cause they 
                        believe in ... they re at peace.  
                        They ve got no reason to come 
                        back.  

      Kurt chews on this for a moment, decides it must be true.  

                                      KURT  
                        How d you know that?  

                                      DAVID  
                         Cause I started it all, 
                        remember?  If I had one wish?  

                                      KURT  
                        I wish you had that wish back.  
                                (beat)  
                        You know, if that s true ... the 
                        majority of dead soldiers 
                        support the war.  They haven t 
                        come back.  

                                      KATHY  
                        Tough sell, Kurt.   Look at all 
                        the soldiers who support our 
                        President by staying dead.   

                                      KURT  
                        Then GIVE ME AN IDEA.  The three 
                        of us sold a war, dammit!  We 
                        sold a war based on nothing but 
                        horseshit and elbow grease!  We 
                        are the best in the goddam GAME!  

      David finally   uncharacteristically   blows his top.  

                                      DAVID  
                        IT S NOT A GAME, Kurt!  Why do 
                        you think this is happening?  
                        Because WE sold a war based on 
                        nothing but horseshit and elbow 
                        grease.  And those poor 
                          motherfuckers DIED.  

                                      KURT  
                        Excuse me.  There is no 
                        defeatist rhetoric in this room. 
                        Hey!  Where are you going?  



                                                42.  



                                      DAVID  
                        I m gonna get drunk within an 
                        inch of my life.  Then I m gonna 
                        sleep eight hours straight ... 
                        while you go out and find a 
                        soldier who was proud to give 
                        his life for horseshit and elbow 
                        grease.  

      David has grabbed his coat and is frantically shoving papers 
      into his briefcase.  His hand is already on the doorknob 
      when Kurt says:  

                                      KURT  
                        Hold it.  
                                (beat)  
                        You know how to piss me off, but 
                        you are a goddamned genius.  

      INT. ZOMBIE INTERNMENT CAMP   DAY 

        A ten-foot-high chain-link fence, with razor wire at the 
      top.   

      Behind it, raggedy UNDEAD SOLDIERS shuffling listlessly 
      about (mostly with backs to the camera).  

      INT. JEEP   THAT MOMENT   DAY  

      Inside it: the unholy trinity of David, Kurt and Kathy.  

                                      KATHY  
                        Which one s him?  

                                      KURT  
                        They ll find him.  We keep 
                        records.  
                              (to David)  
                        Cheer up, Weepy.  You re finally 
                        gonna get your wish.  

                                      DAVID  
                        This blows, Kurt.  

                                      KURT  
                        See, I blame Mrs. Janet 
                        Hofstadter for all this.  Going 
                        on TV, mouthing off, making you 
                        cry like that ... well, that s 
                        her boy right there.  



                                                43.  



      A gate opens, and a half-dozen LIVE SOLDIERS lead a DEAD ONE 
      through it   on what looks like an improvised leash.  Poking 
      and prodding him with night sticks.  

                                      KURT   
                        Corporal Gordon Hofstadter.  Now 
                        how s that for symbolic value?  

      INT. LAB   DAY 

      POV SHOT: David, Kurt, Kathy, all wearing unnatural grins.  

                                      KURT  
                        How d you like to be on the 
                        Marty Clark show?  

      REVERSE ANGLE: the late Cpl. GORDON HOFSTADTER cocks a 
      single eyebrow in response.  We re in the same facility 
      where Kurt earlier introduced David to  Peckerwood.   TWO 
      ARMED SENTRIES stand guard by the door.  

                                      KATHY  
                        Can you talk, Corporal?  

      Dead Gordon nods yes.  

                                      KATHY   
                        Then may I ask, why don t you?  

                                      GORDON  
                        Hurts.  

                                      KATHY  
                        We do have a prepared statement.  
                        If it s more convenient, we 
                        could have someone read it for 
                        you on the show. And you could 
                        simply nod your head yes.  
                                (beat)  
                        Would you like to read it?  

      She holds out a one-page document.  Dead Gordon reaches into 
      his shirt pocket for a pair of glasses with the left lens  
      shot out.  We notice he has only THREE FINGERS on his left 
      hand -- thumb, pinky, index finger.  

      TIGHT ON THE EXPECTANT FACES of Kurt, Kathy and David as 
      Gordon scans the statement.  He looks up.  Snorts.  And lets 
      the paper slip to the floor.  




                                                44.  



                                      KURT  
                        So you don t support the war.  
                        You don t support the President.  
                        That d be too much to ask.  
                              (nodding his head)  
                        Why d you go to war, Corporal?  
                        To protect your homeland, your 
                        family ... to protect your loved 
                        ones, right?  Those are noble 
                        reasons.  
                              (pulling out a cell phone)  
                        What s the mom s number?  

                                      KATHY  

      Speed dial  one.   

      Kurt does as instructed and holds the phone to his ear.  

                                      KURT  
                        Rand here.  Put Mrs. Hofstadter 
                        on the line if you would.  
                              (to Gordon)  
                        Your mother would like to have a 
                        chat with you, Gordon.  

      Dead Gordon takes the phone.  We hear a voice:  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER (O.S., 
                                      FILTER)  
                        Gordon?  Honey?  Is it you?  

                                      GORDON  
                        Yeah, Ma.  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER (O.S., 
                                      FILTER)  
                        I love you, honey.  They said I 
                        could only have a second to 
                        speak to you.  But there s a 
                        paper they want you to sign?  It 
                        might be best if you signed it, 
                        honey.  But you should do what 
                        your conscience    

      Mrs. H. stops talking in mid-sentence.  Now OTHER VOICES are 
      audible in B.G.   too indistinct to make out.  Then Gordon s 
      mom comes back on the line:  





                                                45.  



                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER (O.S., 
                                      FILTER)  
                        It might be best if you signed 
                        it, Gordon.  There s so much I 
                        want to say, but   I m proud of 
                        you, honey.  I love you ...  

                                      GORDON  
                        I love you, Ma.  

                                      MRS. HOFSTADTER (O.S., 
                                      FILTER)  
                        I    

      A CLICK and a DIAL TONE.  Gordon listens for a moment, then 
      flips the phone shut and returns it to Kathy.  

                                      KURT  
                        Did your mom give you some good 
                        advice?  

      Gordon holds out his hand.  Kathy gives him the paper.  Kurt 
      reaches into his jacket for a pen, but as he s passing it to 
      Gordon ...  

      Gordon drops it.  

      Kurt leans over to pick it up.  

      With a BANSHEE S WAIL, Gordon flies out of his chair.  We 
      get a quick, almost subliminal shot of Kurt's bulging eyes, 
      his open mouth, as Gordon's THREE FINGERED HAND snakes out 
      toward his face.  

      As Kurt topples backward his FOOT catches an electrical 
      cord, pulling a table lamp to the floor ...  

      ON KATHY AND DAVID  

      KATHY SHRIEKS as the two of them back away in undisguised 
      horror.  The overturned lamp casts a shadow on the wall 
      behind them, showing us the action in silhouette:  

      Dead Gordon has two fingers buried up to the knuckles in 
      Kurt's eye sockets, a thumb jammed down his throat.  Holding 
      Kurt s skull in a bowling-ball grip, he SLAMS it repeatedly 
      into the nearby lab table.  

      The door hisses open and ARMED REINFORCEMENTS pour in.  It 
      takes three of them to pry Gordon off Kurt, but they finally 
      manage to drag him away.  The body slumps to the floor.  By 
      this point Kathy is on all fours SOBBING hysterically.  

                                                46.  


      David, strangely calm, reaches into Kathy s purse, fishes 
      out her cell phone and speed-dials  one.   

                                      DAVID  
                        Yeah.  You can let Mrs. 
                        Hofstadter go now.  I don t want 
                        her bothered any more.  
                          Understand?  
                                (beat)  
                        No.  This is David Murch.  Mr. 
                        Rand can t come to the phone.  

      INT. DAVID S BEDROOM   NIGHT 

      David has three TV sets in his bedroom, all tuned to cable 
      news shows, all showing the latest poll results.  He lies in 
      bed, on his back, staring up at the ceiling.  Jane is draped 
      all over him, twirling his chest hair.  

                                      DAVID  
                        I don t understand it.  Why me?  
                        Why did I have to be the ... the 
                        focus of all this??  

                                      JANE  
                        So awful about Kurt.  Just 
                        awful.  
                                (beat)  
                        I guess Kathy moves into his 
                        job.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Yeah, I guess.  

                                      JANE  
                        Who moves into her job?  

                                      DAVID  
                        ... Why do you ask?  

                                      JANE  
                        Oh, David, I want to be an 
                        insider.  I want to have real 
                        power, like you.  I m learning 
                        so much from you.  It s amazing 
                        even to me!  

                                      DAVID  
                        But Jane.  You re funny.  You re 
                          photogenic.  You re more useful 
                        in front of the cameras.  



                                                47.  



                                      JANE  
                        I m not going to be 39 forever.  

                                      DAVID  
                        You re 42.  

                                      JANE  
                        David, I want to be your 
                        prot g !  I want you to groom 
                        me.  

      He sighs distractedly.  He doesn t want to be having this 
      particular conversation at this particular time.  Jane 
      snuggles closer and reaches under the covers.  

                                      JANE (CONT.)  
                        Want me to kiss the dead Marine?  

                                      DAVID  
                        No.  

                                      JANE  
                        Is something wrong?

                        Jane   Kurt Rand was like a big 
                        brother to me, and I watched him 
                        die today.  I watched him die.  
                        I ve never seen anyone d   

      He FREEZES in mid-sentence   stunned, as if someone s just 
      dropped a sack of rocks on his head.  His eyes glaze over;  
      He shudders and begins to cry   just as he did on the Marty 
      Clark show the night it all began.  

                                      JANE  
                        Jesus.  What is it with you?  

                                      DAVID  
                        It s like there s an answer to 
                        all this.  And I know it s 
                        there, right in front of me, but 
                        I can t see it.  I can t quite 
                        put my hands on it.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        Of course I didn t have long to 
                        wait before the answer put its 
                        hands on me.

                        would contest the right of these 
                        brave men to vote.  And I resent 
                        that implication.  My brother

      Jane on the sofa, watching Marty Clark.  Her laptop is on 
      the coffee table nearby; she quickly types in the 
        LiberumArbitrium URL.  Her eyes widen.  Her jaw drops.

      INT. SUBURBAN DEN - DAY 

      A cozy, masculine room: big mahogany desk, built-in 
        bookshelves, etc.  Judging from the light layer of dust on 
      everything, it doesn't get much use these days.  David's Mom 
      stares out a window, avoiding his gaze ...  

                                      MOM  
                        We thought it was best for you, 
                        sweetie.

                        When Philip came home he was ... 
                        different.  I don t know if he d 
                        gotten into those drugs or what, 
                        but he wasn t Philip anymore.  

      David is standing a couple of paces away, listening 
        apprehensively.  His gaze goes inevitably to a wooden 
      HUMIDOR on the edge of the desk, and as he stares at it all 
      the color drains out of the scene, transporting us to:  

      INT. SUBURBAN DEN   DAY (B&W FLASHBACK) 

      A MAN S HAND opens the cigar box, plucks out three bullets, 
      and shoves them into the cylinder of a service revolver.  He 
      closes the cylinder and gives it a spin for luck.  

      PHILIP MURCH, 20, bearded, long-haired, dead-eyed, sits at 
      his father s desk contemplating the gun, passing it from 
      hand to hand -- just staring at it, for the longest time, as 
      if trying to make some kind of decision.  

      He swivels in his chair, and realizes that his four-year-old 
      brother DAVID, is in the doorway watching him.  

                                      PHILIP  
                        What s up, squirt?  

                                      YOUNG DAVID  
                        Momma said to help her carry the 
                        groceries.  

      Philip discreetly slips the gun and ammo into a drawer.  He 
      locks the drawer and tosses the key into the cigar box.  

                                      PHILIP  
                        Come on, big guy.  You help too.  

      He flashes David a peace sign, which David dutifully 
      returns.   

      The two of them exit together.  

                                                51.  


      Five seconds later, David reenters.  He makes a beeline for 
      the humidor; opens it; removes the key ...  

      CLOSEUP   DAVID (PRESENT-DAY) 

      Covering his face with both hands as his Mom continues the 
      story:

                        You would never have hurt 
                        Philip.  You worshipped him, 
                        David.  You had no way of 
                        knowing.  

      INT. SUBURBAN DEN   DAY (B&W FLASHBACK) 

      Philip returns to the den and freezes in the doorway.  David 
      is behind the desk, pointing the gun directly at him.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Halt!  Friend or foe?  

                                      PHILIP  
                        That s not funny, squirt.  Put 
                        the gun down.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Friend or foe?  

                                      PHILIP  
                        It s not a game, David. Put it 
                        down.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Friend or f   

      The gun goes off.  Philip crumples to the floor.  David, 
      giggling, runs over and nudges him with his foot.  

                                      DAVID (CONT.)  
                        You re dead.  Get up.  
                              (no reply)  
                        Get up!  

      David fires again, at point-blank range.  His mother appears 
      in the doorway and lets out a howl of agony.  

      EXT. CEMETERY   DAY (B&W FLASHBACK) 

      Post-funeral.  Mrs. Murch stares down at her elder son's 
      fresh grave, with young David at her side.

                                      DAVID  
                        I don t know, Mom.  I don t 
                        know.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        I d forgotten, all right.  
                        Mainly I forgot that you don t 
                        treat other people s lives as a 
                        game.  Now I had over a thousand 
                        Philips on my conscience.

      EXT. POLLING PLACE - DAY 

      CITIZENS arriving, standing on line to vote, with ZOMBIE 
      SOLDIERS waiting their turn like anyone else.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        But they voted.  I saw to that.  
                        I went in to POTUS and I gave 
                        him the sales pitch of my life 
                        ... and on election day, by God, 
                        they voted.  

      VARIOUS SHOTS of ZOMBIE HANDS as they punch cards, pulling 
      levers.  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        And when they d made their 
                        point, and their voices were 
                        heard ... they were finally at 
                        peace.  

      VOTERS look on as ZOMBIE SOLDIERS emerge from voting booths 
      and topple lifelessly to the ground.  

      INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS   EVENING 

      Kathy and David at a long table cluttered with laptops.  The 
      TV s are all tuned to election coverage.  

                                      MARTY CLARK  
                        Exit polls show the incumbent 
                        trailing in both of those key 
                        states.  And based on our latest 
                        electoral tally, he cannot 
                        afford to lose either one. This 
                        may well go down in history as 
                        the year of the Formerly 
                        Deceased Veteran.  

      Kathy sits bolt upright as new data arrives on her laptop.  

                                      KATHY  
                        We re down six in Ohio.  

                                      DAVID  
                        How about Florida?  

                                      KATHY  
                        Not quite as bad.  Bad enough.  
                        You played it wrong, David.  



                                                54.  



                                      DAVID  
                        I did what was right.  

                                      KATHY  
                        Well, you put us in a bad damn 
                        spot.   And now I have to make 
                        the call.  

      A long moment of silence as Kathy gathers her gear.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Do you really have to make the 
                        call?  

                                      KATHY  
                        What should I do? Let the other 
                        side steal this election?  

                                      DAVID  
                        Steal it? Jesus, Kathy, they won 
                        it.  

                                      KATHY  
                        No they haven't. Not yet. 
                        Because we count the votes. We 
                        do what's best for America, 
                        David, and if the voters 
                        disagree, well, that's their 
                        problem.  

      INT. CABLE STUDIO   NIGHT 

      Sleep-deprived Marty Clark stumbling around in front of a 
      giant ELECTORAL MAP.  

                                      CLARK  
                        It s a miracle comeback. With 
                        89% of precincts reporting, the 
                        President has pulled ahead in 
                        Ohio. Florida is now too close 
                        to call.  
                                (beat)  
                        The big story, of course, is 
                        what went wrong with all those 
                        exit polls that showed the 
                        incumbent going down to defeat. 
                        But let's not forget -- our news 
                        media have made the wrong call 
                        once or twice in the past as 
                        well!

      The famous photo of a grinning Harry Truman, holding up a 
      newspaper with the headline "DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN" in the 
      background  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        It was almost four AM before 
                        they finally called it.  Our 
                        side won.  

      EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 

        Confetti-covered REVELERS in party hats wander out of a 
      hotel ballroom onto the streets of downtown D.C.  Among them 
      are David and Jane   both half-smashed and giggly as they 
      make out at a bus stop.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Six weeks in Bora Bora.  That s 
                        what we need.  That ll fix us 
                        right up.  

                                      JANE  
                        I can t, David.  I have to ramp 
                        up.  Kathy wants me on the team!  

                                      DAVID  
                        Really.  Her old job?  

                                      JANE  
                        No, you dumb shit.  Yours!  

      David manages to conceal his surprise   just barely.  

                                      JANE (CONT.)  
                        She told me you were packing it 
                        in.  But can still be my mentor 
                        and spiritual adviser.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Jane!  You re so good to m   

      AN AWFUL, GHOSTLY KEENING NOISE FILLS THE AIR.  

      It s everywhere.  It s unavoidable.  PASSERSBY cover their 
      ears.  Jane and David do likewise.  

      EXT. MILITARY CEMEMTERY  (ESTABLISHING) 

      Row upon row of white military markers.  




                                                56.  



      EXT. MILITARY CEMETERY - NIGHT 

      TIGHT ON a military headstone.  A SKELETAL HAND bursts 
      through the sod before it.  Six feet away, another.  And 
      then a third ...  

      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL   THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 

      Up and down the street, PEDESTRIANS are reeling from the 
      omnipresent KEENING.  Jane is trying, with some difficulty, 
      to carry on a cell-phone conversation ...  

                                      JANE  
                        Kathy!  What is it?  What s 
                        happening?  

      INT. TOWN CAR - MOVING   THAT MOMENT 

      Kathy in the back seat, with SECRET SERVICE MEN on either 
      side.  

                                      KATHY  
                        I m about to catch a helicopter.  
                        And I advise you to get the fuck 
                        out of town till we figure it 
                        out.  

      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL   THAT MOMENT   NIGHT 

      The KEENING CONTINUES as Jane flips the phone shut and 
      shouts in David s ear.  

                                      JANE  
                        They re coming out of Arlington.  
                        All of  em.  World War II.  
                        Korea.  Vietnam ...  

                                      DAVID (V.O.)  
                        We said we'd count their votes, 
                        but we didn't.  We lied.  What 
                        were they going to do?  -- Well, 
                        they did what soldiers always 
                        do.  They called for 
                          reinforcements.

      EXT. ROAD   NIGHT 

      A deserted country road outside Washington, where a FIGURE 
      ON CRUTCHES is silhouetted by the headlights of an oncoming 
      car.   

                                                57.  


      The car SWERVES suddenly and PLOWS RIGHT INTO HIM.  

      A HORN BLARES.  A TROOP TRANSPORT rumbles into frame.  The 
      car veers off the road, crashes through a barrier, and slams 
      into a tree.  

      EXT. ROAD   ON JANE AND DAVID 

      Beside the wrecked car, with dead soldiers advancing on 
      them.   

      Jane aims her shotgun at the zombies while David reaches in 
      the trunk for an automatic.  

                                      JANE  
                        Get up, you pansies!  BRING IT 
                        ON!  

                                      DAVID  
                        I m sorry, Jane.  I never should 
                        have opened my mouth.  

      With that, he shoots her in the back of the head.  The 
      zombies keep on coming   so he lifts the gun to his temple, 
      closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger.  

      Click.  Empty clip.  

                                      DAVID   
                        Oh, shit.  

      And now the zombies are all around him.  But instead of 
      attacking, they MURMUR among themselves   examining David as 
      if he s some kind of exotic specimen.  One of them (with 
      working vocal cords) steps to the front of the group.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        You re the one who called us 
                        back.  

                                      DAVID  
                        That s right.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        You said we d have a voice.  But 
                        you betrayed us.  

                                      DAVID  
                        That s right.  I ve got it 
                        coming, okay?  And I m not 
                        afraid.  So go on.  Do what 
                        you re going to do!  


                                                58.  


      A long silence. Capt. Zombie smiles, admiring David s grit.  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        Help us.  

                                      DAVID  
                        How?  

                                      CAPT. ZOMBIE  
                        Join us.  We re looking for a 
                        few good men.  

      Now David spies an old corpse moving through the crowd.  
      It s little more than a skeleton, in tattered rags, with 
      bits of leathery skin clinging here and there.  With two 
      bony fingers it flashes him a PEACE SIGN.  

                                      SKELETON  
                        Hiya, squirt.  Long time no see.  

                                      DAVID  
                        Philip?!?  

                                      SKELETON  
                        You did your best, little 
                        brother.  I d be proud to fight 
                        beside you.  

      In a tender, brotherly gesture, Skeletal Philip claps his 
      claws on either side of David s head   and TWISTS it 
      suddenly, neatly snapping his brother s neck.
