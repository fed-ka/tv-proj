                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey Stan, where'd you get that black 
                         eye?

                                     STAN
                         Nothing... I mean, I mean, nowhere.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Your sister beat you up again, huh?

                                     STAN
                         NO!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (laughing)
                         Yup, your sister kicked your ass.

                                     STAN
                         She's just pissed off 'cause she got 
                         head gear at the dentist. She's taking 
                         it out on me.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, but that sucks you get your 
                         butt kicked by a girl Stan.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I would NEVER let a woman kick my 
                         ass! If she tried anything, I'd be 
                         like 'HEY! You get your bitch ass 
                         back in the kitchen and make me some 
                         pie!!'

                                     STAN
                         My parents don't even believe that 
                         she beats me up. They think she's 
                         all innocent and sweet. But I know 
                         that she's an evil bitch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Be a man, Stan. Just say 'HEY WOMAN! 
                         YOU, YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND MAKE 
                         BABIES!'

               Stan rolls his eyes.

                                     STAN
                         Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

               ZOOM OUT to reveal that Kyle has a full-grown African Elephant 
               on a leash.

                                     KYLE
                         You mean this one?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     KYLE
                         He's my new pet elephant.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whoa, dude, where'd you get a pet 
                         elephant?

                                     KYLE
                         I got it mail order from Africa. The 
                         ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, 
                         but it only took three.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, that's cool!

                                     KYLE
                         No it's not cool! My mom won't let 
                         me keep him in the house. She says 
                         he's too big. And that its poop is 
                         bigger than our couch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's why MY mom got ME a pot bellied 
                         pig. 'Cause it's poop is small.

               Cartman gestures with his hands.

                                     KENNY
                         Mmmh mph mhhph mmmam nmmm.

                                     KYLE
                         Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart 
                         like elephants.

               The bus pulls up to pick up the kids. The door flies open 
               and Mrs. Crabtree spots Kyle's Elephant.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT IS THAT 
                         THING?!

               Kyle and Stan look at each other.

                                     KYLE
                              (Whispering)
                         Uh, oh this is the new retarded kid.

               The elephant blinks.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh, I'm sorry, little girl...
                              (Pause)
                         But you still can't get on. You have 
                         to take the special Ed bus.

               WHIP PAN to the special Ed. bus. A little bus filled with 
               handicapped children (*NOTE -- This is REALLY funny.)

                                     KYLE
                         Boy, it looks like you're not welcome 
                         anywhere elephant. See ya.

               The boys get on the bus, leaving the elephant behind.

                                     CARTMAN
                         If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd 
                         say 'HEY! YOU GO DO MY LAUNDRY And...

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         SIT DOWN, KID!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes, ma'am.


               The boys stand outside an ominous building, Kyle with his 
               elephant and Cartman with his pig. The sign out front reads 
               "SOUTH PARK GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH." Below, in smaller 
               letters, it reads "Splicin' n' Dicin' fresh DNA since 1965."

               They stare at the building. Thunder and lightning crash.

                         This must be it.

                         Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess 
                         we should come back some other time.

                         No Cartman! We're going in there and 
                         splicing Fluffy and my elephant 
                         together.

               Fluffy whines a little.

                                     CARTMAN
                         It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them 
                         hurt you.

                         It's just a stupid pig.

                         ass kicked by a girl!

               Kenny laughs.

               The door suddenly FLIES open and Mr. Mephesto stands there.

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         Can I help you?

               The boys reel back in fear from Mephesto's presence.

                         We've got work to do Stan. I think 
                         it takes a while for an elephant to 
                         get drunk.

                         weapon against Shelley. The next

               Kyle walks off with Kenny.

                         Kyle I would kick you in the nuts.

               Cartman storms off leaving Stan alone.

               The boys and Fluffy are in the same clearing that the UFOs 
               were in, in ep. 102. The boys are feeding malt liquor to the 
               elephant from a keg they towed in on a red wagon.

                         Come on, Elephant! Keep drinking!

               The elephant tiredly slurps down the beer. It belches and 
               stumbles a little.

                                     STAN
                         Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to 
                         be to make sweet love to the pig?

               The elephant looks at Fluffy. From the elephant's POV:

               A blurred image of an ugly pig. The elephant cringes and 
               quickly starts drinking more beer.

                         Dammit! This is never gonna work!!

               Chef happens along.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello children. I thought I'd check 
                         and see how our little entrepreneurial 
                         venture is going.

                                     KYLE
                         Rotten! They're both really drunk, 
                         but they won't have sex.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, children. You can't just stick a 
                         drunk pig with a drunk elephant and 
                         expect them to do the mattress mambo. 
                         You need to set the mood.

               Chef pulls out a huge boom-box with a microphone attached. 
               He presses play, and very sexy, seductive music kicks in. 
               Landau and Fluffy prick up their ears.

                                     CHEF
                         Let me show you boys what I'm talking 
                         about.
                              (singing)
                         Tonight is right for love, you know. 
                         I wanna touch you where the lights 
                         don't go -- Tonight is right for 
                         love, love gravy. Expressing love so 
                         sweet, I wanna keep you burning like 
                         a dog in heat. Tonight is right for 
                         love, love gravy. Ladies and gentlemen 
                         Mr. Elton John...

                                     ELTON JOHN
                         Ooh tonight, all is right, ooh tonight 
                         is right for love, love gravy.

                                     CHEF
                         Thank you Elton... Tonight is right 
                         for love, love gravy.

               MONTAGE: SOUTH PARK HUMPING SEQUENCE


               As we hear Chef's music, we see through a window of a house, 
               a male and female silhouette gettin' busy.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, look! It's working!

               Landau drunkenly gets up on top of Fluffy.

                                     CHEF
                         Now children, gather 'round and watch 
                         the wonders of life, the beauty of 
                         mother nature.

               The boys all gather around Chef. From the expressions on 
               their faces, and the horrible NOISES that emerge, it is 
               apparent that Landau and Fluffy have started screwing.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, sick!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (crying)
                         Fluffy!!!

                                     CHEF
                         Hmmm, now I know how all those white 
                         women must have felt.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #2


               The boys and Chef watch eagerly, waiting for Landau and Fluffy 
               to wake up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, they will. But it's gonna be one 
                         ugly sight!

                                     STAN
                         I thought you said the wonder of 
                         mother nature was a beautiful thing.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. When does mother nature go 
                         from "beautiful" to "ugly"?

                                     CHEF
                         Usually about 9:30 in the morning, 
                         children.

               Landau groggily opens his eyes and yawns.

                                     CHEF
                         Uh oh! Here we go!

               Landau seems to be okay, until he rolls over and sees the 
               pig that he slept with last night. He SCREAMS wildly!

                                     CHEF
                              (very sympathetic)
                         Yeah, there's nothing worse than 
                         getting all drunk and waking up the 
                         next morning next to a pig, or a big 
                         fat elephant.

               Now Fluffy wakes up. When she sees that she is in bed with 
               an elephant, she slaps her forehead with her little hoof and 
               sighs.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

                                     CHEF
                         Well, boys, we might not know that 
                         for a couple of days.

                                     KYLE
                         A couple of days? But Terrance is 
                         going to have his human clone by 
                         tomorrow!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well good job Einstein! Why don't we 
                         just build a rocket in the mean time?!

               Kyle WHACKS Cartman.

               Mr. Mephesto appears suddenly.

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         Oh thank Bhudda, I've found you boys. 
                         You must tell me, have you seen 
                         anything odd lately?

                                     STAN
                         Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with 
                         a pig.

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         No, no I said "odd."

                                     CHEF
                         Hey, you're that crazy cracker from 
                         up on the hill.

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         Sir! If making mutant animals spliced 
                         with humans is crazy, then... uh... 
                         never mind.

               Chef takes this in for a moment, then

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         I'm afraid there's been a bit of an 
                         incident at the ranch. You see, I've 
                         created a large, mutant clone of 
                         that little boy there, and he's broken 
                         free.

               The kids eyes open wide!

                                     KENNY
                         Mph mph mmph.

                                     STAN
                         A big mutant version of me?!

                                     KYLE
                         Is he bigger than a regular clone?!

                                     MR. MEPHESTO
                         He's terribly dangerous. His brain 
                         is identical to yours. I need you to 
                         help me find him!

               Stan has a huge smile on his face.


               Big mutant Stan is wreaking havoc in downtown South Park.

               He's destroying buildings. People run and scream in terror. 
               Big Stan picks up a car and tosses it like a football. Mr. 
               Garrison comes around a corner.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Stan, are you wearing a different 
                         hat?

                                     BIG STAN
                         Cha waaha waah.

               The Stan thing grabs Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         HEY! I know a certain young man who 
                         is itching for detention!

                                     BIG STAN
                         Haa Cheww weee.

               Big Stan throws Mr. Garrison through Jimbo's Gun shop window.

               Meanwhile, Stan leads the other boys in the search for Big 
               Stan.

                                     STAN
                         How big do you think he is? I bet he 
                         weighs FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, Stan! Don't you even know 
                         where you would go?

                                     KENNY
                              (pointing)

                         Oh my God!

               The boys see Big Stan carrying a few innocent people. He 
               disappears around a corner.


               Officer Barbrady directs traffic amidst the chaos. The kids 
               run up to him.

                                     STAN

                         You boys have been watching the X 
                         files too much. There's no such thing 
                         as --

               Suddenly, the evil Stan grabs Barbrady by the throat and 
               tosses him into Starks' Pond.

                                     KYLE

                         There you are! Stanly, you tore up 
                         my entire gun shop! You better have 
                         a GOOD explanation for this Mister!

                         evil genetic clone.

               Mr. Garrison appears.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Stanly! What the hell has gotten 
                         into you? You have got severe 
                         lunchroom duty Mister!

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm gonna have a word with your father 
                         Stanley.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yeah, you wait 'till your father 
                         hears about this.

                         Wait Stan! There he goes!

               Evil Stan starts to walks away.

                         STOP!!

               The Stan thing turns and looks at Stan oddly.

                         calm down.

               Evil Stan now turns his head. He rests and sits down.
