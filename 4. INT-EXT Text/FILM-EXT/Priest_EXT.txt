Dust swirls in nasty tangles.
A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in
overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned
face, the windmill looming above him.
in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the
earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil.
Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in
the doorway of his CABIN.
He smiles, waving to her. His wife.
The CYCLES circle the house, kicking up dust in sheets.
The cycles cut their engines, headlights centered on the
house. A blistering spotlight.
It's quiet.
The RIDERS step from their machines. We don't get a look at
their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and
windmill, SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders.
The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop.
11U. OUTPOST 10 r- SAME
The power goes out, everything going black.
LUCY
(TERRIFIED)
Daddy?
7.
We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house.
Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds.
Then the worst sound of all. Wood being torn apart.
BLAM! BLAN! Aaron SHOOTS like crazy, the white light MUZZLE
FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the house.
BLACK BODIES blown back. Shrieking. Everything happening
lightening fast.
Finally, the gun clicks empty and we're plunged back into
darkness.
THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON
Aaron is still standing, the house in shambles around him.
He's alone.
AARON
SHANNON!
From outside we hear the cycles revving.
Aaron runs to the door. Rips off the board in time to see --
The motorcycles racing away, a cloud of dust in their wake.
Aaron runs after but TRIPS on --
SHANNON
Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene'
angle. He brushes back her hair --
ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck.
Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for
AARON
LUCY!
He keeps screaming but it's no use -- as the-motorcycles fade
in the night he knows --
They've taken her.
The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain. it
turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into --
8.
The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A
seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with
soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and
stretch.
A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS
Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a
massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying
another day's toll.
A TATTOOED FIGURE
moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way.
They do this not out of respect. . .but fear.
We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES --
Shaved head.
Eyes like nail guns.
Tendons clenching over muscle.
As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it.
He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with.
surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness
to them. Malignant.
The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head --
Something's caught his attention...
We move through trash and shadow finding --
A gang of FACTORY WORKERS, uniformed, surrounding a GIRL
(12).
Their LEADER holds her close, BUTCHER KNIFE at her
throat. Mouth at her ear.
LEADER
Go ahead ...scream.
(SMILES)
Scream for daddy.
He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at
the head of the alley.
9.
LEADER (CONT'D)
Looks like daddy's already here.
(points the knife)
Well, then. Come on daddy...make it
better.
The Figure steps into a pool of white light, giving us our
first good look at him --
A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e. Across
the eyes and down the center.
The Mark Of The Priest.
LEADER (CONT'D)
(LAUGHS)
A Priest! Well, lookie here.. We got us
a real life war-hero boysl Heard you
guys were real baddasses.
The Workers all pull out large knives.
LEADER (CONT'D)
Guess we'll find out.
They move in on Priest, chemicals burning in their blood,
mouths leering.
Priest folds his hands into the prayer position.
The Workers look at each other. Laugh.
WORKER #1-
What's he gonna do. . .BLESS us to death?
VOOMI -- There's a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic
equivalent of a back flip and --
Pries is holding their knives.
Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet.
They HOWL, pinned to the concrete.
Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the
brick wall as Priest moves towards him.
LEADER
This ain't the war no more. You got no
right meddlin'.
(BEAT)
You don't belong here -- You ain't one of
us.
10.
And with that he RAISES the blade to the girl's throat --
C
WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR. The leader looks at the
girl's neck, his blade's gone.
So is his hand.
Priest holds the severed limb, its fingers still clutching
the blade. The Leader collapses, a Holy Shitl expression
frozen on his face.
THE GIRL
Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the
workers.
He turns to her, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how --
She flinches and runs away, disappearing into the street.
A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand,
wiping it off. Tucks it in his waistband.
He moves on.
Gone to seed. The once proud house of God now a sad
collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass.
Magnificent.
At the Cities center, a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND
.CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the
metropolis.
HOMELESS stand single file, wrapped around the corner, black
flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonight's supper.
Priest standing in front of a STEEL DOOR. Hasn't been opened
for some time.
PRIEST (O.S.)
I want so much to firmly resolve with the
help of your grace to sin no more and to
.avoid the near occasions of sin.
An ENGINE ROARS, RUMBLES, idling... a throaty GURGLE... Priest
pulls out on a
BLACK MOTORCYCLE
if this thing were a horse it'd be the ultimate stallion--
Pulse engine. Nitrous. The works. A panel of black titanium
solar cells covers the bike like armor.
He races onto the street.
Sheets of rain fall like lead. Pooling in the gutters.
PRIEST (O.S.)
All I can do is ask for forgiveness for
what is yet to come...
21.
The cycle knifes through the city. Expertly working his way
through congested streets. Moving past tent cities,
stockyards and rusty industrial machinery.
We see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the
city. Priest pulls up to a CHECKPOINT TOWER. A PHALANX OF
GUARDS with big shotguns at the ready, snapping into place.
Mugs like anvils.
PRIEST (O.S.)
I now know the devil lives within me.
The sins coming all too easy...
Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking
our view as we CUT TO:
THE MASSIVE DOOR/WALL sliding open with a KLANG1 revealing
the wasteland.
PRIEST (0.3.)
And all too frequently.
Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors. UNCONSCIOUS
BODIES left in his wake.
CUT TO:
Blazing sun. An endless plain of cracked earth. Nothing
around anywhere...
VROOMI
Priest's cycle streaks across the salt flats. It's glorious.
Priest rides past a line of ANCIENT STATUES dominating the
landscape, each representing one of the seven deadly sins,
sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland.
He FLOORS it, the bike PUNCHING for the horizon, a thick plume
of dust funneling behind it...
CUT TO:
22.
It's quiet, Just the sound of the rusty windmill. The only
light provided by the moon reflecting off Priest's cycle,
he's just arrived.
He crouches, examining,a fresh TIRE TREAD. He stares, taking in
the landscap e, feeling it.
Then he steps inside the cabin --
Hicks and Priest ride in tandem across the plain. Hicks'
bike a standard police vehicle, nothing fancy but reliable.
They head towards town, passing aWOODEN SIGN`--
HALBRIDGE
At a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from
an old western.
TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man
pitching his wares before a painted van reading DR. TOMLIN'S
MEDICINE SHOW. TRANCE MUSIC wafts from the nearby saloon.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
Do I ask for three dollars?' Do I ask for
two dollars? No folks! ONE dollar! One
piece of tin and protection is yours!
PRIEST AND HICKS
Pull up in front of the Jail. Hicks eyes the salesman,
coolly dismounts and adjusts his hat.
HICKS
Scuse me a minute,
He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
Vampires are a deadly lot! YOU could be
next I I seen a Blackblood bite a man
like a gingersnap! The only sure way to
be safe is a bag of DR. TOMLIN' S WONDER
POWDERT
(holds up a sack)
If you care about your loved ones then
you MUST have this amazing elixir in your
homes tonight --
WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and
pins it to a nearby wall with a THUNK.
Hicks steps to the front of the crowd. it's his knife.
HICKS
You best get in that van and clear on
out, mister.
24.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
For what reasons? I'm a legitimate
business man.
Hicks PULLS his SIX-SHOOTER, cocks it.
HICKS
I got six right here.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
Sheriff, I am shocked you can be.so
cavalier with the safety of your
TOWNFOLK --
HAM! A bullet blows out the van's headlight.
HICKS
That's one.
KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Two.
Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares,
scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a
look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle
and quickly PEELS away.
Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the
crowd.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Now you all listen up. This bag ain't
good fornothin' but linin' that man's
pockets with your hard earned money.
Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their
sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER,
steps up.
CROCKER
You don't know'that. You're just a kid.
HICKS
I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry
barkers. He ain't no better.
CROCKER
But what if he's right?
Hicks tosses the sack to Crocker.
25.
HICKS
Take a look.
(Crocker does, the contents
spilling to the ground)
Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a
little garlic.. Oldest trick in the
WASTELAND:
(TO EVERYONE)
Now I don't blame you for bein' afraid.
But those vampires headed clear .on out
and they ain't comin' back.
WOMAN
And what about the girl?
Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.
HICKS
I filed a report with the Cities last
night. I'm sure they're Join' all they
can.
The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over
to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,.
pointing and whispering at him.
A BLIND GRAVEDIGGER plays an old.SQQUEEZEBOX, hands expertly
working the bellows. He's done this for every.,funeral in
Halbridge for the last fifty years. The sad music drifts
across the wasteland.
SHANNON'S COFFIN
Lies in a freshly dug hole. Priest sprinkles dirt across.the
casket, offering prayers.
Aaron watches,. silently. A GROUP OF TOWNSPEOPLE encircle the
grave. Everyone wearing black goggles for protection from
the swirling dust.
HICKS
Stands apart from the others, hat in his hands. His eyes
focused on Priest. Not even watching as --
Aaron plants the RUBY RED FLOWER at the head of the grave.
Its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland.
CUT TO:
27.
The sky is brightening, the edge of the world turning white.
Sunlight hits Shannon's grave, the CROSS MARKER casting a
shadow, the once glorious red flower already withered.
Aaron watches the sunrise, some other time he would've been
moved by the sight, maybe even cried. This morning... nothing.
Priest is beside him.
AARON
You never talked much about the war
but I know you saw things. Bad things.
PRIEST
Yes.
AARON
What'd you do...to make yourself unsee
`em? To make it stop playing in your
head?
PRIEST
I prayed.
AARON
Did it help?
Priest doesn't answer, the question hanging overhead, a dark
cloud.
AARON (CONT'D)
I never used to be much on faith. You
KNOW THAT
(THINKS)
But then Lucy was born. .and as soon as I
saw her I knew. I Just knew -- There's
no way something so perfect came from me.
She was a gift. From God.
(looks at Priest)
You find her. Whatever it takes. Find
Lucy.
33.
Priest nods, his brother's eyes burning into him. Hearing the
sound of an engine, both men turn to find Hicks pulling up.
HICKS
Didn't mean to be late -- My deputies are
a little green about keepin' the peace
all by their lonesome. Needed a pep
talk.
(TO PRIEST)
Figure I'll ride point. I know my way
`round the Wasteland better than just
`bout anyone. '
Without so much as a word, Priest climbs on his cycle and
kick starts it, the engine REVVING to life.
VROOMI off he goes. Hicks can't help but laugh.
HICKS (CONT'D)
(TO AARON)
Real charmer, your brother.
AARON
That's just his way. Don't pay it no
mind.
(BEAT)
You just bring back my baby.
Hicks nods. Then he REVS the throttle, speeding after Priest.
Aaron.,.watching until their cycles are just distant specs.
CUT TO:
A SERIES OF SHOTS as Priest and Hicks BLAST across the barren
wasteland. They make a strange pair, not exactly Butch and
SUNDANCE:
A. THUNDERING past Strange ROCK FORMATIONS, bizarre shadows
cast across the plains.
B. A group of WANDERING MONKS, holy men carrying offerings to
the desert, bow as they race by.
C.- We.see a PHOTO OF LUCY now stuck to Hicks' windscreen.
CUT TO:
Astride their bikes, Priest and Hicks, look down at a valley.
A SERIES OF ADOBES sit clustered in the basin. CRYPTS.
34.
HICKS
The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't
nothin' but red-outs and rejects.
They're a fallen tribe.
PRIEST
Either way. We have two hours to get in
and out.
HICKS
What happens in two hours?
PRIEST
Sundown.
Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the
horizon.
CUT TO:
Priest and Hicks enter engines idling, flocks of chickens run
riot underneath their tires CLUCKING. wildly. Crumbling
structures. Squalor.
HICKS
This is how most of the reservations are
these days.
We see faces peering out from wooden slats. Gaunt,: lifeless
eyes. These'are FAMILIARS.
PRIEST
Familiars are illegal.
HICKS
Nobody really enforces it. most come
from the fringes. Drifters. They're
creepy as all hell -- but harmless.
They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping
awkwardly between the chickens.
A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin.
His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a
chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the
container.
His voice a hissing rasp.
S
35.
FAMILIAR
Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What
brings you to Nightshade?
HICKS
We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They
woulda' came through here a couple nights
ago.
FAMILIAR
Nobody comes through Nightshade. That's
the way we like it. Nice and quiet.
HICKS
Then you won't mind if we have a look
around?
The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher
knife.
FAMILIAR
Not at all.
CHOPI The head clatters to the ground.
CUT TO:
Priest and Hicks move through the reservation looking for
clues. Priest goes to the nearest structure, TWO EYES peer
from a tiny slat. The CRYPT'S FAMILIAR.
PRIEST
We're not going to find anything out
here...We have to get into the crypts.
HICKS
Not supposed: to do that without a warrant --
BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in.
We hear the Familiar SCREECH as Priest steps inside --
CRYPT FAMILIAR
THE MASTERS ARE AWAKING
BLACK SHAPES
BURST from the crypt doorways SCREECHING as they fly into the
air. Circling above the reservation like a nest of angry
hornets. Disturbed.
WHOOSH! One of the figures SWOOPS low, touching to the
ground. Giving us our first good look at a vampire;
Wet, white skin.
Insect clicking claws.
Black eyes.
Fangs.
More creature than human.
The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a
series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily.
LEAD VAMPIRE
What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't
you already done enough?
PRIEST
We don't want a fight. We're just
looking for the girl.
The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one
by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're
scraggly, a little undernourished.
LEAD VAMPIRE
Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to
feed off the blood of animals. We once
scoured 'this land. We were warriors...we
were Gods!
PRIEST
You were murderers.
LEAD VAMPIRE
We were what nature made us.
(flashes his fangs)
I recommend you leave immediately...You
are not welcome here.
40.
ONE BLACK FIGURE still flies above. Like a vulture, it
circles Hicks. Marking him.
PRIEST
We're not going anywhere until you tell
us where she is.
LEAD VAMPIRE
Then you aren't going anywhere,.
If there was a tumbleweed in the vicinity this is when it would
blow by. A tense BEAT then. . .Priest pulls out a BLACK BOOK.
PRIEST
,,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The
Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- "
The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting.
LEAD VAMPIRE
--'Your words mean nothing to us, Priest.
And now we see the book's actually hollow on the inside,
filled with dozens of .little STAR-METAL CROSSES.
PRIEST
1 - 6 (WHISPERS)
Forgive me.
in one quick motion Priest scoops a handful, snapping his
WRIST AND
THE CROSSES
CUT through the air, heading straight for the BLACK FIGURE.
S t SOUEAL.S as the metals; it like hot goals through
1 err tC erina it apart, the pieces raining' down around
Hicks, crashing to the ground.
And then all hell breaks loose.
The Nightshade Vampires hiss. Bearing their fangs like
cobras and taking to the air with a SHRIEK. Attacking.
Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly,
chasing the creatures with his gunfire. His bullets
whistling harmlessly through the air.
WHOOSH! A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws
ready to rip.
PRIEST
41.
Leaps at the creature just in time, driving it to the ground.
in one brutal motion he. straddles it, twisting its head at a
horrible angle.
He turns to Hicks.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
FOCUS.
And with that he's gone, rolling across the ground like a
boulder and LEAPING at TWO DARTING VAMPIRES.
HICKS
Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death
spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy
until finally all life drains away.
HICKS
(under his breath)
Jesus.
Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling
across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping.
Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as
it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty
shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a
shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat.
He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster.
This leaves only
THE LEAD VAMPIRE
Perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle, raging at Priest and
Hicks from the depths of hell with at HORRIBLE SHRIEK.
In full fury, he LEAPS and flies away, the sounds of his
torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the
night sky.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Should we go after him?
PRIEST
No need. He'll the at first light.
Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground.
They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that
mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of
the neck.
42.
10 PRIEST (CONT'D)
No more masters. Just you and me.
He raises a knife, pressing it to the Familiar's skin.
FAMILIAR
(frightened beyond belief)
-- The metal beast! She's in the metal
beast!
PRIEST
Make 'sense.
FAMILIAR
(JABBERING)
The smoke. Look for the smoke --
SHARP CLAWS
Suddenly RIP across Priest's back! It's the Lead Vampire,
back for more. Claws digging into flesh.
Priest wrenches around and the two go at it. A fierce, feral
battle. The Vampire's fangs chattering inches from his neck.
Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the
Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies,
killing them instantly.
THE VAMPIRE
Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall,
flying in after him. We hear the sounds of a BATTLE ROYALE
from inside. WHUMPI WHUMPI WHUMP! The walls buckle outward,
sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed.
Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly...,s  g.
Hicks takes a step towards the crypt. Gun leveled. But --
PRIEST
Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in
his hand dangling by its hair.
He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing
up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved.
CUT TO:

43.
A giant PYRE lights up the night, fed with the bodies of both
Familiars and Vampires, Priest and Hicks silhouetted against
the flames.
The two are silent, grimly going about their task -- It's
obvious the skirmish has affected Hicks. Priest notices.
PRIEST
How's your arm?
HICKS
Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that
deep.
(fingering the bandage)
Don't know what got into those Familiars
to attack like that. They're usually
harmless.
Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand,
tucks it in his waistband.
PRIEST
Usually.
A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension
hanging between them. Then -
HICKS
You did this on purpose, didn't you? You
knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown.
You wanted this to happen.
PRIEST
You don't have the stomach for it --head
back to Haibridge right now.
Hicks glares at Priest.
HICKS
The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers
two years. Even fought in the Boondock
Uprising...I saw some crazy things.
HORRIBLE THINGS
(SOFTER)
I just ain't never seen anything like
this.
PRIEST
Killing a vampire isn't like killing a
man. They come at'you like an animal.
Tooth for tooth.
.(MORE)
44.
'PRIEST (CON'Y'' D)
Claw for claw -- Blood, skin, bones.
6 They take all of it.
(BEAT)
If you let `em.
Hicks studies Priest, in the firelight he looks tired. Old
even.
HICKS
it comes easy to you... don't it?
PRIEST
What?
HICKS
Killin'.
PRIEST
it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do
with it.
He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies.
Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down.
PRIEST (CONT' D)
I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I
know I've done more than my share --
Whatever they do to me I have it coming.
HICKS
(REALIZING)
You think they took her because of
you... don't you?
Priest stands. Cracks his neck.
PRIEST
Give me your gun.
HICKS
What?
PRIEST
Give me your gun.
HICKS
Why? You gonna shoot me now?
Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six
shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers,
giving it a quick spin.
0
45.
PRIEST
Don't anticipate the trajectory of your
target. Know it.
He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF
ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES,
the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks.
HICKS
You're teaching me to shoot?
PRIEST
I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No
more wild shots --
HICKS
My ass I In case you didn't notice I was
pretty damn good out there! And I sure
as hell didn't see you doin' much when I
had that blade buried in my arm.
(SPITS)
Must've been too busy "focusing".
Priest hands the gun back to Hicks.
PRIEST
There's always-two points. A and B.
Know the points and you'll know your
target.
HICKS
Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.
PRIEST
I see ten crypts ...but only eight
vampires. We find the missing, we'll
find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?
HICKS
Jericho. It's clear across the Plains.
Gonna be a rough ride.
PRIEST
Then you better get a good night's sleep.
This bunch was easy, their bloodlines
watered down by man.
(BEAT)
Whoever took Lucy was a whole different
breed.
He tosses another body on the fire, tiny sparks floating into
the night as --
46.
We hear the Banshee call of a STEAM WHISTLE, sharp and shrill
as we CUT TO:
A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
Bearing down like death itself, teeth of the behemoth's grill
leering: like a skull. Thick clouds of heavy smoke burst from
its blast pipe, rails SQUEALING as the train RACES past.
There re no Windows, just an unblinking black juggernaut,
midnight willed into.a steel and iron frame. Terrifying.
ENGINES SCREAMING Priest and Hicks BLAZE across the playa.
A SERIES OF SHOTS
WE WATCH as the sun crests the horizon and rises quickly
across the sky. Clouds whip past at incredible speeds, time
unfolding like a hallucinogenic until we're faced with --
THE PLAINS
They sit parked on a bluff, the emptiness making Hick's eyes
ache. A more desolate view couldn't be found in all of hell.
HICKS
Walkin' Pete talked about this place --
said it. used to be really somethin'.
Everythin' growin' green as a goddamn
dollar bill.
(snorts).
'Course we had to go and screw it up by
poisonin' everythin' -- nothin' pretty
survives this world ...nothin' decent
anyways.
(FROWNS)
Just wish I could'a seen it.
49.
Priest pulls out a canteen of water, takes a sip. Hands it
k7) to Hicks.
PRIEST
How's your arm?
HICKS
(hiding it from him)
Sore. Cut's still open.
As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm
it's completely healed. Not even a scar.
PRIEST
You're a halfbreed.
A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in
a voice just below his breath.
HICKS
My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody
knows -- It's recessive in my family. No
bloodthirst. No light sensitivity. I'm
not proud... but it's a part of me. Ain't
nothin' I can do.
(looks at Priest)
I woulda told you...just didn't want you
treatin' me no different.
It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then
Priest REVS his cycle; a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds
away. HOLD ON HICKS -- Eyes stinging, he watches Priest.
Finally he starts his bike, following.
A SERIES OF SHOTS AS -
A. Priest inspects a TIRE TREAD in the sand, a cluster of
clouds gathering in the sky behind him.
B. A PAIR OF CRACKED BLACK GOGGLES half-buried in the dust.
The kind used by a motorcycle rider.
C. Hicks pulls a TORN PIECE OF CLOTHING (LUCY'SDRESS?)
stashed in a rock crevice, he holds it up to Priest, GUNNING
his engine as we CUT TO --
50.
Priest and Hicks' BARRELING through the dust. Up ahead,
something materializes in the desert --
A TIN STRUCTURE
Must be a mirage. Hicks blinks, can't believe his eyes. It
looks abandoned.
HICKS
Gotta be a desert rat.
They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety
structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching.
Carefully.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way
of cookin' these people's brains so they
ain't quite right -
BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet.
VOICE (0.3.)
Hold it right there, mistert
Hicks freezes.
A BEAT as. the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden
in shadow...thenan OLD MAN emerges, Rifle in hand. He COCKS
it, making a bead for Hick's head.
OLD MAN
Take another step and you'll be meetin'
the Lord directly.
HICKS
Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff.
The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it
sizzles when it hits the dust.
OLD MAN
Ain't no law out here but my own.
Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze.
THE MAN'S EYES WIDEN
Seeing Priest clearly now for the first time.
51.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
Praise The Lord.
Total attitude adjustment. He lowers the Rifle and smiles --
revealing a gap tooth smile wide enough to drive a herd of
cattle through.
CUT TO:
The boys mounting up their bikes, about to head out. The old man
approaches Priest.
OLD MAN
Wait! I want you to have somethin'
before you go
He presses a HOMEMADE CROSS into Priest's hand. It's a real
beauty, flecked with colored stones. A lot of love and care
went into this one.
54.
OLD MAN (CONT' D)
Remember, a man comes into this world
with one thing. His soul. He's lucky if
he's still got it when he leaves.
Priest pockets the cross, REVVING his cycle and with a final
nod -- he and Hicks speed into the wasteland. The old man
watches, his cracked face squinting as the sun flashes off
the metal of the machines.
CUT TO:
The vampire train shooting down the track, blown tumbleweeds
catching the scrub brush as it races by.
A sad collection of crumbling stone walls and turrets. All the
more surreal for rising up in the absolute nothing of the
wasteland.

55.
Priest and Hicks stand, surveying the ancient ruin. Hicks
can't help but laugh.
HICKS
(SARCASTIC)
Yep. Truly a wonder of the world...good
thing we listened to the fossil. Don't
know how we'd find Lucy without him.
PRIEST
Vampires sometimes use abandoned
structures as a perch.
(looks at Hicks)
Watch for booby traps.
And with that he enters the--
Desert shrubs sprout like weeds between the stones, once
proud turrets rotting to dust, everything bleached by the
weather. Whatever this place was -- the desert owns it now.
HICKS
Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy
fucker's so blinded by faith he's
batahit. That's called a zealot in my.
book.
(BEAT)
I'm startin' to think you might be one
yourself. You ever think bout that?
Priest doesn't respond, squinting his eyes.
At the opposite end of the courtyard is an opening. It
leads into a CHAMBER of some kind.
The Priests look up to find the vampire clawed around a
turret, shadowed in the moonlight.
WHOOSH!. Great leathery wings unfold from its back as it
SWOOPS low, coming in for the'kill.
PRIEST
Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons
SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky,
He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of --
THROWING CROSSES
CUTTING through the air, sparkling in the moonlight,
beautiful. BUT
They BOUNCE harmlessly off the creature's wings, knifing back
to the ground, imbedding deep in the stone, Priest having to
nimbly: dodge his own weaponry.
THE CREATURE HOWLS! Blazing straight for him.
Undaunted. Priest looks at the Priestess and folds his hands
into the prayer position, leveling his breath, pulse slowing
as the screaming beast bares down like a freight train!
THE PRIESTESS
Quickly scoops up TWO LARGE ROCKS -- HURTLING them towards
the vampire. HER EYES LOCK WITH PRIEST'S as she too folds
her hand, into the prayer position.
RY NG GOES BLACK
Silence. Then --
62.
The sound of a heartbeat.
The juncture between instants. A fissure.
A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see Priest LEAPING through the air --
EVERYTHING AROUND HIM FROZEN -- the creature, the rocks, the
Priestess.
EVERYTHING GOES BI CK
A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is using the frozen
rocks as STEPS -- LAUNCHING his body until he is above the
CREATURE --
1_ M, .Q
A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is ON the behemoth, he
pulls out the FAMILIAR'S KNIFE, twirling it in his hand --
EVERYTHING GOES BLACx
And WHAM1 we fuse back into real time as the creature CRASHES
to the ground. Its DECAPITATED HEAD rolling to a stop, face
frozen in a horrible rictus.
A BEAT
O
as the world seems to hold its breath then --
Priest lands in a crouch, dropping next to the Priestess, her
hands still locked in the prayer position. She turns to him.
PRIESTESS
Not bad.
Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death
spasm! Talons clacking like STRAIGHT RAZORS, flailing
dangerously close to the two of them.
BAMI
A single bullet. pierces its heart and the body collapses with
a THUD. Once and for all -- dead.
ANGLE ON HICKS in the archway, smoke coming off his gun. He
looks at the Priests.
HICKS
Point A...meet point fuckin' B.
He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters.
CUT TO:
63.
Hicks examining the fallen creature, poking at the carcass
with his gun. In some crazy, distant way he's related to
this thing.
He raises his hand, comparing it to the beast's talon.
Shakes his head.
ATOP THE CASTLE WALL
Priest and the Priestess stare out at the Wasteland,
uncomfortable with looking at each other.
PRIEST
This was a Pureblood.
PRIESTESS
we both know that's impossible -- They
haven't existed for a millennium.
(BEAT)
What's going on here?
PRIEST
.I don't know.
A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess
kt speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of
things long held tight.
PRIESTESS
Sector Seven was the only place I could
find work. Waste Management.
(BEAT)
Nobody else would hire me. %No
applicable skills.&
PRIEST
I heard that one too.
PRIESTESS
A week ago, a family camping out on the
Perimeter approached me --.Told me
vampires were terrorizing their village
and that the government wouldn't do
anything about it.
PRIEST
Did you go to The Clergy?
PRIESTESS
They wouldn't see me,
(LOOKS DOWN)
(MORE)
64.
PRIESTESS (CONT'D)
By the time I got to the village it was
completely razed. Nothing left. Women.
Children. All dead ...they didn't even
bother to feed.
(BEAT)
I've been on their trail ever
since...could be the same group who took
your niece.
PRIEST
Could be.
The Priestess glances towards Hicks.
PRIESTESS
Does the lawman know what you'll do if
you find her?
PRIEST
He knows.
PRIESTESS
He'll try to stop you.
PRIEST
He won't be able to.
She pauses a moment, regarding him.
PRIESTESS
You know, some nights I still dream we're
back on the frontlines ... I wake up, I'm
sweating... my muscles all clenched like
I'm ready for something -- But I don't
know what.
PRIEST
Me too.
PRIESTESS
Nights like that ...I don't go back to
sleep.
(BEAT)
But on other nights ...the good nights
I dream about other things.
PRIEST
..Like what?
PRIESTESS
You.
Priest stares at her, not sure what to say. Lucky for him,
the moment gets interrupted by --
65.
HICKS
(shouting from below)
- Hey.you guys better get a look at thisl
The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started --
but.unsure of what.
They head down the stone steps.
CUT TO:
EXT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Hicks is lifting up one of the creature's wings. There's
some sort of BLACK MARK on its skin.
PRIESTESS
it must be a birthmark of some kind.
HICKS
That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand.
The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her
skin crawl. Maybe because it's in'theshape of a top hat.
PRIESTESS
There's something else you need to see...
CUT TO:
The NIGHT TRAIN thundering across the rails, almost obscene
in the bright sunlight. An intruder from the darkness
We hear a SCRATCHING sound, something scraping. Heavy
breathing as we MOVE INTO...
Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see
anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The
only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind.
Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere --
BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES.
PRIEST
We separate. Go through each building,
see what we find.
HICKS
I'll start with the sheriff.
PRIESTESS
Be careful. Just because it's daylight
doesn't mean it's safe.
Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest.
Everything is eerily quiet, just the sound of the wind.
Hicks crouches just outside the door, examining SPENT SHELL
CASINGS littering the walkway. He pulls out his six-shooter,
pushing the door open with his gun, stepping inside --
Hicks, done searching, meets up with the Priestess in the
middle of the street, he's pretty disturbed. Wind howling
around him.
HICKS
There ain't nobody left. Nobody.
PRIESTESS
(OMINOUS)
Too many mouths to feed.
HICKS
Where's Priest?
71.
But the Priestess's already focused on something else, gazing
at something behind the general store. He turns to see what
it is.
PRIEST
On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of
prayer.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what
the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full
PICTURE:
Before Priest are THREE LARGE WOODEN CROSSES, A NAKED BODY ON
EACH, crucified. Because of the swirling sand it's hard to
make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are
already dead.
Immediately the Priestess drops beside Priest, joining him --
And it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds'
FACES
They're Priests.
CUT TO:
Bare feet running on the salt-flats.
It's Lucy. Covered in dirt, battered and bruised but
chugging along. There is absolutely NOTHING out here, only
LUCY AND
A BLACK FIGURE DROPS SILENTLY FROM THE SKY BEHIND HER
it wears a BLACK COAT, fluttering in the wind as it touches
down, the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds.
The Figure's face is completely covered by a BLACK COWBOY
HAT. The only thing we can see is a CHEROOT Sticking out
from where the mouth would be.
A brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows, a puff of smoke
exhaled. It drops to the ground, silver spurs making a
slight CHING sound as a BLACK BOOT stamps it out.
Lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see -
y I ATHICK CHAIN __SHOOTING OUT from within the Fiaure',
coat. a HUGE METAL_ FINGERED CLAW at use ! The claw SLAMS
into Lucy, thick fingers CLAMPING around her, knocking her to
THE GROUND
72.
She digs her nails into the earth but it's no use as the chain
DRAGS her backwards and she quickly-disappears INTO the coat
with a SCREAM. The folds enveloping her in a dark embrace.
In one graceful sweep, the Black Figure leaps to the sky.
Quickly disappearing.
We see the cheroot on the ground. Spent. The only evidence
that anyone or anything was ever out here at all.
DISSOLVE TO:
Caught between sheets of swirling dust and.sand, the images
like hallucinations, moments of ritual and grief --
A. The crucified Priests taken down from their crosses,
their naked bodies like ragdolls.
B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed
amongst the makeshift pyre.
C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke
rising, the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold.
OUR TRIO stands before the pyre gazing into the fire, it Pops
consuming more of the bodies, if the Priests listen close
enough they can hear the end of an era.
HICKS
Don't make no sense. What were they
doin' out here?
PRIESTESS
The same thing as us.
(BEAT)
Someone's drawing us out.
HICKS
Who?
The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.
HICKS (CONT'D)
I imagine you'll have to go back to the
Cities, inform the Clergy.
A sudden silence.
PRIEST
We're not going back.
73.
The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but
she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime
of conditioning..
PRIESTESS
We'll burn for this.
PRIEST
(looking at the pyre)
We already are.
Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the
charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING.
She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones,
pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel
of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools.
Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a
METAL SPIKE.
HICKS
It's a railroad spike. My pop used to
work boxcars before they shut down -- Why
the hell would anyone wanna swallow that?
A beat as Priest puts it together.
PRIEST
He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.
PRIESTESS
Where's the closest track?
CUT TO.
The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on
its grim trajectory. Suddenly --
THE CAMERA
Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible
speed, leaving the train in its tracks (sorry) as it blisters
across the Wasteland through craggy mountains and finally
ending up in
THE CITIES.
And it is only now that we see exactly what Priest means.
THICK CLOUD OF INDUSTRIAL SMOKE covers the metropolis.
There is no sun.
CUT TO:
75.
ROAR1 Our trio plow through the scrubby desert growth, chewing
up the dirt. The blood of their machines at full boil..
A SERIES OF INTERCUT SHOTS
The VAMPIRE TRAIN chugging along on its dark course, heading
for the Cities.
Our'crew hellbent on stopping `em. The two locked on a fated
path, blurring across the landscape as the sun crests across
the sky DISSOLVING INTO:
Twilight.
Hicks and the two Priests ride past tumbleweed drifts, the
surrounding desertscape golden in the fading light.
Ahead a forboding series of CRAGGY MOUNTAINS, awaits, a
WINDING TRAIL criss-crossing through the peaks.
They stop, their machines idling next to each other, taking
stock of the huge task _beore' them.
HICKS
Beggar's Pass...it ain't gonna be easy.
As if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the
mountain.
QUICK SHOTS AS THEY HEAD DEEP INTO THE MOUNTAIN
78.
Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate
the twisty trail, cutting across sheer canyon walls, teetering
on the brink of an abyss, rock slides a constant threat.
CUT TO:
They've set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge.
Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a
nearby stream, the wear and tear of their journey evident on
the sheriff's face.
Priest lies close by, asleep.
HICKS
If we push it hard we'll gain two days on
'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.
PRIESTESS
We'need more than a jump. We need a
miracle.
HICKS
That's the funny thing about time --
He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the
liquid leak from between his fingers.
HICKS (CONT'D)
It's always runin' right through my
fingers.
PRIESTESS
You should try harder, sheriff.
She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a
drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind.
HICKS
You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?
PRIESTESS
No.
HICKS
What about a husband, children...A
family?
PRIESTESS
I've had a family -- just not the kind
you're familiar with.
79.
Hicks glances at Priest.
HICKS
What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?
PRIESTESS
He's not so bad once you get to know him.
A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious.
HICKS
He's going to kill her, isn't he? If.
she's turned.
PRIESTESS
Yes.
HICKS
There's things that can be done. She
doesn't have to die.
PRIESTESS
She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest.
It's the only way.
Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled,
but he knows there's no point in discussing it any
further... for now.
HICKS
And how many of you Priests are left now?
A long moment before she speaks.
PRIESTESS
Two.
Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,
HICKS
.I'm sorry.,
PRIESTESS
Yes.
She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure.
He watches her as she stares'into the fire. We FADE TO BLACK:
Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat.
He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle,
unable to sleep. There's a tension in the air, the sense of
something about to break as he joins her.
PRIESTESS
Why would the Clergy forbid us from
seeing each other?
PRIEST
Maybe they were scared of what we could
do.
PRIESTESS
Or what we would do.
(PAUSE)
We both know there's something inside the
Order that's off. Even if we don't know
what it is.
PRIEST
With or without the Clergy...we're still
Priests. And we're the only ones who can
stop that train.
PRIESTESS
If we survive this we need to expose them
for what they are.
82.
PRIEST
(PAUSE)
We won' t survive this.
She puts down her tools, staring fixedly at him.
PRIESTESS
You scared to die?_
PRIEST
No.
PRIESTESS
I believed in Heaven my whole life.
Believed everything we were taught -- And
now...when it's finally my time...no more
faith. They took it away from me.
Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting.
PRIEST
Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go.
We'll go together.
At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a
little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
What in greater than God but more evil
than the Devil? The poor have it, the
rich need it -- and if you eat
it...you'lldie.
PRIESTESS
What?
PRIEST
It's a riddle.
The Priestess thinks about it.
PRIESTESS.
Nothing. That's the answer.
(BEAT)
Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is
more evil than the devil. The poor have
nothing, the rich need nothing. And if
you eat nothing... you'll die.
It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they
see each other's hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true.
83.
-PRIEST
What you said before...about those nights
when you were dreaming of me --
PRIESTESS
The good nights.
PRIEST
Yes. The good nights. Do you think
maybe tonight...
PRIESTESS
Could be one of those nights?
She smiles.
And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back.
Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on
hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and
tradition falling away in a flash.
And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like
they finally truly belong.
The last two.
DISSOLVE TO:
A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning
has come.
A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more
treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming
ominously as they head deeper into the mountain.
The final climb.
Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the
canyon walls.
Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone,
just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight
drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead.
84.
The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely
followed by Hicks. Priest brings up the rear, he stops just
past the bridge, looks around.
Something's wrong.
HICKS
I- ee itl
Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.
IN THE DISTANCE
A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke
lining its path; The Night Train.
They're ahead of it. Barely.
In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent
down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to
Priest.
But he's gone.
Off her reaction we CUT TO:
Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding
mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks
through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet.
PRIEST
I know you're there.
A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something
just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's
nothing there.
A GROUP OF ROCKS
Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns
but...still nothing there.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
Show yourself.
A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then --
WHOOSH! Qurye -M
onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=.
0
$5.
Just in time -- he DIVES, the claw BITING into a rock behind
him, the chain quickly snapping back, disappearing into the fog.
RU11TE (O. S. )
(voice like the mist itself)
I've waited a long time for this Priest.
PRIEST
This isn't the time to settle old scores,
Rune.
RUNE (0. S. )
I disagree... This is the perfer, time.
WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from.
nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as
it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack.
RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D)
You've lost a step Priest...I never came
this close before.
PRIEST
I'm older now.
We can almost bear Rune smile.
RUNE (0.8.)
Not me.
And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING
around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body,
snapping a ribt
Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's
got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing
at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up.
Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's
stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh,
tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood
staining the desert floor.
Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.
RUNE (CONT'D)
You can't outrun the past, Priest... the
things you did.
PRIEST
It was a war, Rune.
86.
RUNE
It still is
He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two
grapple, Rune's fangs brushing Priest's neck.
It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus
the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider.
Hunched, ready to strike BUT --
THE PRIESTESS
Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands
beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence.
But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another
attack.
ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound.
Rune looks over, sees --
HICKS
Six-shooter pointed right at him.
6
A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The
air between them vibrating with energy. Crackling. Rune
considering his options.
RUNE (CONP' D)
(HISSING)
Another time, Priest.
He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist.
HAM!
Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon.
RUNE'S BODY
Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead.
And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest.
Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise.
HICKS
Tell me you won't kill her.
Priest doesn't reply.
87.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Tell me...or I'll shoot you where you
stand.
PRIEST
Finally showing your true colors.
A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.
PRIESTESS
What's he talking about?
PRIEST
He's a halfbreed.
Hicks cocks the gun.
HICKS
Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.
PRIEST
You've been itching to do this since
Nightshade.
HICKS
She's your kin, goddamit!
PRIEST
if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.
HICKS
Things can be done. Things to lessen the
thirst. She can have a normal life, she
doesn't have to die.
Priest nods grimly.
PRIEST
It's our way.
HICKS
And what is that? Some special Priest
code of honor? You don't get it. Your
"way' -- It's over!
PRIEST
Shoot me and it won't matter if you find
Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and
you won't save her.
The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks.
88.
PRIESTESS
He's right. We need to be together on
this... it's the only shot we have.
Hicks thinks about it, knows she's right. A tense beat then
HICKS
This ain't done.
He lowers his gun and walks away.
The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at
Priest...hedoesn't return it.
Without a word, he heads back to his cycle.
She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach.
It comes up red.
CUT TO:
The Trio BLAST down the rock face, descending down the mountain
at a furious clip. The Priestess looks at the train off in the
distance, it's now much closer, passing the mountain.
They've lost their edge.
HICKS
C'MONL
He GUNS the throttle and his bike BLAZES forward, wheels
thundering across the earth, the ROAR of engines filling our
head becoming --
The mad CLATTER of the train as it barrels down the tracks.
The assault begins.
Our trio finishes their descent, BLASTING onto the
SALT FLATS
wheels kicking up sheets of sand and grit, spattering their
faces. The train dead in their sites.
89.
HICKS
(SHOUTING)
You think they see us?
As if in response the locomotive belches a thick cloud of
.black smoke, a door sliding open from one of the cars.
A BEAT as everyone holds their breath, wondering what's going
to emerge --
VR0000000000MI
SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy) fly
out from within the car! Vampires covered in rider leather,
protected from the sun, heads obscured by BLAST HELMETS.
Priest turns to the other two.
PRIEST
Make sure you get on that train,
(BEAT)
I'll catch up.
'Before they can respond, he banks his cycle to the left.
THE VAMPIRE RIDERS
Take the bait, going for Priest. They gun their cycles,
engines.WHINING as they rev forward, their LEADER unleashing
a chain, swirling it above his head.
With a SNAP he lashes it at Priest, the chain catching in his
wheel, the sound of metal grinding as
PRIEST
is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in
wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the
momentum to roll back onto his feet.
He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining
his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just
in time to see
TWO RIDERS
Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other, pulling the line taut,
ready to take him out. Approaching fast.
PRIEST
90.
At the last second, DUCKS, grabbing onto. the chain, swinging
himself around in a graceful arc and KICKING his legs into a
split. WHAM! his feet SLAM the two cyclists off their bikes
and into the dirt.
He lands back on the ground in a crouch, the steel chain
tight in his grip -- Ready for battle.
And he gets it.
THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
Circle Priest, surrounding him, the ROAR of their engines
like massive power drills.
PRIEST
Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out.
The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's
handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a
tangled mess.
With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These
vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger,
quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.
A BRUTAL FIGHT
Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep
combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War
cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the
gladiators, dust kicking from their wheels.
PRIEST
Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a
SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the
harsh sun.
Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature
off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the
housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the
rider across the desert.
Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle,
VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the
train...
Hicks and the Priestess are riding right beside the colossus,
the sound incredible as the cars rattle across the tracks.
Carefully, they pull up to the caboose.
91.
PRIESTESS
(shouting to be heard)
You ready?
Hicks nods, maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping
to the Priestess's, his cycle crashing into the dirt as he
LEAPS onto the back of the train.
PRIESTESS (CONTIB)
I'm going for the engine. Find Lucy.
(about to speed off, stops)
Before he does.
Hicks nods, knowing this'll probably be the last time he sees
her.
And with that, she throttles forward, disappearing.
Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at --
THE TRAIN CAR DOOR
Who knows what horrors lie behind it? He pops a WAD OF
ATOMIC CRAW in his mouth and pulls his six shooters.
HICKS
My.tuxn now, Priest.
BAMI He kicks the door in
INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME
Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching
4 so far, as if the sun itself were scared to enter.
Hicks rolls in, guns at the ready. It takes a moment for his
eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of OLD
WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo.
He quickly moves through the car, careful not to disturb
anything. We FOLLOW with him as he exits, entering --
The Priestess, engine at full boil, makes her way up the
train, eyes on the engine up ahead.
ACROSS THE BODY OF THE TRAIN
A long line of tiny SLATS open up, RIFLE BARRELS quickly
emerging, snapping into place with a click. BLAM! BLAMI
BLAM! The guns FIRE AWAY, bullets blasting all around the
Priestess, missing her by millimeters.
She flicks down a TOGGLE SWITCH, there's a mighty roar, a
massive surge of power and WHOOSH! she ROCKETS forward. The
bullets chewing up the dirt behind her!
PRIEST
Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car
riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and
SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -
Lands on the roof of the train. Hard.
The cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the
juggernaut, getting crushed, sparks flying off the rails.
93.
Priest collapses against the metal, the strain beginning to
wear, he blinks up at the sky, close to passing out.
Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the
sun. Priest squints, unable to trust his eyes, he must be
HALLUCINATING --
IT'S BLACK HAT. He looks down at Priest, bowing with a
slight flourish.
BLACK HAT
"And the third day He shall rise again.
Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his
face etched with shock, all he can do is ask --
PRIEST
.How?
Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs.
BLACK HAT
Oh ye of little faith.
The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him
like a wave.
PRIEST
.They turned you.
BLACK HAT
No, Priest...I turned them.
He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO:
Priest and Black Hat eye each other, landscape whipping past
at a furious rate, the train blasting along the tracks.
BLACK HAT
Lost souls abandoned by divinity. No
belief, no voice to guide them through
the wilderness. Sound familiar?
Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him.
BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
Lack of faith. That's what I found in my
new brethren And so it was I
discovered my true calling -- To teach.
To lead.
PRIEST
By murdering innocents?
BLACK HAT
By drawing a once great race back to
their"nature. By helping them discover'
the mastery within themselves.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
95.
BLACK HAT (CONTID)
By putting them in touch with a higher
power.
PRIEST
who?
BLACK HAT
Me.
Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC
on the horizon -- It's The Cities. His jaw tightens, he
knows there isn't much time.
PRIEST
So this is how you go about it? One by
one killing every last remaining Priest?
BLACK HAT
It was the only way. The Cities are
defenseless now...no one left to stop us
from entering our Eden. But I was kind --
I gave every last one the choice I never
had.
(SMILES)
Now it's your turn.
Almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures,
the tension between the two warming up. Two warriors
steeling for a fight.
BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
it's better to be with your enemies than
to be alone, Priest. Humanity had its
chance.
(BEAT)
It's time to make way for new blood.
Priest lowers his head, when he raises it, his reply comes
easy and without hesitation.
PRIEST
Yours.
WE HEAR A HUM
Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar
of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants
to leave these two room to battle.
And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The
SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep
and echo of Priest combat.
96.
Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops.
They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents,
Black Hat having to shout to be heard.
BLACK HAT
They taught us God created man in His
image. . .but they lied. Man created God
in a image -- And so, like man, God is
weak. Corrupt. Merciless.
He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek.
BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
Who do you fight for, Priest? The
Order's collapsed. The Church nothing
but a line of decrepit, ruined old men.
Charlatans.
(SMILES)
How do you think I'm getting into the
cities?
Priest's face drops.
PRIEST
I don't believe you.
BLACK HAT
Your faith has failed you Priest.
(BEAT)
Join me. Join me and have the best of
both worlds --Walk in the sun. Stalk in
the night. Why pray to a God when you
can BE one?
PRIEST
With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging
into the metal.
The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the
roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the
next car.
The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train
car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at
j ust the right moment to land onto the next.
But Priest is,outmatched.
As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof
catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his
body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.
97.
Black Hat calmly approaches, his foot dangerously close to
Priest's hand. The landscape below-whipping past at an
incredible speed.
BLACK HAT
Your problem is you keep looking to God
for-your power -- But I know the real
truth.
(BEAT)
You've been praying to an empty sky.
And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off
Priest's hand as one would swat a bug. Priest falls below,
getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under.
BLACK HAT (CONT' D)
But you know that now.
CROSSCUT TO:
The Priestess, cycle at full throttle, racing beside the
TRAIN ENGINE. Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black
metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare. The hull
completely covered. Impervious.
MASSIVE PISTONS
Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning
the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY
BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just
missing the Priestess.
She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up
to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons
hoping to jam up the works.
The machine chews it up like candy.
CROSSCUT TO:
Priest is still alive. Barely.
He hangs in tatters, desperately clinging to the
undercarriage, face and body punched with bruises and blood.
Jaw set, he begins to move through the undercarriage, hand
over hand, every movement sheer agony.
99.
THE STEAM WHISTLE BLASTS
Howling across the wasteland, the train now racing even
faster, furnace cranking out flame like Dante's inferno, the
Priestess furiously keeping pace with the engine, desperately
looking for a way in.
There is none.
She looks up ahead.
THE SKYLINE,OF THE CITIES
Smudged like a greasestain, looms large across the horizon,
right in the train's path.
She squints up to the sky, analyzing the sun, making a quick
series of calculationsin her head. Trajectory. Timing.
Then she looks at the train. Smiles.
She flicks the Nitros Toggle one last time. Her bike ROCKETS
past the train engine, speeding into a curtain of dust.
Disappearing...
A MASSIVE GATE, not, opened for decades slowly GRINDS open, a
complex series of CHAINS and WINCHES scraping to life. The'
Cities now open to the approaching vampire train.
The SCREAM of the whistle like victory as the locomotive
approaches the city limits, sending up a giant plume of
billowing steam.
102.
The sky above already starting to cloud black as --
Landing in the undercarriage. Coming face to face with the
speeding track, everything shaking like an earthquake.
A VAMPIRE
Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the
creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making
its skin smoke.
On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as
they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train.
They work their way up the side, making it to the roof,
exhausted. Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy.
HICKS
We should jump!
PRIEST
Not until we stop the trains
But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught
up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them.
HICKS
(SWALLOWS)
Too late.
THE CITYSCAPE
104.
t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of
sulphur and carbon clogs their noses.
But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on
the tracks --
Someone stands. awaiting the train.
IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels
towards her. An ant in front of a battleship.
She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them.
Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles.
And spreads her arms open.
ON PRIEST
Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless
to stop her.
PRIEST
What happens next happens fast:
Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy,
hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as --
E ERYTH ggas BLACK
The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition.
A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the.
Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND
HER as if smashing into a building.
She doesn't move.
A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each
other, the cars JUMPING the rails.
MMMM gQES BLACK
A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his
body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the
earth, careening through the air.
105.
And WHAM! we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH
down, sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of
debris and shrapnel, until finally...it all comes to a stop.
It's quiet.
We move through the swirling sand until we find --
PRIEST
He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching.
A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to.
A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air.
Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from
within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black
swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful.
Terrifying.
Then in one horrible instant --
They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the
Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits.
HICKS
(HORRIFIED)
They're gonna make it.
The creatures arctowards the metropolis,the city within
THEIR REACH:
Priest studies the sky and all at once...he knows.
PRIEST
No, they're not.
THE SUN
PUNCHES through the teeming mass.
A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through
the black tide like shattered glass.
Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the
vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm
withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks.
Floating black kites.
Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction,
fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze.
106.
HICKS
You knew they wouldn't make it.
A long time before Priest answers.
PRIEST
She knew.
He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN
as if smashed by the very hand of God.
THE PRIESTESS
Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But
something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something
elemental. She doesn't have much time.
Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be
strong for her.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
Do you want me to?
PRIESTESS
O
Priest lowers his head. The following having been spoken by
him all too often.
PRIEST
"You shall wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit...
The words are heavy, each harder than the next.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
-- As it was in the beginning, is now and
ever shall be. World without end."
(BEAT)
Amen.
IN THE DISTANCE
A FIGURE escapes through the dust, lurching towards the
Cities,-- It's Black Hat.
PRIEST
sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the
hair from her face.
107.
PRIESTESS
I wish we could've had more time.
PRIEST
.Me too.
She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest.
PRIESTESS
Wherever it is we go -- we go together,
right?
She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared.
He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling
them as she draws her final breath.
CUT TO:
The sun setting on the horizon.
A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess' body as Priest
saddles up on a vampire bike, the flames rising behind him.
Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering.
The two men exchange a look, the snap and flash of the fire
reflecting in their eyes.
HICKS
When you're finished -- You know where to
find me.
A tense beat then
Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes
towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire.
CUT TO:
The sound of a CHOIR.
The soaring, ethereal tones carrying us through the forest of
BRICK SMOKESTACKS-- finally coming to rest on A GIANT CROSS
atop a mosaic BASILLICA, the colored tiles black with ash.
We're back in CLERGY CITY.
108.
Complete chaos.
PEOPLE stream out of the massive doorway, stampeding down the
stairs, the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame.
Priest looks up to find FATHER KOEPPEN. The old man staring
.at him. A lost soul.
KOEPPEN
Am I next?
Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the
blow he knows is to come.
But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck.
He's clean.
And without a single word -- Priest just walks away.
When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved.
With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And
for the first moment in a long time ...He believes.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
(CALLING OUT)
People don't run! God is here for youl
He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask
yourself a question
And the people DO stop, looking to him, the panic leaving
their eyes...
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
Ask yourselves -- Where am I going?
At this, Priest turns, the question catching him as well.
And it's only now he realizes --
He has no answer.
CUT TO:
The windmill.
Its rusty blades scrape along, the metal catching the first
rays of the day.
AARON PACE is already up, working on rebuilding his house.
He stops, gazing off in the distance.
112.
ON THE HORIZON
A cycle. Two black specs riding it. Hicks and Lucy.
Dropping his tools, he runs to meet it.
CUT TO:
A full moon.
Hicks stands on the porch, enjoying the breeze as he pops a
wad of chaw in his mouth.
A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention.
IN THE DISTANCE
A FIGURE
Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight.
0
113.
Hicks approaches, the wind kicking up, whistling through the
emptiness. Even though he can't see him -- Hicks knows who
it is.
HICKS
It doesn't have to be like this.
Priest just stands, staring.
Hick's hand curls around the revolver.
Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air
THEN
He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks.
Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it.
Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he
approaches. A feeling of inevitability.
Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun.
HICKS (CONT'D)
D= I t- -make dQ this.
PRIEST
Stares into his eyes and --
Something passes between them something so strong and
personal it transcends emotion.
Hicks FIRES!
But Priest is pone.
Hicks looks around --
There's no sign of him, not even the bike.
HICKS (CONT'D)
(REALIZING)
SHIT
He RACES back to the cabin...
Alone in the darkness, Priest sits on his cycle, his hand
clutching the WELL-WORN PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY.
His eyes shift, gazing into the distance at the outpost, a
warm glow emanating from within the cabin.
He places the photo in his pocket. The wind making a high,
lonely sound.
VRR00000MI
115.
Priest streaks into the night, bathed in moonlight,
desolation opening around him.
He disappears into the emptiness.
CUT TO:
The vampire train.
A car lies half-buried in the sand, mangled cage within.
A BLACK CLAW
Emerges from inside, clamping onto metal, something dragging
itself out into the moonlight.
It's a PUREBLOOD.
With a SCREECH it takes to the night sky, massive black wings
fluttering, arcing towards the twinkling metropolis.
FADE OUT
