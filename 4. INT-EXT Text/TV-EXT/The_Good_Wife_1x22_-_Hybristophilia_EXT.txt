      A cab idles in front of a massive beautiful brownstone as  
      Alicia rings the doorbell, calls back to the cabbie...  

                                  ALICIA
                    Just give me a minute.   

                                  SWEENEY (O.S.)
                    Hello.  Who s there?  

      Static from the door s intercom.  Alicia pushes the button:

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Sweeney?  It s Alicia Florrick.  
                    Will Gardner sent me.

      Pause.  Then a chortle comes from the intercom.

                                  SWEENEY (O.S.)
                    Sure, why not.  Come on up.

      Buzzzzzz.  The door buzzes open, and Alicia starts up....


       Sheila Warburg.   The name plate on a mailbox.  Kalinda 
      stands on the stoop, knocks again.  A dark street. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Sheila?

      Nothing.  Kalinda opens the mail box, overstuffed with 
      catalogues, bills.  She looks down.  Two newspapers, waiting 
    to be picked up.  Kalinda peers through the front window.  
      Hard to see.  Wipes the dust away, sees...

      ...a TV, dining room table.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  A 
      small quaint duplex.  She moves to another window, clears the 
      dust.  Peers into a hall.  Nothing interesting.  Oops, wait, 
      spoke too soon.  Hanging from a closet doorknob is...

      ...a leather S&M mask.  Kalinda smiles, starts to pull on her 
      gloves.      THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    29.




      ...Kalinda gets on her cellphone as she starts away-- like a 
      thief in the night...

                                  KALINDA
                    Burton?  Ready to write down an

      Kalinda starts toward her car when...

                                  LANA
                    Kalinda.

      Kalinda turns, finds Lana getting out of a sedan, starting 
      toward her.

                                  LANA (CONT D)
                    So your boy is free.

                                  KALINDA
                    My boy?

                                  LANA
                    Florrick.  He just won.

                                  KALINDA
                    Really?  Wow.

                                  LANA
                    So I hear there are some tapes.

      Kalinda smiles.

                                  KALINDA
                    There are always some tapes.

                                  LANA
                    I heard they hurt Florrick and
                    Childs so neither wanted to use 
                    them: Mutually Assured Destruction.

                                  KALINDA
                    Sounds like a fairy tale.

                                  LANA
                    Funny how fairy tales turn out to be 
                    true.  Here s the thing, Kalinda.  
                    This isn t about Childs orFlorrick.  
                    It s about Childs andFlorrick.  
                    We re investigating both of them, 
                    and I just don t want you to get 
                    hurt.

                                  KALINDA
                    Thank you for your concern.

      Lana studies Kalinda.  Is that genuine or not?

                                  LANA
                    I m your friend here.
