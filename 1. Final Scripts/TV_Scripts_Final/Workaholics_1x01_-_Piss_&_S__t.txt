      FADE IN:

      EXT. GUYS  HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY (DAY ONE)

      People in swimsuits, A DJ, BBQ, and others play beer pong.  
      BLAKE, stands with ADAM and they drink beers.

                                  BLAKE
                    No... but they are real.  It s like 
                    aliens.  We haven t captured one 
                    yet, but they re out there.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know.  I don t know if I 
                    believe in aliens either.

      ANDERS approaches.

                                  BLAKE 
                    Ders, tell Adam that albino Asians 
                    are real.

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah right.  They would have 
                    captured one by now.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Guess what I just got into.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know.  A bunch of dudes?

                                  ANDERS
                    Sexting.  You done this?

                                  ADAM
                    I ve heard of that.

                                  ANDERS
                    I ve got some girl named Annette, 
                    who I don t even remember meeting.  
                    She s been texting me all morning 
                    and it s pretty righteous stuff 
                     cause, welp, lemme just tell you:
                          (reading off phone)
                     What happened to you last night? 
                    You bailed on me. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             2.

                                  ADAM
                    What?  That s not like you.

                                  ANDERS
                    Again, I don t remember this chick.  
                    I said,  I didn t know you wanted 
                    to roll like that.   She says, 
                     What are you doing now?   So I 
                    said,  We re having a shindig, you 
                    oughtta think about coming by. 

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah.

                                  ANDERS
                    She says,  I ll think about it.  In 
                    the meantime, you think about 
                    this...   BOOM!

      CLOSE ON:  Ders phone, displaying a picture of a NIPPLE.

                      BLAKEADAM
        OOOOH!WOOOW!

                                  ADAM
                    Nipple!  Nipple shot!

                                  BLAKE
                    Nice.

                                  ADAM
                    That s a good lookin  nipple.

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah, the nipple of my dreams.

                                  BLAKE
                    You should probably get that girl 
                    over here.  Why don t you send her 
                    a pic... of your dick?

                                  ANDERS
                    A what?

                                  ADAM
                    That s how sexting works.  You ve 
                    got to one up her, earn her trust 
                    with a pic.

                                  ANDERS
                    She just sent me a nipple.  So...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             3.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  BLAKE
                    Well, that s kind of the order of 
                    things.  It goes nipple, dick, 
                    pussy, butthole.

                                  ANDERS
                    OK.
                          (realizing)
                    Wait, whose butthole?

                                  BLAKE
                    It was on Dateline.

                                  ADAM
                          (tapping Ders  dick)
                    Why don t you get some blood in that 
                    sucker and seal the deal, dude?

                                  BLAKE
                    Seal the deal, man!

      They high five and Anders runs inside.

                                  ADAM
                    I m proud of you, dude.  Get rid of 
                    that hat.

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Anders preps to take a picture of his dick.  He strikes a 
      pose in front of the mirror, then snaps the pic.

                                  ANDERS
                    GQ time, GQ time, everybody  bout 
                    to get GQ time.

      He SENDS the picture.

      EXT. GUYS  HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

      Anders walks back to Adam and Blake, arms raised in triumph.

                                  ANDERS
                    Countdown to vagina town.

                                  ADAM
                    Awww yes.

                                  ANDERS
                    And washed my rear end for the 
                    other photo that I m probably gonna 
                    have to send later.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             4.

      CONTINUED:

      We hear a phone BEEP.  Adam pulls a BEDAZZLED PHONE from his 
      pocket and types on the keypad.

                                  ADAM
                    Forward to - select all and - send.

                                  ANDERS
                    Whose phone is that?

      Adam hands the phone to a girl.

                                  ADAM
                    Vanessa, thanks for the phone.  
                    Enjoy your new wallpaper.

                                  ANDERS
                    What are you doing with her phone?

      Adam and Blake laugh at Anders as CELL PHONES AT THE PARTY 
      RING AND BUZZ.  Ders catches on and looks crushed.

                                  ADAM
                    You were texting me on Vanessa s 
                    phone.  The nipple of your dreams, 
                    is now the nipple of your 
                      nightmares.

      Adam unbuttons his shirt REVEALING his SHAVED NIPPLE.  Blake 
      pulls out an electric razor, BUZZING IT. 

                                  ANDERS
                          (furious)
                    This is hysterical.  Sending a 
                    picture of my penis to everyone at 
                    the party.

                                  ADAM
                          (rubbing nipple)
                    You like that?

      FADE IN:

      EXT. GUYS  HOUSE - ROOF - LATER

      The party is winding down.  Anders climbs a ladder, onto the 
      roof, to meet Blake and Adam (who re doing Edward 40 Hands).

                                  ANDERS
                    So this is where my  friends  are.

                                  BLAKE
                    Look who it is.  It s Tan Dick 
                    Tanner.

                                  ADAM
                    Nice.  Tan Dick Tanner.

                                  ANDERS
                    You know guys, when you kick a dude 
                    and he s down...

      Anders pulls a blunt out of his shirt pocket and grabs a 
      beer.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    He s not likely to share his blunt 
                    with you.

                                  ADAM
                    You don t smoke.

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah well, I m smokin  tonight.

                                  BLAKE
                    But, with us, right?

                                  ANDERS
                    I don t have to.

                                  ADAM
                    You should be thanking us, because 
                    all those chicks have seen your 
                    super tan dick now, and that s 
                    awesome.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s basically like you re headed 
                    towards home.  Past third base.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             6.

                                  ANDERS
                    Are you serious?

      The guys spot a ROLLER BLADER in their driveway.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh shit.

      The roller blader bends down to pick something up.  Adam and 
      Blake stand up on the roof and yell:

                  ADAM (CONT'D)BLAKE
      POOP DOLLAR!POOP DOLLAR!

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    There s poop in it!

      The roller blader skates away quickly as the guys laugh.

                                  ANDERS
                    Whose poop this time?

                                  BLAKE
                    That s all Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    It s weird how unembarrassed I am 
                    by that.

                                  BLAKE
                    Come on guys, this is Sunday fun 
                    day.  Let s get wild!

      Blake CLINKS his forty onto their beer bottles, causing them 
      to overflow and forcing Adam and Anders to quickly chug the 
      escaping beer.

                                  BLAKE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah!

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - DAY (DAY TWO)

      The guys sit at their shared cubicle.  We cut to each of them 
      as they perform their respective sales calls.

                                  ADAM
                    I hear the kids in the background

                    Why would I call you?  I don t even

      JILLIAN, their coworker, approaches and startles all of them.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Are you guys freaking out?

                                  ADAM
                    Now I am, Jillian.  What s your 
                    deal?  Why don t you tone it down a 
                    smidge.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Sorry.  It s just that you guys 
                    don t look at all ready for the 
                    drug test.

                                  BLAKE
                    There s a drug test today?

                                    JILLIAN
                    Yeah.  I know.  I m freaking out 
                    too.  I went to the Lady GaGa 
                    concert last night with my niece, 
                    Sabrina.

      The guys get up and walk out of their cubicle in the middle 
      of Jillian s speech.  She continues as the guys walk away 
      from her.

                    And some guy was smoking weed right 
                    next to us.  It freaked me out.  
                    You know what else freaked me out? 
                    That picture of your dick, Anders.  
                    I got it in a text.

                    OK.  Look.  I followed Sugar Ray on 
                    the road for 5 months after 
                    college, I was high, high, high, 
                    high, higher than high.  I know 
                    what s goin  on out there, but I 
                      twelve-stepped that crap right out 
                    of my life.  Speaking of losers, 
                    just wait until you meet the nerd 
                    that they sent over from West Coast 
                    Testing.

      Just then, ROBBIE, the pee tester, enters.  He s pushing a 
      cart full of urine testing equipment.  Alice feigns 
      politeness to be professional.

                                  ROBBIE

                    There he goes.

                                  ROBBIE
                    OK.  I m just gonna run some tests 
                    on it, and it s important that you 
                    drink a lot of fluids.  And, it s 
                    just a drug test.  Nothing to be

                                  BLAKE

      Robbie turns to the guys, his smile slips.

                    You might have her fooled, but not 
                    this guy.  I m a professional.  A 
                      bloodhound.  And I can recognize 
                    the signs.

      He points to Adam.

                    of yourself.  Ooh mama.  I m gonna 
                    have a good time with you.  

      Robbie slowly backs away.

                                  ROBBIE (CONT'D)
                    See you in a little bit, boys.

                    And seriously, drink some liquids.  
                    It ll make my job a lot easier.

      in disgust.

                    We should probably keep the poop 
                    dollar outside.

      The guys nod in agreement.

                    But, after yesterday s little 
                    sexting prank, I thought - maybe 
                    they don t deserve it.  Maybe now 
                    they ve got to earn it.

                    this last night.

      Anders climbs up onto his chair and reaches up to the 
      ceiling.  He rips two large chunks from the ceiling tile and 
      hands them to the guys.

                    That is straight danger.

      Blake reaches for the tile.

                                  BLAKE

                    Fine.  But your dick is so tan 
                    looking.  It s bizarre.

      Adam takes a bite out of the tile and makes a face like he s 
      about to puke.

      Anders turns to Blake, who s pouring a packet of BBQ sauce 
      onto the tile.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Enjoy that.  Better get some Arby-Q 
                    sauce on that, dude.

      Blake takes a bite and is equally sickened.  He and Adam 
      begin choking and making puke sounds.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s cutting my mouth.

                    You re not a cool dude.  Because 
                    there is fiberglass in here.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s so dry!

                                  ADAM
                    How much do we have to eat?

                                  ANDERS
                    Alright, alright.  OK champs.  I 
                    think you ve had enough.

      Blake and Adam spit the rest of the tile into their desks.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Why don t we wash it down.

      Anders hands them the two cups he took out of his cooler.

                                  BLAKE
                    That s piss.  We re not drinking 
                    piss.

                                  ANDERS
                    It s not pee, it s Gatorade.  
                    That s what happens when you mess 
                    with the mastermind of pranks.

      Adam sips his Gatorade.

                                  ADAM
                    Wow.  OK.

                                  ANDERS
                    You pull a prank on me, you get 
                    pranked back.

      Anders pulls another plastic cup of liquid out of the cooler.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    This is real piss.  And it s all 
                    mine.  It s all...

      Adam JUMPS up from his seat and HITS the cup out of Anders  
      hand, getting it on Anders  face and shirt.

                                  ADAM
                    ...Over your face! 

      Anders is stunned, then launches to his feet.  Toe to toe 
      with Adam...

                    Adam, I had enough pee for all 
                    three of us.  I was gonna run the 
                    joke a little longer and then split 
                    it up.  But, now it s gone and a

                    Why didn t you say something, dude?

                                  ANDERS
                    I didn t say anything because I was 
                    trying to be cool and dramatic.  
                    Which you would know nothing about.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh OK, Anders.  I wouldn t know

                    Who s saving up to buy a

      Suddenly Robbie pops his head into their cubicle.

      As Ders exits, Karl takes a long look at his fingernails.

                                  KARL
                    He s absolutely right.

      INT. GUYS  CAR - LATER

      Adam examines the bottle of niacin as Anders drives.  He 
      dumps pills into his hand.

                                  ADAM
                    It says to take two for results in 
                    eight hours, that means take eight 
                    for results in two.

      Adam passes pills to Blake, who immediately swallows them.

                                  BLAKE
                    Let s crank the windows up and

                    Fuck it.

      He downs a handful of pills as they pull up to the office 
      parking lot.

                                  BLAKE
                    Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What

      Anders slams his hands on the steering wheel.

                                  ADAM
                    How are we supposed to find clean 
                    piss when everyone over the age of 
                    twelve smokes weed these days?

      A lightbulb goes off for all three of them.

      EXT. SCHOOLYARD - LATER

      The guys, itchy and red-faced, run up to a schoolyard fence.   
      The CHILDREN scream and run away at the sight of their red, 
      sweaty faces.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, gotta go pee?  Pigtails, I m

                    I ll give you some piss.

      A PUNK KID approaches them.

                                  ADAM
                    You will?

                                  PUNK KID
                    Yeah, maybe I could go.  But what s 
                    in it for me, bitches?

      The guys reach into their pockets.

                                  BLAKE
                    I have... a receipt.

      Anders hands the kid a small plastic bag.

                                  ANDERS
                    We can do that.  Take this bag, pee

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

      The guys burst into the front door.  Karl sits on their couch 
      as before and smokes a joint.  The guys race past him.

      QUICK CUTS: The guys search frantically through stuff in 
      their bedrooms.  They grab whatever contraband they can find.

      The guys race out the door, passing Karl again.  As they 
      pass, Karl holds out his joint.  Anders and Adam ignore him, 
      but Blake stops.

                                  BLAKE
                      Definitely.

      He takes a hit from the joint then hands it back to Karl.

      Blake runs out the door.  Karl drops the joint on his hand, 
      burning himself.
