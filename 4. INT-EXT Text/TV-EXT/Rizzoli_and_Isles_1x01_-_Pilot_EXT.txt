      REVEAL DETECTIVE JANE RIZZOLI, 30. She PLAYS B-ball with her 
      brother, FRANKIE JR., 28, a Boston P.D. patrol officer. He 
      has on a BOSTON PD T-shirt. She wears nice sweat pants and a 
      tank top that reads: Scare Yourself Every Day. 

      Jane s face is arresting: a quirky beauty that evolved over 
      time. She s a high-strung Yankee, yet she moves with an 
      athletic grace. She SHOOTS. It goes in. 

                                  JANE
                    Finally.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Still behind by ten.

      She SMILES.

                                  JANE
                    I will beat you someday.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    You beat me at everything. Let me 
                    be better at something. 

      He has a smile on his face, tries to convince them both that 
      he s joking. But there s too much history and hurt truth 
      behind it. Makes her sad. She PASSES the ball to distract 
      him.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 2



      He RUNS down the driveway for a LAY-UP. She DEFENDS. He 
      THROWS an elbow. CRACK!

                                  JANE 
                    Ow!

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Oh, crap --

      Blood FLOWS from her nose. Frankie pulls off his T-shirt, 
      HANDS it to her.

                                    FRANKIE JR. (CONT'D)
                    Oh, man, I m so sorry, Janie. I ll 
                    get ice.

                                  JANE
                      Uh...S okay...

      She WOBBLES away, holding his shirt to her nose.


      DET. DARREN CROWE, 30 s, on his cellphone. He has a frat-
      boy s insouciance combined with an aging ballplayer s good 
      looks.  He stands on the lawn of a mansion as CRIME SCENE 
      UNIT (CSU) TECHS and BOSTON P.D. UNIFORMS SWARM in and out of 
      an expensively renovated mansion.

                                  CROWE
                    Bad things on Beacon Hill, and 
                    you re up. 

                                  JANE 
                    Let me talk to Frost.

      ANGLE: DET. BARRY FROST, 28, buff African American cop, PUKES 
      into bushes. Crowe taunts him with a SALUTE. Frost pukes 
      again. 

                                  CROWE
                    He s busy.

                                  JANE
                    On my way.

      Jane hangs up, tosses bloody paper towels into the trash. Her 
      nose has stopped bleeding but Angela hands her an icepack. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 4



                                  ANGELA
                    It won t be attractive if your nose 
                    swells. Never know who you might 
                    run into.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Ma --

      Jane takes the ice, throws Frankie Jr. a grateful look.

                                  JANE
                    I meet so many great guys at work. 
                    Too bad they re all dead. 

      She grabs her stuff, starts to exit. Angela FROWNS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I told you I was on-call --

                                  ANGELA
                    It s Frankie Jr. s birthday!

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Go. It s fine. 
                          (wishes he was going)
                    Murder?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. You ll get there, Frankie.

      She HANDS him a gift.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    If you hate it, gift receipt s 
                    inside.

      She gives him a quick KISS on his cheek. Jane pecks her 
      mother then her father on the cheek --

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I ll call you, Ma. Bye, Pop. See at 
                    the salt mines, Frankie. Your ass 
                    is getting big, Mikey.


      Jane gets into her state issue Ford. It s parked next to a 
      van that reads: RIZZOLI & SONS PLUMBING. Boston s Best Since 
      1954.

      JANE S POV: THRU WINDSHIELD INTO KITCHEN

      Angela and Frank laugh and fuss over Mikey and Frankie Jr.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 5



      CLOSE ON: Jane s hands. WE SEE two nasty and identical HEALED 
      RED SCARS on her palms. She RUBS them absently as she stares 
      at her family. SHOVES her car into reverse and takes off.


      She pulls the SL-500 into a long driveway, parks next to a 
      coroner s van with black letters: Commonwealth of 
      Massachusetts, Office of the Medical Examiner. TWO MORGUE 
      ATTENDANTS wave from the front seat. She waves back. 

      REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS work the taped-off crime-scene, 
      hovering as close as COPS will let them. She gets out.

      ANGLE ON: REPORTER KITTY VANSEN, 31, TV-pretty as she SPIES 
      Maura. She PUSHES her beleaguered CAMERAMAN toward Maura. He 
      perks up: SCHWING. Dr. Maura Isles may be a cold pathologist, 
      but she s also a smokin  hot woman.

                                  KITTY
                    Go, go. It s Queen of the Dead. Get 
                    her and stay close.

      Maura, with her medical case, deftly moves away from Kitty as 
      Kitty and the cameraman run. Kitty shoves a mic at Maura. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 6



                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Isles -- What can you tell us 
                    about the murders? 

                                  MAURA
                    I ll have a statement for you later 
                    tonight, Kitty.

                                  KITTY
                    C mon, please, something for the 
                      11 o clock? This leads.

      Maura starts up STEPS as Crowe puts out a hand to stop Kitty 
      from going any further. She backs away.

                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Bet if I was a corpse, she d talk 
                    to me.

      Maura enters the mansion. Crowe casually applies chapstick 
      and smooths his Ken-doll hair then turns back to Kitty. 

                                  CROWE
                    I ll give you a soundbite.

      ANGLE ON Jane as she POWERS toward them, steps between Crowe 
      and Kitty, BLOCKING the shot. Cameraman lowers his camera.

                                  JANE 
                    Where s Frost?

                                  CROWE
                    Where else?

      Crowe points at Frost, nearby and partially concealed by 
      bushes. He s stopped puking, but he doesn t look good. 

                                  FROST
                          (calls to her)
                    Bad fish sticks.

      Crowe SNORTS as Frost CROSSES to join Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Least he s not trying to get his 
                    mug on-camera. 

      Jane pulls a small tin of Vick s VapoRub from a pocket, hands 
      it to Frost. He rubs it under his nose. They walk up the 
      front steps. 

      Jane REACHES for the door. She pulls her hand back and rubs 
      her palms together. She catches Frost s concerned look.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    It s going to rain. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 7



                                  FROST
                    Hands hurt?

                                  JANE
                    Not that bad.


      Jane and Korsak walk toward a CSU van. The lawn and driveway 
      are still swarming with CSU s, news crews and Cops.

                                  KORSAK
                    I m sorry.

                                  JANE
                    Stop. I m a cop first, Hoyt s 
                    victim a distant second.

      He looks at her, wants to say something. Finally --

                                  KORSAK
                    Hoyt s the reason you don t want to 
                    be partners, isn t he? 

                                  JANE
                    This again? You know why: I m 
                    allergic to cats. And dogs. And all 
                    the other sad, furry creatures you 
                    keep rescuing, Detective Doolittle.

                                  KORSAK
                            (suspicious)
                    You never sneezed.

                                  JANE
                    Frost is my partner now. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Paper cuts make him gag. 

                                  JANE
                    He came from Narcotics. Gore is new 
                    to him. He s a good detective. 

      They grab metal cases from the back of a CSU van, head back 
      inside.


      CLOSE ON: video of Hoyt, alone in a cell.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    Airtight alibi, all right.

      Frost SHOWS Jane video of Hoyt on Frost s cellphone. Korsak 
      SLUMPS against a car, RUBS his sleepless eyes.

                                  FROST
                    He killed a prisoner tonight. 
                    Stabbed him with a shiv he made 
                    from a razor and a spoon.

                                  JANE
                    Tonight? That s not a coincidence.

      A light RAIN FALLS on them as Jane pulls out car keys.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We can t get in the prison until 
                    7:00. Korsak, go get some sleep. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Where re you going?

                                  JANE 
                    I ll explain later. C mon, we ve 
                    got just about enough time. 

      OFF Frost s confused look --RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 15




      CLOSE ON a hand as it BANGS on a door. Reveal Jane and Frost 
      at the front door of a beautiful Victorian home. 

                                  FROST
                    Maybe we should wait  til morning. 

                                  JANE
                    She s Hoyt s only visitor. 

                                  FROST
                    You saying she s the Apprentice?

                                  JANE
                    That d surprise even me. Look at 
                    this place. Built on the bones of 
                    victims. She s almost as sick as 
                    these perps she studies. 

      DOOR swings open. Facing them: DR. JOYCE O DONNELL, 40 s, 
      Grace Kelly classy with the same sheet of blond hair.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    Detective Rizzoli. What an 
                      unpleasant surprise.

                                  JANE
                    We need to talk.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                          (closing door)
                    Call my office.

      Jane STOPS the door with her hand. 

                                  JANE
                    We have a killer out there. His 
                    signature is identical to Hoyt s. 

      We can see from the way Dr. O Donnell tries not to stare that 
      she knows how Jane got those scars on her palms. 


      Jane and Frost walk up to the main entrance. Jane puts 
      fingers in her hair absently, stops, now aware of her habit.

                                  FROST
                    You sure you want to do this?

      Jane pulls in, stops. She rubs her jaw, LOOKS through the 
      windshield. Agent Dean STEPS from the woods to join Korsak 
      and Crowe. Frost gets out.

                                  JANE
                    I ll catch up.

      Jane DUMPS out her purse: gum, balled-up tissue, Boston Red 
      Sox water bottle, Vick s VapoRub, a touch-screen Sudoku 
      Puzzle. SEARCHES but can t find what she s looking for.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 19


      Puts her hand between the seats. SMILES as she holds up a 
      tube of old lipstick: Eureka.


      Jane approaches Dean, Korsak, Crowe and Frost.

                                  CROWE
                    You wearing lipstick, Rizzoli? 

      Jane looks at a shaken MAN with a Labrador.

                                  JANE 
                    Dog find her? 

                                  KORSAK
                    Yup.
                          (channels dog)
                    Mmmm-mmm. Dead lady, my favorite.

                    Dr. Isles is in the woods with the 
                    body. I ll show you.

      They push through brush as Korsak fawns over the dog. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Who s a good boy, huh?

      CLOSE ON a woman s body, her long blond hair a stiff mat of 
      straw.  She s naked, her abdomen bloated. Maura uses a 
      hypodermic needle to extract fluid from the corpse s eyeball. 

                                  MAURA

                                  MAURA (CONT'D)
                    Nice and clear. 

                                  JANE
                    Damnit. We could ve saved her.

                                  MAURA
                    Don t go there, Jane. She s been 
                    dead at least 48 hours. 

                                  JANE
                    Look at the way the body s laid 
                    out. Why didn t he bury her?

                                  JANE
                    I don t think so. Means something.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You know more about Hoyt than 
                    anyone. What s the Apprentice s 
                    next move?

                                  JANE
                    He d kill again. 


      Frankie Jr. and Frost surround Jane protectively. 

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Go stay with Mom and Dad.

                                  JANE
                    No. I m staying in my home. He s 
                    not doing this to me again.

      She WALKS toward the entrance to her building.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Go home.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    You know that s not gonna happen.

                                  JANE 
                    If I was a guy, you wouldn t worry 
                    like this.

                                  FROST
                    He doesn t kill men.

      As she walks away --

                                  JANE
                    I m a homicide cop. He s not gonna 
                    kill me.


      Jane walks up to the Crown Vic, leans in.

                                  JANE
                    You don t have to follow me. 

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    We re staying with you.

                                  JANE
                    Get a patrol car here. I don t want 
                    Hoyt using his scalpel to turn my 
                    neighbors into crafts  projects.


      A HAND KNOCKS. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Jane knocking hesitantly. 
      Then harder. The door swings open. Maura answers, as 
      beautiful as ever, in yoga pants and a silk tank top.

                                  JANE
                    Why do you always look like you re 
                    about to do a photo shoot? I m 
                    taking you up on your offer. 

                                  MAURA
                    Good. I m glad you did. 

                                  JANE
                    I brought my security team.

      Jane points across the street. Maura looks out her window.

      ANGLE ON: Frankie Jr. and Frost sit in a car together. They 
      wave. Maura waves back.


      A FLORIST DELIVERY MAN holds a wrapped flower arrangement.

                                  DELIVERY MAN
                    Hey, all I know is I got a delivery 
                    for a Detective Rizzoli.

                                  JANE
                          (to Frost)
                    Check him out, will you?

      She takes the card off of the arrangement with gloved hands. 
      You can almost hear her heart beat with fear as she reads it:

      CLOSE ON: typed signature. Prickly on the outside, succulent 
      on the inside, just like you. Best - Henry Dudboot.

      In the b.g., Frost continues to interrogate the Delivery Man. 
      Korsak looks over her shoulder, reads the note.

                                  KORSAK 
                    Who s Henry Dudboot?

      CLOSE ON: computer screen. The name HENRY DUDBOOT rearranges 
      into THEODORE BUNDY.


      Frost and Jane walk toward her car. Korsak lags behind, 
      looking sad. Jane stops, walks back to Frost. 

                                  JANE 
                    Korsak s being a baby. You mind 
                    riding alone? 

      He good-naturedly shakes his head,  no.  She tosses KEYS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We ll cover the north end of the 
                    park. You take the South.
                          (to Korsak)
                    Oh, for chrissake, lighten up.


      Korsak MAGLIGHTS bushes. Jane follows. His LIGHT HITS a dirty 
      Maltese with a cute face. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Hello, boy. 
                          (checks dog s parts)
                     Scuze me - Girl. What re you doing 
                    by yourself? Where s your collar?

                                  JANE
                    How do you do that? Do you wear a 
                    homing device? 


      Jane and Korsak sit in the car, hidden in trees and brush. 
      Barney Miller, in his carrier, is on Korsak s lap.

                                  JANE
                          (to radio)
                    Frost, you see anything?

                                  FROST (V.O.)
                    Negative.

      Jo Friday JUMPS UP and LICKS Korsak s face. He pushes her 
      off. Makes a KISSING SOUND at the cat. Cat HISSES.

                                  JANE
                    Why do we always want the ones who 
                    don t want us? 

      Rizzoli points to Jo Friday, who s waging her tail.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Jo Friday loves you.

                    Too easy. I gotta pee. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 40



                                  JANE
                    Got to be kidding me.

                                  KORSAK
                    You want me to do it here?

                                  JANE
                    I ll cover for you.


      Jane waits, irritated. She SCANS for Korsak, sighs.

                                  JANE
                    Later that same day --
                    Korsak?

                                  KORSAK (O.S.)
                    Gimme a minute. It got more 
                      complicated.

                                  JANE
                    T.M.I.

                                  KORSAK (O.S.)
                    Huh?

                                  JANE
                    Too much information.

      She sits down, her gun out. SUDDENLY, there s MOVEMENT in the 
      trees. She s instantly on alert, gun ready --

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak?

      No answer. MORE MOVEMENT. Jane starts to RUN as a FIGURE in 
      head-to-toe black and night goggles SPRINTS away.  Jane 
      CHASES the fleeing figure. Branches SLAP her face. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Freeze! Police. I will shoot you.

                                  MAN
                    Jane, don t.

      The man stops. Removes his night goggles. It s Dean.

                                  JANE
                    What the hell?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I was chasing someone.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 41



                                  JANE
                    Bullshit. I was chasing you!

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You think I m the Apprentice?

      Frost APPEARS from behind, out of breath from running.

                                  FROST
                    Couldn t raise you on the radio.

      Jane is still unsure of Dean.

                                  JANE
                    How did you know we were here? 

      A MOAN interrupts them. Jane MAGLIGHTS the trees, follows the 
      noise. Her light SWEEPS OVER Korsak, BLEEDING from a slash-
      wound to his throat. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Vince!

                                  FROST 
                          (on radio)
                    Officer down! 

      Jane puts pressure on the bleeding wound. Korsak s eyes find 
      hers. He seems to be trying to tell her something.

                                  JANE
                    Shhh. You re gonna be okay. 

      He tries to move, FLICKS his eyes to the trees. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Frost - I think something s over 
                    there.

      Frost SHINES his MAGLIGHT: a naked woman MOVES. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Get another ambulance: it s Karenna 
                    Ghent.

                                          ACT FOUR


      She throws her suitcase into her car, looks up at her 
      apartment. Jo Friday is whining and scratching at a window. 
      Jane sighs and MARCHES back inside.


      A plane lands.

                                  CAPT S VOICE
                    Welcome to Washington, D.C.


      Jane walks up to the building, goes inside.


      Establishing.


      A taxi pulls PAST a parked Boston PD patrol car. CORONER S 
      VAN BLOCKS the sidewalk and ENTRANCE to Jane s building.  
      Jane JUMPS out of the cab, grabs her suitcase. She tries to 
      SQUEEZE past the van. Morgue Attendant 1, who was at the 
      first crime scene, stops her.

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    Uh, Detective Rizzoli, can you I.D. 
                    the body before you go in? 

                                  JANE
                    What body?

      Morgue Attendant shrugs, baffled, points to the van.

                                  MORGE ATTENDANT 1
                    Sorry, thought you knew. Doctor 
                    Isles said it s your neighbor, uh -- 

      As he looks through paperwork --

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    It s a young female, 20 s maybe --

                                  JANE
                    Oh god -- Avery? Is it Avery?

      Jane JUMPS into the back of the van. She SHAKES as she UNZIPS 
      the black body bag. INSIDE IS WARREN HOYT. 

                                  HOYT
                    Nice to see you Jane.

      Jane SCREAMS. The Morgue Attendant gets in behind her, locks 
      the doors. Hoyt HOLDS UP a Taser Gun. 

      ZZZZT! He STUNS her. Jane DROPS to the floor, WRITHES in 
      pain. Hoyt climbs into the driver s seat, PULLS AWAY as 
      Morgue Attendant Tasers Jane again. She blacks out as we --

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      FADE UP FROM BLACK:


      Van STOPS. 


      Two EMT s work on Hoyt. Maura, Dean and now Frost and Crowe 
      surround Jane. An EMT wipes Jane s cheek with a pad. 

                                  JANE
                    How did you find me?

                                  MAURA 
                    Actually, I called the FBI when you 
                    didn t show up. Agent Dean was able 
                    to ping your cellphone.

                                  JANE 
                    What about Avery, she okay?

                                  CROWE
                    So okay. Wicked hot.

                                  MAURA
                    Jo Friday is fine, too.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You were right about Ft. Stewart. 

      Dean HOLDS UP a photo of two Army buddies: Hoyt and the 
      Apprentice. 

                                  DEAN
                    His name is John Stark.

      Morgue Attendants ROLL the GURNEY with the BODY BAG past 
      them. Jane STOPS them, STARES at it.

                                  JANE 
                    Hoyt killed that prisoner so the 
                    prison would summon his Apprentice 
                    from the Coroner s Office.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    He hid under the dead man in the 
                    body bag. Slipped right by us. 

      Jane UNZIPS the body bag then remembers Frost is watching.

                                  JANE 
                    Might want to wait over there.

      But he s rock steady. He LIFTS the dead man s arm for her. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Wow, look at you!

                    68W Health Care Specialists. 
                    They met during training.

      Jane watches EMT s lift Hoyt into the ambulance.

                                  JANE 
                    He s like a cockroach. Should ve 
                    squeezed off a few more rounds.

      A police CAR PULLS next to Jane. Its passenger is Korsak, 
      heavily bandaged.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Get your ass back to the hospital. 

                                  KORSAK
                    I had to make sure you were okay.

                                  JANE
                    I m fine. Go. Now, or I won t walk 
                    Jo Friday. 

      She gives him a faux stern look. He waves as the car pulls 
      away. Dean clears his throat. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I know I said dinner, but what 
                    about breakfast?

      Jane smiles, about to answer, when her cell rings --

                                  JANE

      Jane walks away. STAY ON Dean, watching her protectively.

                          (to phone)
                    Call Crowe. I m taking the day off.

      Maura and Dean TALK to each other. Jane SEES this. Something 
      HITS her heart hard. She turns back to her phone.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We ll take it. 
                          (hangs up, calls to Frost)
                    We got a homicide in Dorchester.

      Jane and Frost get in Frost s car, pull away. Jane looks 
      back. Maura is walking after the car, calling her name. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 60



                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, brother...Stop the car, Frost.

      Jane gets out, WALKS OVER to Maura, who looks hurt and 
      confused.

                                  MAURA
                    What re you doing? 

                                  JANE
                    Being a petulant baby.

                                  MAURA
                    That s what I thought.

                                  JANE
                    Good, getting better at this girl 
                    stuff.

      Jane LOOKS at Dean in the b.g. Maura FOLLOWS her look.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    This is stupid. He s not worth it.

      A BEAT between them before they both BUST UP, laughing.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, yes he is.

                                  MAURA
                    What do we do now?

                                  JANE
                    Hell if I know. 

                                  MAURA
                    I say on three, we jump in my car 
                    and go get a massage. 

                                  JANE
                    Deal. 1-2-3. Go.
