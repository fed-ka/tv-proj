      ADAM and DERS are playing CHESS (though we don t see the 
      pieces yet).   

                                  ADAM
                    I see you re using the Sicilian 
                    defense.  Too bad it s no match for 
                    my King s Gambit. 

      Adam makes his move and slaps an ALARM CLOCK as if it were a 
      chess clock.

                                  ANDERS
                    You are just repeating terminology 
                    that you ve memorized.

      REVEAL:  Instead of chess pieces, they are using mini-bottles 
      of various liquors.  Adam moves a piece.  SLAPS clock.  Ders 
      makes a quick move knocking over one of Adam s pieces.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    Clearly you forgot that Crown Royal 
                    can move in any direction.  Now 
                    drink up.

                                  ADAM
                    Don t tell me how it works, I m 
                    basically the Bobby Fish of Booze 
                    Chess.

      Adam takes the fallen piece, opens it, DRINKS it.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Is it weird that I want to lose?

      BLAKE enters dressed in a policeman s uniform with the shirt 
      unbuttoned, exposing his chest.

                                  ANDERS
                    Whoa, can we help you, officer?

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, looking like L.L. on NCSI.

                    I know, pretty dope, right?  It s

                                  ADAM
                    Now that s a smart way to meet the 
                    ladies.

                                  BLAKE
                    No, it s a smart way to get a great 
                    work out.  And yes, I ve made a lot 
                    of really cool friends.  I 
                      definitely plan on staying in touch 
                    with Cheryl, Penny, and Lori.  Just

                    I think they ll start after they

                    Check it out: Freeze!  I m going to

      Blake hums an R&B song while grinding against the banister.

                          (Doing a butt grab)
                    A little of this guy.  Then some of 
                    the nip-shaking.  My sex appeal is 
                    no big deal.

                                  BLAKE
                    And this next move is called... 
                    Sexual Justice!

      Blake tears off his breakaway pants.  Now he s wearing MINI

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Adam, Blake, and Ders crowd one of their computers ogling the 
      monitor.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you saying you wouldn t bang 
                    Tyra Banks in this fat-suit?

                                  ANDERS
                    I don t think that s a fat suit.  I 
                    can see her gunt.

                                  BLAKE
                    That s a faux-gunt.  Totally 
                      prosthetic.  Unlike my boner, which 
                    is so real.

                                  ADAM
                    Wait, what s a gunt again?

      BRADLEY, 25, mentally handicapped, enters wearing slacks, a 
      button-up shirt, and a NAME TAG.

                                    BRADLEY
                    It s a Gut-Cunt.  Hi, I m Bradley, 
                    the office ISP Supervisor.  I 
                    monitor your web activity.  A lot 
                    of porn, boys.  

      At this, the guys are confused.

                                  ADAM
                    Wait, you re our ISP guy?

                                    BRADLEY
                    What, you don t think I could be an 
                    ISP Supervisor? 

      He taps his name tag.  The guys suddenly feel terrible.

                                    ADAM/ANDERS/BLAKE
                    No!/Not at all./That s not what we 
                    meant.

                                  ANDERS
                    We just meant we don t watch any 
                      pornography.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              4.

                                  ADAM
                    What is porn even?

                                  BLAKE
                    I think it s sexier when women 
                    don t show skin.

                                  ANDERS
                    You know what I find sexy?  A pair 
                    of beautiful eyes.  The curve of a 
                    neck.  A laugh.

      Bradley leans in conspiratorially. 

                                    BRADLEY
                    Cut the shit, jag holes.  I can 
                    keep this info from your boss... 
                    for a fee.

      The guys are relieved, and quickly start searching their 
      wallets for cash.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, phew.  Cause we watch a lot of 
                      pornography.  Mostly the weird 
                    stuff.  DP, 3P, 4P, 5P.

                                  ANDERS
                          (shyly)
                    I like boo-cake.

                                  BLAKE
                    Mr. Chew s Asian Beaver.  The guy s 
                      a showman.

      Anders pools their money, and hands it to Bradley.  It s a 
      few bills and some change.

                                  ANDERS
                    Okay, here you go.  That is 
                      approximately fourteen bucks and my  
                    Barnes and Noble membership card.

      Just then, ALICE walks over. 

                                  ALICE
                    I see you met my brother, Bradley.  
                    Did he scam you for money?

      The guys look at each other -- they just got totally punked!  
      They nod at Bradley, impressed.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              5.

                                    BRADLEY
                    That s not even a real thing.

                    I ll have to watch myself around 
                    this guy.

      Adam high-fives Bradley.

                                  ALICE
                    Give them their money back, Brad.

      WAYMOND peeks around the corner. 

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    You re not getting your money back, 
                    Waymond!  It s sixty bucks.  Jesus, 
                    let it go.

      Waymond sadly exits.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, Brad, I gotta work late 
                    tonight.  But there are leftover 
                    calzones in the fridge.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Ugh, I m tired of being cooped up 
                    in your stupid widow-pad.

                                  ALICE
                    I m not a widow, Bradley, I got 
                    divorced!  I m an independent 
                    woman, in the prime of my life.

      Bradley rolls his eyes, as our guys snicker.

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re thirty-nine and alone.  I 
                    run train on chicks like you.

      The guys look at each other, amazed and impressed -- they 
      can t believe someone is talking to Alice like this.

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    Why don t I hang with these guys?

                          (to Bradley)
                    Really?  These guys, Brad?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              6.

                    Come on, Alice.  For B-Rad.

                                  ALICE 
                    Fine.

                        Yes!/Awesome!/Niiiiice!

      Blake and Ders pal with Bradley and Alice grabs Adam aside.

                                  ALICE
                    I love my brother more than 
                    anything.  I don t get to see him 
                    that much -- so have a good time, 
                    but don t do anything stupid, or I 
                    will be eating a 6-testicle 
                    omelette for breakfast tomorrow.

      Adam s eyes widen.

                                  ADAM
                          (terrified)
                    Okay.


      MONTAGE of the guys getting fucked up with Bradley:

      1.  Adam lays on the bar as Bradley holds a bottle of Jack 
      Daniels like it s his dick and pours it into Adam s mouth.

      2.  Bradley and Blake sing karaoke for the entire bar.

      3.  Bradley and Anders do the electric slide (or the dance TI 
      and JT do in the My Love video).

      4.  Bradley does a flaming-shot with no hands.

      5.  Anders wins at foosball and the guys POUR A PITCHER OF 
      BEER on his head.


      Ders nervously drives with Adam shotgun and Blake and Bradley 
      in the back.

                                  ADAM
                    Punch it, they stop selling beer in 
                    like five minutes!

                                    BRADLEY
                    S go!

      Bradley grabs Blake while Adam and Ders stay in the car.  
      After a beat:

                          (to Ders)
                    It turns me on when you talk about 
                    your comfort zone.

                                  ANDERS

                      I couldn t be more sober.


      Blake and Bradley race to the CASHIER with a case of beer.

                                  BLAKE
                    One case of beers, please.

      The cashier shakes his head and taps the clock on the 
      register.

                                    CASHIER
                    I m sorry, it s 2:02.

                    C mon, man.  Be a king tonight.  
                    Make that choice.

      He shakes his head, and Blake and Bradley walk back to the 
      beverage aisle to put back the beers.  Blake is dejected.

                    Yeah, maybe we should grab you a 
                    vaginal douche for your giant 
                    PUSSY!!!  Come on, man.  Watch and 
                    learn.

      He hands Blake the case of beers, then tears it open.  Blake 
      looks around, freaked.  Bradley takes a case of soda and 
      starts emptying it, and switching beers for sodas.

                                  BLAKE
                    Look at this dude.  Beer MacGruber.

                                    BRADLEY
                    This is  day one  shit, dude.

      Bradley finishes and they head back up to the cashier.

                                  BLAKE
                    One case of sodas, please.

      The cashier suspiciously rings them up.  Blake looks to 
      Bradley who nods at him like,  We got this.   As they re 
      getting rung up, Blake nervously chats the Cashier.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    I like your weird tie.

      All set, they start to walk out. 

                                    BRADLEY
                          (pointedly taking the 
                            change)
                    Keep the change.

      Just as they re almost out of the store, the case RIPS, and a 
      BEER falls out.  They make EYE CONTACT with the Cashier.  He 
      menacingly FLICKS OPEN an EXPANDING BATON.  Oh FUCK!!!

      FADE IN:


      We come back on Blake and Bradley, frozen as they stare at 
      the Cashier. 

                                  BLAKE
                    What?  That s not a soda at all.  I 
                    want my money back!

      The Cashier LUNGES toward them.  Bradley THROWS the change in 
      his face.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Run!


      Through the seat, Blake and Adam open the arm rest leading 
      into the trunk so they can talk to Bradley (who s still in 
      the trunk).  Ders is driving, looking crazy stressed.

                                  BLAKE
                          (to Brad in the trunk)
                    We ll pull over in a second and get 
                    you out of there.

                                    BRADLEY
                    I m cool.

                                  ADAM
                    Ders, you re going to get pulled 
                    over for driving too slow.

                                  ANDERS
                    I m not driving any faster!  We re 
                    already criminals, I m driving 
                    drunk...

                                  ADAM

                    and the guy probably got my license

                                  BLAKE
                    That s all true.

                    I-- Is someone smoking weed?!

      Blake and Adam shake their heads.  Bradley pops his head 
      through the arm rest.

                                    BRADLEY
                    All me, dogg.  Just hot-boxing with 
                    God.

      Bradley pulls the armrest closed.

                                  BLAKE
                       Hot-boxing with God ?
                          (impressed)
                    This guy s savage.

      Ders brings the car to a stop.  They re in a long line of 
      traffic.  Now Ders is really starting to panic.

                                  ANDERS
                    This is not cool.  It s my Kia, my

                    Ders, relax.
                          (rolls down the window and 
                            looks out)

                    What is a DUI checkpoint?

      Ders  eyes WIDEN in fear.

                    Ders, let s just think this 
                      through...

      But Ders is already GONE with the keys.  Adam and Blake share 
      a scared look.  Then they, too, bolt out of the car.


      Our guys sit holding walkie-talkies.  KARL is wearing weird, 
      LOUD  No Limit Soldier -type camouflage.  He hands Blake a 
      pair of bolt cutters.

                                  KARL
                    Alright soldiers, so here s how it

                          (as if it s obvious)
                    I wrote that on there.  The van 
                    doesn t have locks so that keeps 
                    the weirdos away.

      REVEAL: A huge Samoan dude with a keyboard in the corner.  
      He s rocking out, but we can t hear him, because the keyboard 
      is attached to his headphones.  He nods at the guys.

                                  KARL
                    That s Sebastian.  I m producing

                    Havana.

      Off Karl s excited grin...


      Back in the van, Sebastian is crushing it on the keyboard and 
      Adam is wearing the headphones.  Adam is loving it, rocking 
      out super hard.

                                  ANDERS
                    Guys, it s like 4 AM, Alice is 
                    going to be severely pissed when we 
                    drop Bradley off.

                                    BRADLEY
                    She might not have to know -- I 
                    just got a text from her, she s 
                    just heading home from the office 
                    now.

                                  ANDERS
                    So we have a chance of beating her 
                    home?

      Anders hits the gas.

                                  ADAM
                    This is what I m talking about, 
                    Ders.  This is the kind of sexy 
                      recklessness people want in a City 
                      Councilman.

                                  BLAKE
                    What kind of work is she doing in 
                    the office this late?  Nothing 
                    important happens at that company.  
                    Ever.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know, but I gotta start 
                    working late, and accident into 
                    some sort of Frasier and Roz 
                      situation.

      SFX: Music starts as we begin a montage of the dudes racing 
      Alice home, a la Ferris Bueller s Day Off.

        INTERCUTTING between our guys and Alice.


                                    BRADLEY
                    I know a short cut -- Left here!  
                    Right at the light!


      Adam, Ders, and Karl sit in the audience.  Sebastian sits on 
      stage behind a keyboard, in a fedora.

                                  ADAM
                    I am so excited.

                                  ANDERS
                    I got him flowers for after the 
                    show.

      Ders holds up a bouquet.

                                  ADAM
                    Damn, you re a good friend!

      The INSTRUCTOR comes out on the stage.

                                  INSTRUCTOR

      CONTINUED:

      Sebastian begins playing his keyboard.  From the wings come 
      all of the students from Blake s strip-robics class.  It s 
      all ladies and him.  He s dressed up as an INDIAN CHIEF.

                                  KARL
                          (proudly nudging Ders)
                    This is his first single.

      The strippers start doing a beautifully choreographed strip 
      routine.  Blake gives a thumbs up to Adam and Ders.  Adam 
      turns to the man next to him.

                                  ADAM
                    That s my roommate.

      As Blake dances joyfully, we:
