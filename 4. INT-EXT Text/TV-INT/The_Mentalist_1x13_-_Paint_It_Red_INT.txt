      FRANK and KEELY are locked in a fervent kiss.  He s late 30s, 
      turned corporate suit.  She s late 20 s, in prim but sexy 
        receptionist kit.  They make their way across the luxe foyer 
      with a slightly furtive air, stopping at a set of heavy 
      wooden doors. 

                                  KEELY
                    Are you sure about this?  What if 
                    someone sees us?

                                  FRANK
                    Relax, baby.  I ve got it all under 
                    control.

      He takes a hi-tech card from his pocket and slides it through 
      a scanner.  The door locks clunk open.  The couple slips 
      through the doors to...


      An imposing room, more like an aristocrat s study than an 
      office.  Old masters and armor on the wall.  A baronial desk.  
      A fireplace even.  There s one obvious patch on the wall 
      where a picture has been taken down, but Frank and Keely 
      don t notice that.  Tearing at each other s clothes, they go 
      down to the floor on a beautiful silk carpet in the center of 
      the room.  After a moment, WE, then Keely, SEE A YOUNG MAN 
      LYING ON THE FLOOR BEHIND THE DESK, STARING AT THEM.  Keely 
      SCREAMS.  They leap up.  The young man doesn t move.  He s 
      dead. 


      JANE and LISBON walk down a corridor lined with expensive 
      statuary and are greeted by CHO, who s with Frank.  

                                  CHO
                    Hey.

                                  LISBON
                    Hey.

      Cho and Frank fall in beside Lisbon and Jane.

                                  CHO
                    This is Frank Schiappa.  Executive 
                    Director of Security. 

                                  LISBON
                    Lisbon, Jane.  

      Frank does a sort of mime to indicate he s filing the names 
      away properly...

                                  FRANK
                    Lisbon.  Jane.  Good to meet you. 
                    Like I told your agent here.  
                    Whatever we can do to assist you, 
                    we will do.

                                  LISBON 
                    That s good to hear.  


      The dead body of the young man is now lying on the floor of 
      the luxe foyer, directly outside the doors of the office, in 
      a superman pose, arms stretched out in front of him.  

                                  LISBON
                          (to Cho)
                    What do we have?

                                  CHO
                    Name s Harry Lashley, a junior Veep 
                    with the company.  He s the son-in-
                    law of the boss.  A.P. Caid? 

      Frank points out Keely, talking weepily to a uniform 
        policewoman.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    The receptionist Miss Duane over 
                    there forgot her phone, came back 
                    to get it, and found him like this.   

                                  FRANK
                    She called security.  Luckily I was 
                    working late, and I called 911 soon 
                    as I got here.  Then I opened up 
                    Mr. Caid s private office to check 
                    that nothing was amiss.  I have an 
                    all access security pass.  

      They go through the door to...           THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     3.



      Frank points out the bare patch on the wall. 

                                  FRANK 
                    Only one thing was taken. 
                    But it s the most valuable.

      Cho hands Lisbon a copy of a GLOSSY SOTHEBY S-LIKE AUCTION 
      CATALOGUE.  The cover reads,  Cabot s -- Old Master Paintings 
      -- Day Sale,  and shows a Renaissance PORTRAIT OF A BEAUTIFUL 
      YOUNG WOMAN in fine apparel.  She sits before a window, 
      outside of which a Fourteenth Century Italian world is 
      depicted in rich and minute detail -- farmers toiling in the 
      fields, craftsmen at their work in guildhalls, townspeople 
      marketing, highborn lords and ladies in their castles.  

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    A.P. bought it at auction a couple 
                    of months ago.  Paid a little over 
                    fifty million dollars for it.

                                  LISBON 
                    Wow.

                                  FRANK
                    Uh huh.

      Jane s been examining the body and the scene carefully.      
      He notes TORN STITCHING ON THE SEAMS OF HARRY S JACKET 
      SLEEVES where they join the shoulder.  And one of his shoes 
      is half off. 

                                  JANE
                    You say the doors to this room were 
                    closed when you got here? 

                                  FRANK
                    Yes.  The office is always locked 
                    up when A.P. s not here.  It s a 
                    strict rule he has.

                                  LISBON
                    And Mr. Lashley?  Why would he have 
                    been here?

                                  FRANK
                    No idea.  His office is two floors 
                    down.  He had no reason to be here.

                                  LISBON 
                    Maybe he was involved.

      Jane moves around the room, closely examining this and that 
      object. 

                                  JANE
                    If we re lucky, we ll find the 
                    murder weapon.  This was a well 
                    planned robbery, obviously...

                                  CHO
                    Why s that obvious?

                                  JANE
                    Nobody finds themselves in a locked 
                    room full of old masters in the 
                    middle of the night by accident.  
                    So, well planned.  But they didn t 
                    expect to meet any opposition, 
                    otherwise Mr. Lashley here would 
                    have been shot or tasered or tied 
                    up and gagged.  But when surprised 
                    by him, they simply hit him over 
                    the head.  Which suggests an 
                      improvised weapon, yes?

                                  LISBON
                    I m listening...

      Jane s moving round the room, trying this and that object for 
      heft.  

                                  JANE
                    Something like this...

      He points to a miniature bronze BUST OF CAESAR on the desk.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                      I confidently predict forensics 
                    will find traces of Harry Lashley 
                    on this head.

      Cho s willing to go with that, and bags the bust.  

                                  FRANK
                    No offense, but I used to be police 
                    myself, and that s not policework.  
                    That s guessing. 

      Jane studies Frank. 

                                  JANE 
                    Frank, is there a good diner around 
                    here?

                    Uh, yeah.  Garrity s.  Couple 
                    blocks over on Hudson.

                                  JANE 
                    Do they do good eggs?

                                  FRANK
                          (huh?)
                    I guess.

                                  JANE
                    That s the test of a good diner.  
                    Eggs.  You must have had a 
                      contentious relationship with your 
                    father.

                                  FRANK
                    Excuse me?  No.

                                  JANE
                    And tell me, I can t tell with her 
                    hair in her face and the weeping, 
                    but I imagine Ms. Duane s quite 
                      attractive, isn t she?  
                      Receptionists are often hired for 
                    their looks.

                                  FRANK
                    What are you talking about?  

                                  LISBON
                    Good question.  Where are you going 
                    with this?

      Jane goes to the body, turns to Lisbon and Cho...

                                  JANE
                    Look at the shoulder seams on his 
                    jacket.  Pulled apart.  Look at the 
                    way he s laid out so straight.  And 
                    how his shoe s coming off... 

      He demonstrates, miming taking Harry by the wrists and 
      pulling.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, we all noticed.  Someone 
                    dragged him here.

                    And why?  You want to tell us,

                                  FRANK
                    I don t know what you re talking

                                  JANE
                    I ll explain then.  You and Ms. 
                    Duane came up here to have sex in 
                    the boss s office --

      Flustered, Frank goes for bluster.

                                  FRANK
                    --- That s absurd!  Why would I do 
                    such a --

                                  JANE
                    -- Because it s forbidden and thus 
                    very sexy, of course.  Especially 
                    if you have father issues.  And who 
                    doesn t?  It s a furtive, but 
                    powerful challenge to the paternal 
                      authority.  So you open up A.P. s 
                    office.  Oh crap, you find a dead 
                    body.  You have to report it, 
                      obviously.  But how to explain your 
                    presence in his office?  A quick 
                    and dirty solution.  Drag the body 
                    out of the office, and lock the 
                    doors again before calling the 
                    police.

                                  FRANK

                    He s a pain in the ass.  But he s 
                    making sense so far.  You want to 
                      reconsider your statements?

                    I would like to, Frank.  Believe 
                    me, I have zero interest in your 
                    sex life, but it occurs to me, in a 
                    room like this, there must be 
                    security cameras.  Yes?

      Frank looks abashed.

                                  FRANK
                    Yes.

                    the cameras in here were off.  
                    Probably because you turned them 
                    off yourself.  Being head of 
                    security and all.  They are off, 
                    aren t they?

      Frank nods, defeated.

                    So, the question is Frank, how long 
                    have the cameras been off, and who 
                    else might know that they were 
                    going to be off this evening? 

      Frank looks ashen.  Lisbon and Cho look predatory.  Jane

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon comes through the double doors accompanied by Van 
      Pelt.  Van Pelt hands Lisbon the CABOT AUCTION CATALOGUE.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    It s known as  The Moro.   It s 
                    from 14th Century Italy, a portrait 
                    of somebody named Carlotta Moro and 
                    it s the only known work by an 
                    artist known as the Siennese 
                    Master.  

      INSERT -- catalogue with the Carlotta Moro portrait on the 
      cover.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    It s been owned by two Popes, the 
                    King of France, and John Jacob 
                    Astor among others.  Then A.P. Caid 
                    bought it for fifty million dollars 
                    three months ago.

      Rigsby whistles.

                                  LISBON
                    What do we know about Caid?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Apart from he s an idiot with his 
                    money...

      Rigsby pushes a Forbes Magazine-like business journal across 
      the table.  A.P. Caid is on the cover: a brash Ted Turner 
      type, he grins challengingly into the camera, arms crossed 
      with self-confident power.  The caption under him reads:  
       THE ROUGHNECK TYCOON. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                          (pointing at the magazine)
                    Like the cover says, he got his 
                    start as a roughneck in the oil 
                    fields, then turned himself into a  
                      wildcatter and made a fortune 
                    before he was thirty.  Tough guy -- 
                    his trick s pulling oil out of 
                    places where nobody else has the 
                    balls to go.

                    So where is he now? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Somewhere on a sailboat.  He s been 
                    told what s happened, and he s 
                    coming back quick as he can.  I was 
                    thinking, it would ve been easy for 
                    him to sail up or down the coast a 
                    few miles, put in to a small 
                    marina, then come back and commit 
                    the crime without anyone knowing.

                                  LISBON
                    Why would he want to do that?

                                  RIGSBY
                    I m just saying he could.
                    Maybe he wants the insurance money.  
                    Or he wants to get rid of Harry.  
                    Doesn t like that he s married to 
                    his daughter.

                    What d you get from the security 
                    staff?

                                  CHO
                    Everybody at the company that 
                    didn t wear a suit knew all about 
                    Frank Schiappa and his use of 
                    A.P. s office.  Any number of 
                    people might have known the cameras 
                    were off last night.  

                                  LISBON
                    So I guess we ll have to check up 
                    on any number of people.

      Lisbon looks at her watch, rises.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                      Especially Harry Lashley.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    You think he s dirty?

                    He s involved.  Why else was he 
                    there in the middle of the night?  


      STEVIE CAID (late 20 s) escorts Lisbon and Jane to her 
      office, which is just down the hall from A.P. s.  The crime 
      scene tape is still up.  Forensics still doing their snail-
      like thing.  A shrewd and capable organizer, at the moment, 
      Stevie s professional demeanor seems fragile, as if she might 
      crumble into tears. 

                                  STEVIE 
                    If it wasn t for you people, and 
                    all this... 
                          (off the tape etc.)
                      I wouldn t believe it.  Harry s 
                    going to walk through the door, and 
                    this is all just a strange dream.  
                    But here you are.  Harry s dead.

                                  LISBON
                    When was the last time you spoke to 
                    him? 

                                  STEVIE 
                    Yesterday afternoon.  Just chit 
                    chat, where to go for dinner.  
                    Then he left me a message, 
                      cancelling.  He didn t say why.

                                  LISBON
                    That wasn t unusual?  Cancelling 
                    with no reason given?

      Stevie shakes her head.

                                  STEVIE 
                    No.  Harry was very hardworking.  
                    Very keen.  Stuff would come up all 
                    the time.   

                                  LISBON
                    What was his job exactly?

      Stevie flashes a small, sad smile.

                                  STEVIE 
                    Good question.  He was a sort of 
                      jack-of-all-trades for my father.
                    Did whatever he needed from week to 
                    week.  My father liked having 
                    someone on hand with no ties or 
                      friendships within the company. 

      They enter...


      It s much smaller and more utilitarian than her father s 
      office.  A couple of PHOTOS of classic jazz musicians on the 
      walls.  A place to work.  A posed picture of her and Harry. 
      Stevie sits behind her desk. 

                                  LISBON
                    Tough assignment.

                                  STEVIE 
                    Yes.  But he only joined the 
                    company when we got married.  He 
                    was learning the ropes. 

                                  JANE
                    Your father didn t want Harry to 
                    get a soft ride just because he was 
                    your husband.

                                  STEVIE 
                    Yes.  You could put it like that.

                      guitarist.

                    I looked at his fingers.  Guitar 
                    player s fingers.  Jazz with a 
                    flamenco edge, judging by the ridge 
                    on his thumb.

                    He was playing a gig at some 
                    ghastly event you had to go to and 
                    you struck up a conversation, 
                    because you love jazz, so you could 
                    talk easily to him, which is 
                    normally quite hard for you.  
                    Outside of business.

      Stevie s thrown completely.  How the hell? 

                                  STEVIE

      Stevie looks to Lisbon as if for assistance.

                          (all business)
                    I m sorry, Ms. Caid.  He s showing 
                    off.  Can you think of any reason 
                    Harry would be on this floor?  At 
                    that time of night?

                                  STEVIE
                    No.  He would have known that 
                    neither I nor my father were here.  

                                  LISBON
                    So...

                                  STEVIE
                      I understand from my assistant that 
                    Frank Schiappa s misbehavior was an 
                    open secret amongst the junior 
                    staff.  He is no longer a Caid 
                    employee by the way.  Perhaps Harry 
                    had found out and he was trying to 
                    catch him.   

                                  LISBON
                    Perhaps.  Or is it possible he had 
                    prior knowledge that a theft was 
                    going to take place?

                    You re asking if he could have been 
                    complicit in the theft.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes I am.

                                  STEVIE
                    The answer is no.  Harry was 
                    honest, and gentle.  No.  

                                  LISBON
                    He never talked about the painting

                                  STEVIE
                    No.  I didn t approve of buying it. 
                    Fifty million dollars is far too 
                    much money to spend on a single 
                    object.  But my father likes things 
                    done his way, so...

                                  LISBON
                    But from what I ve gathered, your 
                    father very much relies on your 
                    advice.  

                                  STEVIE
                          (wryly)
                    Only when he agrees with it.  And 
                    when it comes to art, rational 
                    arguments don t apply for him.  
                    That would be Kathryn Hawkes  area 
                    of expertise.

                    have his business rivals delivered 
                    to him hog-tied and naked so he can 
                    kill them personally.  Vicious, 
                    greedy, and owner of the finest 
                      collection of Renaissance paintings 
                    in Russia.

                    Harry Lashley has a past.  Ten 
                    years ago in Canada, he stole cash 
                    from a video store he was working 
                    at.  Busted and served six months.  

                                  LISBON
                    Damn.  I was kind of hoping he was 
                    clean.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Yup.  Nope.  Then I tried to find 
                    any connection he had with the art 
                    world, and this popped up.

      She hands over a Xerox copy of a cashier s check.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    A month ago, he paid a company 
                    called R.W. Arts twenty thousand 
                    dollars.  That s pretty much the 
                    only financial transaction he s 
                    made recently.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    I don t know yet.  A shell, 
                    probably.  The address is just a 
                    mailbox in Lockesdale.  That s a 
                    little farming town up north.

      CU on a LITTLE GIRL in a best-company dress, face clean, hair 
      brushed and tied with a pretty ribbon.  She is sitting up 
      very straight, a large pumpkin beside her, a blue 4H ribbon 
      on the side of it.  She smiles a wide smile, revealing a 
      missing tooth.

                    another minute...

      Annie and her pumpkin are sitting in a light-filled painter s 
      studio.  Jane and Van Pelt enter.  Across the room from Annie 
      and her pumpkin, ROB WALLACE (30 s, handsome in a rugged, 
      Marlboro man way) sits at a canvas, using poster paint to 
      execute a portrait.  Annie s proud Parents sit in chairs 
      against the wall behind him, watching.

      Noticing Jane and Van Pelt, Rob looks up from his work.

                    Will do. 

      Jane s already prowling around.  Van Pelt waits, a little 
      awkward.  The little girl s MOM smiles at him, curious about 
      the couple.

                    She hates it when I m open about 
                    this stuff.   

      Annie s parent s exchange a glance.  Van Pelt looks daggers 
      at Jane.  Jane takes a look at Rob s work.

                    He s just playing the fool.  Stop

      Van Pelt sighs, tacitly agreeing to cooperate with Jane s 
      play.  Rob and Annie s parents look at each other and raise 
      their eyebrows. 


      Van Pelt settles into a pose for Rob Wallace, pencil in hand 
      making a preliminary sketch.

                    Don t put her eyes too close

                    Bad habit.  Where s your

                    Down the hall, door on your right, 
                    just under the stairs.

      As Jane exits...

                    Not too close, that s all I m 
                    saying...


      Jane makes his way down the wide-board floor of the hallway.  
      The walls are plain, unadorned.  Everything is simple and 
      clean.  Reaching the bathroom, Jane notices a pattern of 
      multi-colored handprints smudged on the wall heading back 
      into the house.  He glances backwards, then shuts the 
      bathroom door and heads deeper into the building, following 
      the paint handprints...


      Rob starts sketching. 

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    You have an excellent nose.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Thank you.


      Jane enters a small bare room, the faint trace of paint 
      handprints are on the doorknob and smudged on the door frame 
      to a closet.  Jane opens the closet.  It s empty.  Jane raps 
      on the back wall of the closet.


      Rob sketching.  Van Pelt holding very still.

                    Just passing through town are you?

      Van Pelt has no talent for embellishment.

                    Yes.  Passing through.

                    Have you lived here long?

      Rob Wallace nods.

                    together?

      Van Pelt tries to keep Rob s attention from the SOUNDS of 
      Jane in the back.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Um, not long.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Because -- well, okay, I ll say it.  
                    Are you sure about marrying this 
                    guy?  He appears to be kind of a 
                    jerk, no offense.

      Rob seems oblivious.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh no, yes.  I m not marrying him.  
                    That s, no.  Don t worry about 
                    that.  Not going to happen.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Well alright then.  I m glad to

                    Turn your head to the right a 
                    little, look down.  There.  Hold

      SHOTGUN from a footlocker. 

                                  ROB WALLACE (CONT D)
                    Okay, stand up.

      Now she sees it.


      Jane is about to exit, but something makes him go back to the 
      closet: a bare pole with some wire hangers on it, three 
      clothes hooks along one wall.  Jane thoughtfully tugs at one 
      of the clothes hooks.  Nothing happens.  He frowns, tries 
      another.  Still nothing.  He squints at the last one -- a 
      faint smudge of paint.  He tugs, and there is an audible 
       click.   The BACK WALL SWINGS OPEN.  A hidden door.  On the 
      other side, a small chamber and on an easel, the MISSING 
      PORTRAIT OF CARLOTTA MORO.

      Jane smiles thoughtfully.  Van Pelt appears, followed by Rob 
      Wallace with the shotgun.

                                  ROB WALLACE

      Jane does what he s told.

      FADE IN:


      Jane and Van Pelt held at gunpoint by Rob Wallace.

                                  JANE
                    Steady now.  Steady...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Mr. Wallace, if you would just let 
                    me show you my ID.  We re from the 
                      California Bureau of Investigation.  
                    Our office knows we re here.  If 
                    you kill us, they ll know who did 
                    it.

      Rob is having trouble keeping up with Van Pelt.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Kill you?  Why would I kill you? 
                    You re cops?

                                  VAN PELT 
                      Investigating the murder of Harry 
                    Lashley.

                                    WALLACE
                    Lashley s dead?  Oh my gosh.  He s 
                    dead?  What happened?

                                  VAN PELT 
                    We were hoping you might tell us 
                    that.  Seeing that you have the 
                    stolen painting in your possession.

                                  JANE 
                    It s a copy.  Mr. Wallace here is 
                    an art forger.  And a very good 
                    one, from the look of it.  He s not 
                    a thief. 

                                  VAN PELT
                          (embarrassed)
                    Oh.  Well then, put the gun down.


      Rob talking with Jane and Van Pelt. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     24.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Mr. Lashley came to me a couple of 
                    months ago and commissioned two 
                    copies of The Moro.

                                  JANE
                    How did he find you?

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    People who need my services tend to 
                    find me eventually.  It s not a 
                    crime what I do.  If you have a 
                    valuable painting, it s only 
                    sensible to have a copy made for 
                    display.  So that you can keep the 
                    real thing safe.  I gave him the 
                    copies a month ago. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    You gave two copies to him already?  
                    So what s this one for?

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    This one, I did for myself.  It s  
                      a beautiful picture.  I d come to 
                    love her.

                                  JANE
                    Why did he want two copies?

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    He didn t say.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    And you didn t ask questions.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    He paid me ten thousand dollars for 
                    each of them.  No, I didn t ask 
                      questions.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How do we know this isn t the real 
                    thing? 

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Look, I m not a forger, I m an 
                    artist.  I m not trying to trick 
                    anyone.  I always add details that 
                    ensure nobody can sell my work as 
                    the genuine article.

      CONTINUED: (2)2323

                                  VAN PELT
                          (dubious)
                    That s very ethical of you.  
                    Looks pretty much exactly the same 
                    to me.

                                  JANE
                    He s telling the truth.  Look close.

      Van Pelt stares at the painting -- the ineffable smile that 
      hovers around the corner of Carlotta Moro s mouth, the 
      exquisite brushwork of the lace at her neck, the dove in a 
      cage beside her.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What?  What am I looking for?

                                  JANE
                    Closer.

      He points -- out the window behind Carlotta Moro, where the 
      landscape stretches, smaller and smaller into the distance.  
      Farmers in the fields... husbandmen tending cattle... a 
      village wedding...

                                  VAN PELT
                          (leaning in)
                    I still don t --

                                  JANE
                    -- You ve almost found it.

      Frustrated, Van Pelt squints to see: a hunting party of noble 
      lords and ladies in rich finery... a castle on a hilltop... 
      the battlements patrolled by footmen armed with pikes...

                                  VAN PELT
                          (eyes widening)
                    Oh!

      Van Pelt s finger reaches out and touches the canvas.  
      Peeking out from all the flags and towers bristling from the 
      castle s battlements, a tiny anachronistic touch: an old-
      fashioned television aerial.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    A TV aerial.  They didn t have TV.

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Like I said.  I m not a forger.

                    this from you for a while?  To show 
                    our boss?

                                  ROB WALLACE
                    Uh, I don t know about that.   
                    How do I know I ll get it back?

                                  JANE
                    Let me put it another way.  Lend it 
                    to me or Agent Van Pelt is fully 
                    entitled to take you and the 
                    painting back to Sacramento, 
                    and keep you there answering dumb 
                    questions for hours and hours.

      ON ROB.  It s not much of a choice...


      Jane, holding The Moro, wrapped in a blanket, talking with 
      Lisbon.

                    Copies uh?  Clever.  Harry and his

                    once, but they get to sell it three

                    Hey, boss.  A.P. Caid s back from 
                    his trip.  He s on the way to his 
                    office.


      A.P. CAID strides into frame, laughing.  He s tanned and 
      weathered, wearing a Helly Hansen slicker and boat shoes.  
      Jane, Lisbon, Stevie, and Kathryn Hawkes follow.  The man s a 
      charismatic self-absorbed force of nature.

                    ...No no you have it all wrong.
                    I told Harry to get me a copy made 
                    on the hush hush.  I mean, hell, 
                    what kind of idiot puts fifty 
                    million dollars on a wall for 
                    anybody to steal?

                                  LISBON
                    It was a copy that was stolen.

                    All due respect, A.P., why didn t

                    here is my responsibility.

                                  A.P. CAID 
                    You didn t need to know.  This kind 
                    of trick, the fewer people know, 
                    the better.    

      He laughs out loud.

                    And it paid off uh?  Some thieving 
                      sonofabitch just paid a whole lot 
                    of money for junk.

                    I really liked that kid.  He was 
                    going to go places here.  

      A.P. gives his daughter a perfunctory hug, the falsity of 
      which betrays to her the fact that he s too self-absorbed to 
      really give a shit. 

                                  JANE
                    Can we have a look at the painting?

      The Carlotta Moro portrait sits on an easel at the center of

                    A.P., I assure you --

                                  A.P. CAID
                          (accusing)
                    You re supposed to have such a good 
                    eye and you bought me a fake?

                                    KATHRYN
                          (with offended dignity)
                    Mr. Caid, I can state with absolute 
                    certainty that the painting I 
                    bought for you and put into your 
                    hands was genuine.  I have the 
                    documents to prove it.  If you 
                    chose to engage in some clever 
                      subterfuge without my knowledge, I 
                    can hardly be blamed for the 
                    results. 

      And she sweeps from the room with her chin in the air, 
      desperately clutching her tattered dignity.  A.P. seems 
      oblivious to her departure.

                                  A.P. CAID
                    That sonofabitch.  Harry did this.  
                    He switched out the real painting 
                    for the fake one.

                    Were you aware that Harry served 
                    time in prison?  In Canada.  Six 
                    months for theft.  Ten years ago. 

      Stevie tries to stifle her surprise and dismay.

                                  STEVIE
                    Yes.  I mean, no, I, didn t, but it 
                    doesn t, I m sure it s not.  It was 
                    ten years ago.

                          (rising anger)
                    I knew it!  I knew he was no good.   
                    I knew it.  I could feel it.  But I 
                    kept quiet.  For your sake, I 
                    forced myself to trust the guy.  
                    After all this time you finally 
                    find a man, glory hallelujah, and 
                    what does he do?  He steals fifty 
                    million dollars from me.  Damn, 
                    Stevie.

      Stevie turns to Jane and Lisbon.  She has to struggle to 
      speak evenly. 

                                  STEVIE
                    Please, I beg you, find my 
                    husband's murderer.

                    Yes, ma am.  That s what we re 
                    trying to do.

                    They ll tell you the truth.  I want 
                    the truth.  

      Stevie s veneer cracks.  With a convulsive sob she rushes 
      from the room. 

      Scowling, A.P. waves a dismissive hand toward Lisbon and 
      Jane.

                                  A.P. CAID
                    You people can go.

      Lisbon gives him a deadpan gaze.

      force, pulls him from the room.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Because it was part of the plan.  
                    Everybody has to know the 
                      painting s been stolen for him to 
                    have anything to sell.  The

                    So he makes the switch, then he 
                    goes to steal the real painting off 
                    the wall, knowing Frank Schiappa s

                    State Department is crystal clear -- 
                    keep off.  Arlov controls an oil

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon shakes her head as she walks down the hallway to the 
      kitchen, dogged by Jane.

                                  LISBON
                    Nope, nyet, no.  And Minelli said 
                     no,  too.  That s four  no s.  

                                  JANE
                    Minelli always says no.  That s his 
                    job.

                    And it s mine to listen to him.

      They enter the kitchen where Lisbon makes herself a cup of 
      coffee.  Rigsby s there already downing several little yogurt 
      bottles.

                                  JANE
                    You ll walk away?  Arlov is our 
                    guy.  You re going to let him get 
                    away with murder?

                                  LISBON 
                    He didn t do the murder.  He 
                    probably bought the painting from 
                    the murderer.

                    We ll never know unless we go talk 
                    to him.

                    We ll close this case, but not by 
                    causing an international scandal. 

                                  JANE 
                    Arlov s the key.  We won t get 
                    anywhere if we don t get to him.

      Lisbon leaves with her coffee.

                    They re so small.

      Jane waits until Lisbon s out of earshot.

      Jane in back, Rigsby and Cho in front.  Jane taps in a number

      borrowed from Rob Wallace) in his hand, casually wrapped in a 
      towel.  Cho and Rigsby follow at a distance.


      The gangster s revels are still in full swing.  Arlov is on 
      the couch watching TV.  The Guard crosses the room and  
      whispers in Arlov s ear.  Arlov frowns, says something 
      brusque in Russian.  The Guard hurries away.         THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     37.



      Jane enters.  Everybody stares at him.  The guard escorts him 
      to Arlov.  Arlov smiles up at Jane, pats the sofa next to 
      him.  Jane complies, sits down. (NB the Moro portrait is not 
      visible from this part of the suite).  Arlov has good demotic 
      English, like he went to college here.

                                  ARLOV

                                  JANE
                    That s very true.

                                  ARLOV
                    Would you like a drink?  A snack?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Sparkling water please.

      This to the Guard, who scowls and looks to Arlov, who nods.  
      The guard moves off.    


      Rigsby watching Cho listen to his phone.

      Jane s PHONE BUZZES in his pocket, he takes it out and looks 
      at it.

      INSERT -- The PHONE DISPLAY indicates Cho is on the line and 
      Lisbon is waiting...

                                  ARLOV
                    D you want to take that?  Feel free.

                                  JANE
                    Nothing important.

      He puts the phone away.  Drinks some water, very calm and 
      cool.  Arlov picks up the TV remote, pushes pause.  The VIDEO 
      FREEZES, mid-horrific accident.

                                  ARLOV
                          (a shark s smile)
                    So.  Mr. Patrick Jane.  You have a 
                    painting you want to sell me?

      He points his foot at the wrapped frame in Jane s hand.  

                                  ARLOV (CONT D)
                    The Carlotta Moro? 

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                                  ARLOV
                    I don t believe you.

                                  JANE 
                    Take a look.

      He unwraps the painting and shows it to Arlov.  The frame is 
      right, but the picture is a crudely drawn cartoon version of 
      La Moro on paper. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You like it?

      Arlov frowns.  What s this man s game?

                                  ARLOV
                    Are you mad?

                                  JANE
                    Just kidding.  Kidding.  This was 
                    just a prop to get me in the door. 
                    I m aware you already have the 
                    painting. 

      Arlov was about to tell his men to tear Jane up, but this 
      gives him pause. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     40.

                    Really.  You are aware.  
                    How are you aware of this?

                                  JANE
                    A guess.  Confirmed by the 
                    predatory smile on your face when 
                    you asked me about it just now. 
                    You enjoy trapping people in nets 
                    of their own making. 

      A palpable hit with Arlov.  He laughs.

                                  ARLOV
                    Very perceptive of you.

                                  JANE
                    Not really.  Most successful 
                    criminal bosses have a similar 
                    profile.  Sadistic and violent,  
                    but also highly methodical and 
                      psychologically astute.   

      Arlov laughs some more, then turns ice cold.  

                                  ARLOV
                    Why are you here, Mr. Jane?

      Jane shows his CBI ID.

                    Explain.

                                  ARLOV 
                    Who?

                                  JANE
                    The man that died in the course of 
                    the painting s theft.

      Arlov relaxes a little now that he understands Jane s motive 
      for being here.  He pushes  play  on the TV remote button.

                    If you are looking for a bribe, I m 
                    afraid you re out of luck.  You do

                      prosecution in this country. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes, I know.  I show you my ID only 
                    to discourage you from killing or 
                    torturing me or something.  You 
                    might not be arrested for it, but 
                    it would certainly cause a big 
                    fuss.  

                                  ARLOV

                                  JANE
                    Given your immunity, you could tell 
                    me who you bought the painting 
                    from, and do no harm to yourself.

                                  ARLOV
                    Inform to the police?  Why on earth 
                    would I do that? 

                                  JANE
                    Harry Lashley didn t deserve to 
                    die.  He deserves justice.  He has 
                    a wife who needs to know what 
                    happened. 

      Arlov laughs, so do all his henchmen and their women.

                                  ARLOV
                    You re not serious.  Justice. 

                                  JANE
                    Perhaps you haven t paid the full 
                    price of the painting yet.  Perhaps 
                    an arrest would save you some 
                    money.  

                                  ARLOV
                    That s not a bad thought.  But I

      Arlov s man hands Arlov the Moro portrait.  He shows it to

                                  ARLOV

                    to get her.  She is beautiful.        THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     43.



      Cho on the phone...

                                  CHO
                    Now!

      Rigsby uses his elbow to smash the glass of the fire alarm 
      box.  CLANGALALANG!!!


      Everybody turns toward the sound of the fire alarm.  For a 
      second nobody is looking at Jane.  With conjuror s timing, he 
      SWITCHES ARLOV S PAINTING FOR THE COPY he brought with him, 
      lying discarded at his side.  He simultaneously removes the 
      cartoon from the frame (revealing Rob s copy underneath) and 
      slots it into the other frame.  Now Arlov s painting is 
      concealed under the cartoon.  

      When Arlov turns back to Jane he looks exactly as before, and 
      it s impossible to tell that the paintings have been 
      switched.  Arlov takes the painting back.

                                  SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    This is a fire alarm.  Will all 
                    hotel guests move toward the 
                    nearest fire exit.  This is a fire 
                    alarm...

      Arlov scowls at the inconvenience.  He s about to rise,  
      looks at Jane, looks at the painting, looks at the cartoon 
      version by Jane s side, and dismissing his inchoate 
      suspicion, stands up.  Everybody moves toward the door... 


      Jane climbs into the back of the CBI car carrying the 
      painting.  Not a care in the world.

                                  CHO
                    Well?  

      Jane grins.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes!

      He starts the car.

                    You better call Lisbon.  Give her 
                    an update.  

                                  JANE
                    You call her.

                                  RIGSBY
                    I m driving.  Cho, you call...

                                  CHO
                    No way.

                                  JANE
                    I just robbed a Russian gangster. 
                    You can t call Lisbon?  Chickens.   

      Beat.  Cho sighs, opens his phone.

      WIDE SHOT - the CBI car leaves the lot at speed. 


      Jane and Lisbon get off the elevator.  He s carrying the Moro 
      portrait.  Lisbon s in a grump.  They walk to A.P. s 
      office... 

                                  JANE
                    You re not going to be grumpy like 
                    this in the room, are you?

                    If you don t mind me saying, that s 
                    not very professional.

                                  LISBON
                    Don t push me, seriously.

                                  LISBON
                    You had express orders to leave 
                    Arlov alone.

                                  JANE
                    That s why I didn t tell you.  You 
                    had total deniability.

                                  LISBON

                    The point is my brilliant plan 
                    worked like clockwork.  

                                  LISBON
                    What worked?  The case isn t

                                  JANE
                    Watch me.

      Jane enters A.P. s office, holding the painting behind his 
      back.


      So A.P. Caid, Stevie and Kathryn Hawkes don t see the 
      painting at first.

                                  JANE
                    Good morning. 

      Jane produces the painting.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Ta da.

      Jane hands him the picture.

                    Arlov that had it?  

      Jane nods.

                                  JANE
                    It was.

      A.P. hangs the painting over the fireplace.

                    Legally there was nothing we could 
                    do, as you say.  But on the other 
                    hand, Arlov had stolen the 
                    painting, so there s nothing he can 
                    do, either.

      A.P. chortles with delight.

                                  A.P. CAID
                    Better and better!  I have my 
                    painting back, and when Arlov finds 
                    out I ve got it back, it ll kill 
                    him!

      Stevie s fuming.

      catches quickly and it goes up like a torch.  There are

                    Is it?  The reason you had two 
                    copies made was so you could sell 
                    one to Arlov and keep the real

                    Harry, right before the portrait 
                    was to be taken to the vault.

      He turns back to Kathryn.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    But poor Harry must have suspected 
                      something.  He guessed your plan, 
                    and he came to stop you.  

      Harry comes in, goes to stop Kathryn.  They fight.  Kathryn 
      grabs the little bust of Caesar off the desk and hits Harry 
      over the head.

                                  JANE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And you killed him.

      Harry drops to the floor.  Kathryn Hawkes stares down at him, 
      stunned.  

      END FLASHBACK


      Jane points at Kathryn.

                                  JANE
                    Tell the truth, Kathryn.
                    Our people are already searching 
                    your apartment.  

      Lisbon gives Jane a quick quizzical look.  His look in reply 
      tells her that he s bluffing.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    They ll find the painting if they 
                    have to tear the place down. 
                    There s no point lying anymore.

      Kathryn sits down, feeling weak.

                                    KATHRYN
                    I never meant to kill him.
                    If only he hadn t tried to stop me, 
                      everything would have been fine.  

      She looks pleadingly at the faces around her.

                                    KATHRYN (CONT'D)
                    Nobody would have gotten hurt.

      With a strangled cry of rage, Stevie jumps up and rushes 
      across the room to attack Kathryn.  A.P. stops her, holds her 
      tight.

                                  A.P. CAID
                    No baby.  Don t.

      Lisbon gestures peremptorily at Kathryn...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Paint It Red"     GREEN 11/24/08     52.

                                  LISBON
                    Stand up please.

      Kathryn stands.  Lisbon puts cuffs on her.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Kathryn Hawkes, you re under arrest 
                    for the murder of Harry Lashley.  
                    Let s go.

      Lisbon leads Kathryn from the room.  A.P. and Stevie are  *
      still in an embrace.  

      Jane starts to follow Lisbon, stops, turns back to A.P Caid.

                                  JANE
                    My apologies for the pious lecture 
                    I gave you earlier.  I needed a 
                    pretext for burning the painting, 
                    and your family dysfunction fit the 
                    bill.  

                                  A.P. CAID
                    No sir.  No apology needed.  There 
                    was some good hard truth in what 
                    you said. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes there was, but I do hate to be 
                      judgmental.   

      He raises a hand in farewell, heads for the door.

                                  A.P. CAID
                    What say we start a foundation in 
                    Harry s memory?  Teach art 
                      appreciation to kids or something.  

                                  STEVIE
                    Jazz.  We can teach jazz to kids.  

                                  A.P. CAID
                    Whatever you say.  Jazz to kids 
                    then. 
                          (beat)
                    Or jazz and art.

      Jane exits the room.


      Jane hangs the Carlotta Moro portrait on the wall over his 
      couch, stands back to admire it with Cho and Rigsby.

                    Hard to believe it s a fake.

                                  CHO
                    Crazy isn t it?  One painting s 
                    worth fifty million, and the 
                    other s only worth a few thousand, 
                    but they look identical. 

                                  JANE
                    Yup.  Crazy. 
                          (beat)
                    Funny, now that you mention it, I m 
                    not actually sure if this is the 
                    copy.  After a while, it gets hard 
                    to keep track, doesn t it?

      Cho and Rigsby look at each other and simultaneously get up 
      close to examine the painting...

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                        THE END                        ** ADDENDUM - SCENE 47 DIALOGUE **



        Kathryn Hawkes is taking the painting off the wall.  
        Harry enters.

                                        HARRY 
                      Stop, Kathryn.  Put it back.

        Kathryn Hawkes turns, surprised.

                                        KATHRYN
                      Harry?

                                        HARRY
                      I m not going to let you steal the 
                      painting, Kathryn.  

        Harry crosses to where Kathryn stands behind A.P. s desk, 
        holding the painting.

                                        KATHRYN
                      Don t be stupid, Harry.  If I tell A.P. 
                      about your legal problem up in Canada, 
                      how long do you think he ll let you stay 
                      married to mousy little Stevie, hmn?

        She tries to push past Harry, the painting under her arm, 
        but Harry grabs her and tries to take the painting away. 

                                        HARRY
                      No!  Stop! 

      They struggle.  Kathryn shoves Harry.

                                        KATHRYN
                      Let me go!

                                        HARRY
                                (hanging on)
                      Give it back!

        Harry begins to gain the upper hand, forcing Kathryn 
        backward onto A.P. s desk.  Her hand scrabbles behind her 
        for something to use against Harry, finds the bust.  
        Kathryn swings it wildly, striking Harry on the head.  He 
        drops.  Kathryn stares down at him, stunned at what she 
        has done.
