                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT11

      Dark woods stretch into the distance, trees rustling in the 
      wind. Without warning, TWO TOYOTA 4RUNNERS hurtle past, 
      careening along the road. 

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT22

      A cabinet swings open. Deaton grabs a bottle and turns to 
      Scott, who holds up his shirt where Derek slashed him.

                                  DEATON
                    They re on their way back. So we 
                    don t have much time to talk.

      Dousing a cotton ball, he reaches for Scott s wound.

                                  SCOTT
                    What is that?

                                  DEATON
                    Rubbing alcohol. You don t want it 
                    to get infected, do you?

      Scott takes a breath of relief as Deaton hurries to clean and 
      bandage the wound.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    You ll heal the same. Just not as 
                    quickly because of Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, how do you know all this? 
                    Actually, how do you know anything?

                                  DEATON
                    That s a longer story. What I can 
                    tell you is I know about your kind. 
                    Your kind I can help. This...

      He lifts the sheet from Bennett s torso to reveal numerous 
      and bloody slash wounds on the body.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    This is something different.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/122.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you know what did it?

                                  DEATON
                    No. But the Argents will. And this 
                    is the crucial part. They ll have 
                    some kind of record or book. It ll 
                    have descriptions, histories, 
                    notations of all the things they ve 
                      discovered.

                                  SCOTT
                    All of the things? How many 
                    different things are there?

      Before Deaton can answer, the sound of TIRES ON GRAVEL turn 
      their heads toward the waiting area.

      A GLOVED HAND pushes open the front door. Boots tracking dirt 
      across the cement floor, Argent walks in followed by TWO 
      HUNTERS. They turn the corner to find--

      Deaton standing behind the body on the table. Alone.  

                                  DEATON
                    I m starting to think I need to buy 
                    a more prominent Closed sign.

      Gerard steps out from behind Argent and his men. Deaton 
      blinks, a moment of nervousness. He watches the man slip on a 
      pair of glasses to look over Bennett s corpse. 

                                  GERARD
                    Hello, Alan.

      Argent glances to his father, surprised that these two know 
      each other.  

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    It s been a while. The last I heard 
                    you d retired.  

                                  DEATON
                    Last I heard you followed a code of 
                    conduct.  

                                  ARGENT
                    If you hadn t noticed, this body is 
                    one of ours.

                                  DEATON
                    I did. I also noticed the gun 
                    powder residue at his fingertips.

                                  DEATON (CONT'D)
                    So don t assume I ve been swayed by 
                    your philosophy just because I ll 
                    answer a few questions.

                                  ARGENT
                    He was only 24.

                                  DEATON
                    Killers come in all ages.

                                  GERARD
                    All ages, sizes, shapes. It s the 
                    last one that concerns us.

                                  ARGENT
                    How about you tell us what you 
                    found?

      Deaton turns the head to reveal a horizontal SLASH WOUND just 
      below the hairline on the nape of the neck.

                                  DEATON
                    See this cut here? Precise. Almost 
                    surgical. But this wasn t the wound 
                    that killed him. It has a more 
                      interesting purpose.

                                  GERARD
                    Related to the spine?

                                  DEATON
                    That s right. Whatever made this 
                    cut was laced with a paralytic 
                    toxin potent enough to disable all 
                    motor function.

      Deaton rolls the body back to reveal the chest wounds.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    These are the cause of death. See 
                    the pattern on each side?  

                                  ARGENT
                    Five for each finger.

                                  GERARD
                          (correcting him)
                    Each claw.

      Through the crack in the door to the cage room where he 
      hides, Scott peers out, listening to the men talk.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/124.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  DEATON
                    As you can see, it dug in and 
                    slashed upwards, eviscerating the 
                    lungs and slicing through the bone 
                    of the rib cage with ease.

                                  ARGENT
                    Have you ever seen anything like 
                    this before?

                                  DEATON
                    No.

                                  ARGENT
                    Any idea at all what killed him?

                                  DEATON
                    No. But I can tell you it s fast, 
                      remarkably strong and has the 
                    capacity to render its victim 
                      essentially helpless within 
                    seconds.

                                  ARGENT
                    If you re saying we should be 
                    cautious, we get it.

                                  DEATON
                    I m saying you should be afraid. 
                    Very afraid.

      From the cage room, Scott listens to Deaton s warning with 
      growing trepidation.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Because in the natural world, 
                    predators equipped with a paralytic 
                    toxin use it to catch and eat their 
                    prey. This prey wasn t eaten. That 
                    means whatever killed him only 
                    wanted to kill him. In fact...

      He gazes at the men, fear in his own eyes.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Killing may be its only purpose.

      INT. AUTO MECHANIC S GARAGE - NIGHT33

      Stiles s Jeep sits atop a rotary lift underneath which a 
      MECHANIC uses an impact gun to break free a particularly 
      tight bolt on the exhaust.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/125.

        CONTINUED:33

      Pushing through the door of the WAITING ROOM, Stiles waves 
      his hands, trying to get the Mechanic s attention.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, hey! What the hell do you 
                    think you re doing? All I needed 
                    was the starter.

                                  MECHANIC
                    Yeah, but it looks like your whole 
                    exhaust system s got to be replaced 
                    too.

                                  STILES
                    Why do I get the feeling you re 
                    slightly overestimating the damage?

                                  MECHANIC
                    Probably going to run about twelve 
                    hundred for parts and labor.

                                  STILES
                    Are you kidding? This thing doesn t 
                    even have a catalytic converter. 
                    And yeah, I know what a catalytic *
                    converter is.

                                  MECHANIC
                    You know what a limited slip *
                      differential is?

                                  STILES
                          (hating himself)
                    No.

                                  MECHANIC
                          (eyeing the exhaust)
                    Could be more like fifteen hundred.

                                  STILES
                    Just finish. I ll be back here. 
                    Seething with impotent rage.

      Stiles grabs the waiting room door handle, but his hand slips 
      on a clear, sap-like substance.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Nice. Sanitary.*
                          (to the Mechanic)
                    Quality establishment you re 
                    running here.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/126.

        CONTINUED:33

      No longer listening, the Mechanic fires up a DRILL and gets 
      back to work.

      IN THE WAITING ROOM - Stiles wipes his hand on his jeans as 
      he glances at a picture on the wall. It s the Mechanic in a 
      Beacon Hills lacrosse uniform.

      Reaching into his pocket for his phone, Stiles starts to hit 
      the HOME button but oddly, he can t seem to curl his thumb.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What the...?

      He takes the phone with his left hand while trying to flex 
      the fingers of his right. But when both hands lose strength, 
      the phone slips from his grasp and clatters to the floor.

      Alarmed, he glances to the door handle where he touched the 
      strange substance and then--

      THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW - he sees the Mechanic digging 
      through a tool chest while above him, SOMETHING MOVES inside 
      the Jeep. 

      Perched within, A SHADOWY FIGURE reaches its ink black-
      skinned and muscular arm through the open window.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Hey--HEY!

      The Mechanic looks up as the CREATURE darts out of the Jeep s 
      window. Tail whipping about, a clawed hand slashes at the 
      back of the Mechanic s neck.

      Knocked off his feet, he falls to the floor of the pit below 
      the Jeep.

      Almost simultaneously, a frightened Stiles falls to his knees 
      in the waiting room as the paralysis takes hold. He 
      collapses, face hitting the floor. 

      INSIDE THE GARAGE - at the bottom of the pit, the same 
      paralysis overtakes the terrified Mechanic. Unable to move, 
      he watches the creature slip underneath the Jeep. Using a 
      single claw, it severs a cord attached to the lift.

      BLACK HYDRAULIC FLUID showers down and the Jeep begins to 
      lower toward the Mechanic s frozen body.   

                                  MECHANIC
                          (struggling to speak)*

      IN THE WAITING ROOM - Stiles uses every last bit of strength 
      to reach his phone. Fingers trembling toward the screen, he 
      manages to unlock it and hit 9. Then 1. And then--

                                  MECHANIC (CONT D)
                          (barely a whisper)*
                    Help me.*

      Stiles can t hit the last 1. Paralyzed, he watches through 
      the crack underneath the door as his Jeep and all of its 
      three thousand pounds glide slowly yet purposefully down.

      Stiles shuts his eyes as the Mechanic s SCREAMS fill the 
      garage, weakening to choking gasps and then finally--

      Silence.

      All Stiles can hear now is his own nervous gasps. He looks to 
      the space underneath the door where he sees--

      REPTILIAN EYES staring back at him. As Stiles sucks in a 
      frightened breath, the creature disappears from sight.

      Glancing up, Stiles sees the doorknob turn. With a chilling 
      CREAK, it begins to open and--

      A RINGING fills the waiting room. Coming from Stiles s phone. 
      His finger rests on the display, finally having managed to 
      hit the last 1 in 911. 

      As the door opens to reveal the now empty garage, a voice 
      BLARES out from the phone--

                                  EMERGENCY DISPATCH
                    911, what is your emergency?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE:  TEEN WOLF

      EXT. ARGENT HOME/INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT44

      Allison slips out of the house and into her car. At the 
      driver s side window, she breathes softly on the glass.

      The ghostly message from Scott that appears - 9 PM. Allison 
      glances to the dashboard where the time is 8:55. She quickly 
      wipes a hand over the steamed window to reveal--

      GERARD. 

      Allison SCREAMS. Her grandfather s stern visage softens to a 
      smile as she opens the door to get out.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/128.

                    Didn t mean to scare you.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s okay. I was just--

                                  GERARD
                    Expecting someone else?

                                    ALLISON
                    Yes. I mean--no. Definitely no.

                                  GERARD
                    Good. We can talk for a minute.*

      With a smile, he shuts the car door for her.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS LOOKOUT POINT - NIGHT55

      A cell phone s display LIGHTS up, illuminating the woods 
      around Scott. He glances at the time: 9:00 PM. 

      Returning his gaze to the light-speckled town of Beacon 
      Hills, he searches the roads as if he might recognize 
      Allison s car simply by her headlights.

      But as the display light goes out, Scott s hopeful expression 
      seems to dim as well.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT66

      Standing by Allison s car, Gerard pulls a SMALL PILL BOX out 
      of his coat pocket. As he removes it, however, something else 
      drops out--

      A worn, leather bound BOOK hits the pavement. Allison leans 
      down and picks it up, handing it to him.

                                  GERARD
                    Thanks. Don t want to drop that. 
                    I d be lost without it.

      He slips the book back into his jacket and dry swallows a 
      handful of pills.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    When I was your age I didn t even 
                    take vitamins. Now I m choking down *
                      a cocktail of pills three times a 
                    day. But I do what my doctor tells *
                    me because I trust him.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/129.

      Allison s eyes wander to the road, anxious to get going.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Trust is a commodity our family 
                    holds very high, you know.

      When she looks back, she finds him staring at her intently as *
      if trying to gauge her reactions.*

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    My daughter--your aunt, Kate--died 
                    doing what she thought was right. 
                    Her intentions may have been a bit 
                      misguided--

                                    ALLISON
                    A bit?

                                  GERARD
                    I like that. You remind me of her. 
                    She challenged me too.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is that what you want me to do? 
                    Challenge you?

                                  GERARD
                    I want you to trust me. You re 
                    going to find yourself put in a 
                    position where you question the *
                    trust of people close to you. Even 
                    your closest friends. When that 
                    happens, you have to know the trust 
                    you never question is family. Can I 
                    trust you, Allison?

                                    ALLISON
                          (nodding)
                    Yeah.

                                  GERARD
                    Not yeah. Speak with conviction. 
                    Yes or no?

      His sudden intensity causes her to flinch. Finding her voice, 
      she gives a response--

                                    ALLISON
                    Yes. You can trust me.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1210.


      EXT. BEACON HILLS LOOKOUT POINT - NIGHT77

      Racing through the woods, Allison desperately tries to make 
      her meeting with Scott. But when she arrives at the lookout 
      point, she finds it empty.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She turns, trying to see in the darkness, when her eyes land 
      on something. She approaches an outcropping of rock to 
      discover a message scrawled in chalk--

      Couldn t wait. Missed U.

      Disappointed, Allison presses her hand to the rock and begins 
      carefully wiping away Scott s message.

      EXT. AUTO MECHANIC'S GARAGE - NIGHT88

      Under the flare of RED and BLUE lights from Deputy Sheriff 
      cars, Stiles sits in the back of an ambulance. He flexes his 
      now mobile hand while talking to his father, Sheriff 
      Stilinski.

                                  STILES
                    I told you, I just walked in and 
                    saw the Jeep on top of the guy. 
                    That s all.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What s wrong with your hand?

                                  STILES
                    Nothing. Can I get out of here now?

                                  STILINSKI
                    If there s something you don t feel 
                    like you can tell me...

                                  STILES
                    You think I m lying?*

                                  STILINSKI
                    Of course not. I just worry about *
                    you. And if maybe you saw someone *
                    do this, if you re afraid they 
                    might come back to make sure you 
                    don t say anything about it...

      Stiles looks away. That s exactly what he s afraid of.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1211.

                    I didn t see anything. At all. Can 
                    I go, please?*

                                  STILINSKI
                    Yeah. But not in your Jeep. We re 
                    going to have to impound it. Sorry, 
                    kiddo. Evidence.

      Stilinski turns, heading back to the crime scene.  

                                  STILES
                    Well, make sure they wash it!

      INT. MCCALL CAR - NIGHT99

      Stiles gets into the passenger side, slamming it closed. From 
      behind the wheel, Scott watches his friend, concerned.

                                  SCOTT
                    You okay?

                          (nodding)
                    You were right. It s not like you. 
                    It s eyes were almost... reptilian. 
                    But there was something about them.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean?

                                  STILES
                    You know how when you see a friend *
                    in a Halloween mask, but all you *
                    can actually see is their eyes? You *
                    feel like you know them but you 
                    can t figure out who it is.

                    Are you saying you know who it is?*

                                  STILES
                    No. But I think it knew me.

      FADE IN:

      INT. ABANDONED RAIL STATION - DAY1010

      At the end of the dark corridor, Isaac stands with his hands 
      at his sides, head slung low. He takes a breath, teeth 
      clenched and goes down. 

      Hands hitting the pavement, Isaac LAUNCHES himself forward in 
      a lope. Pushing off with his feet, he springs up with power 
      and grace, heading right for--

      Derek. Standing like a monolith, waiting until the very last 
      second as Isaac leaps at him in a ferocious attack.

      When Derek finally moves, it s fast and focused. He grabs 
      Isaac and twists the boy around, SLAMMING him back down to 
      the cement.

      Out of the shadows, Erica appears, bounding up to swing a 
      clawed hand at Derek. But he takes her out even more 
      brutally. Hand wrapping around her ankle, he sends her 
      sprawling across the floor.

      Boyd looks out from behind a steel column, shyly eyeing 
      Erica. Smiling back at him, she pushes herself up.

                                  DEREK
                    Anyone want to try not being 
                      completely predictable?

      He spins as Erica attacks again. She lands right on him, 
      literally latching onto his torso with her legs. He staggers 
      back with her attached to him when--

      She kisses him. Lips and tongue all over his. For just a 
      moment, Derek allows it. But then he breaks her grip and 
      drops her back to the floor. Right on her ass.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    That s the last time you do that.  

                                  ERICA
                    Why? Because I m a Beta?

                                  DEREK
                    Because I have someone else in mind 
                    for you.

                    bones in my body that could use a 
                    few hours to heal.

      Derek grabs his arm and CLENCHES down on it. The SHARP CRACK 
      of bone is followed by Isaac s ear-piercing SCREAM.

                                  DEREK
                    Hundred and one.*

      As Isaac cradles his arm, Derek addresses them all.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You think I m teaching you to 
                    fight? I m teaching you to survive.

                                  ISAAC
                    If they want us dead how come 
                    they re not coming after us now? 
                    What are they waiting for?

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know. But they re planning 
                      something. And you especially know 
                    that s not the only problem...
                          (to the others)
                    Whatever killed Isaac s father? I 
                    think it killed someone else last 
                    night. Until I figure out what it

      INT. MARTIN HOME/LYDIA S ROOM - DAY1111

      The bedroom door clicks open and Mrs. Martin hurries in to 
      wake Lydia. She lies buried under a mountain of covers.

                    Lydia, please--

      SHE SCREAMS, hands jerking back from the BLOOD-STAINED 
      covers. There s blood everywhere. As a stunned Lydia sits up, 
      her panicked mother grabs her arms to find the source.

                                  MRS. MARTIN (CONT D)
                    What did you do? Oh God, what did 
                    you do to yourself?

      She searches Lydia s wrists for the tell-tale slashes, but 
      the cuts are only on the knuckles of her right hand. As if 
      she d punched something.

      Mrs. Martin looks into Lydia s wide, confused eyes. She 
      follows her daughter s gaze to a SHATTERED VANITY MIRROR, 
      shards hanging off it.

                                  MRS. MARTIN (CONT D)
                      Lydia--sweetheart--why did you do 
                    that? Lydia?

      But the girl shakes her head. No idea why. 

      Mother and daughter turn to look into the mirror shards, the 
      reflection of their own bewildered faces gazing back at them.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY1212

      Lydia sits outside a door that reads Guidance Counselor. Her

                    I have an acute phobia of people 
                    prying into my personal life. You?

                      Compulsively drawn to cute but 
                      narcissistic girls.

      Lydia stares at him in disbelief. Before she can fashion a 
      comeback, the door opens, revealing Ms. Morrell.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Are you ready, Lydia?

      Without another glance to the Junior, Lydia steps inside the 
      office.

      Stiles stands opposite Scott, looking deep into his eyes.

                                  STILES
                    Sorry about the other day. I m 
                    trying. We ll get through this. I 
                    know because I love you. I love you 
                    more than--oh my God, you and 
                    Allison seriously have to find a 
                    better way to communicate.

                    Come on, you re the only one we can

                                  STILES
                    Yes. Message complete. Now tell me 
                    about your boss.

                                  SCOTT
                    He thinks Allison s family has some 
                    kind of record of all the things 
                    they ve hunted. Like a book.

                          (realizing)
                    He probably means a Bestiary.

                    No. Pretty sure I don t. It s like

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT2323

      Against the BRILLIANT GLOW of the LIGHTS, the body of a 
      BEACON HILLS MID-FIELDER soars gracefully up. And then 
      CRASHES brutally down.

      AT THE BENCHES - Stiles cringes. Behind him, the parents of 
      Beacon Hills look on with abject terror. The reason why--

      A HUGE PLAYER on the opposing team. He s a dense combination 
      of fat and muscle, towering over all the other boys.

      He throws a glance to THE BLEACHERS where Allison shivers 
      next to Gerard.

                                    ALLISON
                    I knew I should have brought my 
                    coat.

                                  GERARD
                    You re cold? Here, take mine.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you sure?

      Nodding, Gerard slips his coat around her. Allison pulls it 
      tight, then discreetly searches the pockets. Removing a set 
      of KEYS, she turns them over in her hand. Gerard s OFFICE key 
      hangs off a USB DRIVE key ring. When she looks up--

      Another BEACON HILLS PLAYER crashes to the ground, 
      immediately followed by a SECOND PLAYER smashing onto him.

                                  GERARD
                    Good God, is it always this 
                    violent?

      The Abomination turns back with a malevolent smile. As his 
      immense frame moves past, he reveals--

      Matt, in his uniform, but on the sidelines snapping pictures. 
      Lowering his camera, he notices Melissa McCall sitting at the 
      edge of the bleachers, while a limping player is helped off 
      the field.

                                  MATT
                    He doesn t belong to you, does he?

                                    MELISSA
                    No. Mine s still on the field. 
                    While I m here really wishing he d 
                    stuck with tennis.

                    Just lacrosse? Or other things?

      He gazes down at the camera s LCD to examine a new photo.

      THE PICTURE is of Allison. Perfectly lit under the field 
      lights, looking utterly beautiful, while--

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson steps next to Scott.

                                    JACKSON
                    If you re not going to do 
                      something, I will.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you crazy?

                                    JACKSON
                    Get ready. Ball s coming to you.

      Noticing them together, Gerard turns to Allison.

                                  GERARD
                    Those are the two captains, right? 
                    Jackson and Scott?

      Allison gives a nod to her grandfather while her hand eases 
      down and drops the keys to Stiles, right underneath the 
      bleachers.

                                  ERICA (O.S.)
                    Go Scott!

      Allison spins back to see Erica cheering for Scott just two 
      rows up. The girl looks undeniably hot, almost as if she d 
      dressed to be noticed.

      ON THE FIELD - Ball in his stick, Jackson goes right for The 
        Abomination. Using a sudden and almost extraordinary moment 
      of speed, he slips around the larger player and sends the 
      ball flying to Scott.

      Ball caught, Scott whips around and FIRES it into the 
      opposing goal. The incredibly relieved Beacon Hills fans rise 
      to their feet, CHEERING wildly.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT2424

      Hearing the cheers as he rushes through the parking lot, 
      Stiles glances back. Then stops when he sees Lydia sitting in 
      her parked car. Tissues at her eyes, she s crying.

      But she won t lower the window or answer.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    You shouldn t care if anyone sees 
                    you cry. Especially you.

                    Why?

      Stiles comes closer to the window so he doesn t need to yell.

                                  STILES
                    Because you re beautiful when you 
                    cry.

      Lydia scowls at him. But then... the window begins to lower.

      At the benches, Coach leans down to Danny who holds an ice 
      pack to his head. Coach holds up two fingers.

                    You! Can you play lacrosse?

      Sitting next to Erica, Boyd gazes up. As heads turn to look, 
      he stands, taking off his coat to reveal a now sensationally 
      muscular body stretching every thread of his tight T-shirt.

      Cheers go up again from the field. Stiles glances back, then 
      to the darkened school, knowing time is running out.

      Ball in the pocket of his lacrosse stick, The Abomination 
      charges forward. As Beacon Hills Players move to get out of 
      the way, only Boyd stands his ground.

      Cleats digging in, he drops a shoulder and COLLIDES with his 
      massive opponent. This time, the player flying through the 
      air is The Abomination. As his huge body TUMBLES to the grass 
      and dirt--

      Coach leaps up, HOLLERING.

      For the first time in far too long for a sixteen year-old, 
      Boyd smiles. Taking in the cheers. Basking in the glory.

      Even Scott s look of apprehension turns to one of conflict as

      But then Boyd notices Jackson looking at him with more than a 
      little curiosity. The look of someone who knows your secret.

      The Ref BLOWS the WHISTLE. 

      Heart pounding, Boyd turns back to take his position for the 
      next play, unaware that his eyes are beginning to GLOW 
      YELLOW.

      Now there are two werewolves on the field. One with far less 
      control over his abilities. And his anger...

      With the game tied, THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK clicks down to one 
      minute left. Allison glances from the clock to her phone to 
      see a text from Stiles - Nothing here!

      ON THE FIELD - Scott lines up next to Boyd.

      But breathing hard, Boyd doesn t listen. The WHISTLE BLOWS 
      and he takes off, moving fast. With no other option, Scott 
      goes after him.

      Eyes on the ball bouncing across the grass, Boyd races for 
      it. But Scott kicks in a second of super speed and gets to it 
      first, stealing it right out from under him.

      With the crowd hushing to near silence, Scott lets the ball 
      fly. As it hits the net, a winning goal--

      The Abomination takes Scott off his feet.

      Shocked by Scott s fall, Allison springs to her feet. Gerard 
      looks up, noticing her concern. Without another second of 
      hesitation, she rushes down.

      Gripping his leg in pain, Scott sees Allison approach,

                    All right, the thing was pretty

                    teeth.

      Becoming alarmed, Derek and Erica watch the CREATURE crawl

      Then he notices Derek and Erica are not looking at him, but 
      past him. Stiles spins around just as--

      The creature LEAPS off the wall.

      Erica darts in front of Derek to protect him, but the thing 
      moves too fast for her. Whipping about, it SHOVES her across 
      the floor. Her head SNAPS BRUTALLY into the wall. While she *

                    Get behind me.

      Stiles nods, retreating back. But when he does, something 
      catches his eye. A SLASH MARK at the nape of Derek s neck. 
      Exactly how the Mechanic was cut.

                                  STILES
                    Derek. Your neck...

      As he turns to Stiles, hand coming up to his neck, Derek s 
      legs give out. He drops to his knees on the floor, paralysis 
      taking hold.

                                  DEREK
                          (stunned)
                      Scott--get Scott.

      But instead of running, Stiles grabs him. Pulling Derek s arm 
      over his shoulder, he attempts to drag him to the exit just a 
      few yards beyond the edge of the pool.

                                  STILES
                    Where is it? Do you see it?  

                                  DEREK
                    No. Hurry.

      Derek struggles to stay on his feet with the little strength 
      he has left. Stiles pulls his phone from his jacket.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                      Stiles--what are you doing--Stiles!

      BEHIND THEM, the creature emerges from the darkness, slow and 
      stealthy in its approach.

      As Derek s strength disappears, Stiles loses his balance. 
      Forced to use both hands to hold Derek, Stiles DROPS his 
      phone to the tile floor. But then Derek slips out of his 
      grasp as well.

      As Stiles gropes for a hold on him, Derek tumbles backwards 
      and GOES RIGHT INTO THE POOL.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1231.

      Without hesitating, Stiles jumps in after the sinking Derek. 
      Water splashes up, waves rippling out. Then, just as the pool 
      seems to settle, Stiles and Derek burst to the surface, 
      gasping for air.  

                                  STILES
                    Where d it go? Do you see it?  

                                  DEREK
                    No.

      Clutching a now completely paralyzed Derek, Stiles gives a 
      hopeful glance around.  

                                  STILES
                      Maybe--maybe it took off. 

      A PIERCING SHRIEK comes out of the darkness.

                    Maybe not.

      The front door clicks open. Argent and Victoria look out from 
      the kitchen to see Gerard and Allison stepping in.

      Scott sits opposite Allison, surrounded by the Argents as 
      they quietly, silently eat dinner. Gerard sets down his knife 
      and fork. He looks to his family. Then to Scott. 

                                  GERARD
                    All right, why s everyone so quiet? 
                    Is it that uncomfortable that they

                    centuries since I was a teenager,

                    broke up all of the time.

      All eyes fall on Scott. He looks to Allison. And panics.

      Stiles struggles to keep Derek above the surface of the water 
      while glancing about for the creature.

      Kicking out, Stiles draws Derek toward the pool s edge when--

                                  DEREK
                    Stop!

      Stiles splashes to a halt. Both of them spot the GLOWING EYES *

                    What s it waiting for?

      Argent rests a sympathetic gaze on Scott.

                                  ARGENT
                    No offense, Scott, but I think 
                    maybe Allison felt the two of you 
                    were just growing apart.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/KITCHEN - NIGHT3636

      Hand wrapping around Scott s throat, Argent shoves him 
      against the refrigerator.

                                  ARGENT

                    I m kind of wondering what would

                    It wouldn t be good for me. But 
                    then, I d have plenty of chances to 
                    redeem myself. And that wouldn t be 
                    good for you.

      He lets Scott go. The two of them stare at each other in a 
      tense stand off. Finally, Scott grabs the cookie plate. 
      Argent grabs the cake. Still eyeing each other. Holding 
      cookies and cake. They walk out.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/POOL - NIGHT3737

      From the center of the pool, Stiles and Derek watch the 
      creature approach the edge. But then, oddly, it retreats 
      back.

                                  STILES
                    You see that? I don t think it can 
                    swim.

      Derek meets Stiles s eyes. They turn back to the creature 
      which HISSES, slashing at the water. Darting forward only to 
      back away a moment later.

      Powerless to stop them, Argent and Victoria watch Allison and 
      Scott hurry up the stairs.

      Slipping down the hall, Allison pulls Scott into the guest

                    Actually, let me try something.

      Kneeling, Scott places his ear against the safe and carefully 
      begins turning the dial. He concentrates, focusing his 
      hearing on the LOCKING PINS dropping into place.

      With a final turn of the dial, the safe door clicks open. 
      Allison almost laughs.

                    Want to hit a few banks later?

      Lying atop other papers inside is the worn leather book 
      Allison saw Gerard put in his pocket. She grabs it, flipping 
      it open. But her look of triumph falls to one of failure.

      Noticing, Scott takes the book and reads aloud.

      turning as he hears the creature SHRIEK. With a desperate 
      leap, he jumps back into the water.

      Hand shooting up, he manages to keep the phone above the

                    What haven t we thought of?

                                    ALLISON
                    What if it s not a book? Something 
                    else he d keep close to him...

      Allison trails off, realization hitting her.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I know where it is.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - NIGHT4646

      The door to Gerard's office lies open, keys still in the 
      lock. The item Allison and Scott have been looking for hangs 
      between the other keys...

        A high-capacity USB THUMB DRIVE.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/DINING ROOM - NIGHT4747

      Scott rushes back into the dining room to grab his jacket.

                                  SCOTT
                    Principle Argent--Gerard, Mr. and 
                    Mrs. Argent. Thank you for dinner 
                    but I just realized I m totally 
                    late to pick up my mom from work.

      With a smile, he bullets out of the door. Allison sits back 
      down at the table with an innocent glance to her relieved 
      parents. 

      Gerard turns to them.

                                  GERARD

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT4848

      Melissa McCall s car hurtles into the lot, tires SQUEALING to 
      a stop. Scott jumps out, putting his phone to his ear.  

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, where are you? I need 
                    Gerard s keys. There s a USB drive 
                    on it. That s the Bestiary. 

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - NIGHT4949

      Scott races in to find the keys still hanging in the doorknob 
      to the Principal's Office. He yanks them out of the lock and 
      then... pauses. Head cocking to the side, he HEARS something.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/POOL - NIGHT5050

      Legs kicking with more and more effort, Stiles and Derek keep 
      dipping below the surface.

                                  STILES
                      I can t--I can t stay up. I need to 
                    hold on to something.

                                  DEREK
                    The diving board. Try to reach...

      Freeing one hand, Stiles swims them toward the diving board. 
      But when he reaches up to grab it, his fingers slip. They 
      both go under, descending into the dark when--

      TWO HANDS burst down through the surface.

      Both Derek and Stiles SURGE UP out of the water and land 
      sprawling onto the tile floor.

      Crouched on the diving board, Scott, now a full werewolf, 
      rises up with claws out. He lets loose a FEARSOME ROAR, 
      challenging the GLOWING-EYED creature as it approaches from 
      the shadows.

      But the thing is unbelievably fast and surprisingly strong. 
      Scott leaps up to meet it in mid-air. Both crash to the tile 
      floor, clawing and snarling at each other.

      The creature wraps a tail around Scott s leg and lifts him 
      right off the floor with it. Scott hurtles back, tossed into 
      a WALL MIRROR.

      GLASS SHATTERS, fragments raining down.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1240.

      The creature inches forward for the kill. Desperate, Scott 
      grabs one of the larger mirror shards to use as a weapon.

      And then something strange happens.

      The creature pauses, focusing on its own REFLECTION in the 
      glass, almost as if confused by it. For one brief moment, its 
      eyes return to those of a HUMAN. But only for a moment.

      Baring a fearsome set of DOUBLE-ROWED TEETH, the creature 
      hisses at itself and retreats back.  

      It LEAPS onto the wall. Crawling across it like a spider, the 
      creature darts out one of the high windows and disappears 
      into the night.

      With a breath of relief, Scott lets the mirror shard fall to 
      the floor. Then turns back to see an exhausted Stiles and 
      still weak Derek slowly pulling himself to his feet.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT5151

      Scott plugs the USB drive into his laptop on the hood of his 
      mother's car while Stiles looks over his shoulder. 

      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN - A document appears. Pages and pages 
      of strange black and white images amid thick paragraphs of 
      almost illegible text.  

                                  SCOTT
                    That s not English.

                                  STILES
                    Is that even a language?  

                                  SCOTT
                    How are we supposed to figure out 
                    what this thing is?

                                  DEREK (O.S.)
                    It s called the Kanima.

      Derek approaches with a revived Erica at his side.

                                  STILES
                    You knew the whole time?  

                                  DEREK
                    No. Only when it was confused by 
                    its own reflection.

                                  SCOTT

                                  STILES
                    What else do you know?

                                  DEREK
                    Just stories and rumors.

                                  SCOTT
                    But it s like us?

                                  DEREK
                      A shape-shifter. But not right. 
                    It s...

      He searches for the word, but it s Stiles who finds it.

                                  STILES
                    An abomination.

      Derek nods. He glances at Erica and they both move to leave.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek. We need to work together on 
                    this. Maybe we even need to tell 
                    the Argents.

                                  DEREK
                    You d trust them?

                                  SCOTT
                    No one trusts anyone. That s the 
                    problem. And while we re arguing 
                    about who s on what side, something 
                    stronger, faster and scarier than 
                    any of us is killing people and we 
                    still don t know anything about it.

                                  DEREK
                    I know one thing. When I find it... 
                    I m going to kill it.

      In the darkened garage, Sheriff Stilinski gazes up at the 
      hydraulic line, fingers touching the edge where the Kanima 
      severed it. He puts his phone to his ear.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 204" GREEN1/12/1242.

      EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT5353

      Cutting the engine of his mother s car, Scott jumps out and 
      slams the door shut. But right before his hand can leave the 
      door, SOMEONE GRABS HIS WRIST.

      Whirling back, Scott sees Gerard coming at him with 
      frightening speed. A HUNTING KNIFE flashes in the moonlight. 
      The blade goes right into Scott s stomach.

      Gerard pulls him close, almost hugging him as he twists the 
      knife up. Clutching the man, Scott gasps in pain.

                                  GERARD
                    Don t move. Even though I can 
                      practically feel the tissue around 
                    the blade already trying to heal, 
                    you never know with a Beta.

                    after hearing good news from the 
                    doctor.

      Teeth clenched against the pain, Scott tries to hold still.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    That s right. I can play the nice, 
                    doddering Grandpa who likes to cook 
                    and tell stories, be sweet and *

                    boy. Are you listening?

      Gerard jerks the knife upward causing Scott to nearly 
      collapse in pain.

                    a favor one of these days. And

                    Scott, I truly believe that it s so 
                    much easier when bad things don t 
                    have to happen to good people.

                    Yes.

      With a final jerk upwards, Gerard RIPS the knife out of 
      Scott s stomach as--

      THE DOORS of the hospital slide open. Melissa spots Scott 
      waiting for her. He awkwardly holds his coat in front him, 
      giving her the best smile he can. But she can immediately 
      tell he s not smiling with his eyes.

                                    MELISSA
                    Hey there. You okay?

                    Yeah, I m fine. Everything s fine.*

      As Melissa loops her arm in his, she never notices the 
      numerous dark spots underfoot. Drops of BLOOD on the 
      pavement. 

      Scott s blood.
