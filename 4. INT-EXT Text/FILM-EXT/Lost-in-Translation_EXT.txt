We hear the sound of a plane landing over black.
CUT TO:
Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car)
pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky
rise.
The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.
Eager
BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car,
welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.
CUT TO:
Shinjuku High rises sparkle.
Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood
filled with neon, ads, and people.
She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of JAPANESE
PEOPLE wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until
the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross.
A TV screen covering a building plays commercials.
She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish
JAPANESE KIDS, tan SCHOOLGIRLS pass her.
CUT TO:
Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around.
On a small side street she stops at a little park. She watches
a JAPANESE MAN AND WOMAN together:
CHARLOTTE'S POV -
C.U. The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's
neck, and leans in close. The woman smiles at him, in love.
CUT TO:
Charlotte finds her way down a narrow street in an old section
of Tokyo.
She turns a corner and finds a square with what she was
looking for.
CUT TO:
The sun shines over a beautiful old temple. Birds chirp,
Charlotte approaches and goes inside.
CUT TO:
Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood.
She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all
of the wedding portraits. They are very formal and retouched,
Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion
style.
CUT TO:
Charlotte looks through the window as a tan Japanese boy,
tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend.
Charlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette
and watching the CROWDS go by.
CUT TO:
Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops.
She stops at a window of cute underwear that she.looks at.
She goes into the shop.
CUT TO:
Bob and Charlotte try to get past the crowd at the entrance.
A big BOUNCER stops them and is yelling fast Japanese at
him.
The crowd parts as the Bartender emerges shooting his BB
gun, and Bob and Charlotte run for it.
BB GUN CHASE -
The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above.
Bob covers Charlotte as they duck behind the car.
They make a run for it, ducking into a pachinko parlor.
Bob spots a cab and they run to it, seeing Charlie now
throwing bottles in the direction of the bartender.
Bob and Charlotte get in the cab.
POV from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by. It looks beautiful.
In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course.
FADE OUT:
Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys.
All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob
dominates the game.
CUT TO:
Bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight. The street is
crowded with MOTORCYCLE GANGS going by, one waves a big flag.
Bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment,
and then makes his way past.
CUT TO:
He walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned
neighborhood. He's wearing new techno sneakers. He makes a
call on his cell phone.
BOB
Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris...
I'm not going to be able to do that
interview today.., yeah... ok....
Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his
talk show... sure.. ok... bye.
A light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with
a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there
are no street signs.
Bob finally finds the small restaurant. The automatic door
opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby
SUSHI CHEF, turns to Bob happy to see him. He is disheveled
from the rain and adorable.
He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and
orders for him.
CHARLOTTE
You made it.
BOB
They really have to work on that
street name thing.
A perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa!" from his pocket.
CHARLOTTE
What's that?
He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket.
BOB
It's for my daughter.
CHARLOTTE
How old is she?
BOB
Four.
CHARLOTTE
Oh, she'll love it.
The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a
banana leaf.
Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so
she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed.
Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.
BOB
Nice one.
CHARLOTTE
(mouth full)
Fuck off.
They have lunch, he makes her laugh.
He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.
BOB
What happened to your toe?
CHARLOTTE
I don't know, I think maybe I broke
it? I knocked into something the
other day...
She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe
is black and blue.
BOB
That doesn't look good.
She enjoys the sympathy.
CHARLOTTE
It's bad isn't it?
BOB
We should get you to the doctor.
CHARLOTTE
You think so?
BOB
Yeah, look at that thing.
She smiles at him.
CUT TO:
Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in.
He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a
first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte
is enjoying Bob's effort.
Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel
number.
BOB
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
RECEPTION (O.S.)
Excuse me?
BOB
Hospital?
RECEPTION (O.S.)
One moment, please.
She transfers call, it rings.
CONCIERGE (O.S.)
Concierge desk, may I help you?
BOB
Yes, can you tell me how to say
"hospital" in Japanese?
CONCIERGE
"Hospital" in Japanese? Hosupitari.
BOB
Hosupitari?
He tells the Driver who looks at him funny. Bob says it again-
faster, with a Japanese accent. The driver nods excitedly
and drives off.
CUT TO:
Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they
stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in
her arm.
CUT TO:
Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building.
Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses
them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an
empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations
hang above them.
BOB
Where's your husband?
CHARLOTTE
(like she's said it a
million times)
Working.
BOB
Do you ever see him?
CHARLOTTE
(sorta)
Yeah.
BOB
Do you know where we are?
CHARLOTTE
No.
She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake
"one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an
iced coffee.
CHARLOTTE
Isn't it weird there are no street
names in Tokyo... you'd think a city
like this would have street names...
you need a map to get anywhere...
look, there are no signs...
They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.
FADE OUT:
Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small
figure in the landscape.
She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding
procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono
walk under a parasol with their family.
Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her
mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them.
Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the
temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.
CUT TO:
She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.
At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.
At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces
of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people
writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte
writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.
CUT TO:
Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte,
when his cell phone rings.
BOB
Hello?
LYDIA (O.S.)
Hello, Bob, it's me.
BOB
(can't hear)
Hello?
LYDIA (O.S.)
It's Lydia, your wife.
BOB
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
LYDIA
(sighs)
Fine. Is it going ok?
BOB
It's ok.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Do you want to-
(garbled)
BOB
What?
LYDIA (O.S.)
Do you want to talk to
Zoe?
BOB
Yeah.
LYDIA (O.S.)
(calls in background)
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
A little girl's voice shouts "No!" in the background.
LYDIA (O.S.)
I guess she's busy.
BOB
That's ok.
LYDIA (O.S.)
When are you coming home?
BOB
Tomorrow.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't
forget.
BOB
Ok.
In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and
over and a dog starts barking.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Ok, well, travel safely. See you
soon.
BOB
Bye.
CUT TO:
Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob
approaches.
CHARLOTTE
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan
after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
BOB
No, we'll find something around here.
She goes with him.
CUT TO:
The fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out
of the hotel.
Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte
finds Bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers. She's in boxer
shorts and an undershirt and slippers.
BOB
I'm sorry.
CHARLOTTE
That lunch was the worst, huh.
He laughs.
She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel
slippers.
CHARLOTTE
When are you leaving?
BOB
Tomorrow.
CHARLOTTE
(friendly)
I'm going to miss you.
BOB
That's what you said the other night.
CHARLOTTE
Well, I mean it more now.
CUT TO:
It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls
up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy
in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.
Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw
Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and
different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light
rain).
Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some
promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples.
Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas,
and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.
In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.
BOB
CHARLOTTE!
But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to
her.
C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.
The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him
in the crowd.
BOB
Why are you crying?
CHARLOTTE
(sincere)
I'll miss you.
He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.
BOB
I know, I'm going to miss you, too.
He holds her close.
CUT TO:
Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and
looks at her.
She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.
Bob gets into his car.
CUT TO:
Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.
CUT TO:
