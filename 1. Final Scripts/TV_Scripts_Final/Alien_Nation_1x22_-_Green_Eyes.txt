      EXT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT (NIGHT ONE - STOCK)

      To ESTABLISH.

      INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

      CAMERA pans the office as the phone RINGS. We accoutrements 
      of a judge's world - black robe hung on a coat stand, 
      framed university degrees, law books, a gavel on the desk. 
      Also on the desk is a name plate: HON. JULES KAISER, and 
      several brightly coloured cloth balls about the size of 
      baseballs. Between RINGS of the phone, we hear a man 
      GASPING.

      NEWCOMER JUDGE JULES KAISER struggles to answer the phone. 
      He is gravely ill, shaking and gasping for air. An 
      answering machine picks up the phone.

                                  VOICE
                    Hello, this is Judge Kaiser - I'm unable to 
                    come to the phone right now. Please leave a 
                    message when you hear the tone and I'll 
                    call you back as soon as possible.

      BEEP. Judge Kaiser heaves himself toward the desk.

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Jules, this is Marsha. We missed you at the 
                    mayor's reception this evening.

      Kaiser inches closer.

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                    I called your house - there was no answer. 
                    I'm at least glad to know you're not 
                    working late again. You drive yourself so 
                    hard - it's terrible for your health.

      Kaiser's hand reaches trembling for the phone.                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Don't forget, Doug and I are taking you to 
                    the Bolshoi on Saturday.

      CLOSE - KAISER'S FINGERS are within inches of the receiver.

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Don't worry about calling. Bye.

      CLICK and TONE... .

      WIDE - JUDGE KAISER crumples to the floor.

      EXT. SIKES' ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      Full moon - a mantle of stars. SIKES, in shirt sleeves, 
      looks through Cathy's telescope toward the night sky. CATHY 
      stands next to him. Near them are some wine and sour milk. 
      A radio plays romantic MUSIC.

                                  SIKES
                            (excited)
                    I got it - I got Space Lab.

                                  CATHY
                    Let me see!

      He makes way for her to look through the telescope.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh... look at it!
                            (checks her watch)
                    We've got three minutes 'til they test the 
                      communications laser.

                                  SIKES
                    A space station - it's so incredible. Seems 
                    like they just put a man on the moon. You 
                    must be proud, too - a Newcomer astronaut.
                            (sighs)
                    Guy must be having a trip up there.

      Cathy looks at Sikes, feeling his wistfulness.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm like every kid in America. We all wanna 
                    be astronauts. 
                                  (MORE)                                  SIKES (CONT'D)
                    "To boldly go where no man has gone 
                    before."

      His words hang in the air between them. They look at each 
      other, then up at the sky, then back at one another again. 
      Beat. Sikes shivers slightly from the cold.

                                  CATHY
                    You're cold. You should've taken a jacket.

      She reaches for his arm - her touch is electrifying to him. 
      Noticing his reaction, Cathy becomes aware of the sexual 
      tension between them.

      CLOSE - SIKES looks in her eyes.

      CLOSE - CATHY is shy under his gaze. She looks down.

      SIKES lifts her chin.

                                  SIKES
                    Cathy... ?

      Beat. Taking the plunge, Sikes leans forward, and kisses 
      her. Cathy enjoys the sensation, but is awkward with the 
      mechanics. Her eyes blink. Sikes caresses her cheek, moving 
      his hand toward the back of her neck. Touching her hairless 
      nape, Sikes is reminded of the difference between them. He 
      opens his eyes, then pulls back.

                                  CATHY
                    I don't feel like a human woman, do I?

                                  SIKES
                    No... not really... but that's okay.

                                  CATHY
                    So, you liked it?

                                  SIKES
                    Did you?

                                  CATHY
                    I think so.
                            (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    I feel... strange.

      They stare at one another, both unsettled.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah.

                                  CATHY
                    The laser test is going to start.

      Sikes doesn't know whether he's relieved or disappointed.

                                  SIKES
                    Right.

      Cathy turns back to the telescope. Sikes looks at Cathy, 
      drawn to her, yet confused.

      INT. POLICE STATION - SNACK AREA - DAY (DAY TWO)

      Sikes stands with ZEPEDA at the coffee maker. He's making 
      killer coffee - spoon after spoon.

                                  SIKES
                    I really wonder if I shouldn't see a shrink 
                    about this.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Too late, Sikes. You're already 
                      certifiable.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm serious, Zepeda. I think about her - in 
                    a sexual way - three or four times a day.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Cathy's not a barnyard animal - it's legal, 
                    Sikes.

                                  SIKES
                    But she's not human.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    And you are?
                            (re: coffee)

                    We supposed to drink that or eat it?

                            (sets the spoon down)
                    I mean it. You work with them every day - 
                    you forget. But try and get close - really 
                    close - you realise they're different - 
                    they're not like us.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    You sound like my dad when I was dating 
                    Harris Weinstein.

                                  SIKES
                              (frustrated)
                    Forget it - forget I said anything.

      He starts into the:

      SQUAD ROOM

      Zepeda catches up to him.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Sikes, listen - you're worried you're not 
                    normal - okay. This is a very simple thing 
                    - date a human. Get your mind off the 
                    alien.

      He considers a beat, then continues on.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Y'know, this reminds me exactly of my 
                    cousin, Raphael. He was always worried 
                    about being gay. I gave him the same advice 
                    - find a nice girl.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah... ?

                                  ZEPEDA
                    He's living with a guy named Steve.

      Sikes stares at her.                                  ZEPEDA
                    Hey, he's happy.

      Zepeda exits as Sikes sits and starts going through his 
      Rolodex. A nervous GEORGE approaches.

                                  GEORGE
                    I hope it didn't show - I had flies.

      INT. JUDGE KAISER'S CHAMBERS - DAY

      M.E. LOIS ALLEN, Sikes stands over the body of Judge 
      Kaiser. In the b.g. two S.I.D. detectives and a uniformed 
      NEWCOMER COP inspect the room.

                                  ALLEN
                    Judge Kaiser's clerk found him this 
                    morning. I'd estimate the time of death 
                    between ten and twelve last night.

                                  SIKES
                    What killed him?                                  ALLEN
                    I'm not sure. The discoloration could 
                    indicate asphyxiation or coronary 
                      infarctions.

      George enters, approaching them.

                                  SIKES
                    Could it have been an illness - some kind 
                    of natural Cause?

                                  GEORGE

                    We're considering this a possible homicide. 
                    I'll have a much better idea after I run 
                    some toxicological tests.

                    some threatening letters. He's ruled in 
                    favour of Newcomers in a number of civil

      EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

      MARILYN HOUSTON walks to her car, accompanied by BUCK, his 
      human classmate NOAH RAMSEY and several other students.

                                    MARILYN
                    I was at the faculty meeting - Mr. Fisher 
                    presented the new "approved" reading lists. 
                    The school board, because of political 
                    pressure, is banning Salinger, Flaubert, 
                    Camus...

                                  BUCK
                    Camus? You mean we can't read "L'Etranger"?

                    "The Stranger" - a pivotal book in 
                    twentieth century literature - which the 
                    school board considers "subversive."

                    required reading now? 'My Turn" by Nancy

                    on Whitman as the zeitgeist of Post Civil 
                    War America was really well thought out.

                    It's about the Alamo.

                                    MARILYN
                    I look forward to it, Noah.

                                  BUCK
                    Can we start with Flaubert? I hear "Madame 
                    Bovary" is great.

                                    MARILYN
                    Oh, that's my favourite book - yes!

      Noah sees the connection between Buck and Marilyn, and he 
      resents it.

      EXT. MARINA - DAY

      George and Sikes walk down the gangway to the boat slips. 
      Surrounded by sea water, George is tense as he walks on the

      SQUAD ROOM

      Albert is at George's desk, taking the latter's shoes as 
      Sikes walks over.

                    I'll get these so shiny, you'll be able to 
                    see yourself.

                    Here's the work-up on Judge Kaiser. We are 
                    looking at a homicide - he was poisoned 
                      biologically with a bacterium. It resulted 
                    in constricted airways and asphyxiation.

                    It produces a toxin which is fatal within 
                      thirty-six hours after introduction.

      Marilyn, Buck and Noah sit on the grass, enjoying the

                    For all of Emma's silliness - her bourgeois 
                    values - she's ultimately a sympathetic 
                    character - a victim of her society.

                                  BUCK
                    Yeah. Like everybody else - she wasn't 
                    satisfied with what she had.

                                    MARILYN
                    Right. Her sense of worth came only from 
                    material possessions or social status - not 
                    from anything internal.

      George enters, rubbing a pea-green Nu-nip ball between his 
      hands, under his nose.

                    You always have the magic touch with her.

      She extends Vessna to George. Taking the baby, he gives 
      Susan the kaif ball. She partakes of its pleasure as George 
      touches Vessna's temple, then cradles her.

                                  GEORGE
                    ////. Calm down, little spotty head. /////.

      Vessna starts to calm. The doorbell RINGS. George goes to 
      get it, COOING as he does.

                    The letter's from an organisation calling 
                    itself the National Purist Front. Nobody's 
                    ever heard of it. This so-called NPF says

      EXT. PARK - DAY

      Bukowski bags trash on a hillside bridal trail. Looking up 
      he sees:

      SIKES AND GEORGE approaching with a park ranger who's 
      pointing Bukowski out to them.

      BUKOWSKI knows this is trouble. He starts retreating.

                    Stop!

      But: BUKOWSKI leaps off the trail down the side of the 
      hill.

      SIKES rushes toward him. George runs back to their car. As 
      Sikes reaches the edge of the hill. He sees:

      Cathy, wearing a head scarf that matches her dress, brings

                    to expose yourself to small amounts of the

      INT. PRINCIPAL FISHER'S OFFICE - DAY (DAY SIX)

                                  FISHER
                    It was reported to me, by parents of one of 
                    our students, that you were seen after 
                    school, being intimate with Buck Francisco.

                                    MARILYN
                      "Intimate"? What does that mean?

                                  FISHER
                      Specifically, I understand you and Buck 
                    were... what is known as french kissing.

                                    MARILYN
                            (laughs)
                    Who told you this?

                                  FISHER
                    You know I can't divulge the person's name.

                                    MARILYN
                    I know where it came from. Noah Ramsey's 
                    jealous of Buck - I bet he told his 
                    parents.                                  FISHER
                            (leading)
                    Jealous?

                                    MARILYN
                    Because Buck's a better student. I have not 
                    been 'intimate' with him - I spend time 
                    with Buck because he's interested in 
                    learning.

                                  FISHER
                    I've heard about your extra-curricular 
                    reading program. I've had complaints about 
                    that, too.

                                    MARILYN
                    These kids deserve better than the 
                      'approved' reading list.

                    As always, you know more than anyone.

      Fisher stands, coming around his desk.

                                  FISHER
                    Ms. Houston, this is all part of a larger 
                    problem. The radical politics - the 
                    activism - you're always pushing - always

                    You don't take that accusation 
                      seriously... .

                                  FISHER
                    I think you'd be happier at another school 
                    - I think you should put in for a transfer.

                                    MARILYN
                    You can forget about that, Mr. Fisher.                                  FISHER
                    Then I'll be forced to refer this matter of 
                    you and Buck Francisco to the School Board.

                                    MARILYN
                    You're going to blackmail me with this?

                                  FISHER
                    With any kind of molestation or sexual 
                      impropriety charge, the Board tends to err 
                    on the side of caution.
                            (beat)

      Several uniformed cops have cordoned off the dock. George 
      takes a statement from the Beach Type whose speedboat 
      George and Sikes were about to commandeer. In the bay, 
      harbour police skim the water for evidence. A skiff comes 
      up to the dock, Carrying Sikes, Allen and two Coroners with 
      a body bag. George moves to the skiff as it's tied off. 
      Sikes and Allen get out.

                    Most of one body - Parris's. It was a hell 
                    of a bang - Until I perform an autopsy, 
                    we'll assume that was the cause of death.

                    death, suicide?

                                  ALLEN
                    Hard to say until S.I.D. determines the 
                    cause of the explosion. It could have been 
                    suicide, but bullets or sleeping pills are 
                    a lot easier.

                    Let him! We'll fight it!                                    MARILYN
                    This is my job - I could lose my license. 
                    And even if I win, I'll never live it down. 
                    People will always wonder - they'll always 
                    be suspicious.

                                  BUCK
                    You're just gonna give in?

                                    MARILYN
                    You don't need this either - it could get 
                    very ugly.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't care. You're the one who's always 
                    saying you gotta fight for what's right.

                                    MARILYN
                    Not this time. I can't.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't understand... .

                                    MARILYN
                            (extending her hand)
                    Buck, I want you to know what a pleasure 
                    it's been having you as a student...

                                  BUCK
                            (refusing to shake hands)
                    Why are you talking to me like this?
                            (imitating her)
                    "What a pleasure it's been." You act like 
                    we hardly know one another.

                                    MARILYN
                            (turning)
                    I gotta go.

                                  BUCK
                    Marilyn!
                            (when she turns back)
                    Why?

      She stares into his passionate, questioning eyes.                                    MARILYN
                            (beat)
                    Because, it could happen.
                            (stepping closer)
                    I want it to happen.

      She kisses him. Unused to this human act, Buck is at first 
      confused. But as their embrace continues, he is swept up by 
      desire and returns Marilyn's kiss with equal passion.

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      George, Susan and Emily sit on the floor playing Tenctonese 
      Scrabble. George is distracted.

                                  EMILY
                            (picking up her tiles)
                    oh!

                                  SUSAN
                    What do you have?

                                  EMILY
                            (setting the tiles down)
                    Veebo/. That's triple letter score on the 
                    click and double word... thirty five 
                    points.

                                  SUSAN
                    You can't use "Veebo/", {it's a proper 
                    name.}

                                  EMILY
                    It's also a verb - Like Na veebo/ taya 
                    drak.
                            (turning)
                    Right, Dad?

      George is lost in thought.

                                  EMILY
                    Dad?

                                  GEORGE
                            (snapping out of it)
                    Is it my turn?                                  EMILY
                    Dad, what's the matter? You've been 
                      doppelganger all afternoon.

                                  GEORGE
                    Doppel what?

                                  SUSAN
                    It's an expression - you haven't been 
                    yourself.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sorry -- it's this business with 
                    Matthew.

      The doorbell RINGS.

                                  EMILY
                            (jumping up)
                    I'll get it.

      She opens the door, revealing a human DELIVERY MAN who's 
      holding a basket arrangement of flowers.

                                  DELIVERY MAN
                    Hi. This is for a Mrs. Francisco.

                                  EMILY
                    Mom, look.

                                  SUSAN
                            (coming over)
                    Who would send me flowers?

                                  EMILY
                            (taking the basket)
                    Thank you.

                                  DELIVERY MAN
                    You're welcome.

      He exits as Emily smells the flowers.

                                  EMILY
                    Mmmmm. Smell them.

      Susan does so as George comes over.                                  SUSAN
                    They're lovely.
                            (picking up the card)
                    George, are these from you?

                                  GEORGE
                            (smelling the flowers)
                    No.

      Susan opens the card.

                                  EMILY
                          (to Susan)
                    Who're they from?

                                  SUSAN
                            (reading)
                    "You're far lovelier than these flowers..." 
                    Signed... "An Admirer".

      Hearing "An admirer," George pales.

                                  GEORGE
                    Let me see that card...

      Taking the card from Susan, he stares down at it in horror.

      INT. SIKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT (NIGHT SIX)

      Sikes and Lorraine sit on the couch with the remains of 
      their jerk chicken take-out dinner on the coffee table. 
      Lorraine leans back with a contented SIGH.

                                  LORRAINE
                    I'm so full, I'm gonna throw up.

      Reaching for his glass of red wine, Sikes stops in mid-
      movement and looks at her with alarm. Lorraine notices and 
      laughs.

                                  LORRAINE
                    Just kidding!

      Relieved, Sikes picks up his wine glass. Lorraine watches 
      him.                                  LORRAINE
                    Tell me something, would you rather I 
                    hadn't come over tonight?

                                  SIKES
                    Why?

                                  LORRAINE
                    I don't know... it's like you're not really 
                    here.

                                  SIKES
                    Sorry, it's been a hell of a day.
                            (looks at her)
                    I'm glad you came. Really.

      He turns back to drink his wine. She studies him a beat, 
      then, on an impulse, leans to kiss him on the cheek. Sikes 
      Starts, spilling some wine on his shirt. He leaps to his 
      feet.

                                  LORRAINE
                    Oh, gods
                            (standing)
                    I'm sorry.

      She grabs a napkin to blot his shirt.

                                  SIKES
                    It's okay.

      He starts unbuttoning his shirt.

                                  LORRAINE
                            (mortified)
                      I should've known - I should never try 
                    romantic moves.

                                  SIKES
                            (peeling off his shirt)
                    I'll just change shirts.

                                  LORRAINE
                    I'm such a klutz.                                  SIKES
                              (comforting)
                    Hey... it's nothing... .

      They look at one another a long beat. Each moves 
      simultaneously to kiss the other. Lorraine wraps her arms 
      around Sikes' bare back as the kiss continues. There is a 
      loud KNOCKING at the front door.

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                            (urgently)
                    Matt! Matt, it's Cathy!

      Pulling back from Lorraine, Sikes hurries to open the door. 
      Cathy is upset, agitated.

                                  SIKES
                    What is it?!

                                  CATHY
                    I just got a call from my medical centre. 
                    George, Susan, Emily were just taken to 
                    intensive care - it's that bacteria. 
                    They've been exposed.

                                  SIKES
                    Lemme get a shirt on.

      Sikes moves from the door to his closet, revealing Lorraine 
      to Cathy. The two women stare at one another.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Purist leader, Phyllis Bryant, dressed incongruously in an 
      evening gown, is escorted by her bodyguard into:

        A MAKE-SHIFT LAB

      where technicians are setting up equipment. Chiselled 
      former Green Beret, MARK GUERIN, sees Bryant and picks up a 
      capped test tube.

                                  GUERIN
                            (holding up the test tube)
                    We have it.                                  BRYANT
                    I saw the news. Why'd you blow up his boat?

                                  GUERIN
                    Parris wanted a million dollars. He 
                    wouldn't negotiate.

      She nods approvingly.

                                  GUERIN
                            (re: lab)
                    We have all the equipment we need - it'll 
                    take about two weeks to produce enough 
                    bacteria to spray L.A. County.

                                  BRYANT
                    You've done a good job, Mark. For the first 
                    time in six years, I feel like there's 
                    hope.
                            (beat)
                    Soon, we'll look back on the Newcomers as 
                    if they were just a bad dream.
                            (beat)
                    Good night.

      She turns to exit. Her bodyguard follows her out.

      GUERIN holds up the test tube, examining it in the light. 
      CAMERA PUSHES IN on the murky liquid as we:

                                                                              FADE OUT


                                        THE END
