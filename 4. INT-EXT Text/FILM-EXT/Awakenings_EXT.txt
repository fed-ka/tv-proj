Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy
his age, a classmate, move along a street.
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk,
the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the
branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic
pounding of an elevator train.
As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the
ground.

Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his
window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears
at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.
SAYER
What'd I forget?
MISS COSTELLO
I just wanted to say to you I
preferred your explanation.
()
It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.

MISS COSTELLO
And that I'll look after things
for you until you've "settled in."
Good night, doctor.
She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his
dashboard. To it eventually, quietly --
SAYER
Thank you . . .
He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away
toward her car. To the reflection --
SAYER
Thank you very much.

Sayer and Miss Costello walking to their cars.
SAYER
One would think that after a point
enough atypical somethings would
amount to a typical something.
But a typical "what?"
Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what
the "what" could be.
MISS COSTELLO

Doctor . . . would you like
to g e t a
cup of coffee somewhere?

Tea?
SAYER
Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . .

She nods quickly.
She seems, strangely, relieved.
MISS COSTELLO
Some other time.
SAYER
Yes.

Good night.

Good night.
They veer apart to their respective cars.

I believe you when you say some
still live. But I can assure you
they're medically irrelevant. As
they were thirty years ago when I
fought to get my work published.
He smiles at a thought, at once wistful and bitter.
OLD DOCTOR
That's the problem with a unique
disease. Once it no longer rages,
I'm telling you, it becomes very
unfashionable.
.
He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep
breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer.
OLD DOCTOR
What would I be without this
thing? A man with a1 shred of
dignity le_ft.
SAYER
Should I get your nurse?
OLD DOCTOR
God forbid, no.
He lights a cigarette, coughs and puts it out.
OLD DOCTOR
How many have you found there?
SAYER
Five. So far. I think there may
be more.
The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded
of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about
her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing.
Finally --
OLD DOCTOR
How are they?
SAYER
As you described them. As they
were back then. As "insubstantial
as ghosts." Only I guess most of
them were children then.
OLD DOCTOR
Yes.
Children who fell asleep.

KAUFMAN
Freud believed in miracles.
Prescribing cocaine like it was

Sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads
toward the hospital.
KAUFMAN
We all believed in the "miracle"
of Cortisone until our patients
went psychotic on it. Now it's
L-Dopa.
He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical
journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and
keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back.
SAYER
With all due respect, I think it's
rather too soon to say that.
:
KAUFMAN
With all due "respect," it's
rather way too soon. Let the
chemists do the damage.
The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this
sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another.
Kaufman disappears into the building.

Sayer and Leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees
along a path toward the parking lot. At a point, the doctor
realizes his patient is no longer at his side; he's several
steps back, feeling the sunshine on his skin.

Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard,
resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to
buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as
Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary,
apparently, to make the car go.
The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of
one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out --
Leonard's mother.

Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers.
Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale.
"Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations.
"Futuristic" cars.
Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to
the world and stares at it all with wonder. Everywhere he
looks there is something "extraordinary."
LEONARD
What a wonderful place The Bronx
has become.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

A rose.

Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance.
He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly
astonished by the tactile sensation.
Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real
world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the
purity or intensity Leonard can.
Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of
countless thousands of roses.

Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs
running around, nannies with prams, lovers.
A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it
but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer
demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard
doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He
and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a
girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt.
Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his

up, to a sound overhead.

Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver
to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and
turns away.
MRS. LOWE
Wait a minute.
(he turns back)
What on earth have you done to
your hair?
He's parted it, apparently, on the "wrong" side. She pulls a
comb from her purse, recombs it "correctly," straightens his
jacket lapels and steps back.

MRS. LOWE
There.
LEONARD
There's your bus.

The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she
hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus.
SAYER
Ready?

LEONARD
I've decided not to go.
He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him.
LEONARD
I'm staying here.
SAYER
Why? What's wrong?
LEONARD
Nothing. Wave.
He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus.
Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks
the horn again.

As the public bus pulls away, Leonard pats Sayer on the
shoulder.
LEONARD

He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer
staring after him. Miriam honks the horn again, and he climbs
aboard. The doors hiss shut and driver turns to him.
BUS DRIVER
Where to?
Sayer suddenly realizes he has no idea "where to." He glances
over his shoulder at the expectant faces of the patients, all
dressed up with nowhere to go. It's up to him . . .
His face brightens; he's thought of a good place.
