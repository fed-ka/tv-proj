      ERIC QUILL (20s, American, clean cut) moves through a crowded 
      Central American market.  A title wipes across the screen: 
       Altamara City - Central America. 

      He spots an INFORMANT.  They make a BRUSH DROP (exchanging 
      their bags as they pass) and continue on.


      Eric walks up the steps to the run-down offices of Oceana 
      Import-Export, located in an old Colonial building.


      We push in on the offices of OCEANA Import/Export.

                    People, our days as the red-headed 
                    step child of the Agency are over.  
                    Langley has finally taken an 
                    interest in the great nation of 
                    Altamara and an extraordinary 
                    mission lays ahead of us.  


      We push in on the  La Voz  building, with a mural of a 
      reporter typing as flames emanate from the typewriter instead 
      of paper.  The flames chase a Fat Cat (top hat, cigar) and 
      Uncle Sam running away hand in hand.  We hear the out of 
      breath voice of VERONICA (20s, Altamara local, earnest).

                                  VERONICA (O.S.)
                    U.S. companies dump phenol, cyanide
                      ...ammonia in the Delgado River.


      Ted and Larry address Francisco, bundled up in a big parka, 
      on the back of a dogsled.  Huskies paw at the snow.  

                                  TED
                    You should run for President.

                                  FRANCISCO
                    No time.  I m training for the 
                    Iditarod.

      Larry flips open another briefcase full of money.

                                  FRANCISCO (CONT D)
                    I m already rich.
                          (to dogs)
                    Mush!

      Francisco takes off, as we see that servants have arranged a 
      snow path and snow blowing machine on the tropical estate. 

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      Mia stands by the RECEPTIONIST (40s) reading out loud a flyer 
      taped to the wall titled  Station-wide Contest! 

                                  MIA
                    Whoever blackmails, bribes or in 
                    any other way gets Francisco

                    wins a trip to the Agency's Up and 
                    Comers Conference in Aspen.  The 
                    fast track to advancement!

      Below is a picture of Francisco with a plus sign and a big 
       You  followed by an equals sign and a picture of Aspen.

                                  MIA (CONT D)
                    Wow.  Not bad.

      She then notices HANK (late 30s, good looking but intense) 
      sitting in the waiting area.  

                                  MIA (CONT D)
                    Who s the looker?

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    He s here for Eric...and he s 
                    insane.

      After a beat, Hank leans over to the receptionist                                                                                    17.


                                  HANK
                    Excuse me...excuse me again.  Could 
                    you lower those electronic blips 
                    and beeps I keep hearing.  They re 
                    very distracting.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    You mean...the office sounds?

      Hank smiles and nods.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Uh...I ll do my best.

      She glances at Mia and then pretends to turn down volume 
      knobs on her desk.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Is that better?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah.  Thanks.



      Eric carries a bottle of wine and cradles his cellphone to 
      his ear as he walks away from the Oceana building, down the 
      street.

                                  ERIC
                          (on phone)
                    I ll pick you up in ten.  Veronica, 
                    I know.  Sorry, I m late. 

      He reaches a Chevy Nova and unlocks the door.


      Eric jumps out of the parked car, and pops open the trunk.  
      He suddenly looks up and sees Veronica at a butcher s stall.

                                  ERIC
                    Veronica, what re you doing --

                                  VERONICA 
                    Getting papa s dogs some scraps.  
                    My office is only...

      She grabs her butcher s bag and walks over, then accidentally 
      BUMPS into Hank emerging from the car.

                                  HANK
                          (smiles warmly)
                    Hi, I m Hank.

      Their eyes lock.  Then something distracts him.  He reaches 
      over and gently lifts a ladybug off her shirt then shows her.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                      A ladybug.

      He opens his hand and blows the ladybug free.  Veronica is 
      clearly smitten.  Eric notices and moves Hank along.

                                  ERIC
                    Just dropping Mr. Schneider off at 
                    his hotel.  Let s get a move on --

                                  VERONICA
                          (to Hank)
                    Do you have lunch plans?

                                  ERIC
                    I m sure he s exhausted and --

                                  HANK
                    No, I don t.


      Hank s COFFIN moves past the Station staff and Veronica.  
      Eric steps up and lays an unmarked Sudoku puzzle on it.  He 
      puts a comforting arm around Veronica and smells her hair.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
