A beige Buick Skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt
in the glum, isolated hamlet of Brown Valley, WI (pop: 337).
Tim bops his head and sings along as a Parliament song plays
on a Good Times, Great Oldies radio station. A dour OLD LADY
shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by.
The Skylark pulls into the driveway of a tidy umber-colored
rambler with a nature scene painted on the garage door.

Tim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's
a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster
bounce along on the passenger's seat.
Tim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the
words Brodt Heating & Cooling is parked in the driveway.
Tim walks up to the tiny municipal airport. He tries the
door. It's locked. A RETARDED MAN shoveling snow spots Tim.
RETARDED MAN
Airport don't open for two hours.
TIM
Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make
my flight. Going down to Cedar
Rapids. The big ASMI Convention?
The retarded man nods vacantly and goes back to shoveling.
DISSOLVE TO:
Tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage.
He inhales the chilly Iowa air. He glances at his rental
agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt.
TIM
Hello. Score!
As he approaches the car, he stops. He chuckles, in awe.
21.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
TIM (CONT'D)
Holy crap. Awesome.
In the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest
building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the
cloudy sky. Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone.
The Holidome sign reads, Welcome ASMI `09 Participants!!! Tim
gets out of the rental car. He looks around-- not too shabby.
But upon spotting a SIKH CABBIE in a turban, Tim straightens
up and cautiously adjusts his money cummerbund.
As he walks toward the entrance, a pretty but gaunt young
woman in a short denim skirt, BREE, 22, approaches him.
BREE
Hey man, can I bum a heater?
TIM
What's that now?
BREE
A cigarette?
TIM
Oh, I'm like, "this gal wants to
borrow my heater?" Tss. But no,
sorry, can't help you there.
BREE
You here for the convention?
TIM
You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands
Insurance. How `bout yourself?
BREE
Ah, Bree. I'm Bree.
They shake hands.
TIM
Well Bree, it's nice to meet you.
But let me give you a trade secret.
(STAGE WHISPER)
Keep smoking and your premiums will
go through the roof.
BREE
Thanks Mr. Surgeon General.
(they laugh, then)

BREE (CONT'D)
If you want to party, Tim, let me
know. I'll be around.
TIM
You bet. Party hearty. Nice
chatting with you, Bree.
People are so friendly. Tim enters the hotel.
Tim holds hands with Ronald and a DOUGHY MAN at a round table
in a room full of people holding hands. Orin says a prayer.
ORIN
... In Your Name we pray Lord Jesus,
Son of God, Author of our Salvation,
our Redeemer, our Truth. Amen.
Amen. The gathered INSURERS head to the breakfast buffet.
RONALD
Orin knows how to lead a prayer
breakfast, tell you what.
TIM
Hmm...? Oh. Yeah.
RONALD
Little overwhelming? All this?
TIM
Hello, thank you. I feel like my
head is gonna like...
(makes explosion face)
Y'know?
RONALD
Oh I hear ya L & C. Loud and clear.
I was the same way when I first
came to ASMI. The deciding which
break-out sessions to attend, plus
the politics, the pressure, the not
knowing who to trust...
Orin catches Tim's eye, gives him a friendly wink. Just then,
Tim's phone rings. He looks at the caller ID.
TIM
Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss.
(ANSWERS PHONE)
This is Tim.
46.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
Bill Krogstad talks on the phone as he drives. His wife,
DIONE, crochets in the passenger's seat.
BILL KROGSTAD
Tim. Bill Krogstad. Got a call from
Orin Helgesson. Tells me he's
worried about you. Tells me you're
palling around with Dean Ziegler.
Laughing at his jokes, buying him
drinks...
TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)
I... No...
BILL KROGSTAD
What's the ONE thing I told you to
do? The one thing, Tim? Steer clear
of Dean Ziegler. GODDAMNIT, you're
lousing the whole thing up!
DIONE KROGSTAD
Bill...
BILL KROGSTAD
Not now Dione.
Tim does one more turn in the revolving door and steps out.
JOAN
I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I
only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care
for a Virginia Slim, Lippe?
48.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
Tim just shakes his head, unable to hide his despondence.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Whoa, what's wrong?
TIM
Mm, I don't know. Only everything.
Joan gives him a kind, gentle smile.
CUT TO:
Tim and Joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park
overlooking the Cedar River. It is a cold, gray day.
TIM
He didn't have to yell at me. I
didn't do anything wrong. I'm
trying my hardest.
JOAN
D'you want me to kick his butt?
TIM
Could you?
JOAN
Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could
take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin-
jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah!
(TIM CHUCKLES)
So Lippe, how'd you end up in the
insurance game? God that sounded
dorky-- insurance game.
(does 40s-style Cagney)
Look here, see, how'd you end up in
the insurance game, see...?
TIM
You are freaky.
(laughs, then)
No, it's kind of weird how I got
interested in insurance, actually.
When I was six, my dad got killed
in a sawmill accident.
JOAN
Oh my God.
49.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
TIM
Yeah. Not good. But after he died,
our insurance agent fought like a
tiger against the sawmill to make
sure me and my mom were taken care
of. And we were.
(BEAT)
The crazy thing-- our agent was
actually Bill Krogstad.
JOAN
No way. Really?
TIM
He had just opened Northlands.
Anyway, I remember thinking, this
guy's a hero. A real hero. So even
if he doesn't always treat me, like
y'know... whatever now-- I'll never
forget that.
Tim jumps off the swing, taking care not to slip in the snow.
Joan jumps off. They walk toward the river, silent for a bit.
TIM (CONT'D)
This river-- the Cedar River? It
flooded the whole city a couple
years ago.
JOAN
I remember that. Massive disaster.
TIM
People talk about the firemen and
policemen and that. But think about
all the claims in a disaster like
that-- how hard those agents worked
to make sure people's lives weren't
left in the lurch. We're talking
billions of dollars in damages,
literally. And claim by claim,
dream by dream, those agents helped
rebuild this city. I'm telling you,
it's a noble calling. I really
believe that.
JOAN
You realize you just made it sound
cool to be an insurance salesman?
You are a hero, Lippe.
TIM
Tss. I wish.
50.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
JOAN
No, I can tell. You're the Superman
type. Kind of dweeby on the surface
but a real frickin' stud underneath.
They'd call you Insurance Man-- put
a big red "I" on your chest...
TIM
Well, even if you're being full of
it, thanks for saying that anyway.
JOAN
Well, you're welcome.
(THEN)
So can you fly me back to the
hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing
my arse off.
He laughs, sufficiently cheered up. She snaps her fingers and
starts heading back.
Tim and Joan laugh as he peels out of the parking lot.
TIM
OK, I think we're going to want to
take Blair's Ferry Road to Avenue
C, then probably east on 100.
JOAN
Why would you possibly know that?
TIM
I memorized the major thoroughfares
and landmarks in the metro area.
Rather than say anything, Joan just shakes her head and turns
on the radio. GROOVE IS IN THE HEART kicks in, providing a:
MUSIC BED OVER:
58.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
THE SCAVENGER HUNT MONTAGE --
The sun is low. Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of
70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice.
Tim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos.
ORIN
OK guys, this is it. First team to
complete this challenge wins the
whole shootin' match.
(unfurls a scroll, reads)
ASMI's past is behind us; But our
future looks nice; Let's Build a
Bridge to the 22nd Century... by
scaling this silo of ice!
Some DUDES with ice climbing equipment-- ropes, picks, etc.
appear. Tim looks petrified. Joan shakes her head.
JOAN
That doesn't even... There's no
such thing as silo ice climbing.
TIM
No, it's actually a big thing in
Iowa. ABC news did a story about
it. I saw it on YouTube.
JOAN
Of course you did. Well, you can do
it then...
TIM
Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared
crapless of heights.
JOAN
You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz
I'm not climbing jack.
(MORE)
60.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
JOAN (CONT'D)
Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall
buildings in a single bound and all
that...
Tim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner
arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly
high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales.
TIM
Yeah. Let's do this thing.
Orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music
(Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps).
QUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their
climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons.
And they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the
ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares
worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice.
TIM (CONT'D)
Hang on... How's it...?
MIKE PYLE
Little help here...
The Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no
avail. Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it.
A LITTLE WHILE LATER --
All the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them
can get more than a foot off the ground.
TIM
Ugh. This is frickin' hard.
RONALD
Really hard.
DEAN
I think I just shit my pants.
Joan cheers. Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug.
A LITTLE WHILE LATER --
Orin talks on his cell phone, conferring. The contestants
wait in a field, shivering. The sun is getting lower. Orin
hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music.
61.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
ORIN
OK gang, that was Rick Martini with
the National Chapter. Here's the
deal. Since no one could do the
final task, and since Joan and Tim
were the first team to get here,
we're just gonna go ahead and award
them the first place prize. Unless
anyone's got a problem with that?
Ronald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance.
RONALD
Dangit. You could've done better,
Wilkes.
TIM
Wait, we won?
ORIN
Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75
gift card for the Westdale Mall.
Orin hands Joan the gift card. Despite the anticlimax, Tim is
overjoyed. He picks up Joan and spins her around. Everyone
else just wanders away.
DISSOLVE TO:
Tim gets out of the car.
TIM
Just some gal from Omaha they
paired me up with. Between you and
me, she's a little different. Real
hyper-- one of these types who kind
of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar
gift card, I'm not going to
complain.
63.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)
You promised you'd check in with
me. I'm very disappointed.
TIM
(PLAYFUL)
OK, Mom...
Silence. It's as though a profound revelation has just
slipped out. As if, in an instant, everything has changed.
Tim snaps his phone shut. What just happened? He considers
his options for a moment.
Joan is talking on the phone with her son. Her demeanor is
entirely different-- a tone and physicality we've not seen.
JOAN
No baby, you guys are playing at
Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next
week...
(LISTENS)
Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna
miss it. It's not that far. Put
your dad on.
Tim wakes up. The morning light hurts his hung over eyes.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Hey. Did you not look at the
schedule on the fridge? Did we not
have this conversation 10 minutes
before I left?
(listens, sighs)
No, no, no. The playoffs are in
Ralston. This is the last regular
season game. He actually has a
chance to play, Richie. Christ.
Tim staggers out of bed, smiles. Joan holds up a finger.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Fine, but watch your speed on 84th
by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's
gotten busted twice right there. By
that golf course.
(LISTENS)
Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love
you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick
some butt for me. `K. See ya.
She hangs up. Tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn.
TIM
Good morning.
78.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
JOAN
Crisis on the home front. Sorry if
I woke you up.
TIM
No problemo.
Tim sees that Joan's computer is open-- and his Two Diamond
presentation is up on the screen.
TIM (CONT'D)
Is that...? Were you looking at my
Two Diamond presentation?
JOAN
Your cell phone kept ringing in
your little fanny pack thing, so I
shut it off. When I saw the discs,
I figured I'd take a look. It's a
solid presentation.
TIM
Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...
JOAN
Yeah, I see that.
(WISTFUL BEAT)
You know we were together right?
TIM
What? Whaddaya...? You and... You
and Roger, you mean?
JOAN
It's so stupid-- but everyone
basically treated us like the
Brangelina of ASMI for a while
there. It ended two years ago. He
was getting into some pretty weird
stuff... as we all know now.
Tim is livid. He ejects his disc from Joan's computer.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter.
You knew, didn't you?
TIM
My foot I knew! No, I did not. And
yes, it most certainly does matter.
Man, this T's me off.
79.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
JOAN
Tell me you're not jealous. You
can't be jealous. The guy's dead.
TIM
Every stinkin' place I go people
remind me: You're no Roger Lemke.
You're not as good as Roger Lemke.
Here we go again.
JOAN
As good? Tim, Roger was a small-
minded, egotistical jerk. You're an
infinitely better man than he was.
This stops Tim in his tracks. Better than Roger Lemke. Wow.
TIM
Why were you with him then?
This stops Joan in her tracks. Her inner pain percolates.
JOAN
Why? I don't know. I don't know. I
guess I probably maybe don't like
myself very much. I don't know.
TIM
Hey, hey. Come on. You're pretty
and smart and just super awesome.
(COY)
I like you.
She allows a chuckle. Tim rubs her shoulders, supportive.
TIM (CONT'D)
Grrr. I'm so frickin' confused. Last
thing I thought was that I'd come to
Cedar Rapids and fall in love.
Joan shakes him off.
JOAN
What are you talking about?
TIM
Us. This.
JOAN
What this? What are you talking
about? There's no this. There's no
us. I have a family.
80.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
TIM
What about...?
JOAN
What about it? I told you, what I
do here... In Cedar Rapids... It
stays here.
Tim gets up, even more pissed off than he was before.
TIM
Where the heck are my clothes?
JOAN
Come on, Tim. We're adults here.
You're acting like a child...
TIM
Yeah. Well, you're acting like a
fricking... prostitute.
He wraps up in a towel, grabs his money cummerbund and goes.
A moment. Joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets, starts making
the bed. As she does, she sees the Clairol Nice `N' Easy hair
dye box in the garbage. Joan smiles a what has become of my
life smile. She sits on the bed and stares out the window.
A cold, hard rain falls as Tim walks from the Holidome toward
an Applebee's across the busy street.
89.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
Dean's minivan pulls into the gravel driveway of the
dilapidated, isolated farmhouse. We can tell it's the party
house by the music blasting and the DEGENERATES on the porch.
Dean and Joan climb out of the minivan. The rain is falling
harder. Ronald slides open the back door and climbs out. He
has on a long black rain coat. He nearly slips on some ice.
JOAN
Oh man. This place is bad news.
Dean, Joan and Ronald formulate a plan.
DEAN
I'll be standing by `case things
get squirrelly in there. Getaway
vehicle type scenario.
99.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
JOAN
So you're sending me into that
shithole? How chivalrous, Dean.
RONALD
You and me can go in, Joan. It'll
be fine, I'm sure...
Ronald and Joan approach the front door. Judging from the
looks on the faces of the DUDES on the porch, black folks are
not a common sight at this residence. Gary, the squinty-eyed
guy Tim met in the bathroom with Bree, ogles Joan.
GARY
Nice tits.
JOAN
(not missing a beat)
Thanks. Thank you. That's nice.
RONALD
We don't want any trouble, guys.
We're just looking for our friend.
The dudes let Joan and Ronald pass into the house.
Dean sits silently in the driver's seat. The quiet gets to
him. He starts humming, then mumble-sings to himself and
drums the steering wheel.
DEAN
Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to
paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags
we'll leave tonight...
100.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
Dean is outside the minivan, taking a leak on a tree. He
looks toward the house.
DEAN
Oh fuck!
Ronald, Tim and Joan exit the house.
RONALD
Run!
They run for Dean's minivan. Tim slips, sliding across the
snow and mud. Ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before
Tim finally gets to his feet.
Dean, meanwhile, tries to finish peeing as he makes his way
back to the van-- doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing
on himself. Tim, Ronald and Joan dive into the minivan. Dean
climbs back into the driver's seat.
Bree and gang exit the house and watch as Dean peels out,
tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away.
Krogstad yawns but drives with determination as his car
passes a sign that reads CEDAR RAPIDS - 100 MILES.
104.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
The first hints of daylight illuminate the eastern sky. Kenny
Loggins' WHENEVER I CALL YOU FRIEND plays on the radio. Tim,
still hopped up, drives. He enthusiastically sings along.
TIM
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly
light. I never seen such a
beautiful sight! See love glowin'
on us every night, I know forever
we'll be doin' it right!
Tim drives past a farm and sees dozens of hogs foraging
around in a sloppy pen. He stomps the brakes, sliding
dangerously onto the muddy shoulder.
Tim gets out of the car. The peppy song is still playing. Tim
sings along as he dances to the back of the car.
TIM
I always wanna call you "friend!"
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly...
Tim opens up the trunk. That's when we see:
INSIDE THE TRUNK: Orin, in his pajamas, bound and gagged by
Holiday Inn bedsheets. His shouts are muffled by the gag.
Tim pulls Orin from the trunk. Orin's feet are tied together,
so he has to hop as Tim leads him toward the hog farm.
TIM (CONT'D)
Careful. It's super slippery.
Orin falls face first into the muddy ditch.
TIM (CONT'D)
Whoop. Careful now.
105.
Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
Tim helps Orin to his feet. Several enormous HOGS rush toward
them on the other side of a barbed wire fence.
ORIN
(terrified, through gag)
Nmmmmmmmmm!
TIM
I did a ton of research on hog farm
risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they
might bite you a little if they
think you're a food source. But
there's never been a recorded hog-
bite death. So...
With great difficulty, Tim picks up Orin. Then, he awkwardly
hurls him over the barbed wire fence. Orin lands on his back
in a deep pile of mud and hog shit. The hogs descend.
TIM (CONT'D)
The Two Diamonds may be meaningless
to you and Bill. But there are
people who care about this stuff.
Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest,
good people. I'll come back for you
after the Two Diamonds have been
handed out to a legitimate winner.
I'm really sorry about this, Orin,
but the insurance industry deserves
better than you.
Tim goes to his car, leaving Orin wriggling with the hogs.
Tim walks out of the jail into the bright sunlight. Dean is
there waiting for him. They walk toward Dean's minivan.
TIM
Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one
butt rammed me or whatever in
there.
DEAN
"Butt ram!" I love it!
Dean gives Tim a hug. He then pulls a crumpled piece of paper
from his pocket-- it's the sheet Tim gave him earlier.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Want your get out of jail free card
back?
TIM
Not particularly.
DEAN
When I saw it, at first I was like,
shit am I supposed to take money
out of the account, or what?
TIM
Did you?
DEAN
Nah, it was more fun watching the
smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat
his pathetic ass out if he didn't
drop the charges against you.
TIM
(a genuine smile)
Sweet.
Dean tosses the paper into the trash. We now see what it says.
On Holiday Inn stationary, in Tim's scrawl: www.paypal.com.

Dean, Ronald and Joan accompany Tim, now cleaned up, to the

TIM
Well.
JOAN
Deep subject. D'aar. Get it?

I told you you were a hero, Lippe.

DEAN
Well, pal, it's been real.

RONALD
Yeah. You bet.

TIM
I think it sounds awesome.
RONALD
Actually, me too. The Ronimal could
use a vacation.
DEAN
Done.
Dean picks Tim up in a bear hug, spins him around. Ronald
gives Tim a more subdued hug. Then there's Joan.
JOAN
So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that
good stuff.
TIM
You bet. You bet. You too.
JOAN
If you're ever-- not that you would
be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska...
TIM
Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild
Kingdom. I used to watch that.
Would be cool some day to see.
JOAN
Yeah. Look me up.
TIM
So.
He puts out his hand. She laughs and hugs him instead. Tim
closes his eyes. She feels so good. Smells so good.
Joan's eyes are wide open. She swallows hard. She will not
cry. It's OK. Keep telling yourself everything will be OK...

Tim dumps birdseed in the feeder. Sunlight filters through
the tree branches. The snow is starting to melt.
NEIGHBOR MAN (O.S.)
You're just gonna attract red
squirrels with that junk, Tim.
Tim smiles at his old, gnarled neighbor, LESLIE, 80.
TIM
How ya doin' there, Leslie?
LESLIE
Ach, I'm too old to give a shit.
They take off their gloves to shake hands. Leslie won't let
go of Tim's hand-- the way old men sometimes do.
LESLIE (CONT'D)
Bill Krogstad told me he's
switching our policy to some fella
down in Milwaukee. Allstate. Says I
won't notice a bit of difference in
coverage or nothin'.
TIM
No, you probably won't.
LESLIE
Mm. Anyhow, I told the cocksucker
to go fuck himself. Says I'm going

league, slides headfirst into third base.
TIM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That's the point of insurance-- so
we can live and love life to the
