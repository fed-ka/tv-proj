                                        SCENE 1

  INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - NIGHT

  A HOLIDAY PARTY AT "THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE."  MARY, (LATE 
  30'S, MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE KNOWS, NOT AS SMART AS SHE 
  THINKS) IS AT THE BAR WITH HER BEST FRIEND LIZA, (GORGEOUS, 
    JET-SETTYREPORTER).  PEOPLE MILL AROUND.  LIZA CHECKS OUT THE 
  ACTION.  MARY CHECKS OUT HER FACE IN A COMPACT.

                                        LIZA

                  I can't do another office party.  I've 

                  already slept with everyone here.  

                  (CHECKS AROUND THE ROOM, THEN)  Yeah.

                                        MARY

                  Liza, focus.  Peter's coming soon and I 

                  have to look ridiculously adorable in a 

                  totally effortless way. 

  LIZA FLUFFS MARY'S HAIR, AND UNBUTTONS HER TOP BUTTON.

                                        LIZA

                  Now bend over and jiggle them up.

  MARY MAKES SURE NO ONE'S WATCHING, BENDS AND JIGGLES.  

                                        MARY

                  This doesn't feel effortless...

                                        LIZA 

                  You should perk up your nipples.  (OFF 

                  MARY'S LOOK) Fine, I ll do it.

                                        MARY (CONT'D)

                  I just hope I know what to do when he 

                  gets here.  I haven't seen him since 

                  "the incident."  

                                        LIZA

                  Ah yes... the incident.

  EXT. TOP OF THE EIFFEL TOWER, (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

  MARY AND PETER, (4O'S, DASHINGLY HANDSOME, CLOONEY-ESQUE), 
  KISS AGAINST A ROMANTIC BACKDROP.  OTHERS MILL ABOUT.  

                                        MARY

                  This is so romantic...

  THEY KISS AGAIN.  BEHIND THEM, A YOUNG MANIS ON HIS KNEES 
  IN FRONT OF A WOMAN, ASKING HER TO MARRY HIM IN FRENCH.

                                        BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

                  Oui! Jet'aime! 

  THE FRENCH COUPLE HUG.  MARY TURNS BACK TO PETER.

                                        MARY

                  So, you brought me up here to give me 

                  something?

  HE PRODUCES A BEAUTIFULLY ADORNED BAG FROM HIS POCKET.

                                        PETER

                  Yes.  I just wanted to--

                                        MARY

                  (OFF BAG) I do.

                                        PETER

                  You do what?

                                        MARY

                  I dowant to open it.

  SHE OPENS THE BAG.  WE SEE THAT IT IS MARZIPAN IN THE SHAPE 
  OF A FILM CAMERA.  MARY'S FACE DROPS."Accidentally on Purpose"3.


                                        MARY (CONT'D)

                  What the hell?

                                        PETER

                  It's marzipan.  In the shape of a camera.  

                  Because you're a film critic... the best 

                  one at my paper.  What did you think it 

                  was going to be?

  ANOTHER WOMANSQUEALS AS HER NOW FIANCEEPUTS A RING ON HER 
  FINGER.

                                        ANOTHER WOMAN

                  (TO MAN) Yah! Yah! Ichliebedich.

  THE WOMAN THROWS HER ARMS AROUND HIM.

                                        MARY

                  Oh, I don't know... (POINTING TO HAPPY 

                  COUPLE) that?  

                                        PETER

                  Do you know how hard it is to find 

                  marzipan in the shape of a camera?  

                  They had to create a mold!

                                        MARY

                  It's never going to go further between 

                  us, is it?  (THEN) Good bye.

  MARY WALKS TWO FEET TO THE ELEVATOR AND FRANTICALLY PRESSES 
  THE BUTTON.  THE NEW FIANCEES GIVE PETER THE STINK EYE.

  INT. OFFICE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

  MARY AND LIZA ARE WHERE THEY WERE.

                                        MARY

                  Very bad place to make a dramatic exit."Accidentally on Purpose"4.


                                        LIZA

                  Mary, it's been two months.  I drank 

                  your scotch and helped you delete all 

                  his pictures from your iPod.We 

                  watched "The English Patient" five 

                  times.  Move on.  I'm sure Peter has.  

                                        MARY

                  What makes you think he's moved on?

                                        LIZA

                  He's in the doorway with Kate Moss.

  MARY TURNS, CATCHING PETER'S EYE.  

                                        LIZA (CONT D)

                  Relax.  Remember to breathe in and out.  

                                        MARY

                  I ambreathing in and out.  If I 

                  weren't, I would be dead.  Which might 

                  actually be fantastic.  

  PETER HAS REACHED THEM.

                                        PETER

                  Hello, Liza.  Mary.

                                        LIZA

                  Hey, Boss.  You're probably wondering 

                  where my Prince Bandar interview is.  

                  See, my MacBookwas confiscated in 

                  Dubai and... "Accidentally on Purpose"5.


                                        PETER

                  Tonight's a party, Liza.  I'm not "the 

                  owner of the newspaper."  Now, get me a 

                  drink.   

                                        LIZA

                  Love to.  (BOWING) AssalamAlaikum.

  LIZA CROSSES OFF.  MARY AND PETER NEGOTIATE A HUG.

                                        PETER

                  You look good.  Better than good.

                                        MARY

                  Better than Kate Moss?

                                        PETER

                  Ah, Kate.  What a lost soul.  

                                        MARY

                  You say lost soul, I say, "coke head."  

                  That's why semantics are so much fun.  

                                        PETER

                  Why are you mad at me?  I didn't leave 

                  you on the top of the EiffelTower 

                  surrounded by women calling you names in 

                  foreign languages.  Do you know how to 

                  say "rat bastard" in Portuguese?  Because 

                  I do.

                                        MARY

                  I'm sorry, but--

                                        PETER

                  -- Bastardode rato. "Accidentally on Purpose"6.


                                        MARY

                  It was our three year anniversary.  The 

                  setting was so romantic, I got it into 

                  my head that you took me to Paris for a 

                  reason.  

                                        PETER

                  I did.  I took you to Paris for our 

                  anniversary so I could take you to 

                  Paris for our anniversary.

                                        MARY

                  You know what I mean.

                                        PETER 

                  Look, I'm a fantastic boyfriend, but a 

                  terrible husband.  I'm not just saying 

                  that, I have proof -- a restraining 

                  order from my first wife and from my 

                  second a small gunshot wound in my left 

                  buttock.  Besides which when we started 

                  dating you said you never wanted to get 

                  married.  It's just a meaningless piece 

                  of paper.  Unless you're gay. 

                                        MARY 

                  So?  So, a lot of people say they're 

                  never going to do things, and then they 

                  do them.  Like in "Gone With The Wind." 

                    ScarlettO'Hara says she'll never go 

                  hungry again, but then she does.  "Accidentally on Purpose"7.


                                        PETER 

                  She also said, "tomorrow is another day."  

                  So, maybe it's good we're taking a break 

                  and see where we are after the holidays.

                                        MARY 

                  A break?  You're on a date.  

                                        PETER

                  Date shmate.We'll get our heads 

                  together and go back to where we were 

                  before you started this marriage stuff.  

                                        MARY

                  Oh, I see.  It's not me& it's my needs.  

                                        PETER

                  Exactly.  See, thisis why we're good 

                  together.  You getme.

                                        MARY

                  Yes, I do.  That's why you'll never get 

                  me.  

  MARY CROSSES TO THE ELEVATOR, PUSHES THE BUTTON, USELESSLY.

                                        MARY (CONT D)

                  I have gotto plan these exits.

                  Your sister's right.  You'll find 

                  someone else.  I get proposed to all 

                  the time.  I may be married now.  I'm

                                        MARY

                  That's you, Liza.  For the rest of us the 

                  three stages of womanhood are: MegRyan in 

                  "Sleepless in Seattle."  MegRyan in 

                  "You've Got Mail."  And MegRyan in the 

                  grocery store, with people whispering, 

                  "Who's that old lady that looks like Meg

                  Ryan?"  I'm still in that crucial window 

                  of opportunity between "Sleepless" and 

                  "Mail" where Tom Hanks could just fall off 

                  a ladder and into my arms.  But the 

                  window's closing.

                  In the chorus, is he saying: "That's me 

                  in the corner?"  Or "Let's pee in the 

                  corner?"  

                                        MARY

                  Really?  This is a real question?

                  (SINGING) "Let's pee in the corner!!!!"

                                        MARY

                  Why would he say "let's pee in the 

                  corner?"

                                        DAVIS

                  Why would he say "that's me in the 

                  corner?"  Obviously that's him in the 

                  corner.

                  Make that two.  (TO MARY) I bet my buds 

                  I could go a whole day eating and 

                  drinking only things that end in "tos."  

                  Burritos, Doritos, Cheetos, mojitos,...

                  I did that once.  But with foods that 

                  end in "oni."  Rice-a-roni, bologna, 

                  spumoni, calzone.But, there wasn't a 

                  bet involved.  My sorority was just 

                  full of bulimics.

                  Mary, the most interesting person I've 

                  met in a bar since I accidentally 

                  wandered into a drag club called, 

                  "Secrets."  Turned out "the secret" was 

                  not so hard to guess.

                  Of course.  It's got my three favorite 

                  things: treasure hunters, underwater 

                  explosions and Jacqueline Bisset, the 

                  inventor of the wet t-shirt.

                  Hi Steve.  (TO MATT) I think you can

                  This procedure is quite intrusive.  I'm 

                  not sure you want your little brother

                                        MARY

                  Are you seriously expecting we'll just 

                  pick up where we left off? 

                                        PETER

                  Sure.  Why not?

                                        MARY

                  I might be involved with someone.  Did 

                  that ever cross your mind?  

                                        PETER

                  So what?  So am I.  It's a perfect 

                  place for us to start.

                                        MARY

                  Peter, there are other men in the 

                  world.  Available, mature men who don't 

                  keep their emotions hidden like they're 

                  nuclear codes.  And I met one.

  LIZA CROSSES OVER WITH MATT.

                                        LIZA

                  Guess who I found lost in the hallway?

  MARY SHOOTS LIZA A LOOK, THEN MAKES A DECISION.

                                        MARY

                  (FOR PETER'S BENEFIT) Sweetheart, 

                  coming to visit me at work?

  MARY THROWS HER ARMS AROUND A CONFUSED MATT.  "Accidentally on Purpose"42.


                                        MARY (CONT D)

                  (IN MATT'S EAR) Just go with it.

  MATT SWOOPS IN FOR A BIG LONG KISS.  LIZA IS AGOG.

                                        MARY (CONT D)

                  Peter, this is my new boyfriend, Mat... 

                  thew.  Matthew.

  MATT SHAKES PETER'S HAND, GALLANTLY.

                  Pleasure to meet you, Sir.  (NOTICING)

                                        PETER

                  Oh come on, Mary.  He's a zygote. 

                                        MARY

                  Oh, so you can date twenty-year-olds

                  and I can't?

                                        PETER

                  Of course you can.  In fact, bravo.  

                  But there's no way you can expect me to 

                  believe that this kid is the mature, 

                  available manyou've been looking for.  

                                        MATT

                  Excuse me, but I'm into this woman.  

                  She's beautiful.  She's smart.  And 

                  she's carrying my baby!

                                        PETER

                  Wait, he's serious?  I thought you were 

                  doing a bit.

                                        MATT

                  Hey, you treat her with some respect!  

                  Just because your picture's on the wall 

                  doesn't mean we have to put up with 

                  this crap.

  MATT TAKES A STEP TOWARDS PETER.

                    MARYLIZA

  No, let's please not...This is fantastic.

                  (CHUCKLING) What... am I supposed to 

                  break out my KravMaga?

                                        MATT

                  I don't care!  I'll fight him, too!

  MARY REALIZES THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL, GETS IN BETWEEN THEM.

                                        MARY

                  Matt, Peter... stop.  Stop!

  MARY PULLS PETER ASIDE.

                                        MARY (CONT D)

                  What are you doing?  There's no reason 

                  you should even care.

  FOR THE FIRST TIME, PETER'S FACADE DROPS.

                                        PETER

                  Mary, I know I've screwed up a lot with 

                  you.  But I've always cared.

  PETER EXITS.  THERE'S A BEAT.  "Accidentally on Purpose"44.

                  (TO LIZA) See?  I told him and it 

                  wasn't complicated at all.  Ugh...

  MATT TURNS TO MARY.

                                        MATT

                  Can someone clue me in?

                                        MARY 

                  He was my ex-boyfriend.

                                        LIZA

                  And possibly her ex-boss.

                                        MARY

                  Oh come on, he's not going to fire me.

                                        LIZA

                  This is why I only sleep with men in a

  LIZA CROSSES OFF.  MARY TURNS TO MATT.

                                        MATT

                  What?  You said, "go with it."  

                                        MARY 

                  Yes, thanks.  But, why are you even 

                  here?

                                        MATT

                  I was doing laundry and I locked myself 

                  out of the apartment.

                                        MARY

                  Why didn't you just call?

                                        MATT

                  What about a pay phone?

                                        MATT

                  I used up all my quarters.  That's why 

                  my clothes are slightly damp.   

  MARY DIGS IN HER PURSE.

                                        MARY

                  Well& here's the key and I'll see you 

                  later.  (BEAT) I have to fix things

                  I could really use some quarters.

  LAPTOP, TO FIND MATT, DAVIS, RYAN AND SHANE, WATCHING "THE

                  certain uncomfortable situations.

                                        MARY

                  Who are these people, and why have they 

                  never heard of coasters?

                                        MATT

                  They're my buds.  You met Davis and 

                  Ryan and this is Shane.  He just got 

                  out of prison.  (WHISPERS TO MARY)  Not

                  You look upset.  Is it not cool that 

                  they're here, 'cause they were helping 

                  me--"Accidentally on Purpose"47.


                                        MARY

                  -- No, no, it's fine.  I just need 

                  to... put these groceries away and 

                  maybe eat an entire sheet cake.  

  AS MATT'S FRIENDS WATCH, SHE STARTS TO CROSS TO THE 
  KITCHEN.  MATT IMMEDIATELY TRIES TO STOP HER, SAYING.

                  It's no big deal.  Shane thinks he can 

                  reattach it.  He learned lots of 

                  handyman skills in the joint.  "Accidentally on Purpose"48.

                  You mean I can stay?

                                        MARY

                  nice, you know, office space, but sure.

  MARY SITS ON THE COUCH, TURNS THE TELEVISION BACK ON.  
  DAVIS AND RYAN SIT BACK DOWN.  MARY PICKS UP SOMETHING.

                                        MARY

                  Were you using my grandmother's urn as 

                  a water pipe?

  DAVIS NODS YES.

                                        MARY (CONT D)
