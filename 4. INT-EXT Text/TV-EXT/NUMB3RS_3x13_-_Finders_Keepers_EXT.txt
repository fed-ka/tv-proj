  MONTAGE to music.  SAILBOATS slice through the water.  Winter 
  sun sparkles.  Sails flutter then SNAP, filling with wind, 
  lifting yachts away from shore...  It s all the glamour and 
  beauty of sailing without the Dramamine.

  WE LAND ON a sailboat headed in.  She drops her sails and 
  heads up the channel, leading us toward...


  The usual activity among the docks.  Here and there, owners 
  do maintenance.  A few fishing boats hose off...

  At the end of one of the docks WE FIND a group of JUNIOR HIGH 
  KIDS on an oceanography FIELD TRIP.  They re gathered near a 
  tied-up RESEARCH BOAT, listening as a MARINE EXPERT describes 
  some local sea life, holding up SPECIMENS of some, pointing 
  to PICTURES of others on a chart...

                                MARINE EXPERT
                These are some examples of what we 
                might find today in our catch.  
                Pacific crab, sea anemones, any 
                number of a variety of starfish...

  Behind the Expert, on the Research Boat, a small CRANE lifts 
  a bulging fishing net...

                                MARINE EXPERT
                Once the net is released, you 
                should try to identify as many 
                  creatures as you can.  Keep a list 
                there in your notebooks... 

  The net moves into position over the pier.  It s tough to see 
  its contents, most of what s visible is seaweed.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    2.

                                MARINE EXPERT
                So far, most of what we can see is 
                kelp, which you re all familiar 
                with from the beach, right?  
                  Everybody s seen that?  So let s 
                write down  kelp ...

  The net comes to rest.  The Operator throws a lever, dumping 
  its contents - a tangle of sea weed, kelp, a giant crab... 
  and SOMETHING black, rubbery caught in a heap of kelp...

                                JUNIOR HIGH KID
                What is that, a sea lion?

  The Marine Expert tugs on the kelp.  The  sea lion  tumbles 
  out...  It s the wetsuit-clad BODY of a DEAD DIVER!  Teachers 
  and kids react.  The Marine Expert stands stunned... then --

                                MARINE EXPERT
                Somebody call the Harbor Patrol!

  Off the Dead Diver --


  CRIME SCENE now.  LAPD is here, along with PORT POLICE...  
  DON and COLBY arrive as the CORONER S INVESTIGATOR wraps up 
  her initial exam.  She turns to them, familiar --

                Agents.  How is it this guy rates 
                FBI attention?

                              COLBY
                He had the dumb luck to get himself 
                scooped up out of the ocean.  
                   Crimes-at-sea  are ours...

                              DON
                What can you tell us?

                                CORONER S INVESTIGATOR
                He wasn t in the water long, 16 to 
                24 hours.  Can t say for sure  til 
                I get him in the shop, but he was 
                probably dead before he went in.

                              COLBY
                      (off the diver s body)
                I m guessing the bullet hole in his 
                wetsuit had something to do with 
                that?

                Actually, Granger, it s the bullet 
                hole in the diver that really 
                clinched it.

                Thanks.  Nice to see those 4 years 
                of medical school weren t a waste.

  She smiles.  Don turns to a nearby PORT POLICE OFFICER.

                              DON
                We have an exact location on where 
                the body was found?

                              PORT POLICE OFFICER
                The boat was dragging the bottom 
                over several miles, seeing what 
                they could pull up for the kids...

                Bet this went over real well...

  Don stoops to take a look at the body, eyes the wetsuit.

                              DON
                This doesn t look like a 
                  recreational dive suit...

                              PORT POLICE OFFICER
                Nah, it s definitely commercial.

                              COLBY
                Like an oil rig worker or 
                  something...?

  Don moves to the Diver s leg, releases the knife sheath 
  strapped just above the ankle, turns it...

                              DON
                Or a salvage diver.

  He hands the sheath to Colby.  Colby reads the back...

  A beat.  Off the dead diver --


  An industrial area of the marina.  The Morris Salvage BARGE 
  is tied up opposite a small office.  Don pounds on the door.  
  Colby appears from around the side...

                              COLBY
                Their salvage barge is here, but I 
                don t see anyone...

  Don notices a MECHANIC working on a boat in the next slip. 

                              DON
                Hey...  Have you seen anybody from 
                Morris Salvage around?

                              MECHANIC
                Not today...  

                              DON
                When was the last time you did?

                              MECHANIC
                I dunno.  Their boat s been out for 
                the past couple days.  Must ve come 
                back in last night, but I wasn t 
                here.

  The Mechanic goes back to work.  Colby turns to Don...

                              COLBY
                If this guy s right, it means the 
                barge was out the same time period 
                the diver was shot and dumped. 

                              DON
                Which makes this barge our crime 
                scene.

  As they turn and climb aboard the barge...


  The barge is the ocean-going version of a heavy duty TOW 
  TRUCK - marker buoys, winch motors, cranes - most of it 
  covered with rust and/or barnacles... 

  Colby and Don cross the deck, splitting up, poking around, 
    searching.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    10.

                Add in a little alcohol...  Maybe 
                an argument erupts over how they ll

                Three guys sail out, only two end 
                up sailing back in.

  Don rounds the side of the wheel house, stops short.

                              DON
                Better call E.R.T.  Tell  em we 
                need a crime scene team out here.

  Colby comes to see -- a smeared, BLOODY HAND PRINT low on the 
  wall.  It s dried now, but there s no mistaking it.

                              COLBY
                Yeah, I m pretty sure that s not 
                finger paint...

  As Colby pulls his phone to call it in.  Don SEES SOMETHING 
  on the dock that distracts him.

  AGENT LIZ WARNER is coming up the dock...


  Don hops off the barge, goes to greet Liz, all smiles.

                              LIZ 
                How you doin , Eppes?

  They hug, but Liz is unexpectedly guarded, a little distant.

                              DON
                This is one I didn t see coming.

                Do you have any idea yet what

                                OLIVER
                Design flaw probably.  We fared 
                pretty well most of the race.  But 
                3 days after leaving Honolulu, the 
                keel began to separate, the boat 
                started taking on water.

                              MEGAN
                Why didn t they turn back?

                                OLIVER
                Problem wasn t that bad at first.  
                Wasn t until the seas got rougher 
                that we realized how serious it 
                really was.  Finally Reid gave the 
                order to abandon ship.

                              MEGAN
                How many in his crew?

                                OLIVER
                Five, including Reid.  We were able 
                to contact one of the other race 
                yachts.  She doubled back, picked 
                up the others.  But Reid didn t go.  
                Guess he thought he could make it 
                with the Cheetah...

                The yacht s locator beacon went 
                dead.
                      (then, mournful)
                I can build another boat, you know?  
                I can replace the Cheetah.  But 
                there s no way to replace Reid.

  A beat passes. Off Megan and Oliver --


  There s crime tape now, surrounding the wheel house where Don 
  and Colby discovered the bloody hand print.  Charlie s here 
  with Colby and Liz.

                              CHARLIE
                The question we re asking is 
                simple:  Where did this barge go 
                during the time it was out?  And 
                how can we re-trace its path?

  Charlie stops in the center of the deck, looks around as if 
  the answer is going to magically appear.  Liz smiles -

                              LIZ
                Oh, c mon, Charlie.  I m calling 
                your bluff here.

                              COLBY
                No, let him go.  He s fun to watch 
                when he gets like this.

                              CHARLIE
                The key is identifying data 
                sources.  There are a lot more 
                clues here than you probably 
                realize.  For instance, how much 
                fuel was consumed?  How many engine 
                hours were logged?  Did they record 
                any sonar readings?  Uh...  How 
                deep was the anchor chain run out?  
                And is there evidence of a 
                particular algae bloom on the 
                chain?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    19A.

                Ooh, I m having a bad algebra 
                  flashback.   If a salvage barge is 
                headed west at 6 knots in a 
                headwind of 8 knots...

                              CHARLIE
                It s not that difficult.  Each 
                piece of data is a constraint.  
                Since the path of the boat must 
                obey every constraint, the set of 
                possible paths gets pared down with 
                each new measurement.  So I ll make 
                a list of possible data sources.  
                You two start collecting.

                              COLBY
                Well, fuel and engine hour data 
                we ve already got.  It s right here 
                in the crime scene report.
                      (flipping pages)
                Fuel consumed, 68 gallons.  Engine 
                hours on the last trip... 16.

                              CHARLIE
                Are you sure?

                              COLBY
                That s what the report says.  We 
                can double check...

  Charlie starts scribbling on his pad, quick calculations.  
  Then he unrolls the OCEAN CHART they ve brought along.

                              LIZ
                What, Charlie...  You can t already 
                know where the barge went?

                              CHARLIE
                No, but I know where it didn t go.
                      (using the chart)
                The Cheetah went down here.  That s 
                almost 40 miles out.  But by the 
                fuel and engine hours data, I can 
                tell you right now that this barge 
                traveled a maximum of 20 miles.  
                Round trip.

  He marks a semi-circle on the chart, 10 mile radius.

                              COLBY
                So they were never more than 10 
                miles from shore.

                              LIZ
                Which means they were no where near 
                where the Cheetah went down.

                But Charlie, all our assumptions 
                about motive, about cause... 
                they re all attributed to finding 
                that boat.

                              CHARLIE
                Then all your assumptions re wrong.

                racing yacht, what were they 
                looking for?

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:


  Charlie, Cordero and Graves walk across the campus.

                              GRAVES
                Within hours of the time the 
                Cheetah went down, we had two 
                search vessels in the area.  We ve 
                worked around the clock, sonar 
                mapping every inch of the bottom...

                              CHARLIE
                And you know for certain you re  
                looking in the spot she went down.

                              CORDERO
                The boat s locator beacon gave 
                precise GPS coordinates until the 
                moment it went under...  Still, 
                despite all our efforts, we ve 
                found nothing.

                              CHARLIE
                Can I ask why the NSA is interested 
                in finding the yacht?

                N.S.A.  Never Say Anything, I get 
                it.

  A beat.  Charlie stares off.  By chance, his eyes land on a 
  LEAF as it FALLS from a tree, wafting lazily back and forth.

  CHARLIE VISION - 

  On the falling leaf.  Part way through its gliding descent it 
  FREEZES.  Equations suddenly surround it...

  Then the leaf becomes the hull of a SAILBOAT.  More equations 
  as it resumes a descent, gliding forward as it drops...

  BACK TO SCENE -

                You can t find it because you re 
                looking in the wrong place.  Here, 
                let me show you...

  He pulls a sheet of paper from the notebook he carries, 
  crumples it into a tight ball.

                              CHARLIE
                Your search pattern probably 
                assumes that the Cheetah sank 
                  something like this... 

  He drops the crumpled wad.  It falls straight down.

                              CHARLIE
                But... 

  He grabs another sheet, folds it in half, end to end.  Looks 
  around... spots a PAPER CLIP on a file Graves carries.

                              CHARLIE
                Uh...  Paper clip.  May I?

  He snatches the paper clip, attaches it to the end of the 
  folded sheet - a crude PAPER AIRPLANE.

                              CHARLIE
                In reality, the Cheetah probably 
                sank more like this.

  Released, the paper flies forward before hitting the ground.

                                GRAVES
                It glides forward.

                              CHARLIE
                      (growing enthusiasm)
                That s right, it glides.  And a 
                boat like the Cheetah, a boat of 
                that sophisticated a design...  
                It s practically going to fly 
                  underwater, traveling laterally 4, 
                maybe 5 feet for every foot it 
                falls.

                Knowing what I know about the hull, 
                and given the depth of the water, I 
                should be able to determine, with 
                pretty good accuracy, just how far 
                she could ve traveled before 
                hitting bottom... and then the NSA 
                can refocus their search.

                              GRAVES
                How long will it take you?

  Charlie looks invigorated by the chore.

                Oh, and Professor...  This is a

                Sort of.  I laid out a large grid.  
                They ll have to search it.  But 
                there s a better than 83% chance

  CHEETAH has been raised from the ocean floor and now hangs in 
  a sling next to the docks, water still draining off her.  Six 
  large LIFT BAGS hang from her rails - deflated balloons.  Don

                None of this makes sense.  Every 
                piece of data available says this 
                yacht went down 40 miles out to 
                sea.

                So how d she end up on the bottom

                We don t know.  But Morris Salvage 
                knew right where to look.

  They reach Liz, standing next to the Cheetah.  She s 
  examining one of the deflated LIFT BAGS.

                              LIZ
                Here s something else that doesn t 
                add up.  Lift bags.  They re used 
                to raise a sunken ship to the 
                surface.  But these were already on 
                the Cheetah when we found her.

  She turns one over, revealing some familiar markings.

                They d already brought her up.

                Why would someone bring a 2 million 
                dollar prize to the surface... and 
                then throw it back?

  Attention shifts to the NSA s Graves and Cordero as they 
  comes stomping down the dock, flashing badges.

                              GRAVES
                Where s the Agent in Charge?

  Someone points toward Don.  They make a bee-line... until 
  they see Charlie.  They veer toward him instead.

                              CORDERO
                  Professor Eppes.  I suppose you

                              CHARLIE
                I don t know what you mean...

                              CORDERO
                You intentionally sent us in the 
                wrong direction so you could help 
                your brother recover this yacht.

                              CHARLIE
                That s not true, honestly.  I m as 
                  surprised as anyone we found her.

                                GRAVES
                You ll be lucky if you don t lose 
                your security clearance over this.

                              CHARLIE
                But I didn t do anything wrong!

                              DON
                      (stepping in)
                Alright.  Back off, now.

                                GRAVES
                You don t look any better than your 
                brother in this, Eppes.

                              DON
                I don t even know what this is about, 
                alright?  But if you guys want to 
                discuss it in a civilized way, we can 
                talk about it.  Otherwise get the 
                hell outta my crime scene.


  Charlie out on the bridge, still a little shaken.  Don 
  approaches.  Charlie sees him --

                              CHARLIE
                No good deed goes unpunished, 
                right?

                              DON
                Don t worry about the NSA guys.  
                They re over it already.

  Beat.  Something else is bugging Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                I feel bad I back-burnered your 
                stuff to work on theirs.

                              DON
                Charlie, what re you gonna do?  You 
                didn t have a choice, right?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    40.

                              CHARLIE
                I don t know, maybe I did... 
                      (beat, off Don)
                I was so obsessed with that yacht - 
                truth is, when they offered me a 
                chance to work on it, I jumped.

                              DON
                      (beat, teasing)
                Then maybe you do have something to 
                feel bad about.

  Charlie smiles.  The air s cleared.

                              DON
                If you re interested, NSA thinks 
                the Cheetah was smuggling 
                something.

                              CHARLIE
                      (dawning)
                  Smuggling...  Makes perfect sense.

                              DON
                What, you already knew that?

                              CHARLIE
                No.  But it explains why I couldn t 
                find a flaw in the boat s design.  
                The hull only failed because the 
                yacht was carrying an extra load, 
                weight it wasn t designed to 
                handle.
                      (then, curious)
                What were they smuggling?

                              DON
                Don t know.  The race took them to 
                16 different ports all over the 
                world.  Whatever they were carrying 
                could ve been loaded on anywhere.

                              CHARLIE
                That s not true.

                              DON
                Why not?

                              CHARLIE
                I studied the boat s performance.  
                The Cheetah s pace slowed slightly 
                following the stop in Singapore...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    41.

                              DON
                Which would indicate they took on 
                extra weight, right?

                              CHARLIE
                Matter of fact, it wouldn t be 
                  difficult to calculate exactly how 
                much extra weight they took on...

  A beat between them.  Then they hurry toward the building.


  Cordero comes down the dock.  Colby and Liz are waiting for 
  him.

                              COLBY
                It s a cabin cruiser, belongs to a 
                friend of the Sarasins.  The wife 
                says he s been hiding out there...

                              CORDERO
                Your lead...

  Colby s the first to start toward the boat.


  The three Agents cautiously approach the vintage CABIN 
  CRUISER.  Lights are on.  Guns drawn, they silently board, 
  take positions.  Colby pounds hard on the cabin door --

                              COLBY
                Reid Sarasin.  Federal Agents!  
                Come on out!

  A beat.  Nothing.  Colby steps back, then kicks the door in.


  The Agents emerge onto the deck, glance around.

                              LIZ
                I ll call it in to Don.  Maybe they 
                wanna have another go at the wife.

  As Liz pulls her phone, Colby sees something on the forward 
  rail - a torn piece of FABRIC, snagged on the top edge.

  He moves forward, looks into the water alongside the boat...  
    A concentric RIPPLE emanates out from under the nearest dock.  

                              COLBY
                Liz.  Hold up.

  She puts away her phone, joins Colby, sensing something s up.  
  Then Colby spots something in the water, points.

                              COLBY
                There.  What s that?

                              LIZ
                Looks like the tip of a snorkel.

  Sure enough, it s the top 2 inches of a SNORKEL, barely 
  visible sticking up from the water.  Colby grabs a discarded 
  CONTAINER off the ground, fills it with water...

  He then dumps it into the open tip of the snorkel.  Almost 
    immediately, REID SARASIN comes sputtering up to the surface.

                              COLBY
                Alright, Captain Nemo.  Up on the 
                dock.  Let s go.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    48.

  As Reid Sarasin pulls himself up onto the docks...

  OMITTED3333


  Under the orange wash of mercury-vapor lamps, we find the 
  yellow BOX VAN parked alongside the warehouse.  Sounds of 
  ships loading in the distance, train engines...

  Out of the shadows, the Agents appear - Don, Colby, Liz, 
  Cordero and Graves ( casual tac ).  Colby uses a flashlight 
  to peer inside the box van.

                              COLBY
                Empty...

  They move toward the warehouse door.  There s the muted 
  crackle of a radio - Don s ear bud.  He turns to the others.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    55.

                Spotter has two inside.  Southeast 
                  corner...

  They move into position, nearer the entrance.  Don looks up, 
  spots a small motion-detector lamp mounted up high.

                              DON
                      (whispered, urgent)
                Hold up!

  But it s too late.  Cordero trips the beam.  The spotlight 
  above the door illuminates.  A BUZZER SOUNDS somewhere 
  inside.  They ve been made and they re standing in the light.

                              DON
                Dammit, we re compromised.  Hit the 
                door.  Go, go, go!

  Colby BLOWS THE DOOR --


  Mop up.  Handcuffed Suspects #1 and #2 are placed into cars 
  in the b.g.  Don and Colby cross and meet up with Cordero and 
  Graves as the NSA Agents come out of the warehouse.

                              CORDERO
                Crates are all here, full.  
                Guidance systems accounted for.

                              DON
                What about missiles?  Any sign of 
                them?

                              GRAVES
                We found this inside.  It s a 
                shipping invoice.  A container ship 
                coming in tomorrow from Malaysia...

  He hands it to Don.  Colby and Don read, Colby smiles --

                              COLBY
                 Teak furniture.   Why do I get a 
                feeling these guys aren t waiting 
                on a new patio set?

                              CORDERO
                We ve already put a call in to the 
                Coast Guard.  We ll be waiting 
                along with D.H.S. tomorrow when the 
                missiles arrive...

  Graves and Cordero move off.  Colby too.  Don turns to find 
  Liz standing right behind him.  The tension is still there. *
