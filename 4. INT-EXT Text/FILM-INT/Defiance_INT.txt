Zus bursts in to find Panchenko deep in conversation with
Gramov and others. They look up at the intrusion.
ZUS
Forgive me, Commander.
PANCHENKO
Zus. Join us.
He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it.
ZUS
I want to report the mistreatment
of a comrade.
Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye.

ZUS (CONT'D)
This man beat Comrade Lova -- for
no reason at all.
GRAMOV
I had a perfectly good reason. He
is a Jew.
The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov.
PANCHENKO
--and you are an ignorant Tartar.
(offers Zus vodka)
Ignore him. Here...
ZUS
Anti-semitism is a violation of
Party discipline.
Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this?
PANCHENKO
He's right, Gramov. Apologize to
the Jew.
GRAMOV
I apologize, Jew.
PANCHENKO
There. You see?
(...a command)
Now drink up.
Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka.
