shoulder all the way.
CUT TO:
INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING
LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister
staircase.
STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.
LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it
seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.
On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls
him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.
On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the
shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out
of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT
down with him.
On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE.
It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he
reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.
HARD CUT TO:
INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT
A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the
STAIRWELL, above.
A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around
the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at
the table.
RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound.
A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR.
JC jumps up to answer it.
It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.)
JC lets him in.
JC
How are you doing, man?
LT
Very good. Very good. The Mets are
gonna win tomorrow.
JC notes LT's bizarre manner. Decides to humor his paranoid
catatonia.
JC
I know. Here. Just a moment.
JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.
Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.
POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before
PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and
exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet,
hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.
LT takes this all in. JC startles him.
JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH.
JC hands it to LT.
JC
This should be it. Oh, wait.
(to an old woman at
the table)
Mamacita?
MAMACITA takes some VIALS of CRACK out of her APRON.
SMILES. JC takes them from her, give them to LT.
JC
There. Now you've got your profit
and more. You'll have more product
day after tomorrow, right?
LT
(very spaced)
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna
win tomorrow.
JC
I know.
(beat - looks at LT
with concern)
Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be
cool.
LT nods, puts MAMACITA'S CRACK VIALS in his pocket. He notices
that --
POV LT - CU - The CIGAR BOX is inlaid with a CROSS, made of
costume jewels. Other strange symbols surround it. It could
be cursed -- or blessed.
LT turns to go. The DOOR closes behind him. He's gone.
CUT TO:
EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT
LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He
carries the CIGAR BOX.
Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.
ZOOM IN ON - CU LT
Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him.
LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.
POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in
the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that
create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.
LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own
terror.
Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself
against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --
A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.
It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".
BRASH FEMALE VOICE
(OC)
Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire
up the ass!
LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never
any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!
ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.
Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.
BRASH FEMALE VOICE
(OC)
Fuck you.
LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He
cannot be relieved. The terror is with him.
CUT TO:
INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT
LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately
pulls the DRAPES.
LT
Someone just took a shot at me...
Ariane laughs.
ARIANE
Sure, baby Sure And you don't do
cocaine, either.
LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him.
LT
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's --
it's someone who wants to kill me.
(beat)
You gotta believe me!
ARIANE
(shrugs)
Why?
ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT.
LT
Just kick back, baby. Make yourself
at home.
(suddenly pissed)
But of course it won't be nobody's
home, if you don't come through with
the fucking rent!
LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY
under it.
LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a
MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S
NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky
Mob joint answers.
LT
Hello? Is LARGE there?
MOB VOICE
(OC)
No.
LT
Look, man. Lite gave ne this number.
OK? Just take a message. Tell Large
to fucking call me right away at 123-
1234. Got it?
MOB VOICE
(CO -- phony humble)
Sure, I get it...
(laughs)
LT
I'm a good friend of Lite's, man.
It's urgent that --
The MOB VOICE (CO) HANGS UP ON LT.
LT tries to strangle the PHONE.
LT REDIALS.
The line is BUSY.
LT
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all
with my bare hands.
ARIANE
Who?
LT
Those fucking Mob assholes.
LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at
him.
ARIANE
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
LT
Yeah.
ARIANE
Then c'mere. I got something for
you.
ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE.
LT comes but flinches
at the sight.
Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY
appears out of the KITCHEN.
BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.
ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the
paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.
ARIANE
First I'll put your Uptown in the
spoon, then, to make it more exciting,
I'm gonna add some Downtown. They
call this thing a speedball, honey,
but then you must know that...
(beat -- she leans in)
First time shooting up?
LT
Nah...
ARIANE
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just
like that nun. And I'm gonna rape
you.
That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and
lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE
and HEROIN.
ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.
They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic
connotations.
When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds,
sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.
Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES.
Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.
Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.
ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.
Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with
total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --
The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes
who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.
LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from
another world syllable by syllable.
LT
(into the phone)
Large?
LARGE
(OC)
All right, cop. I want my money.
LT
It's still my money. If you want to
have a chance at any part of it,
shithead, you will take my $120,000
and bet on tomorrow's game.
LARGE
(OC)
What about the money you owe me on
yesterday's game?
LT
Fuck yesterday's game. The World
Series is seven games not six. Put
in my bet.
LARGE
(OC)
Let me think about it.
LT
There's nothing to think about. Either
you put in my bet or you ain't getting
nothing.
BIG SILENCE on the PHONE.
LARGE
(CO -- lethal)
Oh, really?
LT
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole,
man. I'm a fucking cop!
LARGE
(OC)
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself
and your friends on the force a
message. Tell them I've got my own
reasons to be very interested in
whomever did the job on the nuns.
I'll double the Church reward if you
bring those punks direct to me. 100
G cash. Get it?
LT absorbs this, then bursts out.
LT
Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about
Strawberry! Is the bet down?
LARGE takes a moment.
LARGE
(OC)
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight
across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th.
At the beginning of the Ninth Inning.
We'll listen to the end of the game
together. You bring your cash, I'll
bring mine.
LT
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
LT HANGS UP, turns to ARIANE.
LT
Can you believe the nerve of this
fucking guy? He kills people for
fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to
bring in some guys who raped a nun.
What a sick fuck. Man...
ARIANE
Who?
LT
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the
rapists if I turn then over direct
to him.
ARIANE'S eyes light up.
ARIANE
But you could do it, baby. We could
use the bread...
LT
You mean you could use it.
ARIANE SHRUGS, waves his dig aside.
LT leaps up. He's on a manic roll. Conceives an insanely
captivating, impossible idea. As he speaks, he speeds more
and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue
twister perfect.
LT
I got it, man! I will find those
kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the
Church! Then the kids'll go to jail.
I'll be in charge, of course. After
a little while, I'll break the fuckers
out -- and I'll turn them in to
shithead I was just talking to. And
pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him
up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it --
'cause I've got the kids. Then, of
course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna
pick up on the Game tonight -- when
the Strawberries win!
ARIANE
"The Strawberries"?
LT
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another
180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ!
That's almost half a million dollars.
Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough,
I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for
the kids. Then it'll be a perfect
500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G
for the kids. Yeah, it's good I
prepared, or I wouldn't have thought
to --
ARIANE has been grooving on it until now. She sees a problem
they've overlooked.
ARIANE
(cuts in)
How come all those guys who're looking
to get 50 from the Church haven't
come up with shit? You got some kinda
inside track?
LT
(nods -- dead serious)
I'm a Catholic.
ARIANE LAUGHS, decides to go with it.
LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of
his dose kick in but good.
He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out
the morning of the desecration.
Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close.
As it was that morning only four days ago, the SUNRISE is
blood red.
As if it is LT'S DREAM, we --
CUT TO:
DAY FIVE:
GAME SEVEN: LT GETS DOUBLE OR NOTHING: $120,000
INT: DAWN THROUGH HIGH NOON  CHURCH/CONVENT
CU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has
been all night.
VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its
enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN.
TIME PASSES.
VARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross.
TIME PASSES.
VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross.
Suddenly --
LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the
white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a
distance.
The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes
to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.
LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR
BOX.
LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.
ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.
They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT
confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY
BEADS.
LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer
of "help".
LT
Listen to me, Sister, listen to me
good. The other cops'll just put the
guys through the system. They're
juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But
I'll beat the system and do justice.
Real justice. For you.
The NUN turns to run.
NUN
I have already forgiven them.
LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her.
LT
Come on lady! They put out cigarettes
on your tits, man! Get with the
program! Don't you want them behind
bars? Or away from the world for
good? How could you forgive these
motherfu -- excuse me. These guys.
How could you? Deep down, don't you
want them to pay for what they did
to you? Don't you want the crime
avenged?
NUN
I have forgiven them.
LT
Nun! These boys still have their
weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness
will leave blood in its wake. What
if they do it to other nuns? Other
virgins? Old women who die from the
shock? Do you have the rights let
these boys go free? Can you bear the
burden. Sister?
The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple.
NUN
I have prayed for days, Lieutenant.
I have prayed for the souls of the
boys who raped me. And I have prayed
for my own soul, too. I know what I
must do. And I know what I must not
do.
(beat)
But you -- you -- it is you who needs
to pray. Now, why do you want to
kill these boys? Why -- really?
LT
(takes yet another
tack)
Look. Sister. No one has to get
killed. We can solve this together.
You and me -- as one. These boys are
lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you
know that? And they're sick, Sister.
With a stress of the mind and of the
soul. They need help. Not just jail.
Not just psychiatry. They need the
help that only the Church can give.
Please help me to help them. Help me
find them before the others do. The
night is full of evil men, chasing
these boys with guns and clubs. We
have charity and love on our side. I
know that together, we could find
them first, even in the dark...
NUN
The good reasons are not always the
real reasons. Talk to Jesus,
Lieutenant. Pray.
(beat)
You do you believe in God -- don't
you? That Jesus Christ died for your
sins?
This blows him away. He has nothing to say to that.
The NUN has finished her morning prayers.
For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.
Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH.
LT comes face to face with the mammoth CRUCIFIX. He is
transfixed.
POV - LT - JESUS on the CROSS.
Soon, LT hears a VOICE.
LT is not shocked or even surprised. He speaks to JESUS as
to someone he's known all his life.
JESUS
(OC)
I forgive you.
LT
Me?
JESUS
(OC)
I forgive you.
LT
You can't forgive me. After what
I've done.
(beat)
I've fucked up bigtime. I've been
bad. Real bad.
JESUS
I forgive you.
LT
Please. Please don't forgive me.
I've always hated you for that.
POV LT - The CRUCIFIX takes on an hallucinatory radiance.
Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS,
and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR.
JESUS
I forgive you.
LT
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me!
Please! Help me!
(confused)
Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
JESUS
I forgive you.
LT
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash
the ashes from my forehead, year
after year after year? And why am I
still drunk on your blood, the taste
of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of
all, why can't I feel the nails in
my palms, the spear in my side, the
crown of thorns round my head? Why
do I have to know, over and over,
that it was you. You who died; died
for my sins! And that I will die for
nothing. Why?
JESUS kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with LT.
JESUS
I forgive you.
LT
Why do I dream every night of the
whore who brought you water on your
road to death? And why have I never
forgotten that if she, then I --
LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again --
JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet --
LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He
stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises
again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant.
He collapses in a corner.
LT
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to
be good. Forgive me. Father, for I
have sinned. It's still goddamn good
to be good.
JESUS
I forgive you.
EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH!
In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a
hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the
ALTAR.
He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the
CHALICE!
LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let
go.
LT
The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to
you! Tell me where the fuck you got
it! Take me there! Now!
At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs
her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea.
Then breaks into TEARS.
She speaks at last.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
I can't tell you.
Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees.
LT
In the name of God, you must.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
My husband will give me Hell, Mister.
LT
We've already got Hell, Sister.
She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly,
she tells him what he needs to know.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
It's very hard. He's a -- you're not
a cop, are you?
LT
No. Not a cop.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
My husband is a fence. He got this
chalice from a couple of kids. Just
yesterday, I think. I stole it out
of his shop so as to return it to
where it ought to be. It's a holy
thing, you know. A holy thing.
The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds
ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.
LT
A holy thing.
(beat -- snaps to)
Let's go.
Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the
arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the
CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his
way out. Manages to carry both items.
When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside,
they both pause to GENUFLECT.
Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.
CUT TO:
EXT: AFTERNOON - BARRIO STREETS - EN ROUTE TO THE FENCE
LT walks the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN swiftly through the streets
toward the FENCE'S SHOP.
He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.
PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that
something is happening -- on several levels at once. The
GAME has begun. It is on TV in every BAR and SHOP WINDOW. In
both English and Spanish. Slowly but surely, the Mets are
losing.
CUT TO:
INT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE FENCE'S SHOP
LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN enter the SHOP. LT is wielding
the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. He has true madness m his
eyes.
POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the
FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!
The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many
EASY CHAIRS. He doesn't seem surprised to see his WIFE. Or
the CHALICE. Or LT! It's as if he expected them.
FENCE
You took the chalice.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
Yes.
FENCE
You brought it back to the Church.
And then it made it's way back to
me, again.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
Yes.
Th FENCE bursts out LAUGHING.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
Are you all right, honey?
FENCE
I was gonna bring it back myself.
The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved.
FENCE
Jesus, woman! What did you think?
You thought I'd get mad like I did
that time you took that set of pots
and pans? That was twenty years ago.
And how do you compare pots and pans
and a chalice?
LT speaks up suddenly.
LT
They both hold stuff you eat.
After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins
in.
FENCE
(to LT)
So what are you doing here?
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
He wants to know who brought in the
chalice.
FENCE
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo
brought it in,
(beat)
You don't want to hurt those boys,
do you? I mean, they sure as Hell
have got something coming, but it
ain't what the Law wants to give
them. You understand?
(beat -- shakes his
head)
No. How could you understand.
The FENCE seems to study LT.
POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.
The FENCE thinks again.
FENCE
Well -- maybe you do. But I don't
know where those boys are at right
now. You'll have to ask around. Those
boys on the corner'll know. You'll
have to get it out of them. But they
know.
POV LT - Through the WINDOW of the FENCE'S SHOP, a busy DRUG
CORNER is visible.
LT
(spaced)
Thank you. And I'll make sure the
chalice gets back where it belongs.
LT leaves. CHALICE in hand.
CUT TO:
EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE
LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about
"JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at
random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE,
asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.
LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now,
he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But
none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.
The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.
Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops.
The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes
down in mime.
Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.
LT
Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio
around?
The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting
"deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.
LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No
response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.
The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at
all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from
his ears but doesn't take it off.
STREET DEALER
What the fuck you want.
LT
You know, my Uncle used to wear a
walkman all the time. The walkman
looked just like yours. And you look
something like my Uncle. But one day
he was standing in a puddle -- the
puddle locked just like that one --
LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now
Standing.
STREET DEALER
And what?
LT
And he got electrocuted.
The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has
just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react.
LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.
LT
Look -- I don't know you, and you
don't know me, but I'm really in the
mood to kill someone today and you
are at the end of my gun.
(beat)
Have you ever had days like that?
Yeah, you have, so now you understand
where I'm coming from.
(beat)
Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?
The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all
it was about? No problem.
STREET DEALER
They were at that abandoned building
last night. Second floor. They're
probably still there now. It's next
to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.
You know the place...
CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out
has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an
began! It suddenly makes sense to him.
LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the
DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing
dozens of thousands of dollars.
The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full
of cash.
CUT TO:
EXT: EVENING - EN ROUTE TO THE CRACKHOUSE
LT, carrying the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX, heads back
Downtown toward the CRACKHOUSE -- and the CHURCH/CONVENT.
In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers'
conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city
has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person
in the street.
Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are
definitely LOSING.
LT drags himself onward.
CUT TO:
EXT INT: EVENING - THE CRACKHOUSE
LT busts in. Fires shots, collars the KIDS. The KIDS are
wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT. They also
wear gold CROSSES. LT HANDCUFFS them.
The other CRACKHEADS race out.
There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME!
The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will
force LT to kill/and or take the KIDS into custody, this
would seem to be it.
JULIO
Who the fu--
LT
Shut up. Let's watch the game.
LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the
Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.
LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds
his GUN.
The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment.
All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game.
LT
Strawberry...
PAOLO
Yeah...
After a moment, LT gets up. The KIDS understand that they
must do the same.
LT
Give me the robes.
The KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on.
JULIO
You're not a cop are you?
LT
No.
LT exits. Taking the KIDS along. He carries the CHALICE and
the CIGAR BOX.
CUT TO:
EXT INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR AND STREETS EN ROUTE TO RENDEZ-
VOUS
VARIOUS ANGLES - LT drives toward the fatal rendez-vous with
the BOOKIE. He is wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the
CHURCH/CONVENT and has the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.
LT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene
mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.)
The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but
also not listening.
LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery
they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating
his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN
at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window,
then at the KIDS, again.
LT
Jesus died for your sins, you
motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't
die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus
went and did it.
(beat)
So why did you do what you did? If
you want to live, tell me now,
motherfuckers! Tell me now!
LT turns around and looks at JULIO and PAOLO, both of them
HANDCUFFED in the back seat.
POV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down
their cheeks. Silently.
LT
I forgive you.
LT starts CRYING too, at the same time CURSING at the TRAFFIC.
He drives wildly toward the Port Authority Terminal.
The Mets are coming up from behind -- but it is a long shot.
LT doesn't seem to care. He stares into space.
CUT TO:
EXT:/INT: EVENING - LTS CAR - THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL
LT stops his CAR -- next to a BUS in an underground tunnel.
LT
Get out.
The KIDS do. LT follows fast.
