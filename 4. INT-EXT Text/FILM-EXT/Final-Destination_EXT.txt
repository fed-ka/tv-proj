Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway.
wearing a dark suit and tie, sits beside his parents on white folded chairs. His head is bowed, guilty and sad...
MINISTER (CONT'D)
As each day passes without a
determining cause for the accident,
we ask ourselves, "Why?"
Alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony...
ALEX'S POV - TOD
sits with his mother, LINDA WAGGNER and his father, Jerry. Destraught, Jerry stares off blankly at the minister.
MINISTER (CONT'D)
Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more
knows his time than fish taken in
the fatal net...
ALEX
guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.
MINISTER (CONT'D)
...or birds trapped in the snare...
Alex checks over his shoulder.
ALEX'S POV - OVER HIS SHOULDER - LAST ROW OF SEATS
Special agents Schreck and Weine subtly survey the area, taking notes. Although their eyes are beyond sunglasses, the tilt of their head indicates they are watching Alex.
MINISTER (CONT'D)
...like these the children of men...
ALEX
turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.
MINISTER (CONT'D)
...caught when the Time falls
suddenly upon them."
CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, feeling eyes upon them. He looks up...
ALEX'S POV - CLEAR RIVERS
is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress. Still, she is off by herself, eyes burning at Alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken.
ALEX
self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.
MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.)
And so before we can heal, before we
can escape the presence of Death
Time, we must mourn and celebrate
theirs with this memorial.
WIDER
A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run."
Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.
MEMORIAL LINE
Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.
CARTER
Hope you don't think, Browning, that
because my name ain't on this wall...
that I owe you anything.
ALEX
I don't.
CARTER
(re: victims)
All I owe is these people.
(turns to Alex)
To live my life to the fullest.
Alex winces from Carter's breath...
ALEX
Then maybe you should lay off the
J.D.
Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.
CARTER
Don't ever fucking again tell me
what to do. I control me. Not you.
Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.
CARTER
I'm never gonna die.
He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.
Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.
BILLY
I took my driver's test this week at
the DMV...
Alex turns to him, increudlously..
BILLY
Got a 70. Lowest score, but I
passed. When I was done with the
test, the guy who drives with you
during the test, he goes, "Young
man, you're going to die at a
very young age."
(beat)
That true?
ALEX
Not here, not now.
(beat)
Not EVER!
Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...
BILLY
If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will
she say "no?"
Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.
Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...
CLOSE - MEMORIAL
Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.
RETURN
Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....
ALEX
Ms. Lewton...
Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.
MS. LEWTON
Don't talk to me. You scare the hell
out of me.
Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.
TOD
(a greeting)
Hey.
Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...
ALEX
I don't want to sound gay, or
nothin, but... I miss you.
Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.
CLOSE - MEMORIAL
Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.
RETURN
As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.
TOD
Me, too.
(beat)
But my dad doesn't understand. When
he's better; you and me, road trip
to the City. Catch the Yanks.
ALEX
That's a plan.
Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.
TOD
I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton
showed me in her class, they're
gonna let me read it. It says what
I'm feeling.
Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.
CLEAR
Because of you... I'm still alive.
Thank you.
Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.
TOD (V.O.)
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast...
TIME CUT:
Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium.
TOD (CONT'D)
But when we say this, we imagine
that the hour is placed in an
obscure and distant future.
As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow.
ALEX
looks up at the sky...
THE SKY - ALEX'S POV
Within the deep blue, a single black cloud blocks the sun.
ALEX
CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod...
TOD
as he continues to read...
TOD (CONT'D)
It never occurs to us that it has
any connection with the day already
begun or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.
CUT TO:
Storm clouds devour a waxing crescent moon above a modest home set amongst the edge of the woods.
TOD (V.O., CONT'D)
This afternoon... which is so
certain... and which has every hour
filled in advance.
whirl and flash INTO CAMERA. CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ADJUSTING to REVEAL a Paramedics vehicle, a Sullivan County, N.Y. Sheriff's patrol car and unmarked sedan.
CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING UNTIL REVEALING Alex Browning racing down the sidewalk. He runs into a CLOSE-UP, sweating, out of breath, expression horrified as he takes in the scene before him.
SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE
stand in the front yard. Schreck subtly redirects Weine's attention toward...
ALEX - SPECIAL AGENT'S POV
The boy franically moves to a paramedic.
ALEX
What happened? Is Tod alright?
SCHRECK AND WEINE
hearing this, they turn to one another, with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion.
ALEX
sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until...
CLEAR (O.S.)
Alex!
Alex stops, looks around. Behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house, stands Clear Rivers.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
(a warning)
Get outta here!
CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house.
ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY
is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard.
ALEX
is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.
ALEX
What... what happened?
Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly.
MR. WAGGNER
Didn't you... "see" it?
Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction.
MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D)
Couldn't you "predict" it?
Couldn't you read his mind?
Alex remains silent, hurt.
ALEX
Mr. Waggner...
MR. WAGGNER
You caused Tod so much guilt over
George staying on the plane that...
(breaking down)
He took his own life.
Alex is stunned, defensive.
ALEX
He wouldn't do it!
Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof."
ALEX
He... he told me we would be friends
again after you got better. After
you got over George. Why would he
make plans for the future if he were
planning on killing himself?
MR. WAGGNER
All my wife and I will ever know is
we wouldn't have lost our youngest
son... if you'd told our oldest to
get off the plane.
Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle.
The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers.
ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD
Clear is gone.
FRONT YARD
everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend...
CUT TO:
A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk.
A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about
"...Tod."
CLEAR
(O.S.)
Almost Autumn.
Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.
ALEX
It's only the end of June.
CLEAR
(shrugs)
Yeah, but everthing's always in
transition. If you focus, even now,
one week into summer... you can feel
Autumn coming.
(beat)
Almost like bein' able... to see the
future.
Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.
Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.
CLEAR
Know what this is?
She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.
ALEX
Like, um... you're mad about
something?
She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.
CLEAR
A piece of debris... from the plane.
I went to the shore off the crash
site and it washed up on the beach.
ALEX
You went there? I've wanted to go
there, but I thought it was off
limits.
CLEAR
It is. But that didn't stop me.
Shouldn't stop you.
Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...
ALEX
Why were you there last night?
While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...
CLEAR
Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
suicides. But they were there last
night, that means: one, they still
don't have a clue what caused the
crash. Two, they haven't ruled out
anything. And the fact that seven
people got off the plane is probably
weird enough, not to mention, that
one of those people had a vision, or
whatever, of it exploding minutes
before it did explode, is highly
suspicious. And it doesn't help that
the visionaries' friend just
committed suicide.
Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.
ALEX
Why were you there last night?
Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.
CLEAR
Know what this is?
Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."
CLEAR
It's you.
Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.
CLEAR
Not a likeness. It's how you make
me feel, Alex.
ALEX
I'm... really sorry.
CLEAR
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
to take form. And, yet, creating an
absolute but incomprehansible
attraction.
Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
Before that day, you were just
another suburban nothing that would
never have anything to do with my
life. And I'm sure you thought I was
some Marilyn Manson body-pierced
freak, or whatever.
(beat)
But at that moment... on the plane...
I felt what you felt. I didn't know
where all those emotions were coming
from until you started freaking out.
Alex sighs, embarrassed.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
I didn't see what you saw, but I
felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that
X-Files bullshit... but it was a
psychic connection. Why to me? Why
to you?
Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.
CLEAR
And you can still feel it, can't
you? Something from that day is
still with you. I know, because I
can still feel you.
Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...
CLEAR
That's why I was there last night.
ALEX
I've never dealt with death before.
I wasn't alive when my grandparents
died. I wish I could know. I mean,
all this... could just be in our
heads. Now it feels like it's
everywhere.
CLEAR
"It?"
ALEX
What if Tod... is just the first...
of us?
The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
CLEAR
Is that something you're "feeling?"
ALEX
I don't know. I wish I could just see
him... one more time, then, maybe...
I would know.
CLEAR
Then, let's go see him!
Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...
CUT TO:
BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.
CLEAR (O.S.)
The mortician was whacked.
CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
He was trippin' on formaldehyde.
Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.
ALEX
He said Death has a design. Even
before he said that I had been
seeing patterns.
CLEAR
(sarcastic)
As in flannels and plaids?
Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.
ALEX
How many died on Flight 180?
From our group?
CLEAR
Thirty-nine.
ALEX
Remember the gate number?
As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...
CLEAR
No.
ALEX
Thirty-nine.
This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.
ALEX
Remember the departure time?
CLEAR
Like... 4:25.
Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.
PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
the halting red hand is lit.
ALEX (V.O.)
Do you know when I was born?
INTERSECTION
Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.
CLEAR
4:25.
ALEX
Right. April 25th.
CLEAR
Wait. I thought you meant the time
of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
in, month and day... that's a reach.
PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.
INTERSECTION
Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.
ALEX
My birthday is the same as of the
time I was meant to die! That's a
reach!?
VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.
CLEAR
You're sounding like those people
who, you know... "Oswald shot
Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in
a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in
a theatre and hid in a warehouse."
CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.
DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.
sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.
ALEX
I'm not just layin' down a bunch
of math here, with this. I'm talking
about indications... omens... that
day, that we were meant to die. That,
if, we have been aware of... would
have saved everyone on the plane.
CLEAR
That's total bullshit. You can find
death omens anywhere you want to.
She picks up her paper coffee cup.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a
"C" and ends with an "E." So does
the word "choke!" We're going to
choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was
a whaler. We're going to be
harpooned!
Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
You'll go nuts if you start with
that shit.
Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.
He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.
CLEAR
She's leaving the school. Moving
away.
Alex studies, appealing to her...
ALEX
Clear, how do we know that by
just sitting here, breathing this
air or sipping the coffee, having
crossed the street... we haven't
started in motion the events that
will lead to our death? Fifty years
from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
(beat)
You don't unless... you're able to
open yourself to the signs I'm
willing to show you.
He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.
CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND
slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...
... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.
DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.
CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR
She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.
CARTER'S CAR
CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.
ALEX AND CLEAR
Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...
CLEAR
I don't understand... did you see
Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?
ALEX
No, but it might as well be the
same thing. This was a message...
from someone, or something...
hinting... at the design.
CLEAR
Alex, on the plane... you must have
experienced... some kind of hyper
awareness. But here... you're
suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
our own... will happen because of...
an active Presence.
Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.
ALEX
The mortician said Death has a
design. Now... if you, me, Tod,
Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton
messed up that design, because, for
whatever reason, I was able to see
Death's plan... then we cheated it.
(beat)
But what if it was our time, what if
we were not meant to get off that
plane? What if it is still is our
time? If... It... is still not
finished with us? We will all still
die; now, not later.
Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Unless... we find the pattern. And
cheat it again.
Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.
CLEAR
After hearing you, just now... I do
believe...
Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...
CLEAR (CONT'D)
...that Tod killed himself.
Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.
ALEX
Then there's no one left who can help
me.
CARTER'S CAR
His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.
BILLY HITCHCOCK
rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...
BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR
barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.
WIDER
Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!
Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...
TERRY
Baby, come on... not now.
But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.
ALEX AND CLEAR
Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.
TERRY
Carter...
At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.
CARTER
Kind of have a reunion, here.
TERRY
Let it go!
Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...
CARTER
When are you moving?
MS. LEWTON
A couple of weeks.
She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...
CARTER
We're losing our favorite teacher.
ALEX
Look, there's something you should
all know.
CLEAR
Alex...
Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.
CARTER (CONT'D)
ALEX (CONT'D)
Lived here her whole life.
This'll be hard to believe.
Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.
CARTER (CONT'D)
ALEX (CONT'D)
And now she has to move.
Listen to me, we may all
All because of Browning.
be in danger...
TERRY
Shut up! The both of you!
The two boys stop their heated exchange.
TERRY (CONT'D)
They died! We lived!
(beat)
Get over it! I won't let that plane
crash be the most important thing in
my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and
if you're gonna waste your life
beating the shit out of Alex
everytime you see him, then you can
just drop fucking dead!
Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...
ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON
are SPLATTERED with BLOOD before they can even recoil.
CUT TO:
The figure is Alex Browning.
Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open...
Startled, Alex turns to find...
Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.
SCHRECK
What are you doing?
ALEX
is nervous but determined. He tells the truth...
ALEX
Checking the air in her tires to
make sure they're safe.
SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE
after a beat of incredulity...
SCHRECK
Get in the car.
Alex exits the police station, walking. He checks over his shoulder to see if he is being watched and increases his pace, legs whipping across FRAME...
CUT TO:
Alex walks quickly up the street. Smoke wafts before him. He turns to see a man burning leaves in the backyard.
The breeze intensifies, lifting the burning debris. The smoke swirls around him. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX as he senses the Presence. He looks ahead.
ALEX'S POV - TWO DOZEN LEAVES
mystically float past him, each on fire.
ALEX
senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint, passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky.
CUT TO:
Alex approaches the front of the house. From here, nothing appears to be wrong. As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house.
From INSIDE, a hoarse, macabre SCREAM! CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX, stunned, before he races off toward the house.
Alex runs with all his strength away from Valerie Lewton's home. Billy Hitchcock is riding his bicycle in Alex's direction. He stops and gets off his bike.
BILLY
Hey, Alex...
Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.
THE HOUSE
from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.
ALEX
even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.
CUT TO:
Tense, her eyes look left, then right...
CLEAR
I don't know where he is. He's not
talking to me.
WIDER
Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.
WEINE
Why?
She studies the men before averting her eyes.
CLEAR
Because I didn't believe him.
The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...
SCHRECK
If he should contact you, it
would be in the best interest
of your own safety to contact us.
Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card.
CUT TO:
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness. Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock ENTER FRAME, moving toward the monument. Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.
Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.
Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.
CLEAR
What are you doing?
CARTER
Terry's name should be on this wall.
Clear is touched by the action.
CARTER (CONT'D)
So, why'd you want us to meet you
here? Now?
CLEAR
They're watching me, see if I go to
Alex.
BILLY
Are you?
CLEAR
They'll follow my car.
(beat)
That's why you're taking me.
CARTER
Why would I want to see him?
Clear eyes the two of them. With the memorial standing behind them...
CLEAR
Because he knows which one of us
is next.
As Carter and Billy feel the chill of their inner fears...
CUT TO:
The muscle car ROARS onto U.S. 17 on ramp. A sign near the road indicates:
"Middletown - 25 mi. New York City - 105 mi."
A posted sign indicates "ACCIDENT SITE. ANY DEBRIS FOUND SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE NTSB (212)555-NTSB." CAMERA FINDS Carter's car pulling up to a stop. Clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while...
CLEAR
He could be anywhere from here to a
mile down the shore. You guys drive
down there, start this way and we'll
meet around the middle. It'll take
half the time.
Clear closes the door. Carter and Billy drive off. As she looks to the beach.
CUT TO:
CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.
The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.
Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.
ALEX'S POV - THE SKY
The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.
ALEX (O.S.)
Are they up there?
WIDER
Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Somehow... is 180 still in flight?
Somewhere... are they still safe?
Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
CLEAR
When I was a kid, like, six or
seven... I used to worry so much
about my parents dying. Like lying
awake at night... just worrying. I
loved them so much. I didn't want
them to get hurt. And what would
happen to me? What would life be
like?
(beat)
Every night... it seemed.
She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...
ALEX
Most kids do, I guess.
CLEAR
Most kids never have it happen.
Alex hangs his head...
CLEAR
When I was ten... my dad went into a
7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
somebody say "Don't turn around." So
on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was
jokin'... he did. And the guy blew
his head off.
She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...
CLEAR (CONT'D)
And, let me tell ya, I had every
reason to worry before... because
life became shit. I don't blame her,
I guess, but my mom couldn't deal
with it at all. She married this
asshole, who my mom with my real
dad would cross the street to avoid
this guy. He really didn't want a
kid. And so my mom didn't either
anymore, I guess.
(beat)
If that was the design for my
father... and my family... then fuck
Death, FUCK IT!
The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
And so, anyway... I've thought of
that "somewhere," Alex. It exists,
that place.
He looks at her.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
Where my dad is still safe. Where he
had a full pack of cigerettes and
kept driving. A place where me and
my dad and my mom... are still
together....and have no idea about
this second life, here.
(beat)
A place where our friends are still
in the sky... where everyone gets a
second chance.
She looks at him...
CLEAR (CONT'D)
But that place might only exist in
my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I
haven't experienced too many second
chances in my life. I haven't seen
any. But because of all of this, I
believe... because of you... I will
get a second chance. Because of me,
you will. With you in my life... that
place, right now existing in our
hearts, will spring out... and become
a real part of this life.
Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.
CLEAR
And that is the only way we can beat
Death... by making something special
out of Life.
His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...
They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.
ALEX
This won't be safe.
Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.
CLEAR
Those guys are probably fifteen
minutes away.
ALEX
No.. I mean, I don't have anything
on me. This won't be safe.
CLEAR
(sadly)
Nothing is... anymore.
Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.
CUT TO:
The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.
The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.
Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.
Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.
TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR
flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.
The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.
In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.
OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW
The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.
INSIDE THE CAR
CLEAR
Move it!
Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving.
ALEX
Billy, get out!
Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...
OUT OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW - BILLY'S POV
A locomotive headlight arcs across the trees... approaching.
RETURN
CLEAR
ALEX
Can't you open the door?!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Billy collects himself...
CLOSE - BILLY'S DOOR HANDLE
POPS open!
The train appears around the blind bend...
The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...
CLEAR
Carter, get out!
ALEX
BILLY
Don't do it! Don't do it!
It's coming! It's coming!
is moments away.
ALEX, CLEAR AND BILLY
assess the situation...
ALEX
CLEAR
Get out! Get out of the car!
Get out! Get out of the
Get out of the fuckin' car!
car!
Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened...
BILLY
Man, he really is next.
Alex takes off toward...
CARTER'S CAR
Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.
THE TRAIN
the WHISTLES SCREAMS!
CLEAR AND BILLY
tense, as the train nears...
ALEX AND CARTER
Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.
CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT
the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.
ALEX AND CARTER
As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...
ACROSS THE TRACKS
The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.
CLEAR AND BILLY
must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.
ALEX AND CARTER
Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...
TRAIN TRACKS
as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.
CLEAR AND BILLY
run to the two survivors.
CLEAR
runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.
ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY
Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.
CLEAR
Scared now?
Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.
CARTER
It broke!
BILLY
No one's that strong.
CLEAR
(to Carter)
Bullshit. He saved your life...again!
CLOSE - TRAIN WHEELS
continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal...
RETURN
The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation...
BILLY
THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE
NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM
YOU!
Billy begins backing away from the others.
CARTER
SHUT UP, BILLY!
CLEAR
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Billy continues backing away, horrified.
BILLY
I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM
HIM! HE'S NEXT!
CLOSE - TRAIN TRACKS
the debris rattles beneath the wheels...
CARTER AND ALEX
still on the ground...
CARTER
FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!
BILLY
backing away...
BILLY
YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE
DEAD!
TRAIN TRACKS
the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...
BILLY
BILLY (CONT'D)
AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!
FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his
shoulders.
ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER
The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.
EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS
The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.
CARTER
Jesus fucking Christ!
For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.
ALEX
(to Carter)
You should have been next. After
Lewton, you should've been next.
That's the only pattern. You should
be dead.
CARTER
You're the fuckin' devil.
ALEX
(to Clear)
But I saved him. I intervened. Just
like the plane. That's the design.
CLEAR
Police are coming.
ALEX
That's why It skipped Carter and
went to the next one in the path
of the explosion; Billy.
Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.
ALEX (CONT'D)
My intervention in the death of 180
surviviors will cheat the design.
CARTER
"Intervention?" What are you, God
now?!
ALEX
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to
die! Gods don't die! We do!
CLEAR
You're losin' it. The police will be
here. We have to go to the cabin.
You can hide there. Get your head
together.
Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...
ALEX
After Billy... it's me. And then you.
Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.
ALEX (CONT'D)
(to Clear)
Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.
Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...
CARTER
Then, get out of here.
As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.
In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.
CUT TO:
The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...
The unmarked F.B.I. sedan maintains surveillance. Schreck and Weine sit inside.
The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.
ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips
unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.
An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.
The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.
Sharp metal edges spin. Glinting blue arc light...
CUT TO:
Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.
Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.
WIDER
the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.
CUT TO:
The backdoor opens. Clear charges out into the backyard.
THE DOG
Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.
CLEAR
continues to run...
THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE
is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.
CLEAR
the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.
THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME
is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...
ABOVE GROUND POOL
the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.
CLEAR
reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.
THE POWER LINES
whipping, strike one another causing an angry FLASH!
THE RIVETS
holding the pool frame begin to BREAK and POP. Water floods into the yard.
CUT TO:
CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.
Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...
GULLY
He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...
ALEX
stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.
CUT TO:
water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...
A POWER LINE
coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!
TREE
Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.
CLEAR
Run!
The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...
THE POWER LINE
whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...
CLEAR
in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...
CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG
convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.
CUT TO:
Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.
ALEX
races along the path of the stream.
SHERIFFS
continue their pursuit through the dark trees.
ABOVE
Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.
SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.
ALEX
The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.
CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.
As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.
WIENE'S POV - FOREST
the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.
ALEX
struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...
WEINE AND SHERIFFS
believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.
CUT TO:
Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch. Lighting and THUNDER CONTINUE amongst the ARCING, CRACKLING POWER LINES. She searches for an escape.
CLEAR'S POV - THE TREE BRANCH
extends toward the house.
CLEAR
straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch...
CUT TO:
dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.
With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.
He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.
CUT TO:
Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.
CUT TO:
Weine RUNS INTO FRAME, looks around, frustrated...
WEINE
(into radio)
Lost him.
ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - SCHRECK
deperately scans the area.
SCHRECK
From the direction... there's only
one place he can heading...
CUT TO:
The power lines strike the rooftop.
Alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards Clear's house. Blue ARC light glowing from the front yard.
CUT TO:
The power lines WHACK angerily against the door.
Alex reaches the backyard. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation. HE RUNS OUT OF FRAME...
BAM! In reverse, the Corolla SMASHES through the garage door.
THE METAL ARM
of the garage door opener RIPS through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor.
thick cable ARCS, snapping toward the car INTO FRAME.
The Corolla lurches backward, freed from the grasp of the house.
As the Corolla lurches away from the house down the sloped driveway...
THE POWER LINE
THUDS upon Clear's car.
From the rear of the house appears Alex. CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON HIM as he reacts to the situation...
ALEX
Don't move!
WIDER
The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile. The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, SPARKING, CRACKLING, as it hits the ground.
Alex extends his hands. O.S., CARS approach THUNDEROULSY...
ALEX
You're grounded in the car. Don't
touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
IN THE STREET
The unmarked F.B.I. vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street. Schreck and Weine hustle out of the car.
WEINE
Alex, get away from there!
SCHRECK
Any part of that line touches you,
you're dead.
THE POWER LINE
SNAPS in ALEX'S DIRECTION.
ALEX
lurches back...
THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE
is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.
ALEX
backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.
CLEAR
keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...
ALEX
reacts, shocked. He realizes...
WIDER
the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.
SCHRECK AND WEINE
step forward...
THE POWER LINE
atop the car, whips, ARCS, warning everyone away.
IN THE COROLLA
Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.
CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL
The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.
ALEX
steps closer...
ALEX
NO!
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car...
SCHRECK AND WEINE
WEINE
Get back! You'll both die!
ALEX AND CLEAR
hearing this, Alex's mind is made up. He looks to Clear.
ALEX
You know what to do.
CLEAR
No! No! Don't!
ALEX
When I do this.. it'll have skipped
you... and it'll all be over.
At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...
ALEX
You know what to do. I'll always be
with you.
He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.
COROLLA
Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.
ALEX
is engulfed in the flames.
ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS
the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay...
ALEX
through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image...
ALEX
NO!
He looks toward...
CLEAR - ALEX'S POV
She... is the last sight he'll ever see.
WIDER
The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.
CLEAR
Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.
SCHRECK
Is he alive?
CLEAR'S EYES
flash open, horrified, answering the question...
THE SKY
a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.
SCHRECK AND WEINE
CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.
CLEAR - OVERHEAD
As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone.
CUT TO:
"ALEX BROWNING" is marked in the granite. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the name has been added to the memorial, along with Tod Waggner, Valerie Lewton, Terry Chaney and William Hitchcock.
A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.
Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.
CARTER
Alex was right.
Clear looks up.
CARTER (CONT'D)
It did skip us.
Clear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...
CLEAR
I believe... that's what Alex
believed. But how do we know... this
wasn't the design all along?
Clear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... "FLIGHT 180."
CAMERA HOLDS as "Long May You Run" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.
FADE OUT.
