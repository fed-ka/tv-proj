We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward
a tree-lined street.
LESTER (V.O.)
My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
neighborhood. This is my street. This...
is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In
less than a year, I'll be dead.
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand
with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.
CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools.
Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
peeping out through the drapes.
LESTER (V.O.)
That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
handle on those pruning shears matches
her gardening clogs? That's not an
accident.
In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS
repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises
the barking dog.
JIM #1
Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?
LESTER (V.O.)
That's our next-door neighbor Jim.
A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the
house.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And that's his lover, Jim.
JIM #2
(re: barking dog)
What in the world is wrong with her? She
had a walk this morning.
JIM #1
And a jerky treat.
JIM #2
You spoil her.
(sternly)
Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.
Lester watches all this from the window.
CAROLYN
Good morning, Jim!
Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.
JIM #1
Morning, Carolyn.
CAROLYN
(overly friendly)
I just love your tie! That color!
JIM #1
I just love your roses. How do you get
them to flourish like this?
CAROLYN
Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
Miracle Grow.
Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
watching them.
LESTER (V.O.)
Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She wasn't always like this. She used to
be happy. We used to be happy.

Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
HORN again.
Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her
shoulder.
CAROLYN
Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
unattractive?
JANE
Yes.
CAROLYN
Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
admirably.
Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,
carrying a BRIEFCASE.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Lester, could you make me a little later,
please? Because I'm not quite late
enough.
Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill
all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather
everything.
JANE
Nice going, Dad.
Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
LESTER (V.O.)
Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
gigantic loser, and... they're right.
A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next
door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the
house.
The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn
drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.
CAROLYN
--there is no decision, you just write
the damn thing!
LESTER
You don't think it's weird and kinda
fascist?
CAROLYN
Possibly. But you don't want to be
unemployed.
LESTER
Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls
and work for Satan, because it's more
convenient that way.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
CAROLYN
Could you be just a little bit more
dramatic, please, huh?
As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS
next door.
CAROLYN (CONT'D)
So we've finally got new neighbors. You
know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them, instead of--
(heavy disdain)
--"The Real Estate King," that house
would never have sat on the market for
six months.
She heads into the house, followed by Lester.
LESTER
Well, they were still mad at you for
cutting down their sycamore.
CAROLYN
Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
portion of the root structure was on our
property. You know that. How can you call
it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
heart to just cut down something if it
wasn't partially mine, which of course it
was.
On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester
and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying,
but it's obvious it's not going well.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW
HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester
calling after her.
CLOSE on the face of
RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen
of his DIGICAM as he
videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his
eyes are much older.
Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks
something wounded...
and dangerous.
His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester
at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His
head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes
he's being watched.
CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:
OPEN HOUSE TODAY
BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham
The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a
run-down
neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the
house.
Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading
a box of
cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the
Mercedes
when something across the street catches her eye.
Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb
appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome
silver-haired MAN. It reads:
Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane
The Real Estate King 555-0100
Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.
12.
The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the
smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.
CAROLYN
Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!
13.
Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish WOMEN.
CAROLYN
You know, you could have some really fun
backyard get-togethers out here.
WOMAN #1
The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like."
There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it.
Except for maybe the bugs.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
WOMAN #2
There's not even any plants out here.
CAROLYN
(re: shrub)
What do you call this? Is this not a
plant? If you have a problem with the
plants, I can always call my landscape
architect. Solved.
WOMAN #2
I mean, I think "lagoon," I think
waterfall, I think tropical. This is a
cement hole.
A beat.
CAROLYN
I have some tiki torches in the garage.
The game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym.
JANE
Oh shit, they're still here.
Her POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking
lot.
LESTER
Janie!
CAROLYN
Hi! I really enjoyed that!
She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by
Angela.
LESTER
Congratulations, honey, you were great.
JANE
I didn't win anything.
LESTER
(to Angela)
Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad.
ANGELA
Oh. Hi.
An awkward beat.
JANE
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.
LESTER
Okay, good to meet you. You were also
good tonight. Very... precise.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
ANGELA
(warming)
Thanks.
CAROLYN
(to Angela)
Nice to meet you, Angela.
(to Jane)
Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you
very closely, and you didn't screw up
once.
(then, to Lester)
Okay, we have to go.
She starts toward the parking lot. Lester stays behind.
LESTER
So, what are you girls doing now?
JANE
Dad.
ANGELA
We're going out for pizza.
LESTER
Oh really, do you need a ride? We can
give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna
come with us?
ANGELA
Thanks... but I have a car.
LESTER
Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great!
That's great, because Janie's thinking
about getting a car soon too, aren't you,
honey?
JANE
(you freak)
Dad. Mom's waiting for you.
LESTER
Well, it was very nice meeting you,
Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a
friend of mine.
Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him. He is
mesmerized; grateful, even.
LESTER (CONT'D)
Well... I'll be seeing you around then.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED: (2)
Lester waves awkwardly as he crosses off.
JANE
Could he be any more pathetic?
ANGELA
I think it's sweet. And I think he and
your mother have not had sex in a long
time.
A WHITE BMW 328si CONVERTIBLE is parked on the street outside
the Burnham's house. We HEAR girlish LAUGHTER from inside.
On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves
as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the
driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence.
Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where
the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is
shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals
Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a
BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely
around his neck.
Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.
JANE
Asshole.
He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and
starts to videotape her.
His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and
walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.
21.
CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page
and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.
Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.
We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs
Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his
ear, nervous.
ANGELA
(over phone line)
Hello? Hello?
Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is
turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits
quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from
the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her
wet hair. She picks up the PHONE.
JANE
Hello?
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane
picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the
phone, but we can't hear her.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
(sing song)
Rick-y! Break-fast!
Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.
ANGELA
I'm serious, he just pulled down his
pants and yanked it out. You know, like,
say hello to Mr. Happy.
TEENAGE GIRL #1
Gross.
ANGELA
It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
TEENAGE GIRL #1
So, did you do it with him?
ANGELA
Of course I did. He is a really well-
known photographer? He shoots for Elle on
like, a regular basis? It would have been
so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
26.
TEENAGE GIRL #2
You are a total prostitute.
ANGELA
Hey. That's how things really are. You
just don't know, because you're this
pampered little suburban chick.
TEENAGE GIRL #2
So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you
looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy
Turlington.
The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.
ANGELA
(calling off)
Cunt!
(then)
I am so sick of people taking their
insecurities out on me.
The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.
JANE
Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed
me last night.
ANGELA
Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.
JANE
You know him?
ANGELA
Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade, and he would
always say the most random, weird things,
and then one day, he was just like, gone.
And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his
parents had to put him in a mental
institution.
JANE
Why? What did he do?
ANGELA
What do you mean?
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
JANE
Well, they can't put you away just for
saying weird things.
Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.
ANGELA
You total slut. You've got a crush on
him.
JANE
What? Please.
ANGELA
You were defending him! You love him. You
want to have like, ten thousand of his
babies.
JANE
Shut up.
Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.
RICKY
Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next
door to you.
JANE
I know. I kinda remember this really
creepy incident when you were filming me
last night?
RICKY
I didn't mean to scare you. I just think
you're interesting.
Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.
JANE
Thanks, but I really don't need to have
some psycho obsessing about me right now.
RICKY
I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.
He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is
unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.
ANGELA
What a freak. And why does he dress like
a Bible salesman?
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED: (2)
JANE
He's like, so confident. That can't be
real.
ANGELA
I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't
even like, look at me once.
Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service
We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear,
looking down at us. Jane joins her and is immediately
unnerved by:
Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word "JANE" is
spelled out in FIRE.
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane
tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,
even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not
interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,
who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up
MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her
computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and
she's gone.
39.
Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's
GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging
through shelves against the back wall.
Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through a WINDOW on the side of the
Burnham's garage, we see Lester step out of his pants and
briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the
dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in
the window as he does.
We're FLYING high above the neighborhood. Below us we see the
two Jims, jogging. We APPROACH them steadily.
LESTER
It's a great thing when you realize you
still have the ability to surprise
yourself. Makes you wonder what else you
can do that you've forgotten about.
We're now at street level, FOLLOWING the two Jims.
LESTER
Hey! You guys!
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as
Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair
of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches
up, then the three men run together in the early morning
light.

JIM #2
Lester, I didn't know you ran.
LESTER
(panting)
Well, I just started.
JIM #1
Good for you.
LESTER
I figured you guys might be able to give
me some pointers. I need to shape up.
Fast.
JIM #1
Well, are you just looking to lose
weight, or do you want have increased
strength and flexibility as well?
LESTER
I want to look good naked.
The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub
the bumper, when something Catches his eye:
His POV: Lester and the Jims jog down the street.
The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the
house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.
COLONEL
What is this, the fucking gay pride
parade?
Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and
the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and
bends over, panting.
LESTER
Hey! Yo! Ricky!
(re: the Jims)
My entire life is passing before my eyes,
and those two have barely broken a sweat.
He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.
LESTER (CONT'D)
Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next
door. We haven't met.

45.

COLONEL
(shakes)
COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
LESTER
Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. The Colonel
doesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat.
LESTER (CONT'D)
So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the,
uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked
about...
RICKY
(quickly)
Re-Animator.
LESTER
Yeah!
RICKY
You want to borrow it?
(before Lester can answer)
Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.
He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then
follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.
Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the
GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.
Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through
the window.
Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new
WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.
Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the
ground at his feet.
On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing.
ANGELA (O.C.)
What are you doing?
On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela
staring at us.
RICKY (O.C.)
I was filming this dead bird.
ANGELA
Why?
RICKY (O.C.)
Because it's beautiful.
On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh.
ANGELA
I think maybe you forgot your medication
today, mental boy.
On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane.
RICKY (O.C.)
Hi, Jane.
JANE

Look. I want you to stop filming me.
Ricky lowers the Digicam.

This is boring. Let's go.
JANE
(to Ricky)
Do you need a ride?
ANGELA
(to Jane)
Are you crazy? I don't want to end up
hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.
RICKY
It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.
ANGELA
Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway.
C'mon, let's go.
Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow. Ricky smiles at
her. She almost smiles back, then:
JANE
(calls off to Angela)
I think I'm going to walk, too.
Angela stops and stares at her.
ANGELA
What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.
Carolyn's Mercedes is parked next to a JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE
with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads "R E KING."
Lester's TOYOTA CAMRY cruises through the streets. We hear
Lester SINGING along to "AMERICAN WOMAN" on the STEREO.
Lester continues singing along to "AMERICAN WOMAN," as the
Camry pulls into the parking lot of a FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.
Lester pulls up to the drive-thru speaker box.
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)

NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS
COUNTER GIRL
Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
LESTER
No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out
an application.
She stares at him, confused by his age and attire.
COUNTER GIRL
There's not jobs for manager, it's just
for counter.
LESTER
Good. I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.
Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems
comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat:
JANE
So how do you like your new house?

RICKY
I like it.

JANE
The people who used to live there fed

An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass
them slowly.
RICKY
Have you ever known anybody who died?
JANE
No.

Have you?
RICKY
No, but I did see this homeless woman who
froze to death once. Just laying there on
the sidewalk. She looked really sad.
They watch the FUNERAL CARS pass.
RICKY (CONT'D)
I got that homeless woman on video.
JANE
Why would you film that?
RICKY
Because it was amazing.
JANE
What was amazing about it?

LESTER
Remember those posters that said, "Today

life?" Well, that's true of every day
except one.

The day you die.
We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester,
wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front
door and dashes up the driveway.
We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He
carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC
as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,
reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.
74.
Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who
watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.
His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an
insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat

emerges from the house in his sweatpants.
LESTER
Yo, Ricky. How's it going?
RICKY
Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.
Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call
me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.

LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes
before going inside the house.
CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.
The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn
drives; Buddy sits beside her.
CAROLYN
I think we deserve a little junk food,

BUDDY

I'm flattered.
They are too involved with each other to notice Lester

Whoa. You are so busted.
CAROLYN

You know, this really doesn't concern

LESTER
Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru

(to Carolyn, quietly)
So. This makes sense.
CAROLYN

Oh, Lester--
LESTER
Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy.

The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips
garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in
next to Buddy's Jaguar.
Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the
parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.
The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom
window, and then he pulls the drapes shut.
The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 is parked in the breakdown lane, its
HAZARD LIGHTS BLINKING. Cars ZOOM past in the rain.
We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW
through the RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing
only his sweatpants, performing bench presses.
His POV: Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights
and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. He runs his free hand
over his chest... and then he glances at us, suddenly aware
he's being watched.
The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp
CLAP of THUNDER. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it

Carolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the
bone, clutching her PURSE tightly. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.
In BLACK & WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of
a suburban home. The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield
FLASHES BRILLIANTLY.

99.

And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's
brand new Firebird...
In BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE,
dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit
SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.
LESTER (V.O.)
And Janie...
IN BLACK & WHITE:
A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those
SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists
the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster.
LESTER (V.O.)
(with love)
And... Carolyn.
100.
On VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier,
of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind
carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...
LESTER (V.O.)
I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me... but it's
hard to stay mad, when there's so much
beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel
like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's
too much, my heart fills up like a
balloon that's about to burst...
We're FLYING once again over Robin Hood Trail, ASCENDING
SLOWLY.
LESTER (V.O.)
...and then I remember to relax, and stop
trying to hold on to it, and then it
flows through me like rain and I can't
feel anything but gratitude for every
single moment of my stupid little life...
(amused)
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
I'm sure. But don't worry...
FADE TO BLACK.
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You will someday.
