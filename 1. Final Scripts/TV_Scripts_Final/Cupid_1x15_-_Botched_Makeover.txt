  FADE IN:

  INT. SINGLES SESSION ROOM - NIGHT11

  The GROUP listens attentively while TOM CAIGHNE, gorgeous in 
  a former Phi Delt rush captain sort of way, speaks.  
  PRISCILLA and other female group members are getting a little 
  misty.  The guys listen to this with a bit more skepticism.

                              TOM
                ... She was always saying how she wanted 
                a yellow lab puppy.  She even had a name 
                picked out -- Barnaby.  And I thought, 
                you know, what a great three-months-of-
                dating gift.  So I show up to her house.  
                  I knock...
                      (beat, this is difficult)
                ... and her ex-boyfriend answers in a 
                towel.

  Priscilla shakes her head:  that evil bitch.   CLAIRE S 
    expression tells us she may not be buying this.

                              TOM
                It was just so... post-sex.  You know?
                      (he pauses dramatically)
                  Barnaby s seventy pounds now, and I know 
                my apartment isn t a great place for him.
                But what can I do?  I love the guy.
                      (shrugs)
                I guess I m just afraid to get back out 
                there... afraid of getting hurt.

  Sympathetic female faces.  Except for previously unknown 
  group member DAPHNE.  She s pissed.

                                DAPHNE
                I m sorry, but I can t take this anymore.  
                That is the biggest, heaviest, densest 
                load of crap I have ever heard.

  Audible GASPS from the group.  TREVOR S eyes flicker.

                                CLAIRE
                Uh, Daphne, we ve talked about 
                   respectful listening...

                                DAPHNE
                  I listened respectfully when he told me 
                he couldn t wait for me to meet his 
                parents.  We saw each other every night 
                for a week.  After I slept with him, I 
                never heard from him again.

                              TOM
                      (as if this makes it all right)
                I just didn t feel a connection.  I kind 
                of thought we were on the same page about 
                that.
                        ( admitting  his mistake)
                We probably should ve talked --

  Daphne looks like she s about to blow a gasket.  Claire tries 
  to interject, but a shy woman, VELMA, speaks up.

                              VELMA
                He made me a treasure map leading to two 
                tickets to  La Boheme.   He said I was 
                his destiny.  The next morning, I woke up 
                alone.

                              TOM
                      (hates to bring this up, but&)
                If you hadn t snored --

                              VELMA
                Snored!?

  Reactions from the group:  this is getting interesting. 
  Trevor s reaction is enigmatic.  A new voice --

                              VERONICA
                He told me he was looking for commitment.  
                Lucky I noticed in time that his video 
                tapes were labeled  Gina, August 15  and 
                   Sabrina, October 31... 

  Tom s reaction says he can t believe this is happening to 
  him.

                              LAURENCE
                      (to Mike, incredulous)
                The man got himself a witch on Halloween.

                              VERONICA
                Oh yeah...  And I didn t see any seventy 
                pound dog.

  Tom starts to protest his innocence; Claire s heard enough.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)  "Botched Makeover"    #114     Revised (pink)    1/15/99    3.

                                CLAIRE
                Tom, it s pretty clear what s going on 
                here.  You have some real issues with 
                women that I think we could work on in a 
                private session.  In the meantime, your 
                presence here is a distraction.  I m 
                afraid I have to ask you to leave. 

  Tom scans the room.  Decides there s no option, but he s 
    resentful, as if he genuinely doesn t think he should be 
  asked to leave.

                              TOM
                      (never in a million years)
                I ll call in and book that appointment 
                right away, Dr. Allen.
                      (to the group)
                It s been real.

  Tom heads toward the door.  Trevor puts his arm around him.  
  Claire gives them a quizzical look.  WE HEAR Claire s first 
  couple of lines to the group as Trevor and Tom EXIT.

                                CLAIRE
                We ve talked before about the dangers of 
                dating members within the group.  I 
                really suggest a lengthy getting-to-know-
                you period if you decide to --

  INT. SESSIONS ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS22

  Trevor escorts Tom out.  Claire s voice fades.

                                TREVOR
                So she threw you out.  That s cold, my 
                  friend...

                              TOM
                Yeah, that is one frigid --

                                TREVOR
                      (loaded with irony)
                Yeah, what was she thinking -- you being 
                such a swell guy and all.

  Tom clues in.  Trevor is NOT commiserating.  Trevor s pissed.

                              TOM
                Weren t you the guy who rushed to the 
                defense of nude twister last week?*

                Hey, Don Juan.  Pay attention.

  Tom does as he s told.

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                My problem isn t with the sex.  My 
                problem is that you re not a very nice 
                guy.  And guys like you just make my 
                mission harder.

  Tom sneers and tries to walk away.  Trevor grabs him by the *
  arm and pulls him back.*

                                TREVOR (cont'd)*
                Consider yourself lucky that an assault *
                  conviction would probably land me back in 
                an asylum.

  Tom wants to laugh that off.  In fact, he may even get the 
  first notes of a chuckle out, but Trevor s dead serious 
    expression cuts it off.  Suddenly, Tom s not so sure Trevor 
  is exaggerating.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

  EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY (THE ONE NEXT TO THE STUDIO)33

  GUNSHOTS.  Then tight on a wounded western-dressed, though 
    thoroughly modern, sexy and masculine police detective, 
  SUNSET.  He pants as BULLETS RIDDLE the side of the building 
  around him.

                              CHAMP (O.S.)
                Brother, you are in some serious jelly 
                this time.

  Sunset turns.  His expression registers shock, then fear.

                                SUNSET
                Cohen?

  CHAMP emerges from a cloud of black smoke, an apparition on 
  the mean streets of Chicago, immune to the flying bullets.

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                Prior to my untimely demise, your hands 
                didn t shake.

                Cohen?  But you re dead.  Your wife got 
                the folded flag,  cuz I didn t cover your 
                back. 

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                I m wearing the chalk outline  cuz some 
                skell carved out my heart.  No blemish on 
                your conscience.

                                SUNSET
                      (hopefully)
                On the line?

  The fog machine kicks into overdrive and rookie detective 
  Cohen begins to fade into the urban landscape.

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                I m tellin  it straight.  Just get that 
                junkie who ended me.  Make  em pay,

  Sunset, now determined, grits his teeth, counts to three to 
  himself, then darts from behind the cover of the building, 
  firing away like Butch or Sundance.

  Trevor follows Champ into the offices.

  INT. SUNSET & VAUGHN WRITERS  ROOM - DAY44

  The writing staff of  Sunset and Vaughn.   Attractive and 
  overtly sexy KIM BRABER, JOSH BAERWALD, cute in a nebbish 
  sort of way, and two anonymous male writers toss ideas around 
  a table.  Frumpy, dowdy, orthopedic shoe-wearing writer s 
  assistant KRISTY HOLBROOK hands out the writers  Chinese food 
  lunches.  Kristy is effectively invisible to the men in the 
  room.  Kim, on the other hand, inspires lust.  Roger enters, 
  harried.

                Not bad, I m not quite sure I buy it.  
                Here s what I want:  everybody go back 
                and write the scene.  At the end of the 
                week, we shoot the best one.

  Writers begin to rise.

                And Josh.  Make it good this time.

  Josh sighs.  He s clearly not having a banner season.

                              ROGER
                Good work, Kristy.

  Kim s none too happy to see Kristy getting attention.

                Oh, Kristy, could you take my dogs out 
                for a walk?  You know where I keep the 
                plastic bags...

  Kristy nods.  She s been put in her place.

  INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY - CONTINUOUS55

  Kim, holding leashes, catches up to Kristy.  A FLOWER 
  DELIVERY BOY approaches.  WE STAY on the back of his head.

                              KIM
                At least ten minutes of fetch this 
                time...

  Kristy signs for the daisies.  Kim peers slyly over the 
    clipboard.

                              KIM 
                From your  cousin  again?

                No -- no, I ordered them.  For my desk...

                      (stage whisper)
                You should really pick them up at the 
                shop next time.  Otherwise people might 
                think it s a little... desperate.

  She smiles like she s just told Kristy soda works on stains.

                              KIM (cont d)
                I don t mean to embarrass you, I just 
                don t want the others to think you re 
                  pretending to have a boyfriend. 

  Kim walks off.  Kristy looks at the flowers sadly.  PULL BACK 
  to REVEAL Trevor.  He s heard the whole conversation.

                                TREVOR
                I send myself flowers all the time.  
                Makes me feel pretty.

  Kristy s too close to losing it to care who she s talking to.

                                KRISTY
                I just thought maybe they d cheer me up.

                Trevor, I told you to wait for me by the 
                  reception desk.

  Champ can t believe Trevor just said that.

  But Champ s got Trevor out the door before he can finish.

  INT. SUNSET & VAUGHN RECEPTION - DAY - CONTINUOUS66

  As Champ attempts to lead Trevor out of the building, we 
  discover the vilest bunch of character actors ever assembled.  
  WE SEE pages marked  Lousy Perp Scene  hanging from the wall.

                                TREVOR
                What s this?

                For what?  Sleazebags?

  A few of the actors look up, only mildly offended.

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                I could be a sleazebag.

                              CHAMP
                Could be?

  Trevor takes a copy of the sides and approaches a brutish 
  looking actor nearby.

                                TREVOR
                Wanna run lines?

  Champ grabs him by the arm.

                That s right.  Rough me up, it ll be more

  REVEAL ROGER, KIM & JOSH

  observing Trevor from behind a desk.  Kim starts to speak, 
  but Trevor cuts her off with a bit of improvisation.  (No 
  singing.)

                                TREVOR (LOUSY PERP)
                Who can take a bent spoon?  Hold it to 
                the flame? Enrique can.  Enrique can... 
                that s who.

  They are agog.  Kim blinks, remembers that she s reading with 
  him.  She reads the part of Enrique with a complete lack of 
    intonation -- an actor s worst nightmare.

                              KIM

  The flatness of Kim s reading throws Trevor for a moment, but 
  he recovers in style.

                I m just not sure my opinion should 
                really count.  I mean, the reason I m 
                here, I guess, is because I never go out.

  Claire handles this in stride, the complete pro.

                                CLAIRE
                Meeting people these days is tough, 
                Kristy.  When you re ready to get out *
                there, we can work on interpersonal skill *
                  generation, dating process sensitization, *
                and risk-taking capacity augmentation -- *

  Trevor cocks his head, his attention focused on Kristy s 
  frumpiness.  Kristy looks like Adrian in the first Rocky.

                                TREVOR
                I say we get you a make-over.

  Lots of murmuring from the group.  Claire shoots a  prepare 
  to die  look at Trevor, who appears pretty self-satisfied. 
  (Go figure.) Our regulars know it s time to duck and cover.

                              MIKE
                Look out.

  EXT. SESSIONS BUILDING - NIGHT1313

  Members of the group spill out.

  PULL BACK to REVEAL Tom, his pal, flask-chugging MATT and two 
  other cronies.  Unseen, they watch the group members exit. 

                              TOM
                      (spotting Kristy)
                There.  That one s new.  She ll be next.

                              MATT
                She should only count as a half.

                It was a bet, not a beauty pageant.

  INT. TAGGERTY S - NIGHT1414

  Claire follows Trevor into Taggerty s, carrying on a battle 
  we know started at group.  Champ tends bar.

                                CLAIRE
                Trevor, from now on, can ya wait  til the 
                second meeting to torture new members?

                                TREVOR
                What s so wrong with wanting to get a 
                girl a date?

                                CLAIRE
                Nothing.  Telling her she s too 
                  unattractive to find one, on the other 
                hand --

                                TREVOR
                      (weary of this conversation)
                That s not what I said, and relax -- she 
                declined the make-over.

  Trevor walks around the bar, puts on an apron, joins Champ.

                                CLAIRE
                She said she didn t think it would do her 
                any good.  It nearly broke my heart.  Did 
                you see the way it took the wind out of 
                the group s sails? 

                                TREVOR
                Now that you can t blame on me.  That was 
                all you.

                                CLAIRE
                Me, how?

                                TREVOR
                Telling  em they have to set their dating 
                 way back  machine fifty years.

                                CLAIRE
                Now that would be a field trip I wish I 
                could take them on.  They d learn so 
                much.

                It s a swing club.

                People dancing cheek to cheek.  Strangers

  Trevor does a wooden square dancing move, planting his feet 
  as if there were cut-out shoe soles taped to the floor.  This 
  is not sexy.

  Claire and Champ exchange a look.  Yes, they re cocky.

  INT. SINGLES SESSION ROOM - NIGHT1515

  Claire and Champ complete an impressive swing move.  The 
  group is impressed.  Trevor s dumbfounded expression tells us 
  he never would ve guessed that Claire was this good.

                                CLAIRE
                And that s called a  Sugar Push.

                All right.  Your turn.  Everyone partner

  Everyone begins to do just that.  Trevor looks around.  He 
  desperately needs a good partner.

                Mostly it s the breasts and guns and

                and the fact that we show Sunset s naked

  INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY1818

  Kristy arrives and finds a wonderful bouquet of roses.  
  Kristy glances around, suspicious.  She finds a card:   From 
  your secret admirer.  Call me.   There s a phone number.  Kim 
  walks by.

  Kristy starts to object, but Kim has already walked off.  
  Kristy reaches for the phone.  Stops.  Reaches again.  Stops 
  herself again.  Reaches again.  Dials six numbers.  Hangs up.  
  Begins to reach for the phone again.

                      (beat, repeating his question)
                How will you recognize me?

  Kristy looks at her reflection in the office window and 
  winces.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Kim, down the 
  hall, making a point, very flirtatiously with Roger, who 
  appears to be acquiescing, won over by her feminine charms.

                Maybe men will be attracted to her

                Let me put this in terms you can 
                  understand.  You find people their true 
                love, you get a match, a bead, a step 
                closer to home.

                Not to mention a tremendous feeling of

                                CLAIRE
                This method is more likely to get Kristy 
                hurt than get you a bead.

                You know, back in Atlanta, this sort of 
                thing just wasn t done.

                        (misinterpreting)
                Well maybe it s time Atlanta entered the 
                  twentieth century.  Maybe, for once, 
                Dixie shouldn t look away.  Maybe the 
                taboos of our fathers shouldn t be --

                I meant swing dancing.

  Off of Laurence s silent embarrassment.  Claire approaches 
  Trevor who watches Kristy dance with Mike.

                Your dancing s really coming along,

                This is swing.  Where you re still sort

  A serious look crosses Claire s face.

                You know?  There is something I want.

                All right, but don t be offended if I ask 
                you to wear a bag over your head.  
                Nothing personal.  File it under 
                   fetish.

                this move worked out where I swing you by 
                one arm -- all four limbs off the 
                  ground... high degree of difficulty.  
                It s a favorite with the Romanian judges.

                      (Off Trevor s questioning look)
                  I have... a date.

  Trevor and Claire share a look.  They both believe this 
  proves their point.

  INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT2323

  Kristy arrives for her date, sees Tom standing there and is 
  bowled over by his godlike mien.  She works up her nerve.

                                KRISTY
                      (shy)

                Hi.

  Kristy waits for him to say more but he doesn t.  Confused, 
  she tries again.

                                KRISTY
                Do you want to sit down?

                              TOM

  Tom is now totally befuddled.

                Kristy, God... you look so different 
                than... than...

  Tom thinks he s screwed.  Kristy bails him out.

                Than the picture in the magazine.  I... 
                cut my hair.

  A maitre d  approaches to lead them to their table.  Tom 
  follows Kristy, still awed by her new look.

  Kristy nods, her quietly delighted expression telling us it

  face.  He ll have no problem winning this bet.  It really is

  INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY2525

  Kristy works quietly at her desk trying not to pay attention 
  to the two anonymous writers across the room who are 
    ostensibly loitering at the coffee machine, but are clearly 
  just there to check out her new look.  Roger comes motoring 
  through the room.  He catches a glimpse of Kristy out of the 
  corner of his eye.  His DOUBLE-TAKE isn t even discreet.  He 
  doesn t quite crash into a wall, but he nearly does.  Josh 
    approaches Kristy s desk.

                              JOSH
                Wow.  You look great.  Ready to get to

  Kristy and Josh sit at the conference table.  The *
    brainstorming is fast and furious.

                Okay, he s stashed the knife on his body -

                We think they haven t found it -- which 
                they haven t -- but when they press him 
                he slips and --

                      (playing it safe)
                That s cool.  Short notice.

  Josh glances at Kristy, now jotting notes, if he was asking 
  her out -- and he was -- she didn t notice or didn t care. 

  INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY2727

  Kim needs something.  She approaches Kristy s desk.

                              KIM
                Kristy, have you picked up my...

  But Kristy s not at her desk.  Kim notices the flowers at 
  Kristy s desk.  She rolls her eyes.

  INT. SUNSET & VAUGHN WRITERS  ROOM - DAY2828

  Kim s voice buzzes in, interrupting Josh and Kristy s 
  friendly brainstorming.

                              KIM (O.S.)
                Hello... Kristy?  Do I still have an 
                  assistant...?

  Kristy gives Josh a worried look, scurries back to her desk.

  INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY - CONTINUOUS2929

  As Kristy gets back to her desk, she sees Kim looking at the 
  card that goes with the flowers.  Kim reads without looking 
  up.

                Hey, Kristy.  Now an okay time for lunch?

  Kristy looks up.  REVEAL Tom in all his gorgeousness.  Kim s 
  jaw drops.  Then she looks at Kristy for the first time.  
  This is almost too much for her to absorb.

  INT. SUNSET & VAUGHN RECEPTION - DAY - CONTINUOUS3030

  Trevor enters carrying a jambox.  WE SEE him from behind the 
  sullen, engrossed-in-her-crossword-puzzle receptionist.

                I need to talk to the writers.  I have

  The receptionist nods.  Trevor walks back down the hall but 
  is faced with a number of doors.  He hesitates, chooses one.  

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE WRITERS  OFFICES - DAY - CONTINUOUS3131

    Ad-libbing small talk, Tom helps Kristy on with her jacket as 
  they head down the hall.  Tom slips into the bathroom while 
  Kristy, responding to a summons, slips into an office.

  Trevor comes out of a doorway.  Starts to walk in another 
  door.  As he passes the bathroom, Tom opens the door, sees 
  Trevor, has a split second of recognition and ducks back 
  inside for a moment, to let him pass.  He then heads down the 
  hall, now behind Trevor.

  steps inside.

  At this moment, Trevor is being shooed out of the Writers 
    Conference room.  

                                TREVOR
                I m not married to the Scottish accent.  
                We can work something out here...

  Kim approaches.

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Hey, have you seen Kristy around?

                              KIM
                Why do you ask?

                                TREVOR
                She s my dance partner.  Gotta teach her 
                our stealth move -- the  No-Handed 
                Lizzie.  

  It s a new world for Kim, who departs shaking her head.

                So... what was it that you liked about my 
                Atlantic Monthly story...?

  Tom experiences a moment of panic which he quickly covers. 
  What Kristy interprets as the impassioned stuttering of the 
  true admirer, we recognize as the desperate bluffing of a guy 
  who didn t read her story.

                              TOM
                Well, like I said on the phone, your 
                story was... it was just... it was... 
                  powerful.  I think what impressed me most 
                was the... unconscious nod to the 
                  metaphysical.

                making a joke.  You re trying to tell me 
                I m getting carried away.

                                KRISTY
                I doubt you ever get carried away, Tom.

                You seem very much in control.

  Tom s a little shaken:  is she onto him?

                your fingers and the entire student body 
                drops their pants -- in formation and on 
                cue --

  Tom relaxes, realizing she doesn t know what he s up to.

                              TOM
                      (with a reluctant grin)

                I ve wondered what it would be like -- to 
                be that guy.  You.  I always thought it 
                would be fun for a day, and after awhile, 
                it would just be this... job.

  This hits Tom close to the bone and his expression shows it.  *

  Kristy s walking by the writers  room.  She spots Trevor 
  inside.  He smiles, waves her in.

  Josh walks by the writers  office.  WE HEAR the faint SOUNDS 
  of SWING MUSIC, and the THUD of a body landing.  Josh 
  considers for a moment before deciding, then pokes his head 
  in.  He sees Trevor on the floor.  Both Trevor and Kristy are 
  breathing hard and laughing.  A disappointed look from Josh?

  Claire is dressed to the nines for swing dancing, the picture 
  of  40s swing chic.  A KNOCK on the door.  She answers.  
  Champ stands on the other side, not dressed to the nines.

                      (embracing him)

                make sure Claire and Champ don t win.  I 
                know, I ll play on the actor s ego... 

  Champ is a tad insulted by the direction this is going.

                 I ll tell him a big television show 
                needs him tonight.  He ll never question 
                that.  Claire won t suspect, because 
                she s so... 

  Champ can t believe this normally rational person is losing 
  it like this.  He takes her by the shoulders.

                Claire.  Did you skip your classes on 
                  paranoia?  Listen, I came by to tell you 
                because I knew it was important to you,

                you ll race back to Morty s.

                You rim the glass with a fresh lemon

                What?  So they don t schedule ahead?

                My man!  Do you need me to come back 
                there and show you?

  Claire reluctantly gives up her inquiry as Trevor seems 
  genuinely oblivious.  Trevor glances out at the dance floor.

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Lookie there.

  VERONICA & A STRANGER

  dancing cheek to cheek.  Veronica seems pretty happy.

  MIKE & LAURENCE

  dancing, adequately, with the women they asked to dance.

  PRISCILLA & ANOTHER SINGLES GROUP MEMBER

  dressed up.  They stand at the edge of the dance floor 
  chatting with a couple strangers.

  Claire smiles.  She does take comfort in that.

  ACROSS THE ROOM

  Kristy is a step away from Tom ordering from a waitress as 
  Tom s SLOPPY DRUNK pal, Matt, taps him on the shoulder.  Tom 
  is surprised to see him.

                              MATT
                My man, look at this fine looking woman.  
                So what happened with that bag lady from 
                the singles group you were gonna nail? 

  REVEAL KRISTY

  turning back in time to catch this.  The room starts to spin 
  for her.  She s numb.*

  REVEAL TREVOR IN CLOSE UP

  his eyes go wide, then shrink to slits of fury.

  TREVOR S POV - TOM ACROSS THE ROOM HOLDING HANDS W/KRISTY

  Trevor begins to march over.  Claire sees what s going on.

                                CLAIRE
                Trevor!  Don t do anything stupid!  
                      (sotto)
                Who am I kidding?

  She follows Trevor.

                You had a week to do it.  That was the

  Kristy hauls off and SLAPS THE SHIT out of Tom.  REALLY lets 
  him have it.

  She slaps him again.  Tom just takes it.  Kristy departs.

  TREVOR & CLAIRE

  approach Tom.  Claire catches Trevor, takes his arm.

                                CLAIRE
                He s not worth it, Trevor.  

  It takes all of Trevor s willpower not to bust Tom s ass.

                                CLAIRE (cont d)
                Let it go, Trevor.  Let it go.

  FAVORING MATT

  who follows Tom toward the exit.  Matt checks his watch.

                              MATT
                Damn, man, you get slapped a lot.  Hey!  
                Your week ended last night!  You had to 
                nail that singles group girl by last 
                night.

                              TOM
                That was her.

                Damn.
                      (about the bet)
                So...?

  A beat as Tom decides what kind of person he s going to be.  
  Sadly he goes into Big Cool Daddy mode.

                              TOM
                Last night?  You re sure!  I thought I 
                had tonight.

                              MATT
                Nope.  Last night was Friday.  You

                              TOM
                I was gonna pull the trigger tonight.

                It won t happen again.

  They leave together, two parlor snakes in a pod.  Just as the 
  reach the door, WE SEE Tom give a last lingering look at 
  Kristy.

  INT. MORTY S - NIGHT - LATER4444

  Claire, Trevor and Kristy in a booth near the dance floor. 
  The dance contest appears to be gearing up.  Couples stick 
  numbers on each other s backs.  

                                KRISTY
                I don t feel much like dancing, Trevor.  
                I just wanna go home and scrape off the

                I ll stop by tomorrow.  Help you make a 
                voodoo doll.

  Kristy smiles, gathers her bag and things.  She looks at 
  Trevor and Claire sitting next to one another, both sort of 
  looking around.  Kristy makes a suggestion.

                                KRISTY
                Neither of you has a partner.

  Trevor and Claire look at each other.  Claire takes one 
  lingering look at the entrance hoping for a Champ sighting. 
  None is forthcoming.  She sighs...

  INT. MORTY S - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT4545

  The group members ring the dance floor.  Trevor and Claire 
  are dancing, and damn they re good.  They re genuinely great 
  together.  We don t even have to stick around for some 
  perfunctory trophy scene, because we know...

4646INT. KRISTY S DESK - DAY  

  Claire, annoyed, arrives to be Trevor s personal assistant.  
  She finds Kristy dressed not like the frump she was at the 
  beginning of the episode, but not as the sex kitten either.  
  Classic, stylish.

                                CLAIRE
                Hey, Kristy.  I like your outfit.  It s

                I can t believe you re going to be his

                But you didn t actually lose, right?

                He said  If my partner and I win,  then I 
                have to be his assistant.  Well, his 
                partner and he won.  I, on the other

                Trevor?  Oh, yeah.

  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY4747

  Trevor as  Lousy Perp  gets interrogated by Sunset and 
  Vaughn.  Sunset is bandaged per his wound in the opening.  
  The scene plays like a NYPD Blue or Homicide interrogation 
  scene.  Trevor is sweaty and disheveled; LOOKS LIKE a junkie 
  who needs a fix.  He s very good.

                                TREVOR (LOUSY PERP)
                You think I m gonna get sick, need some

  Sunset lunges toward the perp and yanks him across the table.

  Suddenly everyone s talking at once.

  Roger wanders off, but Kim catches up to him quickly.  It s

                play it cool for a while.

  Roger calls for Kristy.

                              ROGER
                Kristy, could you come here for minute, 
                I ve got a couple questions about the 
                scene.

                                KRISTY
                Gotta boogie.  See you at group.

  Kristy leaves Trevor alone with Claire.

                                TREVOR 
                There s no bead in playing it cool.  
                There s no bead in getting to write a 
                  script...

                                CLAIRE
                Nope.

                                TREVOR
                She s more alone than she ever was. 

                                CLAIRE
                She s not more alone, Trevor --

                                TREVOR
                Alone, more alone, it s a figure of 
                speech.  The point is... about the make-
                over... I guess I was wrong.  There, I 
                said it, happy?

                              ROGER
                Okay, I need first team in position!

                                TREVOR
                That s my cue.  Grab me a latte.  Some 
                grapes.  Remove the seeds.  Meet me in my 
                trailer.  We ll run some lines.

  Trevor heads to the set.  Claire is left to herself. 
  Suddenly... from all the way across the studio.

                              KIM
                      (shouting)
                Kristy, it s time to walk the dogs!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Botched Makeover"    #114     Revised (pink)    1/15/99    56.

  From where she s standing next to Roger, Kristy shouts back.

                                KRISTY (cont d)
                        (pleasantly)
                Great!  And could you run by Starbucks 
                and pick me up a latte while you re out.

  On Claire, SMILING.

                                CLAIRE
                No, Trevor, you weren t wrong at all.

  Claire s reverie is broken by --

                                TREVOR (O.S.)
                Claire!  Where s my script?  I need my 
                script!

  Claire rolls her eyes and moves towards Trevor s trailer.

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK:
