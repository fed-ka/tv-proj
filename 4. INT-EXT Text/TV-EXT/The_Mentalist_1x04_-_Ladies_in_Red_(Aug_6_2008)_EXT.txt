      A bucolic garden setting with the marina in the b.g.  A 
      PHOTOGRAPH of Jason Sands rests on an easel surrounded by 
      flowers.  Family and friends have gathered to mourn Sands  
      passing.  JENNIFER SANDS, 30 s, dressed in black, forlorn but 
      naturally lovely, stands beside the photo trying her best to 
      receive well-wishers.  Young JULIE, 7, stands alongside 
      stoically, doll in hand.  Hovering nearby Jennifer is MICHAEL 
      BENNETT, 40 s, the family attorney, who appears equally 
      thrown by recent events.     

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, VAN PELT and Rigsby (in business attire)  
      observe the crowd from a slight distance. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    I look around, I don t see anyone 
                    here could torture a man to death 
                    with pliers and a lit cigar. 

                                  JANE
                    Picture them naked and ravenously 
                    hungry.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Eew.  

                                  CHO 
                    Strictly speaking he wasn t 
                    tortured to death.  He bled to 
                    death on his own in his hidey hole 
                    there.   

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Kind of almost has himself to 
                    blame, huh?

                                  CHO
                    Kind of.

                                  JANE 
                    How s the widow check out?

                                   RIGSBY
                    Yup.

      Jane is watching Jennifer closely.  There s something going 
      on between Bennett and the widow, in whispers and looks and 
      gestures.  Hard to read though.      

                                  JANE 
                    Who s the suit hovering round her?

                    Michael Claymore Bennett the third.  
                    Sands  lawyer.

      Lisbon sees the predatory gleam in Jane s eye.

                                  LISBON
                    What about him?

                                  JANE
                    The widow s scared of him.  Or...

                                  LISBON
                    Or?

                                  JANE
                    Or they re having an affair and 
                    he s reassuring her about something 
                    else that she s scared of.  

                                  CHO
                    Which is it?

                                  JANE
                    Not sure.  Could be both.  

      Beat on the team clocking the widow closely.  Hmmm.

                                  LISBON
                    Well, can t question them here.

                    You never know, someone might 
                    confess.  

      Lisbon exits.  Van Pelt follows.  Jane watches Rigsby 
      wistfully watch Van Pelt leave.  As soon as Lisbon s gone 
      Rigsby leads the way to THE BUFFET TABLE and they start 
      grazing....

                                  JANE
                    Can I ask you a personal question?

                                  RIGSBY
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Have you told her how you feel?

      Rigsby has a visceral dislike of talking about his feelings. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    She s a co-worker.  It s against 
                    the rules.  That s how I feel.

                                  JANE
                    That s not how you feel.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    That s none... I m not...
                    I sent out the vibes.  I got none 
                    back.  Okay?  So I m leaving it 
                    alone.   

                                  JANE
                    Vibes.  Really?  Vibes?  

                                  CHO
                    That s where he stares at the back 
                    of her neck for several hours.  
                    Women love that.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Shut up, Cho.

                                  JANE
                    You have to go get her, man.  
                    Seduce her.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (sheepish)
                    Seduction is not my strong point.

                                  JANE
                    Meh, seduction is easy.  Once you 
                    grasp the basic principle.  There s 
                    nothing to it.    

                                  RIGSBY
                    Really.  I don t see a crowd of 
                    women following you around.

                                  JANE
                    Why would I want a crowd of women 
                    following me around?

      Jane is watching the Widow argue very discreetly with 
      Bennett.  Sees Bennett squeezes her hand a little tighter 
      than a lawyer squeezes a client s hand.  We can t tell 
      whether it s a gesture of passion or oppression.  But 
      Jennifer looks horribly sad for a moment, before putting on a  
      brave face again.  Or was that an angry face?  The situation 
      between them is ambivalent, but clearly charged with emotion.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Okay.  I ll bite.  What s the basic 
                      principle?

                                  JANE
                    Cost you a dollar.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    For what?

                                  JANE
                    So you ll pay attention. 

      Rigsby hands him a dollar.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Love and affection.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Love and affection.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Give me my dollar back.

                                  JANE
                    When you seduce someone, what are 
                    you offering?  Love and affection.  
                    Who doesn t want love and 
                      affection?  It s that simple.

                    I ll demonstrate.  I bet you I can 
                    seduce any woman here.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Okay.  The widow.

      A big grin from Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Watch me.  

      Jane hands Rigsby the bottle of water he s holding,and heads 
      right for the widow. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Wait a minute, what are you... 

                                  CHO

                    Jane, no... Jane!

      Too late.  Jane s in the receiving line.  He pats little 
      Julie on the head. 

                                  JANE
                    Hello, sweetheart.  

      Jane nods hello to Bennett, and takes Jennifer s hand.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Mrs. Sands... My name is Patrick 
                    Jane.  CBI.  I m sorry for your 
                    loss.  

      She nods.  He gazes very intently at her for a long beat -- a 
      Daniel Day Lewis/Madeline Stowe kind of a deal -- until she 
      gets uncomfortable.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I uh, exc--

      He takes her hands in his, speaks with both seductive 
      gentleness and firm authority.

      Jane fixes him with a death glare that he turns on like a 
      flashlight.

                                  JANE 
                    --Back up.  Now.

      Bennett does as he s told, hurrying off to find security 
      guards.  Everyone s watching.  Jane switches off the glare 
      and turns his gaze back to Jennifer, who is transfixed. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      He lets go of her hand, turns and walks away as Rigsby and 
      Cho and a pair of blazered Security Guys converge on him.  

                                  CHO

      As they escort Jane away...

                                  RIGSBY
                    I think you owe me a hundred bucks.

                    Early days, Rigsby.  Early days.


      Jennifer hands Jane a cup of tea.  Jane glances down to the 
      pool area where Julie is playing with the Nanny, making 
      bubbles.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Sugar?

                                  JANE
                    Just milk, please.  

      She pours milk, hands him the cup and notes his wedding ring.

                                  JENNIFER
                          (off his ring)
                    Are you married, Mr. Jane?

                                  JANE
                    Was.  She s dead.

                                  JENNIFER

                            (guarded/not cold)
                    Doesn t matter.

      Jane sips his tea, looks at her, waiting.

                                  JENNIFER 
                    You have a very strange way about 
                    you, Mr. Jane.  

                                  JANE

                    After what happened at the memorial 
                    service, I don t know why I don t 
                    simply have you fired.   Are you 
                    usually so, so forthright?

                                  JANE
                    What s on your mind, Mrs. Sands?  
                    Why am I here?

                    You know why.  I, I want an 
                    apology.

                                  JANE
                    No you don t.  

      Jane sits and looks at her without affect.  Below Julie 
      squeals with delight as the Nanny makes a big bubble.  

                                  JENNIFER 
                          (quavering)
                    You, you said if I was to need your 
                    help that I should call you.  

                                  JANE 
                    Yes.  Here I am.

                                  JENNIFER
                    You were right, Bennett did upset 
                    me at the service.  He told me the 
                    truth about Jason.  

                                  JANE
                    Which is?

                                  JENNIFER
                    His investment business was a sham.  
                    It went broke ages ago.  Our bank 
                    accounts are empty.  He s left me 
                    and Julie nothing but massive 
                    debts.  Penniless.  We re going to 
                    have to sell the house and 
                      everything else we own. 

      She crumples a little.  Jane takes her hand.  

                                  JANE
                    I m so sorry.  

                                  JENNIFER 
                    The IRS and the SEC and I don t 
                    know who else were investigating 
                    him for fraud.  

                                  JANE
                    He told you nothing?

                                  JENNIFER 
                    Nothing.  Nothing.  Turns out our 
                    marriage was a lie.  Our whole life 
                    together was a lie.

                    Perhaps he was ashamed of his 
                    failure.

                                  JENNIFER
                    No.  Jason?  Ashamed?  No.  I knew 
                    he had a secretive, mistrustful 
                    side to him, but this... 

                                  JANE

                    There are rooms in the house       
                    I didn t even know were there.

                    You asked me to help you, Mrs.

                                  JANE
                    How can I do that?

                                  JENNIFER
                    If I know Jason, there s something 
                    left.  He would have hid a nest-egg 
                      somewhere.  Just in case.  Don t 
                    you think that s possible?  

                                  JANE 
                    Whoever killed him certainly 
                    thought so.

                                  JENNIFER 
                    Yes, that s true.

                                  JANE
                    They won t come back.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Why not?  What if they think I know 
                    where it is?

      Empty-handed, the Repo Deputy and his guys hurry to their

      The STATE CAPITAL looms in the distance.  Lisbon and Bennett 
      walk together. 

                                  LISBON
                    Thanks for meeting me. 

                                    BENNETT
                    No problem.  I was lunching with a  
                    couple of your deputy AGs. 

                                  LISBON
                    My sincere apologies for the 
                    behavior of our operative Jane by 
                    the way.  Unconscionable.  
                      Supervising Agent Minelli gave him 
                    a severe reprimand.

                                    BENNETT

                    I knew there were difficulties, 
                    yes.  But I had no idea he was in 
                    as deep as he was.  I don t deal

                    I look after his personal financial 
                    matters, and those were in good 
                    shape, until very recently.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  Two weeks ago, he converted a 
                    ten million dollar pension fund to 
                    cash.  Pretty much all he had.

                                    BENNETT
                    As was his right.  I only learned 
                    of it from his accountants after 
                    the fact.  It was a large 
                      withdrawal, but of course, I 
                    thought he had much more in 
                    reserve.

                                  LISBON
                    Did you ask him what he was doing 
                    with the money?

                                    BENNETT
                    I did.  He said he needed it to 
                    surprise his wife. 

                                  LISBON
                    He did that alright.

                                    BENNETT
                      I believed him.  

                                  LISBON 
                    What do you believe now?

                                    BENNETT 
                    He was looking at jail time.  
                    I think he grabbed all the cash he 
                    could and he was going to run away. 

                                  LISBON
                    Who do you think stopped him?

      Bennett shrugs.

                                    BENNETT
                    You re the detectives.  You tell 
                    me. 

      Lisbon extends a handshake.

                    Thanks for your help, Counselor.

      Rigsby and Van Pelt sit in their car eyeing a big rundown 
      party house.  The lawn is brown.  A mint CADILLAC and 
      CORVETTE sit in the driveway.

      ANGLE -- A neighboring Mom tries to corral her Kids and get 
      them in the car.

      Rigsby and Van Pelt both wear Kevlar.  Van Pelt studies the 
      rap sheets of CARTER LEWIS and DIETER WEBB, both early 30 s, 
      sleazy white hipsters.  Rigsby looks around impatiently, 
      watches the Mom and her children across the way.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Where s the entry team?  They were 
                    supposed to be here twenty minutes 
                    ago.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Relax.  It s not even noon.  
                    Way too early for guys like these 
                    to be awake.

                    They could be up from the night 
                    before.  They might go out for 
                      breakfast.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    We can deal with them.

      Van Pelt laughs.  Suddenly --

      THEIR POV -- As WEBB and Lewis exit the house and head for 
      the Mercedes in the driveway.  One tosses the other the keys.

                    They re on the move.

                    C mon, let s take  em.  

      Just as the suspects climb into their car, Rigsby flips on 
      the SIREN, guns the engine and screeches to a halt blocking 
      them in.   

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt jumps out, shotgun in tow, rushes to the 
      passenger window and levels it at a dazed Carter Lewis. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Police.  Hands where I can see 
                    them!

      NEW ANGLE -- Dieter Webb decides to run.  He leaps from the 
      driver s side and bolts across the yard.  Rigsby gives chase.  
      Both men race through a sprinkler.  Dieter finds he is in a 
      dead end, fails to scale a wire fence, and is tackled by 
      Rigsby with great force.  As Dieter moans in pain, Rigsby 
      handcuffs him.

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt smiles and waves to the Mom and Kids 
      watching this all from their adjacent driveway, stunned. 


      Darkness.  Rain-slicked tarmac.  Jane in Jennifer s car, 
      engine running, wipers going, side-lights on.  A long wait.  
      Jane looks up to a tiny camera in the visor.

                    Ah.  Someone s coming.

      A hooded figure holding an umbrella ghosts across the lot and 
      climbs into the passenger seat.  It s Adrianna.  She holds a 
      gun on Jane with casual menace, like someone who s done this 
      kind of shit before.  She clutches a cellphone in her other 
      hand.

                    This better not be a trap.  I will 
                    kill you.  Give me the diamonds.

                                  JANE
                    You re taking the wrong road, 
                    Adrianna.  Kidnapping...  

                                  ADRIANNA
                          (hissing)
                    I m not a kidnapper.  You think I 
                    want to do this?   I have to do 
                    this.  I don t want Julie to die.     

                                  JANE
                    Tell me what s going on.  I can 
                    help you.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I don t know you.  I don t trust 
                    you.  Give me the diamonds.

      Jane shows her a leather bag, opens it, flashes a look 
      inside.

                                  JANE
                    Where s Julie?

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I call a number and tell them 
                    I have the diamonds.  We get Julie.

                                  JANE
                    So call them.

      Jane opens a bottle of water, drinks.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    How do I know those are real 
                    diamonds?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      43.

        CONTINUED:30B30B

                                  JANE
                    I don t know.  They look real to 
                    me.  Here, have a look at them.  
                    You ve seen them before. 

      Here Jane employs a classic mentalist street con known in the 
      trade as  the Russian scam.   It s played slow and graceful, 
      rather than swift and comical.    

      He offers her the bag.  She wants it, but is momentarily 
      stymied because she has a gun in one hand and a cellphone in 
      the other.  He offers to take the cellphone with one hand and 
      offers to give the leather bag with the other.  Adrianna 
      automatically complies, and gives him the phone.  He hands 
      her the diamonds.  

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, sorry.

      He takes back the leather bag, replaces them with a bottle of 
      water.  He shakes his head no, that s not right, just as she 
      does.  He hands her back the diamonds and takes the gun.  

      Now he s got the phone and the gun.  But hey, she figures, 
      confused momentarily, I got the diamonds.  She opens the bag.  
      Jane flips open the purloined phone and touches keys, whilst 
      doing the same with his own phone.   

                                  ADRIANNA
                          (off diamonds)
                    This is not diamonds.

                                  JANE
                    No.  Plastic.   
                          (to phone)
                      Forwarding the last number dialed. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey!  No! 


      Jane swaps back the phone for the water bottle.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Son of a whore.

      He drinks some water.

                                  ADRIANNA (CONT D)
                    They will kill Julie now.  

                                  JANE
                    Who s they?

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I don t know.  They call me.  They 
                    send pictures to my phone.  
                    Of Julie, tied up.  Say I must give 
                    them Jason s money or she dies.  
                    I don t have Jason s money.  They 
                    are going to kill Julie.  So what 
                    else can I do?  I call Jennifer and 
                    say I have Julie.  Maybe she has 
                    the diamonds.  Now, now for sure 
                    they kill her.  

                                  JANE 
                    Wait.  Did they ask for Jason s 
                    money?  Or did they ask for 
                    diamonds?

                                  ADRIANNA 
                    For money. 

                                  JANE
                    Then they won t hurt Julie.  
                    If you re telling the truth.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    No if.  I m telling the truth.      THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      45.



      The rain has stopped.  Adrianna hurries up the front steps 
      and RINGS the buzzer.   

      Our entire CBI team, dressed in Kevlar and windbreakers, come 
      up in the shadows behind her.

      Adrianna RINGS again and after a brief moment, Bennett opens 
      the door, gun in hand.

      Van Pelt flings Adrianna safely aside and Rigsby, Lisbon and 
      Cho go in after Bennett, who s been knocked to the floor.   

                                  RIGSBY
                    Police!  Freeze!


      Jane and the CBI team watch as Inspector Mulvey puts a 
      handcuffed Jennifer into a SFPD vehicle.  Jennifer looks at 
      Jane as the door closes.  

                                   CHO
                    When did you first suspect it was 
                    her?

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I had an idea at the funeral 
                    service. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    No you did not.

                                  JANE
                    I did so.  She was looking way too 
                    good.  Nobody should glow at their 
                    husband s funeral.

                                  LISBON
                    So you made that bet with Rigsby, 
                    that you could seduce her, with the 
                      deliberate intention of snaring 
                    her?

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  I meant to win the bet 
                    too.  Only when it came to it, 
                      I couldn t.

      Van Pelt comes over.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Just because I lost doesn t mean 
                    you shouldn t take my advice. 

                                  RIGSBY 
                          (waving him away)
                    Yeah yeah.  Hush.

                    I m serious man.  Go for it.

      Jane exits, tugging Cho with him.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What s he talking about?

      Long beat, while Rigsby considers taking Jane s advice.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Nothing.
