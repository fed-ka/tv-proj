      SCREAMS of agony fill the tent as two British SOLDIERS try to 
      hold down another badly WOUNDED SOLDIER.  

      British Army Nurse Claire Randall calmly goes about CUTTING 
      off the remnants of the wounded man s pants, exposing 
      horribly mangled legs with jagged bones cutting through 
      grievous lacerations.  In the b.g. the triage tent is filled 
      with cots and rough pallets, all jammed with the WOUNDED.  

                WOUNDED SOLDIERSOLDIER #1
      JESUS CHRIST!  OHMYGOD, Where s the bloody doctor?!
      OHMYGOD!  OH DEAR JESUS!

      Suddenly a SPRAY OF BLOOD splashes across Claire and the 
      other soldiers.  The wounded man jerks and spasms.

                                  CLAIRE
                    HOLD HIM!  YOU HEAR ME!  HOLD HIM 
                    RIGHT NOW!  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

      CONTINUED:

      Claire grabs a clamp from a crash tray and then works to 
      reach deep inside the man s lacerated thigh as he screams his 
      lungs out.  The soldiers hold him tight.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    I have to clamp the femoral artery 
                    or he ll bleed out! 

                                    SOLDIER #2
                    Come on, Jackie boy, it s all 
                    right.  You re going home... you re 
                    going home...

      Claire grimaces, fights, finally gets her fingers on the 
      artery and clamps it off.  The spray of blood STOPS.  An Army 
      DOCTOR (30 s) finally rushes over to the table with a 
      hypodermic needle of morphine, which he INJECTS into the man.  
      The soldier sags back on the table as the drug kicks in.

                                  DOCTOR
                          (to Soldiers)
                    We ve got him now.  On your way.

      The soldiers step back from their friend.  

                                    SOLDIER #1
                    Thank you, doctor.  Thank you.

      No thanks for Claire, who saved the man s life.  But she 
      neither notices nor cares -- too busy working her patient.


      A few minutes later.  Frank fills out the registry book while 
      Claire looks around.  MRS. BAIRD (60 s) a squat and easy-
      going woman, sets up their account and fetches the room key.

                    When a new house is built in these 
                    parts, the custom -- since far back 
                    in the Old Days -- is to kill 
                    something and bury it under the 
                      foundation.  The blood ye saw is 
                    that of a black cock.  The houses 
                    on this street being what ye call 
                    yer  pre-fab homes  the new 
                    residents are only just now havin  
                    the chance to honor the old ways.

      She drops her voice as if sharing an intimacy.

                                  MRS. BAIRD (cont d)
                    Some folks in these parts believe 
                    that the late War was due to people 
                    turning away from their roots and 
                    omitting to take proper precautions 
                    -- such as burying a sacrifice 
                    under the foundation.

                    Please don t encourage him, Mrs. 
                    Baird.  My husband is a historian 
                    and could easily stand here all day 
                    trading ancient aphorisms.

                                  MRS. BAIRD
                      A historian is it?  Are ye a

                    Ach, then this is a last holiday 
                    before settling dun to the workaday 
                    life again, is it?  Well ye picked 
                    a bonnie time to be here, just nigh 
                    of the Beltane Festival.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Claire)
                    One of the four pagan sun feasts.  
                    Beltane being the feast of the 
                    spring equinox. 

                                  MRS. BAIRD
                    Ye ll both be welcome, of course, 
                    but mind ye -- ghosts are freed on 
                    the feast days and they ll be 
                    wandering about, free to do good or 
                    ill as they please.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Ghosts?

                                  MRS. BAIRD
                    Oh, sure now, lassie.  
                          (low)
                    Like up at Mountgerald, the big 
                    house at the top of High Street?  
                    Ay, there s a ghost.  A workman 
                    killed in the eighteenth century as 
                      a sacrifice for the foundation.  

      Mrs. Baird leans forward over the wooden counter, warming to 
      her subject as she tells an old ghost story to the young 
      couple in her parlor.

                                  MRS. BAIRD (cont d)
                    The story goes that by order of the 
                    house s owner, one wall was built 
                    up first, ye see?  Then a stone 
                    block was dropped from the top of 
                    it straight onto one of the 
                    workmen.  They buried him in the 
                    cellar and the rest of the house 
                    built up over him. 
                          (beat)
                    To this day, he haunts the cellar 
                    where he was killed, excepting on 
                    Beltane, when he s freed to walk 
                    the streets of Inverness once more.  
                          (beat)
                    A word to the wise:  be careful 
                    after dark.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      8.

      CONTINUED: (3)

      She lets that hang in the air for a beat, leaving Claire and 
      Frank unsure for a moment whether they re being had.  But 
      then it dawns on them that she s perfectly serious.

      Frank finds his voice first.

                                  FRANK
                    Thank you, Mrs. Baird.  We ll keep 
                    that in mind.

                                  MRS. BAIRD
                          (hands Claire key)
                    Ye ll have the room up the stairs 
                    and first door to the left.  
                    Breakfast is at seven and tea at 
                    three. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thank you.  Oh -- I was also 
                    wondering if you knew of anyone in 
                    the village with knowledge of the 
                    plants in the area.  I have a 
                      particular interest in medicinal 
                    herbs and I d be very interested in 
                    learning about the local varieties.

                                  MRS. BAIRD
                    I should introduce you to Mr. 
                    Crook.  He knows all about the 
                    plants in the area, I m sure he d 
                    be more  n happy to show you.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thank you, again.

      Claire and Frank head toward the stairs.



      Moments later, Frank carries the luggage as Claire unlocks 
      the door and lets them into their modest, if well-kept room.  
      We might notice that Frank and Claire automatically separate 
      soon after entering the room, and that there s almost always 
      a physical distance between them in any given space.

                                  FRANK
                    Not without its charms, certainly.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Beats an army cot and a tent in the 
                    mud.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      9.

      CONTINUED:

      Frank drops the luggage, sits on the bed -- it gives out a 
      loud SQUEAK.

                                  FRANK
                    So much for marital privacy.

      Claire smiles from across the room as he bounces a little and 
      the bed gives out progressively louder and more emphatic 
      SQUEAKS.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You think the sound carries?

                                  FRANK
                          (stops)
                    I think it s safe to say Mrs. Baird 
                    will be kept apprised of any 
                    renewed attempts to start a family.

      Claire plops herself down beside him.

                                  CLAIRE
                      Lazybones.  You ll never manage the 
                    next branch on your family tree 
                    unless you show a bit more industry 
                    than that.

      Claire begins energetically bouncing up and down.  Frank 
      grins and in a flash the two of them are in danger of 
      breaking the rickety bed as it groans and shrieks.


      Mrs. Baird pauses in her work at the sounds coming down 
      through the ceiling overhead.  She raises an eyebrow and goes 
      back to work.


      They re laughing and bouncing on the bed -- they stop after a 
      moment and Claire regards him tenderly.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You know, one of those things I 
                    used to try and remember lying in 
                    my cot in the mud:   What s the 
                    sound of my husband s laugh?   I 
                    couldn t conjure it no matter what 
                    I did; I couldn t hear it even 
                    though I d heard it a million times 
                    before.  Strangest thing.

      Frank takes her hand, opens the palm.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                                  FRANK
                    I used to sketch this.

                                  CLAIRE
                    My hand?

                                  FRANK
                    The lines.  Why exactly, I m not 
                    sure, but I had a very clear memory 
                    of this pattern.  Made little 
                    doodles everywhere.  A brigadier 
                    once dressed me down because I d 
                    somehow managed to draw them in the 
                    margin of a report for the 
                    Minister.

      Frank chuckles, then brings her hand to his lips, and in a 
      moment they re kissing.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Now that we know the bed will stand 
                    the strain...

      He gasps as her hand is suddenly inside his trousers.  He 
      fumbles with her blouse, but Claire has taken charge here and 
      she has him (literally) in the palm of her hand.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    Let s dispense with the 
                      preliminaries.

      She hikes up her skirt and climbs on top of him.  Frank gasps 
      as he enters her.  Claire has her blouse and bra off in a 
      flash and she guides his hands to her breasts.  

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    Wait -- wait -- now.

      He PINCHES them hard and now it s her turn to gasp.  She 
      begins rocking back and forth with increasing speed and 
      urgency.


      Mrs. Baird is cleaning some glasses when the sound from 
      upstairs resumes.  This time it s slower, more rhythmic, 
      somehow sexier.  Mrs. Baird reacts with a secret smile.


      The next day.  Claire s curls -- unruly at the best of times -
      - are blown into utter chaos by the wind, as Frank drives.  
      She s smiling, happy.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                    another reason for choosing the 
                      Highlands.

      Frank points out a passing ROCK FORMATION shaped like a

                      Cocknammon Rock.  During the 17th 
                    and 18th centuries, you d have 
                    often found a British army patrol 
                    lying there in wait for Scottish 
                    brigands or rebels.  You see how 
                    the position commands the high 
                    ground in every direction?

      Claire tries to look interested.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Not that I minded.  I was raised by 
                    my uncle after the death of my 
                    parents.  


      An archeologist s library, overflowing with books and papers 
      in a London townhouse.  A slightly older Uncle Lamb stands up 
      to greet Frank as he comes through the door.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    And then one day a handsome, dark-
                    haired historian came to consult my 
                    uncle on a point of French 
                      philosophy as it related to 
                    Egyptian religious practice. 

      Claire (now in her early twenties) steps out from behind a 
      stack of books, carrying a heavy tome.  She sees Frank and he 
      sees her -- and there s a small, but clear, flash of 
      electricity between them.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    I was smitten from the first... and 
                    remained smitten even through the 
                    long years apart.


      Later.  Bounded on either end by large archways, the room   
      once served as a meeting hall, dining room, ballroom, etc.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

      CONTINUED:

      Whatever furniture it once held is long gone, along with the 
      window panes and most of the decoration.  What remains is 
      dimly illuminated by narrow shafts of daylight.  

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Frank s new-found passion was 
                    genealogy -- his personal 
                      genealogy, that is.

      Claire picks her way among the dirt and debris while Frank 
      moves about, animatedly gesturing and chattering about the 
      life that once filled the space.

                                  FRANK
                    ... I haven t found any hard 
                    evidence that my ancestor actually 
                    visited this castle, mind you, but 
                    it was within his operational 
                    sphere of activities and it is just 
                    possible that he did walk this very 
                    hall on occasion...

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    He d become fascinated with tracing 
                    and exploring the various branches 
                    of his family tree.  From what I 
                    gathered, some tiresome ancestor of 
                    Frank s had had something to do 
                    with something or other in this 
                    region back a couple of centuries 
                    ago.  


      Later.  Frank puts his shoulder to an ancient wooden door, 
      but it won t budge.  Claire pitches in and the two of them 
      shove OPEN a dusty door to a lower room in the castle.  They 
      step into the room, but it s hard to see anything in the 
      gloomy interior.  A single slash of light comes from a high 
      slit window and all they can make out is a high-ceilinged 
      space crammed with broken furniture and junk.

      Frank roams the room, somewhat disappointed.  Claire lingers 
      near the doorway.

                                  FRANK
                    Just a storeroom at this point, I m 
                    afraid.  I was hoping for something 
                    a little more indicative of its 
                    original purpose.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    In a way, burying himself in the 
                    distant past gave Frank an ability 
                    to escape the recent.  I knew he d 
                    sent dozens of men behind the lines 
                    on secret missions during the war 
                    and that most never came back.  
                          (beat)
                    He didn t talk about it very often, 
                    but I knew it preyed on him, the 
                      responsibility for the deaths of so 
                    many.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    From the lack of proper lighting 
                    and ventilation I d imagine this 
                    was the province of the castle 
                    hermit.  Or perhaps a troll or two.

                                  FRANK
                    I don t believe trolls live in 
                    pairs, my dear.  Solitary 
                      creatures, they.

                                  CLAIRE
                    More s the pity.  All this and no 
                    one to share it with.

      Frank flashes a quick grin, which crinkles the corners of his 
      eyes in a dashing way.  He s quite handsome, even in this 
      light, and Claire feels that rush of attraction for him once 
      more.  She pushes some junk off a tabletop and sits on it.

                                  FRANK
                    You ll get dirty...

                                  CLAIRE
                    You can give me a bath...

      She hikes up her dress, then cocks an eyebrow.  He smiles and 
      crosses the room toward her.

                                  FRANK
                    Why Mrs. Randall, I do believe you 
                    forgot your undergarments at 
                    home...

      She grins as she pulls his head down between her legs.

      WIDER -- THE CASTLE

      Framed by the morning sun, its shadow extends far across the 
      rolling hills and fields.                                                                                    15.



      Frank pours over various documents on a desk.  Enormous 
      windows let in a flood of nearly blinding light into the 
      study, which is currently overflowing with books, documents, 
      maps, and sheet after sheet of aging yellowed paper covering 
      virtually every surface.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Before the war, we were 
                      inseparable.  But now the war was 
                    over and yet we were still 
                    separated somehow.  Not physically, 
                    perhaps, but apart just the same.  

      FIND Claire sitting in a comfortable chair, idly watching 
      from across the room.  Frank suddenly reacts.

                                  FRANK
                    Yes!  There he is!  I ve found him!

      REVEAL the REVEREND WAKEFIELD (50 s, short, tubby) working in 
      a different section of the library.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    Indeed?  Let us have a look.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    The Reverend Wakefield, Vicar of 
                    the local parish, shared Frank s 
                    passion for genealogy.  Several 
                    long nights were spent here in 
                    hopes that one of them might 
                    suddenly unearth a baptismal 
                      certificate or some other scrap of 
                    paper related to the notorious 
                    ancestor.

      Claire rouses herself from the chair and makes her way 
      through the debris to where the two men are excitedly 
      spreading out scraps of paper.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Him...?  You mean...  Walter  was 
                    it?  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                    Jonathan, you remember, surely?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Remind me, dear.

                                  FRANK
                          (patient)
                    Jonathan Wolverton Randall.  A 
                    captain of dragoons -- mounted 
                    infantry -- in the Royal Army.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Right.   Black Jack  Randall, I ve 
                    heard you call him.

                                  FRANK
                    A rather dashing nickname he 
                    acquired in the army, probably when 
                    he was stationed here in the 
                    1740 s.  What the Reverend has 
                      discovered is a whole series of 
                    army dispatches that mention 
                    Captain Randall by name!

                                  CLAIRE
                      Fascinating.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    Isn t it?  It appears he was in 
                    command of the garrison at Fort 
                    William for four years or so.  
                    Seems to have spent quite a bit of 
                    his time harassing the Scottish 
                      countryside above the Border on 
                    behalf of the Crown.  

                                  FRANK
                    He was hardly alone in that 
                    endeavor.  The English were rather 
                    notably unpopular throughout the 
                    Highlands in the 18th century.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    And well into the 20th, it would 
                    seem.  I distinctly heard the 
                    barman at that pub last night refer 
                    to us as Sassenachs.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    I do hope you didn t take offense.  
                    It only means  Englishman,  after 
                    all, or at worst,  Outlander. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

      The housekeeper, MRS. GRAHAM (60 s) ENTERS, carrying a tray 
      of tea and biscuits.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM
                    I ve brought ye a wee bit of 
                      refreshment, gentlemen.  I ve 
                    brought but the two cups, for I 
                    thought perhaps Mrs. Randall would 
                    care to join me in the kitchen for 
                    a bit of --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes!  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you.

      Grateful for the reprieve from history lessons and moldering 
      scraps of paper, Claire gives Frank a quick kiss and then is 
      out the door with the housekeeper.


      A few minutes later, Claire sits at the table sipping tea.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Mmm.  It s been quite a while since 
                    I ve tasted Oolong.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM
                    Aye, I couldna get it during the 
                    war.  It s the best for the 
                    readings, though.  Had a terrible 
                    time with that Earl Grey.  The 
                    leaves fall apart so fast, it s 
                    hard to tell anything at all.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You read tea leaves, then?

                                  MRS. GRAHAM
                    Why, certainly I do, my dear.  Just 
                    as my grandmother taught me, and 
                    her grandmother before her.  Drink 
                    up your cup, and I ll see what you 
                    have there.

      Moments later, Mrs. Graham is examining the leaves at the 
      bottom of Claire s cup with a serious expression.  Finally, 
      she sets it down carefully, as if it might explode.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (amused)
                    Am I going to meet a tall dark 
                    stranger or take a journey across 
                    the sea?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM
                    Could be.  Or could not.  
                      Everything in it s contradictory.  
                    There s the curved leaf for a 
                    journey, but it s crossed by the 
                    broken one that means staying put.  
                    And strangers there are, to be 
                    sure, several of them.  And one of 
                    them s your husband, if I read the 
                    leaves aright.
                          (beat)
                    Let me see your hand, child.

      Claire s amusement fades somewhat at Mrs. Graham s serious 
      expression as she examines Claire s hand closely.  A long 
      quiet moment before she speaks again.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM (cont d)
                    Odd.  Most hands have a likeness to 
                    them.  Mind, I d no just say that 
                    it s,  See one, you ve seen them 
                    all,  but it s often like that.  
                    There are patterns, you know?  But 
                    this is not a pattern I ve seen 
                    before.  The large thumb, now?  
                    Means you re strong-minded, and 
                    have a will not easily crossed.  
                    Reckon your husband could have told 
                    ye that.
                          (re: base of Claire s 
                            thumb)
                    Here s the Mount of Venus.  In a 
                    man, ye d say it means he likes the 
                    lasses.  For a woman,  tis a bit 
                      different.  To be polite about it, 
                    I d say your husband isna like to 
                    stray far from your bed.

      The elderly woman gives a bawdy chuckle and Claire blushes 
      slightly.  Mrs. Graham goes back to her examination.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM (cont d)
                    The lifeline s interrupted.  A bit 
                    more chopped-up, than I usually 
                    see; all bits and pieces.  Marriage-
                    line is divided... means two 
                      marriages.
                          (off Claire s look)
                    Doesna mean anything s like to 
                    happen to your good man.  It s only 
                    that if it did, you d not be one to 
                    pine away and waste the rest of 
                    your life in mourning.

                    But most divided lines are broken.  
                    Yours is... forked.   

      There s something in the way she says it, something hushed 
      and disquieting that raises the hairs on Claire s neck.  But 
      before she can pursue the matter --

      -- Rev. Wakefield and Frank come BASHING INTO THE KITCHEN 
      carrying the tea tray and cups with a great clatter.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    ... I suspect your ancestor had a 
                    patron.  A prominent and powerful 
                    man who could protect him from the 
                    censure of his superiors.  

                                  FRANK
                    Possibly.  It would have to have 
                    been someone high up in the 
                    hierarchy of the time to exert that 
                    kind of influence --
                          (snaps his fingers)
                    The Duke of Sandringham!

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                          (of course)
                    The Duke of Sandringham!

      Mrs. Graham is up on her feet and seizing the tea tray and 
      cups from danger.

                                  MRS. GRAHAM
                    None of that, none of that -- stand 
                    clear before ye do some permanent 
                    damage!

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    Yes, yes -- my apologies, Mrs. 
                    Graham.  I completely forgot myself 
                    in the excitement.

                                  FRANK
                    Claire, I think we re onto 
                    something at last!

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m so glad to hear it.  But I 
                    think I shall take my leave.

                    Yes, I think a good bath is well in 
                    order.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    Of course.  I hope you will join us 
                    for the feast of Beltane tomorrow 
                    night?

                                  CLAIRE

                    The pagan festival?  Why Reverend 
                      Wakefield, you do astonish me.

                                  REV. WAKEFIELD
                    I love a good ghost story as much 
                    as the next fellow.  
                          (with relish)
                    And the Old Feast Days are rife 
                    with tales of ghosts and spirits 
                    suddenly freed to roam about the 
                    mortal realm as they will.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You make it sound positively 
                    spooky.  In that case, I look 
                    forward to sharing the warmth of 
                    your table while hordes of Scottish 
                    spectres roam the land outside.
                          (to Frank)
                    Take your time, but do try to make 
                    it back before the storm breaks.

      Frank s lost searching through the papers in his hands, and 
      barely registers that she s leaving.  

                                  FRANK
                    Hmmm.  Yes.  Right.

      She gives him a quick peck on the cheek, then EXITS.


      Uncle Lamb playing CARDS across from Young Claire in a small 
      compartment as the world passes by just outside.  Lamb is 
      trying in vain to get her to do something with her cards.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    My uncle once tried to teach me 
                    poker, but I refused to trade any 
                    of my cards for new ones.  It 
                    seemed wrong, cheating even, to 
                    change just because I didn t like 
                    what I d been dealt.

      Young Claire remains impassive in the face of her uncle s 
      entreaties, and he finally throws down his cards in defeat.


      Claire sits before the mirror, brushing her hair with dubious 
      results -- the curls refusing to behave despite her efforts.  
      She glares at the mirror.

      Claire has lit CANDLES in the small room just as Frank throws 
      OPEN the DOOR allowing a DRAFT to blow in as well, 
      extinguishing a few of the candles.  Claire relights them.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Someday, you might possibly 
                    consider entering a room with 
                    something less than the momentum of 
                    a Sherman tank.

      He doesn t answer and Claire looks up at him.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    What s the matter?  Looks like 
                    you ve seen a ghost.

                                  FRANK
                    As a matter of fact, I m not at all 
                    sure that I haven t.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t tell me you ve seen Mrs. 
                    Baird s crushed workman wandering 
                    the streets.

                                  FRANK
                    No.  This was... something else.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

      MOMENTS LATER

      Claire is pouring them short glasses of whiskey while Frank 
      gets out of his wet clothes.  Outside, the storm is blowing 
      hard now, rain pelting the windows.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Looking at me?  Are you sure?

                                  FRANK
                    Quite.  We could both see you 
                    clearly brushing your hair.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Punishing my hair would be more 
                    accurate.  What d this fellow look 
                    like?

                                  FRANK
                    Big chap.  A Scot, in complete 
                    Highland rig-out, complete to 
                    sporran and running-stag brooch on 
                    his plaid.
                          (beat)
                    I only got a glimpse of his face, 
                    but he seemed terribly unhappy 
                    about something.  When he pushed 
                    past me, he was close enough that I 
                    should have felt him brush my 
                    sleeve as he passed -- but I 
                    didn t.  I turned around to say 
                      something, but he was gone.  
                    Vanished.  That s when I began to 
                    feel a bit cold down the backbone.

      A disquieting moment.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Well, that is spooky.

      Claire shakes it off, downs the rest of her drink, then 
      gathers the glasses to refill them.  

                                  FRANK
                          (quiet)
                    Did you have many Scots in your 
                    charge during the war, Claire?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, quite a few.  I remember one, a 
                    crusty old thing really, a piper 
                    from the Third Seaforths who 
                    couldn t stand being stuck with a 
                    needle...

      She trails off as she makes a realization.

                    What is it you re asking me, Frank?

                                  FRANK
                    When I saw that chap staring up at 
                    you, I thought... that he might be 
                    someone you had nursed.... someone 
                    who might be looking for you now... 
                    to... reconnect.

                                  CLAIRE
                       Reconnect ...?  

                                  FRANK
                    Claire, it was six years.  It 
                    wouldn t be unusual if -- I mean, 
                    everyone knows doctors and nurses 
                    are under tremendous stress in the 
                    combat theater... and it s just 
                    that, well, it wouldn t be 
                      surprising if something had --

      Claire is on her feet with fury.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Do you think I ve been unfaithful? 
                    Do you?  Because if so, you can 
                    leave this room this instant.  
                    Leave the house altogether!

                                  FRANK
                          (tries to take her hand)
                    Darling --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t you dare touch me!  A strange 
                    man looks up at my window and you 
                    take it as evidence that I ve had 
                    an affair with one of my patients?  
                    Is that what you think of me?

      Despite her protestations, Frank puts his arms around her, 
      but Claire remains stiff as a board.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                          (caressing her hair)
                    No.  No, I don t think any such 
                    thing, Claire.
                          (beat)
                    I only meant to say that even if 
                    you ever did... it would make no 
                      difference to me.  I love you so. 
                    Nothing you ever did could stop my 
                    loving you.

      A moment, then Claire puts her arms around him.  

                                  FRANK (cont d)
                    Forgive me?

      Lightning flashes outside the window as Frank kisses her neck 
      and Claire softens.

                                  CLAIRE
                     The quality of mercy is not 
                    strained.  It droppeth as the 
                    gentle dew from heaven... 

      Claire s skirt then droppeth to the floor.  

      This time, the lovemaking is tender, comfortable, enjoyable.  
      Claire is unabashed with her body and her sensuality, 
      perfectly comfortable making her desires known and more than 
      willing to satisfy her partner.  Frank is more conventional, 
      a little reserved in contrast to his more ravenous wife, but 
      game to try and keep up with her. 

      When it s over, Claire rests her head on Frank s chest as

                    Sex was our bridge back to one 
                    another.  The one place we always 
                    met.  Whatever obstacles presented 
                      themselves during the day or night, 
                    we could seek out and find each 
                    other again in bed.  
                          (beat)
                    As long as we had that, I had faith 
                      everything would work out.

      Her eyes begin to flutter, nearly dozing off -- but Frank

                                  FRANK
                    The vicar told me there s a circle 
                    of standing stones on a hill just 
                    outside the village -- their own 
                      Stonehenge, as it were -- and that 
                    a local group still observes 
                    rituals there. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    And tomorrow being Beltane, the 
                    witches will be out in force, I

                                  FRANK
                    Well, not witches, actually.  
                    Although there have been witches 
                    all over Scotland for hundreds of 
                    years -- they burnt them  til well 
                    into the eighteenth century -- but 
                    this lot is really meant to be 
                    Druids, or something of the sort. I 
                    don t suppose it s actually a coven 
                    of devil-worshippers, or that sort 
                    of thing.

      Claire snuggles in to her husband s arms. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    More s the pity.  Can t imagine 
                    anything I d rather do than rise 
                    before dawn to watch a coven of 
                      devil-worshippers prance about in

      Later.  Claire sits in an armchair, leafing through a BOOK.  
      Frank comes down the stairs, sees her and comes over.

                                  FRANK
                    What are you doing?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Looking for that plant.  The one I 
                    saw in the stone circle.  It could 
                    be in the Campanulaceae family, or 
                    the Gentianaceae, the 
                      Polemoniaceae, the Boraginaceae -- 
                    you know, Forget-me-nots.  That s 
                    most likely.  I don t think it was 
                    a gentian of any kind; the petals 
                    weren t really rounded...

                                  FRANK
                    Why not go back and get it?  The 
                    ritual s complete, I doubt any of 
                    the celebrants will be returning.  
                    And if they did, there s nothing 
                    wrong with a visitor coming to 
                    examine the site or gather the 
                    local flora.

                                  CLAIRE

      They exchange quick kisses.


      Claire s eyes take a moment to adjust to the blaze of light 
      inside from CANDLES, OIL LAMPS and a FIRE in the hearth of 
      the single-room cottage.

      A group of rough-looking MEN in KILTS and Highlander rigs are 
      drinking, tending various wounds, and talking in low voices 
      as they ENTER.  Their bearded leader -- DOUGAL (40 s) -- 
      looks up.

                                  DOUGAL
                    What is it you have there, Murtagh?

                                    MURTAGH
                      A sassenach wench, by her speech.

      Murtagh brings her to where Dougal sits by the fire, a hunk 
      of bread in his hand.  Her dress is torn in several places 
      and there s a fair amount of breast and thigh exposed.  

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    I decided that clutching at the 
                    remnants of my torn dress like a 
                      frightened child would only invite 
                    more predatory interest.   

      Claire pulls away from Murtagh s grip and stands tall before 
      Dougal with a calm, steady expression on her face.

                                  DOUGAL
                    A bonny one, sassenach or no.  
                    What s your name, lass?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Claire... Claire Beauchamp  
                      [pronouncing it Bee-cham].

                    Using my maiden name was a spur of 
                    the moment decision.  If they 
                    intended to ransom me, I didn t 
                    want to lead them back to Frank. 

                                  DOUGAL
                      Beauchamp?  [French pronunciation.]  
                    A French name, it is, surely?

                                  CLAIRE
                    That s right.  And just what do you 
                    think you re --

      Dougal ignores her as he would a child or a dog who suddenly 
      decided to yap at him.

                                  DOUGAL
                          (to Murtagh)
                    Where did ye find her?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                    words with a certain Captain of 
                    dragoons wi  whom we are acquent .

      The men in the room get the reference to Randall -- clearly 
      they all know him and don t think very highly of the captain.

                                    MURTAGH (cont d)
                    There seemed to be some question as 
                    to whether the lady was or was not 
                    a whore.

      A few muttered comments as they eye her tattered garments.

                                  DOUGAL
                    And what was the  lady s  position 
                    in this discussion?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I.  Am.  Not.

      That amuses the group.  A large, fat man -- RUPERT (30 s) -- 
      then moves toward Claire with a leer.

                                  RUPERT
                    We could put it to the test.

      Claire refuses to shrink back from the huge bulk moving 
      toward her, but it s an effort.

                                  DOUGAL
                    That will do, Rupert.  I don t hold 
                    wi  rape and we ve not the time for 
                    it, anyway.

                                    MURTAGH
                    Dougal, I ve no idea what she might 
                    be, or who -- but I ll stake my 
                    best shirt she s no a whore. 

      Dougal looks her over one more time.

                                  DOUGAL
                    We ll puzzle it out later.  We ve 
                    got a good distance to go tonight 
                    and we mun  do something for Jamie 
                    first; he canna ride like that.

      Dougal gets up and the men part for him as he heads over to 
      the fire.  Claire, forgotten for the moment, retreats to one 
      of the shadows, happy to no longer be the center of 
      attention.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                    Escape was my chief concern.  But 
                    escape to where?  I had no idea 
                    where I was and trying to find the 
                    road back to Inverness in the dark 
                    felt like a fool s errand.

      AT THE FIRE

      JAMIE MACKENZIE FRASER (22) a young man, with a shock of red 
      hair, sits on a stool, rocking back and forth in pain as he 
      clutches one shoulder with the opposite hand.  

      Dougal comes over and gently pulls away the protective hand, 
      while Murtagh quickly cuts away the dirty, blood-soaked linen 
      shirt with a knife.  Several men gasp at the sight of Jamie s 
      shoulder:  a bloody wound still flowing freely down his 
      chest, but the real horror is the shoulder joint itself and 
      the way his arm hangs at an unnatural angle.

                                  DOUGAL
                    Out o  joint, poor bugger.

                    musket ball knocked me off my 
                    saddle.  I landed with all my 
                    weight on the hand, and crunch!  
                    There it went.

                    I tried to comfort myself with the 
                    thought that Frank would have the 
                    entire constabulary of Inverness 
                    turned out looking for me by now.

                    The wound s no trouble.  The ball 
                    went right through, and it s clean -
                    - the blood s runnin  free enough.

      Dougal ponders that for a moment and the men all fall quiet,

                      I recognized the faces in the room.  
                    They were hard men.   Not  tough  
                    men whose pose is often more 
                    pretense than reality, but hard. 
                    I d seen faces like these in the 
                    war.  Faces inured to living with 
                    brutality and death every day.  
                    Eyes that looked out at the world 
                    from inside deep shadows where  
                    daylight never reached.

                                  DOUGAL
                    Dinna worrit yourself.  I don t 
                    mean to be leaving him behind.

                                  RUPERT
                    No help for it, then.  We ll have 
                    to try and force the joint back.  
                    Here, lad.

      He uncorks a leather flask and Jamie takes a drink, coughing 
      and gagging at the raw spirit.

                                  RUPERT (cont d)
                    Murtagh, you and Charlie hold him; 
                    I ll give it a try.

      Rupert grabs hold of Jamie s wrist as the other two get a 
      firm grip on the young man.  Jamie braces himself as Rupert 
      gets ready to yank on the arm with all his might -- but 
      suddenly Claire s voice cuts through the room like a clang of 
      steel.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    DON T YOU DARE!  

      The men are slightly taken aback as Claire forces her way 
      through them to get to the wounded man.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

      CONTINUED: (5)

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    You ll break his arm if you do it 
                    like that.  Out of the way, please.  

      Surprisingly, they do as they re told and step back.  Claire 
      examines the shoulder professionally for a moment.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    You have to get the bone of the 
                    upper arm at the proper angle 
                    before it will slip back into its 
                    joint.  

      She takes Jamie s wrist and pulls it up, while turning the 
      elbow in.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                          (to Jamie)
                    This is the worst part.  

                                  JAMIE
                    It canna hurt much worse than it 
                    does.  Get on wi  it.

      Claire cups his elbow, then has to use all her strength to 
      force the limb up, feeling for the moment it will pop back 
      into the socket.  Sweat breaks out on her forehead, and Jamie 
      grimaces, but there s no sound in the room except the soft 
      muttering of the fire.  Finally, there s a soft CRUNCHING POP 
      and the arm is back in the socket.  The relief on Jamie s 
      face is immediate and obvious.

                                  JAMIE (cont d)
                    It doesna hurt anymore!

      The men are amazed and look at each other in wonder.  Claire 
      carefully bends the arm across Jamie s torso.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It will.  It will be tender for 
                    several days.  You musn t extend 
                    the joint at all for two or three 
                    days; when you do use it again, go 
                    very slowly at first.  Stop at once 
                    if it begins to hurt, and use warm 
                      compresses on it daily.

      Another man -- NEDDIE (20 s) -- ENTERS the cottage in the 
      b.g. and motions to Dougal.

                                  NEDDIE
                    Dougal?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

      CONTINUED: (6)

      Dougal goes to speak with him near the door. 

                                  JAMIE
                    I m taking a guess you ve dun this 
                    before.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m a nurse.

      His eyes drop to her breasts.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    Not that kind of nurse.

      NEAR THE WINDOW

      Dougal and Neddie speaking in low tones.

                                  NEDDIE
                    Two patrols moving this way from 
                    the south.  Taking they time about 
                    it, but leaving no stone unturned.

                                  DOUGAL
                    Can t stay here much longer, then.  

                                  NEDDIE
                    Continue on, ye thinking?

                                  DOUGAL
                    Not with redcoats on our scent.

                                  NEDDIE
                    We dinna made many gains in our 
                    task to be headin  back so soon.

                                  DOUGAL
                    Time enough later.  I weel explain 
                    to Colum.  Bragh Stuart.

      AT THE FIRE

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    The wound needs to be disinfected 
                    before it can be dressed.  

                                    MURTAGH
                      Dis-in-fect..?

                          (impatient)
                    The dirt must be removed from the 
                    wound and it must be treated with a 
                    compound to discourage germs and 
                    promote healing.  

                                    MURTAGH
                    Germs...?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just get me some iodine. 
                          (off his blank look)
                      Merthiolate?  
                          (again)
                    Dilute carbolic?  
                          (not a chance)
                    Alcohol?  

      Relieved at hearing a word he recognizes, Murtagh pushes a 
      flask into her hands.  She rolls her eyes a bit, but decides 
      it s better than nothing.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    This ll hurt.

                                  JAMIE
                    It all hurts.

      She pours the alcohol over the open wound, then looks about 
      for something to dress it with.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Now I need a sterile bandage or 
                    piece of clean cloth.

      The men look at each other blankly.

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    Surely there must be a single piece 
                    of clean cloth among you?

      The men look at one another in a mixture of shame and 
      confusion.  

                                  CLAIRE (cont d)
                    Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.

      Without other options, she seizes the hem of her dress and 
      TEARS off a few wide strips.  In quick order, she makes a 
      dressing for the wound, just as Dougal pushes his way back to 
      them.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                    Can you ride, lad?

                                  JAMIE
                    Aye.

                                  DOUGAL
                    Good.  We re leaving. 

      At that, the men start to head to the door.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Not so fast -- you ll need a sling 
                    to keep that arm still.

      She and Jamie both glance down at her torn hem.

                                  JAMIE
                    Use much more o  that and ye won t 
                    be leaving much to the imagination.

      She shoots him a look, then begins to tear off strips from 
      his own tattered shirt.

      AT THE DOOR

      Rupert pauses with Dougal.

                                  RUPERT
                    What of the lass?

                                  DOUGAL
                    She ll come with us.

                                  RUPERT
                    Why do ye no just leave her here?

                                  DOUGAL
                    If she s an English spy, we canna 
                    risk leaving her here to tell them 
                    which way we ve gone.  And if she s 
                    no spy, well, I ll not leave a 
                      defenseless woman here in her 
                      nightshift.

                    time. 

                                  DOUGAL
                    Leave Colum to me.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                    to stop him, ye can be sure of 
                    that.

      Dougal storms out.
