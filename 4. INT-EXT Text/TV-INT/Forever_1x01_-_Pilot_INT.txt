      Henry weaves through the crowd and down the darkened tunnel 
      of the subway platform.  A train WHIZZES past.  Brakes 
      SQUEAK.  Henry boards the first car. 


      Henry enters to find one available seat.  The free seat 
      happens to be beside a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She smiles.  Henry 
      nods back.  He studies her for the briefest of moments.  One 
      glance is all it takes for Henry to learn a great deal.                                                                                      2.


                                  HENRY
                    Dobryj dyen.

      Henry smiles as he greets the woman in PERFECT RUSSIAN. 

                                    RUSSIAN WOMAN
                    Dobryj dyen.
                          (in English with accent)
                    How did you know I was Russian?

                                  HENRY
                    Your lips.

      She eyes him strangely.  He points to her mouth.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Korovka.  You have a little smudge.

      Inside her slightly open purse is a package of Korovka -- a 
      Russian candy. 

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Good luck at tonight s performance.

      This catches her attention.  Henry quickly explains.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I just noticed the 
                      indentations on your fingers.  At 
                    first I thought violin, but the 
                    spacing is a bit too wide and 
                    there s no markings under your 
                    chin.  So, cello.  Which, happens 
                    to be my favorite instrument.  I m 
                    a sucker for Bach.

                                    RUSSIAN WOMAN
                    Me too.

      They ride in silence.  After a beat, something occurs to her.

                                    RUSSIAN WOMAN (CONT D)
                    How did you know I have a 
                      performance?

                                  HENRY
                    Your collar has a bit of moisture 
                    on it, freshly showered, so I 
                    assumed you were either headed to 
                    work or going on a date, and with 
                    all due respect, it would be 
                    unusual for a woman as beautiful as 
                    you to take the subway to a date. 
                    Not impossible, but unlikely.                                                                                      3.


      She smiles.

                                    RUSSIAN WOMAN
                    You see a lot.

                                  HENRY
                    Well... I ve seen a lot.

      Their eyes meet.  It s a charged moment.  An automated voice 
      announces  Lincoln Center, next stop.   The Russian Woman 
      rises.  Moves past Henry.  Then stops.  Turns.

                                    RUSSIAN WOMAN
                    Perhaps you d like to come to the 
                      performance?  Maybe afterwards, we 
                    could grab a drink?

      Henry stands.  Their eyes only inches apart.  Henry smiles.

                                  HENRY
                    I d love to.

      That s when -- SCREEEECH!!!  The PIERCING SOUND of metal 
      against metal!  The subway SMASHES INTO A PARKED TRAIN!  The 
      front car FOLDS into itself, as BODIES FLY, NECKS SNAP.  It s 
      instantaneous, violent and visceral.

      Henry lies on the floor, a simmering chard of metal sticking 
      out of his chest.  The Russian Woman is unable to move, her 
      neck broken.  Her eyes flutter, afraid and in pain.  With his 
      last moments of life, Henry reaches into his jacket and 
      removes the ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH.  He tosses it.  He then 
      reaches for the Russian Woman s hand.  But he never gets 
      there.  Inches away, just a fraction out of reach, they both 
      die.

      We gaze down at them through the TORN OPEN metal roof of the 
      subway and slowly PULL BACK from this macabre portrait...

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    I ve had a full life.  I ve fought 
                    in wars.  Been madly in love.  I ve 
                    been shot, stabbed, hung, stoned, 
                    burned, had typhoid, malaria, 
                    yellow fever, Spanish fever, 
                    smallpox, gangrene, gonorrhea (a 
                    few times), but the one feat I 
                    can t seem to accomplish, the one 
                    small task all people, whether 
                    great or small, evil or kind, young 
                    or old seem to do with ease... is 
                    die.                                                                                      4.


      And with that, we are consumed by a FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Water drips down from the ceiling, as DR. HENRY MORGAN (looks 
      the same as present day) examines an OLD AFRICAN SLAVE with 
      eerie GRAY EYES.  Using an old wooden stethoscope, Henry 
      checks his heart as the CAPTAIN looks on, suspicious.

                                  HENRY
                    Just a fever.  This man will be 
                    fine.

                                    CAPTAIN
                    He s not a man, he s property and 
                    he has cholera.  I can t risk 
                      contaminating the rest of the 
                    cargo.  Throw him overboard.

      Henry steps between the SHIP S GUARDS and the Slave.

                                  HENRY
                    I m a medical professional and I 
                    assure you he is not infected!

                                    CAPTAIN
                    You are a guest.  Being permitted 
                    passage as a courtesy.  Now, allow 
                    my men to remove him or I shall.

      The Captain cocks a revolver.  Henry doesn t move.  If this 
      is how he takes his final breath, so be it.  As the Captain 
      pulls the trigger -- CRACK!  

      LIGHTNING strikes the mast of the ship.  Water fills the 
      hull.  Henry loses his footing and BANGS his head against a 
      wooden table.  Henry s POCKET WATCH falls out of his jacket, 
      sliding across the floor.  Henry loses consciousness.  A FIRE 
      fills the ship.  The last image he sees is the African 
      Slave s gray eyes glistening in the fire. BANG!  Another BOLT 
      of lightning CRACKLES -


      Henry is drowning.  Falling deeper and deeper under the sea 
      along with the CREW, SLAVES, and TREASURES of the ship 
      (including Henry s watch).                                                                                      5.


      Upside down, Henry passes the OLD AFRICAN SLAVE.  Their eyes 
      meet one final time before -- HENRY IS YANKED UP!


      Early morning light shines in through the curtains.  A cell 
      VIBRATES on a night stand.  Beside it, the scattered remains 
      of last night s debauchery.  An empty fifth of vodka.  A 
      joint floats in a bottle of water.  


      DETECTIVE JO MARTINEZ (32) splashes cold water on her face.  
      Gazes at her reflection in the bathroom mirror.  This is 
      about the worst Jo can look, and it s still not bad.  She 
      pulls down her under-eyes.  Blood shot.  Two quick shots of 
      Visine.  She rubs her temples, a pounding headache.  Grabs a 
      few aspirin and washes them back with a sip from the faucet.  

                                  JO
                    Please tell me last night was a 
                    really bad dream.

      That s when ANDRE (27; buff; some ink) KNOCKS on the bathroom 
      door.  He s naked.  Jo sighs.  Not a dream.  Shit.                                                                                      8.


                                  ANDRE
                    Morning, babe.

      He tries to kiss her neck.  She pulls away.

                                  JO
                    I d feel slightly less nauseous if 
                    you could not call me babe.

                                  ANDRE
                    Hey.  It s cool.  Just wanted to 
                    give you your cell.  Thing s been 
                    buzzing all morning.

      Andre hands over the phone.  Jo checks her messages.  Shit!

                                  JO
                    Oh, no!  I have to go.

      Quickly, Jo gets dressed.  Hopping around on one foot.

                                  ANDRE
                    Mind if I shower?

                                  JO
                    Yes.  You have to leave, now.

                                  ANDRE
                    Look, I see what s going on here.  
                    Dude s clothes in the closet.  
                    Beard trimmer in the bathroom.  
                    Picture.

      Andre points to a photo of JO and a MAN kissing on a boat.

                                  ANDRE (CONT D)
                    You re stepping out on your old 
                    man. 

                                  JO
                    You re very perceptive, Alex.

                                  ANDRE
                    Andre.  I have my moments.  So, 
                    secret s out.  No reason to play 
                    games.  Your move, babe.

      Andre falls back on the bed, hands behind his head, buck 
      naked.  Jo sighs.  She crawls across him and reaches for her 
      bedside table.  Andre smiles.  Here we go... Jo grabs a 9 mm 
      handgun and cocks it.  Off Andre, freaking out --                                                                                      9.



      Abe glances over at Henry as they drive.*

                                  ABE
                    Correct me if I m wrong, but you ve 
                    never died in a train crash before?

                                  HENRY
                    No... I have not.*

                                  ABE
                    Well, as someone who has never 
                    died, and admittedly isn t looking 
                    forward to the prospect, I think 
                    this is cause for celebration.  You 
                      experienced something new today.  
                    Isn t that the whole point of life?

                                  HENRY
                    Abe, I think it s safe to say I 
                    have yet to figure out what the 
                    point of life is.  Mine anyway.

      This lands on Abe.  But he plays through it.

                                  ABE
                    Well, that s why we keep looking.  
                    How about I get us tickets to La 
                    Traviata?  I hear the soprano s got 
                    some pipes on her.

                                  HENRY
                    No.  Thank you. 

                                  ABE
                    Ball game?

                                  HENRY
                      I appreciate the effort but *
                      occasionally, after a violent 
                    death, a man needs a period to 
                    wallow.

                                  ABE
                      Understood.  How about a rib-eye 
                    for breakfast?                                                                                    10.


                                  HENRY
                          (considers)
                    ...I suppose I shouldn t wallow on 
                    an empty stomach.

                                  ABE
                    My thoughts exactly.

      Abe smiles as they pulls u in front of an ANTIQUE SHOP in 
      Lower Manhattan.  They re home.


      The store is filled with relics from Henry s long and 
      colorful life.  Antique chairs, desks, paintings.  Henry 
      stops in front of a 1940 s BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of a 
      woman we recognize as ABIGAIL. (The frame is for sale, not 
      the picture.)  This time she is slightly older than in 
      Henry s FLASHBACK.  Henry stares at the photo. *

                                  ABE
                    Did you lose the pocket watch?

                                  HENRY
                    No.  It s on the floor of the 
                    subway, I think.

                                  ABE
                    Good.  Then, I promise we ll get it *
                    back.

      Abe squeezes Henry s shoulder and heads up the winding 
      staircase that leads to their apartment. 

                                  HENRY
                    Abe.

      Abe stops. Henry has trouble saying the words.

                                  ABE
                    Don t say anything too emotional.  
                    It ll be uncomfortable.

                                  HENRY
                          (smiles)
                    My thoughts exactly.

      Abe heads upstairs.  Henry stands atop a small area rug.  He 
      yanks the rug away REVEALING -- a hidden door in the floor.                                                                                     11.



      A rickety staircase leads to Henry s secret lab, where he *
      conducts his experiments on mortality (or immortality.)  
      Chemicals, log books, beakers, mass spectrometer, X-Ray 
      machine, microscopes and a glowing FISH TANK filled with 
      Turritopsis nutricula aka the Immortal Jellyfish. *

      QUICK MONTAGE OF HENRY -- as he goes about his business.  He *
      jots down some notes into a weathered Logbook Of Death.*

                                  HENRY (V.O.)*
                    Cause of death -- Impaled by subway *
                    railing.  Pain level, 6.  *

      Henry rubs his neck, crosses out the 6 and writes 7.*

                                  HENRY (V.O.)*
                    Call it a 7.  This is my lab.  Over *
                    the years you could say I ve become *
                    a student of death.  Not out of *
                    some macabre obsession, mind you, *
                    but purely for research. You see, I *
                    need to find a way out of this, a *
                    key to unlock my curse.*

      CLICK.  FORENSIC TECHS snap photos of the bloody mess inside 
      the mangled subway car.  It s a zoo. COPS, FEDS, FORENSICS, 
      MTA WORKERS.                                                                                      12.


      ANGLE ON -- JO as she ducks under the yellow police tape.  
      Surveys the chaotic scene and pops a breath mint before 
      stepping INSIDE --

      THE MANGLED SUBWAY CAR -- where Forensic Techs in plastic 
      suits are bagging debris.  The contents of an open purse 
      spread across the floor: lipstick, wallet, a pack of candy; 
      KOROVKA.  Something catches Jo s eye.  She snaps on a pair of 
      rubber gloves and gently pulls out the blood stained POCKET 
      WATCH.  Eyes it curiously.  A FORENSIC TECH looks on.

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    Wow.  That thing looks pretty old.

                                  JO
                    Kind of fancy for a subway.  It s 
                    still ticking.

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    Can t say the same for whoever 
                    owned it.  No survivors in this 
                    car.  Back trains a bunch of 
                    injuries, some broken bones, but 
                    nothing serious.

                                  JO
                    What do they think happened?

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    Above my pay grade.  But, 
                      apparently not an act of terror or, 
                    Feds and Homeland Security would 
                    have the whole city on lock-down.

      Forensic Tech shuts up when he sees Jo s boss, LIEUTENANT 
      ROARK (50 s, recovering alcoholic, seen it all) approaching.

                                  LT ROARK
                    Was trying to reach you all night.

                                  JO
                    Sorry.  Hit the sack early.  My 
                    phone was on vibrate.  What 
                    happened?

                                  LT ROARK
                    ME on the scene thinks the 
                    conductor had a heart attack.  
                    Traces of vomit found. No 
                      hemorrhaging or bruising so they 
                    think he died before impact.

                                  JO
                    Don t they have automatic brakes?                                                                                    13.


                                  LT ROARK
                    This is an older car.  They were 
                    planning to change out the computer 
                    next week.  Bad luck. Fifteen dead.  
                    And I imagine we ll have a few more 
                      casualties at MTA when the Mayor s 
                    office is done with them.

                                  JO
                    What do you need from me?

                                  LT ROARK
                    Head down to the ME s office.  Get 
                    someone signed off on the cause of 
                    death for the conductor asap.  
                    There s gonna be a ton of eyeballs 
                    on this.  Just pray there s no 
                    alcohol in him. If there is it 
                    becomes manslaughter and we re 
                    looking at fourteen homicides.

                                  JO
                    Got it.

      She heads off.  Roark calls after her.

                                  LT ROARK
                    Jo, simple heart attack would be 
                    good.

                                  JO
                    Fingers crossed, boss.


      CLOSE ON a pair of beautiful blue eyes.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL -
      - we re staring down at the naked, cold, and very attractive 
      body of the RUSSIAN WOMAN on an autopsy table.  Henry, in a 
      lab coat, looks into her lifeless eyes.  On his lapel, an ID 
      Badge -- Dr. Henry Morgan, Medical Examiner.

                                  LUCAS (O.S.)
                    Man, what a waste.  

      LUCAS WAN (29; a young ME TECH and a bit of a hipster) peers 
      over his shoulder and shakes his head.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Just one more beautiful woman I 
                    won t have a chance with. 

      Henry gently closes her eyes.                                                                                      14.


                                  HENRY
                            (deflecting)
                    Remember what I told you, Lucas,  
                    don t fall for the corpses.  Too 
                    many skeletons in their closet.
                          (back to professional)
                    C-5.  Cervical fracture.  Died of 
                      asphyxiation.

      Henry walks off.  Lucas stares agape.

                                  LUCAS
                    How do you do that?

                                  HENRY
                    Educated guess.  Who s up first?

      Lucas points to a HEAVY-SET MALE (40 s) on a metal table.  

                                  LUCAS
                    Subway Conductor.  NYPD called 
                    twice to see if we have a cause of 
                    death.  Told them we have about 
                    twenty.  Spinal fracture, blunt 
                    trauma to the head, tracheal 
                      exsanguination, all probably post-
                    mortem.  Early diagnosis is cardiac 
                    arrest got him first.

      Henry switches off Lucas s music (The National) and puts on 
      some Bach -- ode to the Russian Woman.  Henry begins his prep-
      work.  Unrolls a set of antique tools (including an African 
      hunting knife).  Puts on a headset to record notes.  Sharpens 
      his knife and just before making the first incision says...

                                  HENRY
                    Lucky bastard...

                                  JO (O.S.)
                    How so?

      Henry turns to find -- Detective Jo Martinez, badge in hand.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Detective Jo Martinez.  You have a 
                    cause of death yet on the subway 
                      conductor?

                                  HENRY
                    Was just about to begin.  You re 
                    welcome to stick around. 

      Henry holds up the African Hunting knife and smiles.                                                                                     15.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    I ll make it quick.  Lucas here 
                    could get you a cup of coffee.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yes!  I could get you a latte or a 
                      frappy-type of beverage?  Pressed 
                    juice?  Does wonders for your 
                    colon... Clinically.  I ve seen a 
                    lot of colons.

      Lucas is a bit tongue tied.  No wonder he s single.

                                  HENRY
                    We don t get a lot of visitors down 
                    here.  Live ones, at least.

                                  JO
                    No.  Thank you. I m fine. I ll just 
                    hang out, if that s okay.

                                  LUCAS
                    I ll get an assortment.

      Lucas rushes out.  Henry points to a jar of Vick s Vapor rub.

                                  HENRY
                    Vick s over there.  It can get a 
                    little pungent.

                                  JO
                    I notice you don t use any.

                                  HENRY
                    I m accustomed to the aromas of 
                    death.  You might want to stand 
                    back.  Never know what kind of 
                    splash we get.

      Jo takes a cautious step back as Henry makes his first 
      incision.  Slicing from the neck down to the abdomen in what 
      is known as a Y-cut.  After he s cut through the initial 
      layer of skin he uses the African knife to saw the bone.  
      It s gruesome work, but Henry is a maestro. 

      Jo looks ill.  Not exactly the ideal cure for a hangover.  
      She pretends to browse some of the medical books.  Henry 
      glances up at her for a moment.  One look is all it takes...

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    I m sorry for your loss, Detective.                                                                                    16.


                                  JO
                    I think you re confused.  I didn t 
                    know any of the victims.

                                  HENRY
                    No.  I meant your husband.

      If the partially opened chest cavity wasn t enough to get 
      Jo s attention, this certainly did.

                                  JO
                    Excuse me?

                                  HENRY
                    Noticed the slight discoloration on 
                    your left ring finger.  Could be 
                    divorced, but most divorcee s don t 
                    wear their wedding band around 
                    their necks.

      Henry points to her chest, where her ring can be seen 
      dangling between two buttons on her shirt.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    I d put his death at under a year. 

      Henry stops working.  Looks up at her.  His concern genuine.  
      Jo studies this strange man holding a cleaver.  

                                  JO
                    How would you know that?

                                  HENRY
                    Well, you re pretty young to make 
                    homicide, so my assumption is your 
                    drinking is a recent development.  
                    Squinting suggests a sensitivity to 
                    light.  Slight decrease in 
                      respiratory function, you ve taken 
                    less than 8 breaths since you ve 
                    been here and the mascara under 
                    your right eye is crooked.

                                  JO
                    Was in a rush this morning.

                                  HENRY
                    And there s none under your left 
                    eye.

      Jo sneaks a quick peak at her reflection in a metal cabinet.  
      Checks her mascara.  Shit.                                                                                      17.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  Take a look at this.  
                    Realize this probably isn t the 
                    ideal cure for a hangover.

                                  JO
                    I m not hung-over.  What is it?

      Henry holds up with forceps a bloody, gnarled-up mush. As if 
      this substance wasn t gross enough, Henry puts it up to his 
      nose and takes a deep whiff.

                                  HENRY
                    Corned beef.  Probably his last 
                    meal.  Wouldn t be my choice, but 
                    I m sure he enjoyed it.  

      Henry places the mushed meat into a metal tray. 

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Greyish tissue in areas of the 
                      myocardium.  Plaque formation in 
                    the aortic arch.  If this man had 
                    lived any longer, he most certainly 
                    would have died of a heart attack.

                                  JO
                    So, you re saying he didn t die of 
                    a heart attack?

                                  HENRY
                    Of course not.  Didn t you look at 
                    the corned beef?  I m putting his 
                    last meal at one to two hours 
                    before the accident.  That would 
                    have been enough time for the 
                    hydrochloric acid to break down 
                    whatever was in his stomach, unless 
                    something slowed down his digestive 
                    process.  Look at this.

    He beckons her closer.  Jo peers into the open chest.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Blistering around his lungs.  He 
                    died of pulmonary edema. 

                                  JO
                          (writing)
                    So, that s the cause of death?                                                                                     18.


                                  HENRY
                    No.  That s the manner of death.  
                    Same way that if you get shot in 
                    the head, you technically die of a 
                    brain herniation.  Cause of death 
                    is different. I believe this man 
                    was poisoned.

                                  JO
                    Wait!  What?  This a homicide?  
                    That s your official diagnosis?

      Lucas returns with coffees.

                                  HENRY
                    Well, yes and no.  It s my 
                      assumption, but I ll need the tox 
                    report to confirm.  Could take up 
                    to two weeks.  But I have a pretty 
                    good track record if you want to 
                    get started on your investigation.

      Henry smiles.  Jo does not.

                                  LUCAS
                    It s crazy, actually.  Sometimes he 
                    doesn t need to open them up to 
                    tell how they died.  Like they 
                    speak to him.  It s kind of awesome 
                    and kind of creepy.  

                                  JO
                    You do realize the gravity of what 
                    you re saying?

                                  HENRY
                    I realize you now have fifteen 
                    homicides on your hands and a mass 
                    murderer to catch.  You might want 
                    to reconsider that coffee.

      Lucas holds up the tray.  As Jo wonders if this lunatic can 
      be trusted with a major accusation that would cause a shit-
      storm, the OFFICE PHONE RINGS.  Lucas answers it.

                                  LUCAS
                          (into phone)
                    OCME?.. Yeah, who s calling?
                          (holds up phone)
                    It s for you.  Says it s a friend.

                                  HENRY
                    Excuse me.                                                                                    19.


      Henry takes the phone from Lucas.  Lucas turns to Jo.

                                  LUCAS
                    That s weird.

                                  JO
                    Which part?

                                  LUCAS
                    He doesn t have any friends.

                                  HENRY
                          (into phone)
                    Hello.

      On the other end, AN ANONYMOUS VOICE -- measured and calm.

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Is this Henry Morgan?  Dr. Henry 
                    Morgan?

                                  HENRY
                    Speaking.

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Dr. Morgan, I have to say, talking 
                    to you is probably the most 
                    exciting thing that s ever happened 
                    to me.

                                  HENRY
                    That s nice.  For most people it s 
                    not even the high point of their 
                    day.  

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Oh, I m sure if they knew more 
                    about you their opinion would 
                    change.  Dr. Morgan, how did you 
                    survive that subway crash?

      Henry s face turns white.  Mouth goes dry. 

                                  HENRY
                    Um... I m not sure I know what 
                    you re talking about.

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Yes, you do. The one that killed 
                    everyone in the first car.  
                    Everyone, except you.  

      He grips the phone tightly and shields himself from Jo.                                                                                    20.


                                  HENRY
                          (curtly)
                    Who is this?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Henry, can I call you Henry?  You 
                    can t imagine how long I ve been 
                    looking for someone like you.

                                  HENRY
                    Someone like what?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    You don t have to pretend with me.  
                    You know what you are.  And now I 
                    do too.  See ya soon, Henry.

      Click.  Henry stares at the dead receiver in his hand.  For a 
      man who thought life could no longer surprise him, Henry 
      Morgan is speechless.

                                  HENRY
                    I um... have to... excuse me.

      Still wearing his blood stained lab coat, Henry rushes out.

                                  LUCAS
                    Like I said.  Kind of awesome and 
                    kind of creepy.

      Jo peers out in the hallway and watches as Henry disappears 
      down the hall -- looks like a man running for his life...

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    21.


                                        ACT TWO


    The photo is tossed into a suitcase along with clothes and 
      other emergency items.  Henry removes a slat of floorboard to 
      REVEAL -- a secret compartment.  Inside, CASH, PASSPORTS.  
    Abe enters.

                                  ABE
                    Before we go abandoning our entire 
                    lives and I cancel a very promising 
                    date, can we just talk this out?

                                  HENRY
                    What s on your mind?

                                  ABE
                    Are we sure whoever this person is, 
                    who called you, knows?

                                  HENRY
                    Abe, please.  He basically said it.  
                    Look, we got complacent.  Too much 
                    time in one place is dangerous.  

      Henry jogs down the staircase, Abe following behind. 


      Henry rushes down the rickety steps and finds his logbook of 
      death.  A few other necessary notes.  

                                  ABE
                    Where are we going this time? 

                                  HENRY
                    Completely your choice.  South of 
                    France?  Brussels?  How s your 
                    Dutch?

                                  ABE
                    A bit rusty.  And then what?

                                  HENRY
                    What we always do. Lay low.  
                    Outlive him.  Move on.                                                                                    22.


                                  ABE
                    You can, I can t.

      This stops Henry in his tracks.  Henry s heart sinks.  He 
      needs Abe for a lot of reasons.  They both know it.

                                  HENRY
                    You know I can t do this without 
                    you.

                                  ABE
                    Then stay!  We ll fight back!  Find 
                    out who he is.  What he s after.

                                  HENRY
                    What do you think he s after?! Abe, 
                    it s happened before.  I ve had 
                    every ounce of my blood drained!  
                    My organs dissected in the name of 
                    science.  I ve been hung for heresy-

                                  ABE
                    That was a long time ago.

                                  HENRY
                    Yes.  A hundred and seventy-two 
                    years.  I remember it well.  Hang 
                    me once shame on you, hang me 
                    twice...  I wish I could be as 
                    trusting as you, but I ve seen too 
                    much of this world.  I have to run, 
                    it s my only choice. 

                                  ABE
                    No.  That s just what you ve been 
                    telling yourself.  You re old 
                    enough to know you can t outrun 
                    your demons.

      Abe hands Henry the photograph of ABIGAIL from the desk.  

                                  HENRY
                    True, but I can avoid making new 
                    ones.

                                  ABE
                    And how do you do that?  Isolate 
                    yourself from the world?  Spend all 
                    day with corpses?  Never letting 
                    anyone get close.  I have news for 
                    you, you may not be able to die, 
                    but you haven t lived for a very 
                    long time.                                                                                    23.


      For the second time today, Henry is left speechless.  Abe 
      heads back up the rickety stairs.  

                                  ABE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  But if you want to run, 
                    you ll have to do without me.

      Henry stares down at the photo of Abigail.  His face reflects 
      off the glasses table.  Looks like he s in the picture beside 
      her.  Henry sighs.  Sits back down.


      Jo, DETECTIVE HANSON (30 s; no bullshit) and a few other 
      DETECTIVES are in Lt Roark s office getting debriefed.  

                                  LT ROARK
                    How sure are we this was a 
                      poisoning?

                                  JO
                    I checked with the Chief ME and she 
                    told me this guy Morgan is her 
                    best.  It s why she gave him the 
                    case. Says he s got a  sixth sense 
                    with death.   Second person who s 
                    told me that.

                                  LT ROARK
                    How long until we get the tox 
                    report back?

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON
                    Even if they expedite it, could 
                    take up to a week.  Maybe longer. 

                                  LT ROARK
                    And surveillance of the subway?

                                  JO
                    We have a team going through it 
                    now, but a bit of a needle in a 
                    haystack.  Without knowing the 
                    specific poison used, it s hard to 
                    determine when it happened.  Some 
                    poisons take effect in minutes 
                    others in weeks or even months.

                                  LT ROARK
                    Are we sure this isn t an act of 
                    terror?                                                                                    24.


                                  JO
                    At this point there s too many 
                    variables to leave any options off 
                    the table.

                                  LT ROARK
                    Check out the conductor, see if 
                    anyone had motive.  That s it.  I 
                    want updates on the hour.  
                          (as they leave...)
                    Jo, got a sec?  Close the door.  

      She closes the door, but doesn t step far inside.  Feels like 
      she s been summoned to the principal s office.

                                  JO
                    What s up, Lieutenant?

                                  LT ROARK
                    You missed the meeting last night.

                                  JO
                          (covering)
                    I m sorry about that, I went for a 
                    jog, then got caught up on a bunch 
                    of old case files --

                                  LT ROARK
                    I m not asking where you were.  
                    Just saying you weren t there. You 
                    don t want to do the program, fine.  
                    But recovery is something you can t 
                    beat on your own. Trust me on this.

      Roark points to a picture of his FAMILY.  WIFE, TWO SONS.

                                  LT ROARK (CONT D)
                    Now, I just look at it like I ve 
                    got two houses.  One, I m not 
                      particularly welcome at.

      She smiles.  Jo likes Roark, but he s still her boss.

                                  LT ROARK (CONT D)
                    I ve given you a fair amount of 
                    rope because of what you ve been 
                    through.  But it s been what, a 
                    year and a half?

                                  JO
                    Thirteen months.                                                                                    25.


                                  LT ROARK
                    Not saying you have to talk to me.  
                    But you do need to talk.

      Jo s gaze falls to her feet.  Not comfortable opening up to 
      anyone, especially not her boss.

                                  LT ROARK (CONT D)
                    Clean it up, Detective.  I need you 
                    sharp.  No more rope.  Understood?
                          (Jo nods)
                    You still haven't grasped the 
                    talking part.

                                  JO
                    Yes.  Sorry.  Understood.


      Henry carries his suitcase back up the stairs where Abe is 
      making dinner.  Drinking wine.  

                                  HENRY
                    It occurred to me that the weather 
                    in Belgium is terrible this time of 
                    year.
                          (Abe nods)
                    Do not gloat!

                                  ABE
                    You re misreading my facial 
                      expressions.  This isn t gloating, 
                    it s pride.

                                  HENRY
                    Uck.  Even worse.  Just stop it, I 
                    hate you thinking you ve won with 
                    all your ridiculous psycho-babble.  
                    I d rather have a blunt instrument 
                    shoved into my spleen.  That s 
                    speaking from experience. 
                          (he sniffs, re: wine)
                    Is that an  82 Pomerol?

                                  ABE
                    It is.  Too bad you quit drinking 
                    53 years ago.

                                  HENRY
                    I m reconsidering my stance on a 
                    variety of subjects. 

      Abe hands him a glass.  Henry takes a sip, savoring.                                                                                    26.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Now, it s been awhile so you have 
                    to remind me, how do I fight back?

      Off Abe s smile...


      Jo pours herself a cup of coffee (her fifth).  ON MONITORS, 
      RESEARCHERS scroll through the footage from stations PRIOR to 
      the accident.  ANITA (30 s; bookish) runs the room. 

                                  ANITA
                    This can be a lot more effective if 
                    we know exactly what to look for.

                                  JO
                    Anyone getting on or off the train 
                    that looks suspicious. 

                                  ANITA
                    With that kind of directive, should 
                    have something in no time.
                          (off Jo s look)
                    Sorry.  Jo, this could take days.  
                    Why don t you go home?  I ll call 
                    you if I find anything.  

                                  JO
                    I m fine.

                                  ANITA
                    The hovering makes my team 
                      uncomfortable.

      ON MONITOR, something catches Jo s eye.  She leaves the room.

                                  ANITA (CONT D)
                    Jo! I was kidding.  Hover away!

      Jo returns with a file folder.  Inside, are PHOTOS of the 
      ACCIDENT.  Blood stained walls, contents of a purse, the 
      ORNATE POCKET-WATCH.

                                  JO
                    Scroll back on that monitor.  I 
                    want to see the guy winding the 
                    pocket watch.  I can t make out his 
                    face.  

      ON SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE - we see a MAN look down at his 
      pocket watch, his face obscured from the camera.  He weaves 
      through the crowd, into the dark tunnel and onto the train.                                                                                     27.


                                  ANITA
                    He misses every security camera.

                                  JO
                    Back it up... Stop there.

      They pause the footage, as he passes a HOMELESS MAN.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Can you push in on the sunglasses?

      In the refection of the Homeless Man s sunglasses we see -- 
      HENRY S FACE.  ON JO -- Holy shit!!!

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    You ve got to be kidding me.

                                  ANITA
                    What?

                                  JO
                    I just saw him in the ME s office 
                    today. 

                                  ANITA
                    Not surprised, everyone who was 
                    sitting in that first car died. 

                                  JO
                    He s not a corpse.  He works there.  
                    He s alive.

                                  ANITA
                    Really?!  Did he tell you how he 
                    survived the crash?

                                  JO
                    Nope.  Didn t even mention he was 
                    in it.

                                  ANITA
                    Huh.  That the kind of suspicious 
                    thing you were looking for?

                                  JO
                    Yes, this would qualify.

      Jo stares at the monitor, her eyes inches away from Henry.  


      Henry heads into work.  Focused, determined.  He freezes 
      inside his small cluttered office when he finds a MANILA 
      ENVELOPE on his desk. Written in Sharpie are the words -- To: 
      Henry.  From: Your Fan.

      Henry races out of the office, where Lucas, (with earbuds in) 
      is prepping a BODY.

                                  HENRY
                    Lucas!  Do you know how this 
                    envelope got on my desk?

                                  LUCAS
                    Mail, I guess.

                                  HENRY
                    There s no postage.  It was hand 
                      delivered.  Has anyone come in the 
                    office this morning?

                                  LUCAS
                    Just that cop from yesterday.  The 
                    hot one.  She was asking about you.  
                    Told her I didn t know anything, 
                    which considering we ve been 
                    working together for three years is 
                    oddly true.

      Lucas gets back to work.  Henry retreats into his office, 
      locking the door behind him.  With a deep breath he gently 
      opens the envelope.  Slowly, he removes... an 8x10 
      PHOTOGRAPH.  Henry s eyes go wide.  He stares, frozen.  The 
      blood draining from his face.

      In his hands, an old black and white photo of... HENRY and 
      ABIGAIL.  Taken in 1955.  They re smiling.  In love.  
      Although Henry looks exactly the same age, there s something 
      different about him.  More hopeful.  A much happier man.  He 
      falls back into his chair, lost in thought --


      POP! A flashbulb explodes.  Henry and Abigail break their 
      pose, as Henry spins Abigail across the dance floor.  An 
      orchestra plays Mozart;  A Little Night Music. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                          (British accent)
                    Nice footwork, Dr. Morgan.                                                                                    29.


                                  HENRY
                    Well, I ve had a lot of practice 
                    Mrs. Morgan.

      Abigail pushes him playfully.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Please don t remind me.

      He pulls her in tightly.  Looks into her eyes.  Dead serious.

                                  HENRY
                    All of it.  Everything I ve 
                    learned, everything I ve ever done 
                    was so I d be worthy of you. 

      One look into Henry s eyes and we can tell he means it.  As 
      he leans in to kiss her --


      KNOCK, KNOCK.  Henry snaps back to reality to see Lucas 
      standing in the doorway.  He covers the photo.

                                  LUCAS
                    Going on a coffee run.  You want 
                    anything?

                                  HENRY
                    No.  I m fine. 

      Lucas lingers in the doorway.

                                  LUCAS
                    You know, it is a little weird that 
                    we hardly know each other.  Maybe 
                    we could grab a pint one night?  
                    Hear some music?  I know you dig 
                    your classical stuff, but maybe 
                    something from this century?

                                  HENRY
                    No, thank you.

                                  LUCAS
                    Okay...  Appreciate the candor. 

      On his way out, Lucas points to the back of the picture.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    What s QED?
                          (off Henry s look)
                    On that paper.                                                                                    30.


      Sticking out of the manila envelope is a newspaper article.  
      Taped to it with a Post-it is written; Henry Morgan, QED.  
      Lucas reaches for it.  Henry tries to stop him --

                                  HENRY
                    Wait!  No!!

                                  LUCAS
                    It s okay.  Chill.  Just a 
                    newspaper clipping.

      Lucas slowly pulls out the article.  Henry braces for what it 
      reveals... It s a headline from yesterday s train crash.  The 
      caption reads,  Tragedy on Subway. 15 killed. 

      Henry exhales.  Temporarily relieved.  Then his mind begins 
      to race.  Putting the pieces together. 

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Don t they mean MD?

                                  HENRY
                    QED.  Quod erat demonstrandum. It s 
                    used in mathematical proofs.  
                    Means, Which was to be 
                      demonstrated...
                          (realizing)
                    ...He wanted to prove it was true.  
                    He did it!

                                  LUCAS
                    Who did what?

      Henry paces.  His mind racing.  Then, he gets an idea.

                                  HENRY
                    Is the Subway Conductor s corpse 
                    still here?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah.  He s in a cooler.

                                  HENRY
                    ... You know what Lucas, I would 
                    love a coffee.  Do you mind?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah, sure.  What do you want? 

                                  HENRY
                    Something frothy, or frappy.  
                    Whatever you re having.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                  HENRY (CONT'D)
                    And then we should socialize 
                    sometime.  Go see a band.  Maybe 
                    jazz or... um, rap.

                                  LUCAS
                    Um, cool.  Okay, I ll look into it.

      Lucas smiles.  Genuinely psyched.  When Lucas is gone, Henry 
      races over to the CADAVER REFRIGERATORS. He YANKS open a 
      container revealing -- the dead SUBWAY CONDUCTOR.

                                  HENRY
                    Just need to borrow a bit of your 
                    blood...

      Next, Henry JAMS a needle into the corpse s femoral artery, 
    but his circulatory system is frozen.  The man has been in 
      rigor-mortis for hours.  With a bit of strain, Henry pumps 
    the dead man s ankle towards his groin, essentially  milking  
    him for blood.  Harder and harder, Henry pumps his leg until 
      eventually, a little blood trickles into the syringe.

      Henry smiles.  It s working....


      Detective Hanson hands Jo a file.  Inside, is Henry s face.

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON 
                    From everything I can gather, this 
                    guy is a real whack-job.  Went to a 
                    vaguely accredited medical school 
                    in Guam.  Graduated in just two 
                    years.  Prior to that, nada.  
                    Checked his references, they re all 
                    dead ends.  

                                  JO
                    So before getting a job at the 
                    biggest medical examiner s office 
                    in the country, no one had ever 
                    heard of him?

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON 
                    Found one previous employer in 
                    Germany.  You know what his last 
                    gig was... grave digger.  Hand to 
                    God.  You couldn t draw up a 
                    creepier dude.

                                  JO
                    How the hell did he get hired?                                                                                    32.


                                  DETECTIVE HANSON 
                    How should I know?  Check with HR.

      Hanson walks off, Jo stares at Henry s picture.

                                  JO
                    Who are you?


      Henry races through the apartment talking quickly.  He s 
      energized, awakened.  

                                  ABE
                    I m confused, what does QED have to 
                    do with it?

                                  HENRY
                    It means, which has to be --

                                  ABE
                      Demonstrated.  It s a proof. I know 
                    what it means.

                                  HENRY
                    Then what aren t you getting?!  
                    Abe, he killed the conductor to 
                    prove I couldn t die.

                                  ABE
                    Aren t there a lot easier ways to 
                    do that?  Come up behind you in the 
                    street and bang.

                                  HENRY
                    Where s the flair in that?  He s 
                    leaving clues.  He wants me to find 
                    him.  If I can figure out what kind 
                    of poison he used, then I can get a 
                    time frame for when the injection 
                    took place.  Once we know when he 
                    killed him, we figure out who he 
                    is!

                                  ABE
                    Okay, but to figure out the type of 
                    poison, you still need to wait for 
                    the toxicology report.

                                  HENRY
                    There may be a faster way.

      Henry holds out the vial of blood.  A crazed look in his eye.                                                                                    33.


                                  ABE
                    No.  Absolutely not.  

      Henry smiles.  Nods.  Oh, yes!


      A shirtless Henry is strapped down to the exam table.  
      Electrodes on his chest hooked up to an EKG monitor.  Abe 
      sits by his side, syringe in hand.

                                  ABE
                    Are you sure you want to do this?  
                    The toxin in his blood is still 
                    potent, you re going to feel every 
                    bit of this.

                                  HENRY
                    It s the only way to know 
                      immediately what he used.

      This is hard for Abe.  Doesn t want to see Henry suffer. 
      Henry nods.  He s ready.  Abe is about to inject the blood --

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Wouldn t it be ironic if this time 
                      I actually die?

                                  ABE
                      Hysterical.

                                  HENRY
                    Okay, I m ready...

      Abe takes a deep breath.  Slowly injects the poison.  PUSH IN 
      ON HENRY S EYES until the whites fill the frame.  

                                                              FLASH TO WHITE --


      Henry sits on one side of the interrogation table, Jo the 
      other.  Between them, the pocket-watch.  Behind the mirrored 
      window stands Lieutenant Roark, Detective Hanson and OTHERS.  

                                  JO
                    This watch belong to you?
                          (Henry nods)
                    Any idea how it ended up in the 
                      demolished subway car?

                                  HENRY
                    Might as well come clean... I got 
                    onto the subway and was lucky 
                    enough to find a seat beside a very 
                      attractive Russian woman.  We 
                    started chatting, and well, I made 
                    an advance -- it s not easy to meet 
                    women in an ME s office -- she 
                    wasn t interested.  It was a little 
                    awkward, so I moved to another car.  
                    After the crash, I raced out with 
                    everyone else, thought it was an 
                    act of terror.  

                                  JO
                    Huh.  And it didn t occur to you to 
                    mention any of this when I was in 
                    your office?

                                  HENRY
                    It occurred to me.  But I knew it 
                    wasn t relevant, so I didn t want 
                    to waste your time.  I m a private 
                    person. 

                                  JO
                    I can understand why.  We obtained 
                    a warrant for your residence.  
                    Found your secret cave.

                                  HENRY
                    My laboratory.  Yes?  

                                  JO
                    Quite a collection you ve got down 
                    there.  Human organs, some old 
                    torture devices --

      She tosses some photos in front of him.                                                                                    36.


                                  HENRY
                    Those are for sex...
                          (shrugs)
                    Sometimes you need to push the 
                    envelope.

      Jo refuses to let this guy throw her off her game. 

                                  JO
                    Also found a bunch of hazardous 
                    toxins.

                                  HENRY
                    All perfectly legal. I experiment 
                    with all kinds of poisons, nerve 
                    agents, algae, bacteria, even have 
                    a tank of immortal jellyfish.  All 
                    in an effort to understand the 
                    great mystery of death.  It is, 
                    after all, my stock in trade.

                                  JO
                    What happens if the tox report 
                    comes back and we can link you to 
                    the poison?

                                  HENRY
                    You won t.  Based on my findings, 
                    if I had to hazard a guess, I d say 
                    it was aconite.  Something I 
                    stopped experimenting with years 
                    ago.  If I was going to kill 
                    someone, I d use polonium.  Doesn t 
                    present for weeks, better for an 
                    alibi.  Aconite on the other hand, 
                    works extremely quickly, the killer 
                    had to get up close and...

      Henry trails off.  His mind racing.  Jo waits.

                                  JO
                    And what?

                                  HENRY
                          (realizing)
                    The killer was on the train, I 
                    suspect.  At some point, at least.

      Henry realizes he s making Jo s case for her.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Okay, I did it.                                                                                    37.


                                  JO
                    Is that a confession?

                                  HENRY
                    No.  A hypothetical.  Work through 
                    it with me.  Homicide by thirty 
                    two, I assume you re fairly good at 
                    deductive reasoning.

                                  JO
                    Thirty one.  You got on the train, 
                    poisoned the conductor.  Motive 
                    we ll work out later.

                                  HENRY
                    Fair enough.

                                  JO
                    You knew he was going to die so you 
                    went into a back car and braced 
                    yourself.  Then, piled out with the 
                    crowd.  Few hours later you went to 
                    work, like nothing happened.

                                  HENRY
                    Where I was lucky enough to meet 
                    you.  You should have seen the look 
                    on your face, aside from having a 
                    slightly greenish hue, for whatever 
                    reason... You were literally 
                    praying it was a heart attack.  

                                  JO
                    But you re the one who suggested 
                      poisoning.

                                  HENRY
                    So, Detective, what conclusions can 
                    you draw?

                                  JO
                    Either you re a complete sociopath 
                    who really wants to get caught, 
                    which I m not ruling out --

                                  HENRY
                    Nor should you.

                                  JO
                    Or... The real killer is still out 
                    there.                                                                                     38.


                                  HENRY
                    Seems like sound logic to me.  Then 
                    the only question is, just how 
                    crazy am I?

      Jo tries to get a read on him.  Something doesn t add up.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    As you ponder, I m sure one thing 
                    we can both agree on, is you don t 
                    have enough to hold me.  At this 
                    point.

                                  JO
                    True.  You re a free man, Dr. 
                    Morgan.  But, don t go far. 

                                  HENRY
                    You have my word.


      The body of the SUBWAY CONDUCTOR is once again splayed out on 
      the autopsy table.  Lucas stands over his shoulder.

                                  LUCAS
                    What are we looking for?

                                  HENRY
                    An entry point.  The killer had to 
                    inject him somehow. 

      Behind the Conductor s ear, Henry finds a tiny red mark, with 
      some bruising around it.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Here it is!  Look at the bruise.

                                  LUCAS
                    How do you know that wasn t made 
                    during the crash?

                                  HENRY
                    There wouldn t be a mark.  Once he 
                    was killed his blood stopped 
                    pumping.  Better question: Why 
                    would you let someone inject you 
                    behind the ear?  Unless, you didn t 
                    let them.  Come here!                                                                                    39.


      Henry grabs Lucas forcefully.  Puts one arm around his neck 
      and mock-injects with the other.  

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Don t just stand there!  Struggle.

                                  LUCAS
                    Um... I m uncomfortable with this.  

      Lucas tries to free himself but Henry holds on tight.  His 
      fingers touching the back of Lucas s neck.

                                  HENRY
                    Got it!  Grab the silver nitrate.

      Rubbing his neck, Lucas fetches the Silver Nitrate.  
      Delicately, Henry dabs some on the Subway Conductor s neck.  
      He switches off the lights.  Puts on a sunglasses.  Using a 
      BLACK ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT, Henry scans the neck.  As the light 
      reflects off Henry s glasses, he smiles.  We see, a perfectly 
      intact fingerprint...


      Detective Hanson, Jo and Roark are mid-argument about Henry.

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON
                    Are you kidding me?  You actually 
                    believe this guy?!

                                  JO
                    When you look at the evidence 
                    against him, we have nothing.  
                    There s no connection to the subway 
                    driver.  My gut says it s not him.

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON
                    Come on.  He s a total freak.  A 
                    grave digger who collects poisons.  
                    Who knows what he s capable of?

                                  JO
                    I m not saying he s not capable.  
                    He is without a doubt the weirdest, 
                    creepist, most unusual person I ve 
                    ever met.  I m simply saying if 
                    he s our only suspect, maybe we 
                    should start looking for another.

                                  HENRY (O.S.)
                    Couldn t agree more.

      All heads turn to see Henry, standing in the doorway.                                                                                     40.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Might I have a word, Detective?


      Once alone, Jo tries to smooth over what Henry overheard.

                                  JO
                    When I said creepiest, I meant that 
                    in the nicest possible --

                                  HENRY
                      Detective, I assure you, I ve been 
                    called worse.  Here.

      Henry hands Jo a photo of the fingerprint.

                                  JO
                    What s this?

                                  HENRY
                      Fingerprint I lifted off the corpse 
                    of the subway conductor.  Thought 
                    you could run it through your 
                    system.  That is, if you re still 
                    open to other options.

                                  JO
                    Where d you take the print from?

                                  HENRY
                    His nape.
                          (off Jo s quizzical look)
                    Back of his neck.

                                  JO
                    I know what a nape is.  Why did you 
                    look for a print there?

                                  HENRY
                    I suspect the killer had to 
                    forcibly inject him with a hand 
                    around his neck.

                                  JO
                    A hand could have been there for a 
                    variety of reasons.  Could be his 
                    masseuse, could be his lover.

                                  HENRY
                    With all due respect to the 
                    deceased, we both saw him naked.  
                    Didn t strike me as the type of man 
                    to incite that kind of passion.                                                                                    41.


      Jo s still not sure if she can trust this guy.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Look, if I m wrong you still have 
                    one very legitimate suspect.

      Henry smiles.  Jo, sighs.  Grabs the fingerprint from Henry.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jo uses her flashlight to illuminate the dark, dingy space.  
      Inside -- a MAKESHIFT LAB.  Bottles, chemicals everywhere.   
      On the lab station WHITE POWDER and chemicals.  Henry sniffs 
      the chemicals.

                                  HENRY
                    Aconite.  One touch is lethal.

                                  JO
                    Back out, don t touch a thing. 

      But Henry keeps going in.  He s looking for clues.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Henry!  Now!

      Suddenly HEADLIGHTS APPEAR on them.  They duck.  Car door 
      SLAMS.  Footsteps approach.  The door creaks open.  Jo puts a 
      finger to her lips.  A MAN (40 s; imposing) enters.  He goes 
      to his work station.  Stops.  Senses something.  Jo POPS out 
      from behind the shelves.  Gun drawn -- 

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Freeze!  NYPD!                                                                                      43.


                                  MAN
                    Take it easy.  Nice and easy...

                                  JO
                    Hands where I can see them!  Now!

      Slowly, the Man turns.  As he does, he quickly FLINGS A TEST 
      TUBE AT JO!  She blocks it with her arm, as the liquid SPRAYS 
      HER HAND, burning her skin!  The MAN races out.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Ah!  It s on my arm!  I have to 
                    wash it off!

      Henry watches as the Man race to his car.  He wants to follow 
      him, but if he does, Jo dies.

                                  HENRY
                    No don t wash it! It ll get into 
                    your pores!  We need a neutralizer.

      Henry quickly scans the chemicals on the table.  Finds a 
      bottle labeled,  Ethanol.   He quickly squirts it on Jo s 
      hands.  Then, lights a Bunsen burner.  Before Jo can realize 
      what he s doing he LIGHTS JO S HAND ON FIRE!  

                                  JO
                    What are you doing?!

      With her hand engulfed in flames, Henry rushes Jo to an old 
      sink.  He douses her arm in water.  They fall back soaking 
      wet and exhausted.

                                  HENRY
                    Sorry about that, but trust me, 
                    aconite is a terrible way to die.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FOUR


      FORENSIC TECHS in Hazmat suits are SNAPPING photos, etc.


      Police have cordoned off the house.  Jo s hand is bandaged by 
    an EMT.  LT. Roark and Detective Hanson go through the 
      details they ve learned.  Hanson reads off a note pad.

                                  DETECTIVE HANSON
                    Hans Koehler; turns out he used to 
                    be a chemist for Dow until three 
                    years ago when his wife, Karen had 
                    an accident falling onto the subway 
                    tracks.  The driver of the train 
                    that killed her, same conductor who 
                    was just poisoned.  Koehler sued 
                    the city but lost because his 
                    wife s BO content was over the 
                    legal limit.  He took a job with 
                    MTA three months later.  Guy s been 
                    planning this for a long time. 

                                  LT ROARK 
                    Well, now he s in the system with 
                    FBI, Homeland Security, FAA.  We ll 
                    get him.
                          (to Jo)
                    How s the hand?

                                  JO
                    Slightly charred but I ll live.  
                    Thanks to him.

    She nods across to Henry, studying a bulletin board with 
      SEVERAL PICTURES OF A WOMAN (30 s.)  She walks over to him.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    You seem confused.

                                  HENRY
                    It doesn t make any sense.  The 
                    Subway Conductor killed his wife?  

                                  JO
                    Don t look shocked. People kill for 
                    a lot worse reasons than revenge.                                                                                    45.


                                  HENRY
                    Yes.  It s just... I thought he was 
                    after something else.  I was wrong.

      This means the person who KNOWS is still out there.

                                  JO
                    I realize this must be a new 
                      experience for you, but most of us 
                    are wrong all the time.

                                  HENRY
                    I m aware.

                                  JO
                    Come on.  Buy ya a cup of coffee.
                          (Henry doesn t budge)
                    This isn t a lasting commitment, 
                    just a hot beverage.


      Henry stirs his coffee.  He s lost, still trying to figure 
      out who the mysterious stranger could be. 

                                  JO
                    Don t worry, Koehler will turn up.

                                  HENRY
                    You think so?

                                  JO
                    Facial recognition software. Bank 
                    accounts frozen. Much harder to 
                    disappear in today s world.  

                                  HENRY
                    Huh.  That s interesting.

                                  JO
                    You can drop the bit, Henry.

                                  HENRY
                    What bit is that?

                                  JO
                    The, Hmmm.  Wow, that s so 
                      interesting...  You know all about 
                      disappearing.

                                  HENRY
                    I m not sure I follow.                                                                                    46.


                                  JO
                    No?  Medical school in Guam.  Not 
                    one previous employer has ever 
                    heard of you and you carry around a 
                    three hundred year old pocket 
                    watch.  So, Henry Morgan, what s 
                    your story?  You can be honest.

      Henry studies Jo. Decides to come clean. 

                                  HENRY
                    Won t bore you with all the 
                    details.  The watch was a gift.  
                    Legend has it, it belonged to a 
                    doctor seeking passage on a ship 
                    from Africa.  It was given to him 
                    by his father, had been in the 
                    family for generations. Anyway, the 
                    ship sank along with everyone in it 
                    and it was seemingly lost forever.  
                    Years later, it was recovered by 
                    treasure hunters at the bottom of 
                    the sea.  Someone bought it at 
                    auction and gave it to me.

      Henry didn t exactly answer her question. Jo lets it slide.

                                  JO
                    Generous gift.  This person must 
                    have really cared about you.

                                  HENRY
                    I suppose she did... But, then she 
                    came to her senses and left me.

                                  JO
                    They do that.

                                  HENRY
                    What happened to your husband?

      Jo hasn t opened up to ANYONE about this. But there s 
      something about this strange guy.  It s in his eyes.  Maybe 
      it s pain, maybe experience, but for some reason, Jo talks.

                                  JO
                    He was a lawyer.  Was in DC for a 
                      deposition.  Went for a run on the 
                    hotel treadmill and had a heart 
                    attack.  When the phone rang, 
                    before I even answered it, I felt 
                    this shiver.  You know what phantom 
                    limb syndrome is?  Like with 
                    amputees.

                                  JO (CONT'D)
                          (Henry nods)
                    There s this part of him I can 
                    still feel.  I want it to go away.

                                  HENRY
                    It won t.

      Their eyes meet.  Jo nods.

                                  JO
                    Thanks.  That makes me feel much 
                    better.

                                  HENRY
                    I thought you wanted me to drop the 
                    bit.  Just be honest?

                                  JO
                    A few things you could sugarcoat.

      Henry smiles.  For the first time in a long while, it s a 
      genuine one.  Jo smiles too.  Her CELL RINGS.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah...  Be right there.
                          (to Henry)
                    They found more poison in his lab.


      FORENSIC TECHS examine the chemicals in Koehler s lab.  

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    These vats were full until about 
                    six hours ago.  The spectrometer 
                    says it was aconite.  Based on the 
                    volume I d say about two gallons.  

                                  HENRY
                    To provide context, to kill the 
                    subway conductor, you would need 
                    about this much.

      Henry holds his fingers a millimeter apart.

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    We also found traces of ethanol. 
                    Guess he was cleaning the casks.

                                  HENRY
                    Or, he wanted to make it soluble.                                                                                    48.


                                  JO
                    Why would he do that?

                                  HENRY
                    To produce a mass quantity.  Maybe 
                    he s looking for a bigger audience.

      The ramifications become immediately clear. Jo heads off.

                                  JO
                    I better call Homeland Security.

                                  HENRY
                    Where would he go to reach the most 
                    people?

      On the bulletin board are architectural drawings.  A map of 
      the Zodiac but the drawing is upside down.  Henry tilts his 
      head to get a better look.

                                  FORENSIC TECH
                    I know, it s upside down.  Idiot.

      Henry studies the drawing, then the photo of the wife.  

                                  HENRY
                    Where was his wife killed?

      One of the DETECTIVES checks through his notes.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Fell off the platform at 42nd and 
                    Park.  Grand Central.

      As Henry stares at the drawing, FLASH TO --


      A BLUR as people walk through the terminal, pointing up at 
      the ceiling and laughing.  Henry (in period clothes and hat) 
      stops in the middle of the crowd and looks up.  Standing atop 
      scaffolding are TWO PAINTERS.  Above them, on the ceiling of 
      Grand Central, the Zodiac sign is painted backwards.


                                  HENRY
                    On the ceiling of Grand Central 
                    Terminal the Zodiac is painted 
                    upside down!  They said it was to 
                    give the perspective of God, but it 
                    was an accident.  They hired a 
                    bunch of drunks.                                                                                    49.


                                  JO
                    How do you know all this?

                                  HENRY
                    Bit of a history buff.  I could be 
                    wrong, but if I m not, we re both 
                    going to be very busy...


      POLICE scour the terminal.  UNDERCOVER AGENTS work jobs, mop 
      etc, wear earpieces. UNIFORMED OFFICERS hold Koehler s PHOTO.

                                  JO
                    We should shut down the terminal.

                                  LT ROARK
                    Based on what?  His hunch? 

      Roark nods in the direction of Henry.  Staring up at the 
      ceiling, lost in his own world.  Henry tries to search the 
      crowd, but as the faces pass him, they slowly start to MORPH 
      into FACES OF ANOTHER ERA. The  40 s, 30 s,  10 s...  

      A VIOLINIST plays.  His open case filled with bills.  
      Mozart s  A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC  echoes through the cavernous 
      hall.  Henry drifts back...


      We pick up where we left off.  Henry and Abigail, dancing.  
       A Little Night Music  plays.

                                  HENRY
                    ... everything I ve ever done was 
                    so I d be worthy of you. 

      Henry leans in to kiss her but Abigail breaks away. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Stop it.  That s not true, Henry.

                                  HENRY
                    Oh, but it is, Mrs. Morgan.  Trust 
                    me, I ve done the research and I 
                    love you more than I ve ever loved 
                    anything in this world.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    I ll be gone someday and you won t.

                                  HENRY
                    Please, Abigail.  Can t we just 
                    have this moment --                                                                                    50.


                                    ABIGAIL
                    Henry, listen to me.  Everything 
                    you are, everything you ve learned 
                    is for something bigger.  You were 
                    made like this for a reason, and I 
                    love you, but it wasn t for me.


      Someone BUMPS into Henry, snapping him back to PRESENT.  
      Henry watches as PEOPLE walk through the busy terminal.  
      COUPLES kiss.  FAMILIES walk hand in hand, smiling.  PEOPLE 
      wheel luggage, OTHERS on their phones... all BREATHING.

      A MAN tosses a coin into the VIOLINIST S case.  Misses. It 
      rolls along the floor and disappears into a vent.  For Henry, 
      the pieces fall into place.  He takes off.  Jo follows.  


      Henry races up the old brass spiral staircase, Jo behind.

                                  JO
                    Henry, did you see Koehler?

                                  HENRY
                    No, but I realized something.  All 
                    the people down there are 
                      breathing!  

                                  JO
                    Very observant!  Why are we running 
                    upstairs?

                                  HENRY
                    He made the toxin soluble so it 
                    could be airborne.  The ventilation 
                    system!


      The overheard fluorescent lights of the hospital.  Jo fades 
      in and out as she s wheeled through the corridor.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Early morning light streams in through the window.  Jo 
      squints, slowing awakening.  Her shoulder bandaged, IV in her 
      arm.  Backlit by the sun, almost angelic, is Henry.

                                  HENRY
                    It lives.

      Jo winces as she sits up.  

                                  JO
                    What happened?

                                  HENRY
                    Well, to summarize, you were shot, 
                    and Koehler decided to take his own 
                    life.  He jumped off the roof.

                                  JO
                    What about the poison?

                                  HENRY
                    Guess he thought better of it.

                                  JO
                    That doesn t make any sense.

                                  HENRY
                    People can t have a change of 
                    heart?  Gaze into the abyss and 
                    realize the futility of it all?

                                  JO
                    Not him.  He killed too easily.  
                    His mind was made up long before he 
                    got on that roof.

                                  HENRY
                    Well, I can be very persuasive.
                          (Jo s not buying it)
                    Okay.  What do you think happened?

                                  JO
                    I was shot and then I thought... 
                    you both fell off the roof.                                                                                    54.


                                  HENRY
                    Both of us?  Now, how is that 
                    possible?  Trust me, I d like to be 
                    a lot more heroic, but I assure you 
                    that s the morphine talking.

      Jo rubs her wounded shoulder.  Something is off, she just 
      doesn t know what.  She stares at this strange man sitting on 
      the edge of her bed.  

                                  JO
                    There s something you re not 
                    telling me.

      Henry studies her.  Only a handful of people in Henry s long 
      life have ever learned his secret.  Will Jo be one of them?  
      The PHONE RINGS.  

                                  JO (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?... Uh, yeah.
                          (holds out the phone)
                    It s for you.

      With a shrug, Henry takes the phone.

                                  HENRY
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    I just wanted to make sure you were 
                    alright.  That was a nasty spill 
                    you took last night.

      With the cord tying him close to Jo, Henry has nowhere to 
      hide.  He flashes her the one minute sign.

                                  HENRY
                          (fake smiles; into phone)
                    Yes, fine, thank you.  What is it 
                    you want?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Same thing you want, Henry.  Death.  
                    But that doesn t seem to be an 
                    option for either of us.

      Holy shit!!!  The blood drains from Henry s face...

                                  HENRY
                    I don t understand.  What are you 
                    saying?                                                                                    55.


                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    We re the same, you and I.  We 
                    share the same pain, same curse, 
                    same affliction.

                                  HENRY
                    How is that possible?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE
                    I m afraid I m as lost as you.  But 
                    maybe we can help each other.

      With Henry s mouth completely dry, the words barely come out.

                                  HENRY
                    And how would we do that?

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Long term, perhaps we find a 
                    solution to our problem.  Short 
                    term, as long as we re here, might 
                    as well keep life interesting.  I 
                    must confess, I find it much more 
                      pleasurable to be bad than good.  

                                  HENRY
                    You re insane.

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Oh, that ship sailed a long time 
                    ago.  We re soulmates, Henry.  
                    We ve got eternity together.  Might 
                    as well have some fun with it...

      Click.  Henry stares at the dead receiver.  Looks like he s 
      just spoken to a ghost.  Jo can tell he s rattled.  Shaken, 
      Henry backs towards the door.

                                  HENRY
                    I better go.

                                  JO
                    Henry, you okay?

                                  HENRY
                    I m not the one who was shot.

                                  JO
                    I know.

      Henry thinks about it.  He s endured just about anything this 
      world can throw at you and yet he s still here.  Henry nods.                                                                                    56.


                                  HENRY
                    I ll survive.  


      Henry wanders down the long hallway, dazed.  A MAN on a 
      gurney is wheeled quickly past.  

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    I ve seen a lot of death...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Henry (in army scrubs and surgical mask) pumps furiously on a 
      wounded SOLDIER S chest on an operating table.

                                  HENRY
                    I m losing him!  Come on...

      Blood seeps out of the soldier s mouth as he expires.


      CLOSE ON -- Henry fingers, as he chops parsley expertly with *
      chef s knife.  A garnish that he sprinkles atop some homemade *
      soup.  He carries the bowl over to the kitchen table.  Puts *
      it before Abe.  *

      Abe squeezes Henry s fingers (just as the little baby did *
      many years before) as we slowly PAN UP Abe s arm where we *
      notice -- the SAME FADED NUMBERS tattooed on Abe s forearm.  *
      Henry kisses the top of Abe s head.*

                                  HENRY (V.O.)*
                    The problem with living for 200 
                    years isn t the loneliness or the 
                    pain or the loss -- okay sure it s 
                    those things -- but what really 
                    gets you is when life ceases to 
                    surprise you.

      There s a KNOCK on the door.  Giving the board a last hard 
      glance, Henry answers it to find -- Jo, her arm in a sling.

                                  HENRY
                    Hi.  

                                  JO
                    Hey.  I was in the neighborhood and 
                    thought I d return this to you.

      She hands over Henry s POCKET WATCH.

                                  JO (CONT D)
                    Figured it was pretty valuable.

      Henry rubs his finger along the face.  It means a lot to him.

                                  HENRY
                    It is.  Thank you.

      They linger awkwardly in the doorway.

                                  ABE
                    Invite her in!                                                                                    58.


                                  JO
                    Actually, I can t stay.  On the 
                    job.  In fact, have you ever heard 
                    of a sword called a Hancho Mass-
                      something?

                                  HENRY
                    A Honjo Masamune?!  It s considered 
                    the most famous sword in the world.  
                    Went missing after World War II.

                                  JO
                    Yeah.  Well, it s sticking out of 
                    some guy s chest on 32nd and Park. 
                      I requested you as my ME.  You 
                    coming or what?

      As Henry considers his options, Abe appears behind Henry, 
      handing him his jacket.  Henry follows Jo down the stairs.

                                  HENRY (V.O.)
                    I ve spent my entire life studying 
                    the human body and I can say with 
                      scientific certainty that what 
                    keeps us alive, more important than 
                    blood or oxygen or even love... is 
                    hope.

      Abe gazes out their apartment window at the street below.  
      Watches as Henry and Jo get into her car together.  A wide 
      smile on Abe s face.  His  Dad  is going to be okay.


      Jo buckles the seat belt over her sling.  Drives off.

                                  HENRY
                    Can we put the sirens on?

                                  JO
                          (rolls her eyes)
                    Jesus.  How old are you?

      Off Henry s sly grin, they drive off.  We CRANE UP over the 
      city of New York, as the skyline MORPHS, fading back to an 
      earlier time.  Just another day in the long life of Henry 
      Morgan...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
