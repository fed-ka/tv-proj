  Six year old STEFAN runs from the big grey stone slab of 
  Crickley Hall, more institutional than residential. 

  Children singing.

                              CHILDREN
                On the farm no poor rabbit
                Comes to harm because I grab it
                They jump and frolic whenever I go by
                They know I help 'em to dodge the rabbit 
                pie!

  A figure grabs him by the collar and lifts him off his feet.

  Stefan kicks wildly in mid-air as he pivots to face his 
    tormenter.  Terrified that it might be:

  AUGUSTUS CRIBBEN.  We don t see his face yet.

                              CRIBBEN O.S.
                You re mine.

  Stefan screams.


  The bedroom light comes on.


  Eve parks outside their house.


  A montage of Cam having his fun on slide, roundabout, swings 
  and a few more besides with Eve supplying the momentum with 
  the last of her energy.

                                                                  CUT TO:

  Eve watching Cam with love and deep exhaustion from a bench. 
  He s still racing around, tireless. She s catching up with 
  homework marking.

  There are other mothers and children around.

                              CAM
                Look at me!

                              EVE
                I am looking. Five minutes.

  Clouds pass.

  Eve can t focus on the handwritten scrawl of her pupils.

  Cam is standing on the highest part of the climbing frame 
  gazing at Eve.

  Her eyelids are drooping.

  Cam gazes at her intently. Whispering:

                              CAM
                Love you Mummy.

  Even though Eve is too far away to hear she mumbles a 
  response.

                              EVE
                Love you more.

  Eve closes her eyes for a moment.             THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      9.




  Stefan is carried screaming and kicking back to Crickley 
  Hall. Cribben slams the front door.

  A distant cry.

                              CAM
                Mummy.


  Eve wakes up with a start.

  Surely she s only been asleep for seconds.

  But the playground is empty. No other mothers. No other 
  children.

  And no Cam.

  Her marking lying on the grass. She wipes her mouth. Stands 
  up.

                              EVE
                Cam?

  She looks around, confused. 

                              EVE (cont d)
                Cam?

  She runs into the centre of the playground. Just his blue 
  woollen hat on the ground. She picks it up.

  She runs to the adjacent path and looks both ways.

                              EVE (cont d)
                Cam!

  Back into the park. Criss crossing. Scans the horizon 
    desperately.

                              EVE (cont d)
                Please no.

  She shrieks into the abyss.

                              EVE (cont d)
                CAM!!


  A full police search is underway where Cam was last seen.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      10.



  Eve is sitting on the park bench with a WPC. Eve s gazing at 
  the shortened little finger on her left hand.

                              GABE
                Eve.

  Eve stands up as Gabe approaches her. He looks as numb as she 
  is but hugs her tight.

                              EVE
                I fell asleep.

  Gabe kisses her.

                              EVE (cont d)
                I fell asleep.

                              GABE
                Don t.

                              EVE
                Someone must have been watching us.

                              GABE
                He may have just wandered off.

                              EVE
                Someone must have seen something.

                              GABE
                They said we should go home.

  Eve looks at him like he s insane.

                              EVE
                I m not leaving here.

                              GABE
                Loren and Cally need you.

  Eve is in torment.

                              GABE (cont d)
                I ll take over here.

                              EVE
                Will you?

                              GABE
                I ll stay.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      11.



                              EVE
                He might have hurt himself or ... fallen 
                under something. I ve covered every inch 
                of the park but the streets ...

                              GABE
                I ll be here. Go and see the girls.

  Eve absorbs a new horror.

                              EVE
                They re going to ask me what happened.

                              GABE
                It s not your fault.

                              EVE
                It is.

                              GABE
                It is not and don t tell them that.

  Gabe hugs her again.

                              EVE
                Say we re going to find him.

                              GABE
                Of course we re going to find him. How 
                can we not find him.

  Eve nods. Fumbles for her keys. Gabe closes his hand round 
  hers.

                              GABE (cont d)
                They re driving you.

  Eve begins to move away.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Eve.

  He hands her the marking. No reproach from him. But she feels 
    a terrible judgment.


  Eve returns to the playground at dawn. Gabe still there. 
  Police dispersing. Eve searches Gabe s face. He shakes his 
  head.  They look across the barren dawn landscape.

                              GABE
                He s gone.

                              EVE
                No.

  He holds her as we pull back and:

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.


  Eve returns from the shops laden with bags. Close on her 
  face, she looks hollow.

  Caption: Eleven Months Later.

  She notices something out of the corner of her eye and stops 
  dead.

  A lamp post with a missing cat poster.

  She approaches it, astonished.

    Underneath we can see another poster peeking out from the 
  corners.

  Eve furiously rips away at the missing cat poster.

  Gradually Cam s faded photo is revealed underneath. 

  Someone has pasted a missing cat poster over her missing 
  child. 

  She s crying as she uncovers her son s face.

  She calls out to the surrounding houses.

                              EVE
                Who did this? Who could do this?          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      14.



  She breaks into a run, leaving her shopping scattered over 
  the pavement.


  Gabe returns home.


  Gabe s car speeds along a country lane.

                Devil s Cleave! Dad! It s called Devil s 
                Cleave! Is that like cleavage?


  Gabe s car winds its way through narrow country lanes.


  Eve approaches the imposing grey slab of a building. Trying 
  to figure out where she s seen it before.

                              EVE
                Which way s the school?

                              GABE
                Two miles ... that way. There s a school 
                bus for the village they said they ll

  Gabe unlocks the front door.

                              GABE (cont d)
                Clyde! Come on! Stop sulking.

  Eve looks back to the car and the open back door. The dog is 
  watching them gravely.

  Gabe gets some treats from his pocket and shows them to 
  Clyde. But Clyde doesn t move.

                              GABE (cont d)
                You are sick.

  Eve follows Clyde s gaze to the narrow top window in the 
  house. An image from her dream she half-remembers.


  Percy stops and looks back at the house. He s on the edge of 
  tears. On his pov of the house we dissolve back seventy years 
  to:


  On the outside not much has changed. On the doorstep is a 
  young woman NANCY, dressed for an interview.

  Watching her from the same spot as elderly Percy, is young 
  Percy, seventeen.


  Nancy stands outside Crickley Hall, gathering her thoughts.

                              PERCY
                Allow me Miss.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      28.



  Percy reaches for her case. Nancy ignores him and picks it up 
  with her good left arm.

                              NANCY
                There s nothing wrong with me.

                              PERCY
                Can t argue with that Miss.

  She s shocked at the blatant flirtation.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                I tend the grounds Miss. Percy Judd at 
                your service.

  He offers his right hand but Nancy doesn t take it.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                Have you met his Lordship? You might want 
                a stiff drink first.

                              NANCY
                I don t touch it I m afraid.

  Percy watches her stride off with her suitcase. He s 
    impressed.

                              PERCY
                You let me know when that changes.


  Crickley Hall nestles peacefully in the moonlit valley.


  Nancy rings the bell.

  Maurice answers the door. Chewing with his mouth full.

                              MAURICE
                Morning Miss Linnet.

                              NANCY
                Good morning.  You must be Maurice. 
                You re the oldest here aren t you?

                              MAURICE
                I m kind of the prefect.

  He doesn t seem too happy about it. A little hunted.

                              NANCY
                I look forward to teaching you Maurice.

  She notices Maurice is barefoot.


  We hear barking from inside Crickley Hall.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      38.




  Gabe, Eve and the girls get out of the car outside the local 
  very traditional pub. 

                              CALLY
                Mummy are you sad today?

                              LOREN
                Shut up.

  Eve comes to attention. Smiles at Cally.

                              EVE
                Give me a reason not to be sad.

  Cally looks around, thinks hard. Eve looking at her with 
  love. Cally points at a newsagents.

                              CALLY
                Sweets!

                              EVE
                I m happy!


  Clyde s barking stops abruptly. Now we hear louder and more 
  frantic sounds as we withdraw from the house. High-pitched 
  keening. An animal in terrible distress.


  Cally gnaws on a stick of rock as they emerge from the sweet 
  shop. Eve looks at the church opposite.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      40.



                              EVE
                Can we?

  Gabe s not happy about churches.

                              GABE
                Sure.


  Gabe moves among the headstones. He looks down at a 
    gravestone and sees the inscription and year of death - 1943. 
  He moves on a couple of paces and sees another with the same 
  year. And another.

                              PERCY
                Mr. Caleigh?

  Percy carries some weeding instruments. He nods towards Eve 
  at the church door with the reverend.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                I met your wife up at Crickley Hall

                              PERCY
                I look after the orphans.*

  Percy searches Gabe s face to see how much he knows. Gabe 
  doesn t follow. Percy is relieved.

                              PERCY (cont'd)
                You re settling in all right.

                              GABE
                  Everything s great thanks. And we ve got 
                your number.

                I hope you won t need it.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      41.



  Gabe watches Percy head over to a corner of the cemetery 
  where he kneels and begins tending the grave stones.


  Gabe returns to the church entrance where Eve is with the 
  vicar. Gabe indicates the headstones.*

                              GABE
                1943 was a bit of a bad year for you.

                                ANDREW
                The flood didn t reach the church thank 
                God but yes. Sixty-eight people lost 
                their lives.

                              EVE
                How?

                                ANDREW
                It was a flash flood. People were drowned 
                in their sleep.

  He glances at Loren and Cally, both rapt.

                              GABE
                  Sightseeing.

  Andrew s eyes meet Gabe s. Gabe is radiating polite 
    hostility.

                              GABE (cont d)
                God doesn t do anything for us I m 
                afraid.

                How can you say that with two beautiful 
                girls.

  Gabe s got an answer ready but:

                              EVE
                I d love to come to a service.

                                ANDREW
                We d love to have you.


  Percy looks up from where he s tending the graves as Reverend *
  Andrew approaches. *

                              REVEREND ANDREW*
                Let them be, Percy.*

                If I was staying there with young *
                children I d want to know.*

                              REVEREND ANDREW*
                They don t need to share in our tragedy.*

                              REVEREND ANDREW*
                I know it s not right to terrify young *
                  children.*

                                PERCY*
                That s why they should leave.*

                              REVEREND ANDREW*
                If you want to keep attending these *
                graves I m going to have to insist you *
                leave Crickley Hall alone. I hate to do *
                this to you Percy but if you want to *
                respect their memories, you have to let *
                them go.*

                                PERCY*
                It s not me who won t let them go.*

                              REVEREND ANDREW*
                You decide.*

  Andrew walks away and we track away to a single headstone *
  overgrown and neglected.*

  The kitchen door is open to the garden. Loren at the far end 
  of the garden calling for Clyde. Gabe examining the door 
  lock.

                              GABE
                This wasn t broken when we left.

                He gave it a real hammering.

  She sees the blood in the paw marks.

                Mummy he wet the floor.

  They look at the pool of urine on the kitchen floor.

                              EVE
                Maybe he is sick.

  Percy on his bicycle careens down a country lane to catch up 
  with Nancy. 

                              PERCY
                You need a lift Miss?

                              NANCY
                I m nearly there.

                              PERCY
                Let me take that.

  She recoils.

                              NANCY
                I really can manage.

                              PERCY
                What have you got in there the family 
                jewels?

  She cracks a smile. He grins: first base.


  They ride in tandem to park outside the village pub and 
  lodgings.

                              PERCY
                  Crickley s not been lived in since before 
                I was born. I just keep it looking nice 
                in case anyone s stupid enough to buy it.

                              NANCY
                What s wrong with it?

                              PERCY
                Chap who built it fancied himself an 
                  architect. He liked his fresh water so 
                much he built it on a river. Turned it 
                into a refrigerator. Speaking of which 
                have you met Cribben?

                              NANCY
                He was indisposed. I m sure we all have 
                our off days.

  Percy carries Nancy s case to the door.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      45.



                              PERCY
                Not me Miss. I m not going to waste what 
                time I have left moping around.

                              NANCY
                      (LAUGHING)
                What are you - all of seventeen?

  She realizes.

                              NANCY (cont d)
                Oh. When are you being called up?

                              PERCY
                Couple of weeks. Make the most of me.

  Nancy is silenced.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                You can come in with me in the morning if 
                you don t mind starting at five-thirty.

                              NANCY
                Let s see how it goes.

                              PERCY
                Call it six tomorrow. Give you time to 
                put your face on.

                              NANCY
                Are all country boys as cocky as you?

                              PERCY
                Can I call you Nancy then?

                              NANCY
                You may not. Goodnight Percy.

                              PERCY
                I m glad those kids have got you to look 
                out for them. 

  Percy looks into her eyes and takes her right hand. Her 
  withered arm. At first she stiffens.

  He lifts it gently and kisses her hand. She s surprised and 
  touched.

  Percy gets on his bicycle and speeds off to his house.

  She feels reassured and hopeful.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      46.




  It s getting dark as Loren and Gabe walk through the village 
  looking for Clyde.

                              GABE
                When he s hungry he ll go looking for 
                people. You need to get your stuff ready 
                for school. You ve been great about 
                coming out here.

                              LOREN
                It s only a few weeks. Is it helping her?

                              GABE
                Yes. And it s helping me.

  Loren looks around distracted.

                              GABE (cont d)
                We ll do the back road on the way home.


  Nancy leads the children out of Crickley Hall.


  The school bus is parked outside Crickley Hall. Eve is seeing 
  Loren onto the bus. Cally is waving from the door. Loren 
  waves back sleepily.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      54.



  Once Eve s back is turned, Loren sees a girl on the bus Tina 
  waving sarcastically then commenting to her friend and 
  laughing. Loren gets on the bus, nervous.


  Magda leads the orphans back into Crickley Hall, accompanied 
  by a policeman and a nurse. They all look very friendly. A 
  shared laugh. The nurse examines the bruise on Magda s face. 
  Nancy watches from a distance, tearful as Percy joins her.

                              NANCY
                They said the other children did it. I 
                don t know what s more monstrous.

                              PERCY
                They owned up Nancy. And Stefan said the 
                same.          THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL     Ep 1    Pink Revisions      58.



                              NANCY
                They re terrified! They are in fear of 
                their lives! Who s going to look after 
                them now?

                              PERCY
                You are.

  Nancy looks at him.

                              PERCY (cont d)
                No running away. I want you here when I 
                get back.

  He kisses her for the first time.


  Eve leans down to Cally as Gabe and Loren approach.

                              EVE
                Now are you going to let me tell them in 
                my own way or are you going to belt it 
                out at the top of your voice.

                              CALLY
                Is it a secret?

                              EVE
                No it isn t a secret I just want to say 
                it in the right way.

  Gabe and Loren arrive at the door. Gabe looks at Cally.

                              GABE
                What are you smirking about?

  Cally looks up at Eve, bursting. Back to Gabe.

                              CALLY
                We ve got ghosts!


  Loren calls into the darkness, scanning the trees with a 
  flashlight.

                              LOREN
                Clyde! ... Clyde!
