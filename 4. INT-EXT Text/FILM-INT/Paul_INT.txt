GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
the blade. He nods appreciatively.
2.
CLIVE
Beautiful piece.
VENDER
Damn straight. Practical
performance. 100% Japanese, folded
steel. Real hero shit.
CLIVE
How much?
VENDER
$1,349.99.
CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.
GRAHAM
Aren't you gonna get it?
CLIVE
No, it's rubbish.
We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.
GRAHAM
What are you going to ask?
CLIVE
Do you feel that the killing of
Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
invalidates Ripley's struggle at
the closed of the previous
installment?
GRAHAM
I was going to ask that!
CLIVE
(IN KLINGON)
Tough tits four eyes.
SECURITY
Alright, next!
Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.
MICHAEL BIEHN
Hey there. Who's it to?
GRAHAM
Graham.
3.
MICHAEL BIEHN
Graham.
GRAHAM
Uh... are you... did you?
MICHAEL BIEHN
There you go.
SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.
MICHAEL BIEHN
Hey there. Who's it to?
CLIVE
Clive.
MICHAEL BIEHN
Clive.
CLIVE
Uh... are you... did you?
MICHAEL BIEHN
There you go.
SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.
CLIVE
I... I need to photograph him.
SECURITY
You can take it from there.
CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
off, looking at their spoils.
GRAHAM/CLIVE
(HIGH FIVING)
YES!
GRAHAM
That was amazing. I was actually a
bit nervous.
CLIVE
Really? I wasn't.
GRAHAM
Good egg, wasn't he?
CLIVE
Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I
forgot to give him my card.
CLIVE points at SECURITY.
4.
GRAHAM
Give it to Colossus.
CLIVE
Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!
GRAHAM
She NEEDS to call me.
GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
down, making sure everything is in order.
PUBLICIST
Looks good, right?
CLIVE
Yes, it's very impressive.
PUBLICIST
It really does the image justice. I
never noticed the third tit.
CLIVE
That was Graham's idea.
PUBLICIST
Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?
You got enough pens? You wanna
Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?
CLIVE
I'll have a fat Coke please?
PUBLICIST
A fat what?
CLIVE
Coke.
PUBLICIST
Oh you man a FAT Coke.
CLIVE
A what?
PUBLICIST
Fat coke.
CLIVE
Yes please.
5.
GRAHAM
When do we start?
PUBLICIST
Ten minutes ago.
CLIVE
Why is it so quiet?
PUBLICIST
Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main
pavillion.
CLIVE
Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I
wanted to find out if he actually
eats the brains.
PUBLICIST
I can make a call.
CLIVE
Please.
PUBLICIST
It'll pick up when he's done.
GRAHAM
I'm nervous.
CLIVE
Don't be. The hard work's done, we
have a great story and as usual
your renderings jump from the page.
PUBLICIST
Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.
GRAHAM
Thank you.
CLIVE
All we have to do now is sit back
and enjoy.
A child approaches.
CLIVE
Queen Jelva welcomes thee.
CHILD
Do you know where Sylar's on?
CLIVE
Main pavillion.
CHILD
Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome.
6.
Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER
They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.
PUBLICIST
Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?
CLIVE
Three copies.
PUBLICIST
Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you
should have given her four.
GRAHAM
That's sick.
PUBLICIST
Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.
CLIVE
Yeah, but three copies?
PUBLICIST
Better than Carl Weathers.
CLIVE
YES!
GRAHAM
Would you like a copy?
PUBLICIST
Are you nuts? My office is full of
junk.
The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.
CLIVE
Graham, I need a drink.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.
7.
GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
a map. Other maps are scattered about.
CLIVE (O.S.)
It was like the Prancing Pony in
there.
GRAHAM
Nasty Hobbitses.
CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
on a black leather cord.
CLIVE
They think they're so cool.
GRAHAM
Hey, are you excited about going to
Area 51?
CLIVE
Hell yes.
GRAHAM
06.30 check out?
CLIVE
A-ffirmative.
GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.
CLIVE
Three, two, one...
GRAHAM CLIVE
Beep. Beep.
CLIVE
Good night, Graham.
GRAHAM
Good night, Clive.
They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.
GRAHAM
Are you asleep?
CLIVE
No.
8.
GRAHAM
Shall we try and storm the Citadel
before we nod off?
CLIVE
Couldn't hurt could it?
We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.
CLIVE
Cover me.
GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
reception desk. His head hits the bell.
DING!
CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
fusses with maps and provisions.
GRAHAM
Breakfast?
CLIVE
Java. Straight up.
GRAHAM
Any solids?
CLIVE
No, let's punch through. Miles make
the eggs taste sweeter.
GRAHAM
I love eggs!
CLIVE
I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on
the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
I need your map skills.
GRAHAM
Good job I pre-pared.
GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
(Chewie) seat.
GRAHAM
It's a shame I don't have some
controls on this side. That way, I
could take over if you needed the
loo.
CLIVE
Yeah, I could say "take the helm."
GRAHAM
"Take the helm, number one."
CLIVE
Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
need a number two."
They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.
GRAHAM
"Least I've got Cerebro, eh?
10.
CLIVE
Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi
map and advanced geo-tagging with
continual info stream?
GRAHAM
Impressive.
CLIVE
Most impressive.
GRAHAM
And let's not forget, we've always
got Analogue.
GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.
CLIVE
Not when we're driving Graham.
GRAHAM
Sorry.
GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
percolator gurgles in the galley.
GRAHAM
Sounds like coffee o'clock.
CLIVE
Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
had my first cup of J.
GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.
GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
prawns. He inspects the shells.
GRAHAM
Looks like a pile of dead droids.
A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
awkward.
WAITRESS
You boys all set? Can I get you
anything else?
GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.
They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.
11.
CLIVE
Amazing, isn't it? There are
295,734,134 people in this country
and we haven't seen a soul for a
hundred miles. Where is everybody?
GRAHAM
What about that old woman on
crutches we saw hitchhiking?
CLIVE
Apart from her. I suppose that's
why they established the Dreamland
facility out here.
GRAHAM
Far from prying eyes.
CLIVE
Did you know the site was selected
in the mid-1950s for testing of the
U-2 spyplane, due to its
remoteness, proximity to existing
facilities and presence of a dry
lake bad for landings?
GRAHAM
Yes.
CLIVE
Oh.
GRAHAM
Shall we have a bite before or
after we hit the Black Mailbox?
CLIVE
Before.
GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
bumper stickers.
PAT
"Watch The Skies" or "Alien
Onboard?"
GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
looking back at PAT.
GRAHAM/CLIVE
"Alien Onboard."
12.
PAT
Nice choice. So, where have you
boys come from?
GRAHAM
(MUMBLY)
San Diego.
PAT
Comic-Con?
CLIVE
How could you tell?
We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.
PAT
Just a guess. My nephew launched a
comic down there a couple of years
ago. Sort of dramatized the
accounts of some of the folk we've
had in here.
CLIVE
Encounter Briefs?
PAT
That's it. You heard of it, huh?
CLIVE
I've got all six.
PAT
Well whaddya know? Small world.
CLIVE
Do you get a lot of UFO types round
here?
We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.
PAT
Some.
GRAHAM
Have you ever seen one?
PAT
A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.
GRAHAM
Really?! You've seen more than one
UFOs?
13.
PAT
Well, I don't know what they were.
So as far as I'm concerned they're
unidentified and they were
definitely flying.
CLIVE
And objects.
PAT
Damn straight. Whether or not they
were spaceships, I can't say.
Probably not, but I'd like to think
they were. Be a shame if we were
the only souls in the universe.
CLIVE
Did you now, it's estimated that
there are as many as 200 billion
galaxies in the observable universe
and each of those has approximately
40 billion starts, around which
orbit countless planets and moons?
PAT
Yes.
CLIVE
Oh.
PAT
Makes you think though, don't it?
CLIVE
What?
PAT
Where is everybody?
GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.
PAT
You boys all set?
CLIVE
I'd like a cup of coffee please.
PAT
Sure thing. How about you, sugar?
GRAHAM
Can I have an E.T. malt please?
PAT
You wanna sparkler in that?
GRAHAM smiles coyly.
14.
PAT
I'll take that as a yes.
She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.
CLIVE
It's nice here, isn't it?
GRAHAM
Absolutely.
CLIVE
I think I might use the loo.
CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.
PAT
Yes dear, what can I get you?
JAKE
Two beers.
PAT
Coming right up.
CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.
CLIVE
That is absolutely amazing!
CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.
CLIVE
Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
into my palms.
CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.
CLIVE
I'm joking, of course. They have a
soap dispenser, shaped like an
alien's head. When you pump his
jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.
GRAHAM
(MUMBLING)
Clive...
15.
CLIVE
It's hilarious.
GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.
CLIVE
What?
CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.
PAT (O.S.)
Here it comes!
GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.
PAT
Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
with a sparkler for the boys from
outer space.
The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.
PAT
So, where you boys headed?
JAKE
We're heading into Utah. Do
ourselves some hunting.
GUS
Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
in front of the bangstick, right
Jake?
They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
JAKE
You got that right, Gus.
PAT
Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts
up quite a fight.
GUS
That's what we're counting on.
They nudge each other and laugh.
PAT
I better make you something good
and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
fumbles for hi wallet.
16.
He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
a wink. He leaves.
GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
engine is running.
CLIVE
What took you so long?
GRAHAM
I was putting the sticker on.
CLIVE
They were an odd pair, weren't
they?
GRAHAM
Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
That wasn't their truck was it?
CLIVE
No.
GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
rear view.
GRAHAM
What's the matter?
CLIVE
Nothing. How we doing?
GRAHAM
We should be just about there.
They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
CLIVE
I've found it.
GRAHAM
Where?
17.
CLIVE
THERE!!!
CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.
GRAHAM
Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps
whoever it was turned doff.
CLIVE
Of course it's them. We're dead.
It's like Deliverance. They're
going to rape us and break our
arms.
GRAHAM
I don't want my arms broken!
CLIVE
There's only one thing for it.
GRAHAM
What?
CLIVE
I'm gonna have to fly blind.
19.
CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.
CLIVE
Probably best not to do that. I
couldn't really see anything.
They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.
CLIVE
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
GRAHAM
I need the toilet.
CLIVE
Me too.
The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.
CLIVE
They're trying to overtake.
GRAHAM
Don't let them get past.
CLIVE
Should I ram them?
GRAHAM
What about the deposit?
CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.
CLIVE
It wasn't them.
The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
CLIVE peer out of the window.
CLIVE
We should see if they're okay.
GRAHAM
I still need a wee.
CLIVE
I can hold mine.
GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.
20.
GRAHAM
The bulb's gone in there.
GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.
PAUL
Can I have this ham?
GRAHAM
Uh... yes.
PAUL
Great!
PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
wolfing it down hungrily.
GRAHAM
Paul? Where am I going again?
PAUL
I told you, North. Do you have a
map?
GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
PAUL
Not when we're driving, Graham.
24.
The map disappears back up into the roller.
GRAHAM
Sorry.
PAUL
Just head North. We need to get as
much distance as we can between us
and them.
GRAHAM
Them? Who's them?
Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.
PAUL
The bulb's gone in there.
CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.
PAUL
I hate it when you get the closed
ones, right?
GRAHAM
I usually bite them open.
PAUL
Are you fucking insane? You gotta
tap "em and if they don't open you
throw them away.
GRAHAM
That's molluscs.
PAUL
Shut up.
GRAHAM
It's true.
(NOTICES CLIVE)
Hello Clive! How are you feeling?
CLIVE
I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
You're happily sitting there
chatting to... to... that, like
it's the most natural thing in the
world. The two of you laughing away
like you haven't seen each other
since 1990.
PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
27.
CLIVE (CONT'D)
So forgive me if I seem a little
rattled but from where I'm standing
it would appear you are trading nut
knowledge with an alien life form.
GRAHAM
His name is Paul.
CLIVE
Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
Reiser?
PAUL
Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
or Dracula.
GRAHAM
Paul's from a small planet in the
northern spiral arm of the
Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE
No he is not!
PAUL
I am man, seriously.
CLIVE
How could he possibly have
travelled that distance?
PAUL
Wormhole.
CLIVE
Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
seems. What about Ocham's Razor?
GRAHAM
The hairdressers?
CLIVE
Yes, the old man who owns it told
me that, in unbelievable
circumstances, the most plausible
explanation is usually the truth.
PAUL
And what's the most plausible
explanation, Clive?
CLIVE
That you're a thin midget in an
alien costume.
28.
PAUL
There's no such thing as a thin
midget? Those guys are built. Have
you not seen The Station Agent?
GRAHAM
He's right. I think that's less
believable than Paul being form a
planet in the norther spiral arm of
the Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE (CONT'D)
Oh really?
With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
trying to gain a hold of a mask.
PAUL
Ow! Get off me!
CLIVE
You're not real. You're not real!
GRAHAM
Excuse me.
PAUL
Get off me, you fucking psycho!
GRAHAM
EXCUSE ME!
CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.
CLIVE
Oh shit!
CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.
CLIVE
Where's he gone?
GRAHAM
Maybe he beamed up.
CLIVE
As if. We would have seen the
classic shimmer and hum.
GRAHAM
Good point.
BANG, BANG, BANG!
GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.
29.
GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
and shaken.
CLIVE
Well, it's pretty obvious what
happened there, isn't it?
GRAHAM
Is it?
CLIVE
Yes, the government used some sort
of neurotoxic paint on the Black
Mailbox, which was white by the
way, and it caused us to suffer a
shared hallucination about an
alien. I mean, it's what we've
always wanted, isn't it?
GRAHAM
I suppose so.
CLIVE
Than that's what happened.
PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
PAUL
WRONG!
CLIVE
Where the hell did you go?
PAUL
Nowhere.
GRAHAM
What, you went invisible?
PAUL
It's not invisibility per so. It's
more like what a chameleon does
with a little light blending thrown
in for good measure.
GRAHAM
Like Predator?
PAUL
Exactly.
GRAHAM
Can you do it whenever you want?
PAUL
(PREDATOR VOICE)
Anytime...
CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.
CLIVE
No thank you.
PAUL
You sure? How about a cup of
coffee?
(sees he's tempted)
Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
cuppa J.
PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.
PAUL
Hey, look who's up!
32.
GRAHAM
Hello Paul.
GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.
GRAHAM
What's the matter?
CLIVE
Graham, there is a Grey in the
galley, making me coffee.
GRAHAM
Did you want tea?
CLIVE
No, I don't want tea.
GRAHAM
Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't
it?
CLIVE
No, what's wried, Graham, is that
we have picked up an extra
terrestrial hitch hiker and you
seem completely fine with it!
GRAHAM
He needs our help, Clive.
PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.
PAUL CLIVE
You got it? Yes I've got it.
PAUL CLIVE
It's hot. (slightly testy)
Thank you.
GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...
PAUL
Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say this is probably the
weirdest thing that's ever happened
to you. Am i right?
CLIVE doesn't deny it.
PAUL
And I appreciate the fact that I
have somewhat gate-crashed the
party here but, truth be told, I'm
in a hell of a pickle. I really
need your help.
33.
CLIVE
Why us?
PAUL
Why not?
CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
CLIVE
What about the RV? It has to be
back in two days.
GRAHAM
Clive, he's an alien. A living,
breathing, alien.
CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.
CLIVE
I suppose we could phone the hire
company and get an extension.
PAUL looks super-pleased.
CLIVE
How did you get here?
PAUL
Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.
GRAHAM
Happens to the best of us.
PAUL
Also, I'm a shit driver.
CLIVE
Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!
PAUL
Roswell was a smoke-screen man,
designed to distract from the
truth.
CLIVE
They invented a fake alien crash to
distract from an actual alien
crash?
PAUL
I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?
CLIVE
What have you been doing here all
this time?
34.
PAUL
Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting
the shit. Advising the government.
GRAHAM
Not just the government.
CAPTION: 1980
A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a
cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on
the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
...I want him to have some kind of
special power, you know? Something
sort of messianic...
PAUL
How about molecular revivification.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
I don't know what that is.
PAUL
Restoration of damaged tissue
through telepathic manipulation of
cellular intrinsic field memory.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
I...uh...
PAUL
Healing, Steven.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort
of thing? His little finger could
light up at the end and-
PAUL
You know what? Sometimes, less is
more.
The line beeps.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
You got another call?
PAUL
Yeah I gotta take this man. It's
the fucking V guys again.
35.
PAUL
Right.
GRAHAM
You'd be surprised how much he's
influenced popular culture
generally over the last 60 years.
CLIVE
(TO GRAHAM)
How come you know so much?
GRAHAM
We had quite a long chat while you
were unconscious.
CLIVE looks miffed.
GRAHAM
...while you were asleep.
PAUL
You want a bagel Clive?
CLIVE
No thanks.
PAUL
Graham?
GRAHAM
Yes please.
CLIVE
Go on then, I'll have half.
PAUL (O.S.)
You want anything on it?
CLIVE
Jam.
PAUL (O.S.)
What?
CLIVE
Jelly.
PAUL
Gotcha.
PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.
GRAHAM
I gave your jeans a swill and hung
them up.
36.
CLIVE
Thank you. So, do you know where
we're going?
GRAHAM
Just North. He said we had to make
a right at Utah.
CLIVE
Why can't he tell us?
GRAHAM
He said it was a surprise.
CLIVE
Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,
is he Strider or Black Rider?
GRAHAM
Strider, definitely.
CLIVE
You'd better be right. I don't want
to wake up and find him inserting a
probe into my anus.
GRAHAM
It's okay, he doesn't do that.
PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.
PAUL
Bagel time!
The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.
GRAHAM
Fuel level's critical.
PAUL
Sorry, I had a warning light just
like that on my ship.
GRAHAM
For fuel?
PAUL
Anti-grav failure.
CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.
CLIVE
There's a place called Ely five
miles from here. It's small but
there should be a gas station.
GRAHAM
Roger that, number one.
37.
CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".
GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears
deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a
V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD
MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.
CLIVE
Paul, don't do that!
PAUL
Here's what I need. Some organic
beef mince, organic pork, some
veal, red onions, pine nuts,
pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a
fistful of fresh basil and 3 war
ciabattas.
CLIVE
You know this is a gas station?
PAUL looks disappointed.
GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of
jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some
mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.;
CLIVE
Don't you think that's a bit much?
Put it all back. Except the
burrito... and the doughnuts... and
the chocolate milk. Let's just pay
for it and leave.
GRAHAM
We need bulb for the toilet.
CLIVE
Essential only, Graham!
They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.
STATE TROOPER
Morning Chris!
CHRIS
Hey Dean.
STATE TROOPER
Who do you think I had in my office
this morning?
CHRIS
Jeremy Piven?
STATE TROOPER
No. The Secret Service.
GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it
tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.
CHRIS
They find out how you can afford a
Dodge Viper on troopers pay?
STATE TROOPER
Not yet. They're all over this
crash on the road up to Rachel.
CHRIS
What you think's going on?
STATE TROOPER
Don't know, could be Muslims.
CHRIS
Jesus Cheeerist!
CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.
41.
STATE TROOPER
You go right ahead.
CLIVE
Thank you very much, officer.
STATE TROOPER
Where're you guys from?
GRAHAM
Britain.
STATE TROOPER
Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!
CHRIS
No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.
CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER
and CHRIS watch them go.
PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms; in his mouth. GRAHAM
drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.
CLIVE
It's find for you. You'll get
whisked back to whatever lab they
kept you in and we'll be arrested
for harbouring a fugitive and sent
to Guantanamo Bay.
PAUL laughs.
CLIVE
Why's everything so funny? They
think we're Muslims.
42.
PAUL
That's their excuse for everything.
There are worse things you can be.
We had a Muslim guy at the base.
Systems analyst called Yusef. We
used to do karaoke on Tuesday
nights. You should'a heard him do
Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get
a chance to say salam alaikum.
CLIVE
Paul, the authorities know we're in
an TV.
PAUL
We're hardly the only RV on the
road. Trust me, if we stay off the
highways, keep to the back routes,
we'll have a nice uneventful
journey.
BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.
GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva,
Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.
GRAHAM
What do you think?
PAUL
Ask me when I've finished it.
CLIDE rubs his yes.
GRAHAM
You tired, Sausage?
CLIVE
(WHISPERING)
Don't call me Sausage in front of
him.
45.
GRAHAM
Sorry. Are you tired though?
CLIVE
Mummy, I am bushed.
GRAHAM
What do you need?
CLIVE
Best case, I'd like a cold flannel
on my neck and an honest meal.
GRAHAM
I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still
call you Big-Rig can't I?
CLIVE
Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck
with an RV park? We need somewhere
off the beaten track, n'est pas?
GRAHAM
Roger that. Cup of Joe?
CLIVE
You read my mind.
GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.
CLIVE
Can I help you?
PAUL
You want a cigarette?
CLIVE
No, thank you. I don't smoke.
PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.
PAUL
Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating
the bird.
CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
coffee and a Honey Bun cake.
GRAHAM
Honey Bun?
CLIVE
Could you unwrap it for me?
GRAHAM
By your command.
46.
GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL
watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.
PAUL
Let me ask you something. Are you
to...?
CLIVE
What?
PAUL
You know...
PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.
CLIVE
No!
PAUL
Okay, that's great. I just
wondered. I'm cool with it.
Everyone's "bi' where I'm from.
It's all about the pleasure thing,
you know? We've evolved beyond
paranoid notions of gender
identity. I mean, procreation is
only the functional aspect of
sexual congress right? The human
race is fairly advanced but most
males still act like a cornered
tiger if you imply the like
"smoking the bone' and let's face
it they probably do. Look at single
sex, empirical institutions,
boarding schools, prisons, pirate
ships, places where the choice has
been removed, everyone's banging
everyone else and there isn't a
whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
out into the real world and guys
are getting smacked int he chops
for wearing pink socks. You think
you're so sophisticated because you
can distinguish yourself from your
own reflection but ultimately
you're part of a deeply neurotic
species and you'd all be a lot
better off if you stopped worrying
and learned to love the bum.
CLIVE
What are you trying to say?
PAUL
Maybe you should start smoking.
47.
Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,
steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.
CLIVE
Great find, Graham.
GRAHAM
I sourced a website listing off the
beaten track, North American RV
parks.
PAUL
I really lucked out with you nerds,
didn't I?
GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.
GRAHAM
It's awfully quiet.
CLIVE
Just the way we like it.
PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
the horn.
HOOOOOOONNNNK!
CLIVE
Stop doing that!
GRAHAM
Someone's coming.
PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.
VOICE
Hello?
CLIVE
(quietly to Graham)
We're just a couple of regular guys
on a tour of the less touristy side
of the American midwest.
GRAHAM
I don't think she heard you.
CLIVE
I was talking to you.
GRAHAM
Oh, sorry.
48.
VOICE
Hello?
GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".
RUTH
Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.
CLIVE
Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
in?
RUTH
Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is
$50 for the night, plus $10 for
hook ups an I'll need to hang onto
an ID too.
CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.
GRAHAM
We're just a couple of regular guys
on tour of the less touristy side
of the American midwest.
RUTH
Where you heading next?
GRAHAM
Uh, east... apparently.
CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.
RUTH
England?
CLIVE
Yes. London.
RUTH
I love London.
CLIVE
Have you been?
RUTH
No. Did you know it was founded by
the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?
GRAHAM/CLIVE
Yes.
RUTH
Oh. I'd love to go someday.
49.
GRAHAM
You should.
RUTH
There's lots a places I wanna go.
Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The
world's a big place. I need one of
these though.
CLIVE
You don't have a passport?
RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry
RUTH
That's my father. I'll come over
and take your money in the morning.
Have a pleasant night now, won't
you?
RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
watches RUTH intently as they pass.
CLIVE
Doors to manual and cross check.
Graham? Graham?
GRAHAM
Hmmm?
PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.
PAUL
BOO!
RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
What took you so long?
RUTH
I was just talking.
50.
RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
You talk to much.
RUTH
Sorry Papa.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
How long they staying?
RUTH
Just the night I think
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Hook ups?
RUTH
Uh-huh.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Where they headed?
RUTH
East.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Them California plates I saw?
RUTH
Yes, but they're from London.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
London, Ohio?
RUTH
No, London, England.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Where?!
RUTH
England, Papa. It's in North
Western Europe.
The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is
tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.
MOSES BEHE
Europe? I'll give you Europe,
missy. Now, get and make my supper.
MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.
51.
The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL
lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.
PAUL
Arrghh, what the fuck?!
GRAHAM
Hungry?
PAUL
I ate already.
GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.
PAUL
Too soon?
They nod.
PAUL
Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break
bread with you guys. What are we
having?
GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
GRAHAM
Willies!
PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.
CLIVE
I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
my forte.
CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
slams the door of the RV behind him.
It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.
CLIVE
Who is it?
RUTH (O.S.)
It's Ruth.
GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.
RUTH
Good morning.
CLIVE
Good morning.
RUTH
May I come in?
GRAHAM
Yes.
CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.
RUTH
Was everything to your liking?
CLIVE
Yes, thank you.
RUTH
Where's the other one?
CLIVE
The other one?
RUTH
It's okay, we don't charge by the
person. That was three pairs of
legs I saw last night cavorting
round the camp fire, right?
CLIVE
Oh the other one. Um...
PAUL
I'm in the can. I ate a closed
mollusc.
PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.
55.
GRAHAM
I like your shirt.
The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"
RUTH
Thanks. I got it at my church.
GRAHAM
Why would Jesus want to shoot
Charles Darwin?
RUTH
(BRIGHTLY)
Because of his theories. Are you
men of God?
GRAHAM
Would you like a coffee?
CLIVE
I suppose we're men of science.
GRAHAM
CLIVE-
RUTH narrow her eye.
CLIVE
If we believe in anything it would
be macro evolution. Cause and
effect. The establishment of a
biological order from the maelstrom
of physical and chemical chaos.
RUTH looks scandalized.
GRAHAM
Or it could be God. You just don't
know do you?
RUTH
God created the earth in six days
and on the seventh he rested.
PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.
CLIVE
Did you know that the universe has
been dated as being 13.5 billion
years old an that the release of
neutral hydrogen at the moment of
the big bang has enabled scientists
to do this with categorical
accuracy?
GRAHAM
Yes.
56.
CLIVE
Not you!
RUTH
The world is 4000 years old.
PAUL (O.S.)
Oh come on!
GRAHAM
PAUL-
PAUL (O.S.)
Horseshit!
RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.
RUTH
Explain to me how something as
complicated as the human eye simply
comes into being.
PAUL (O.S.)
Oh, don't give me that old
irreducible complexity crap-
RUTH
They eye is comprised of three
interacting parts. Remove any one
of them and it ceases to exist. It
has the precision and delicacy of a
pocket watch and, when the good
Lord permits, it works in perfect
harmony with its environment.
Something as functionally perfect
as that doesn't just occur without
the intervention of a guiding hand.
PAUL (O.S.)
But it didn't just occur did it? It
is the culmination of millions of
years of development across
countless species.
RUTH
What are you talking about?
PAUL (O.S.)
Evolution baby.
RUTH screams and bangs the door.
RUTH
It'd design!
57.
PAUL (O.S.)
If He designed it, why didn't He
just make it one part and take the
whole weekend off?
RUTH
Nothing you can so or do can shake
my belief, or faith in the sure and
certain knowledge that God made
Heaven and earth and created us all
in His own image.
PAUL
Oh yeah?
(stepping out of the toilet)
Well then how do you explain me?
RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
up, her hair turns white. She collapses.
PAUL
And that's Jenga.
CLIVE
What did you do that for?
PAUL
I didn't do anything, she fainted.
CLIVE
She saw you!
PAUL
Oh come on. Who's gonna believe
anything she says?
CLIVE
The authorities will be on the look
out for exactly this sort of thing.
PAUL
What, a delusional, one-eyed God
botherer?
CLIVE
Paul, right now they're going to
follow any lead they can get.
PAUL
I didn't think of that.
GRAHAM
We could take her with us.
PAUL/CLIVE
What?
58.
GRAHAM
We're only going to be a couple of
days. We could let her go once
Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll
be fine once she gets to know us.
PAUL and CLIVE consider this.
CLIVE
How am I going to get my passport
back?
PAUL vanishes.
PAUL (O.S.)
Leave it to me.
The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.
PAUL
Hallelujah.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Ruth, what in the Lord's name-
MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
a second.
PAUL
Boo?
Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,
GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.
59.
GRAHAM
Hi.
RUTH
Where am I?
PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.
PAUL
Hey, look who's up.
RUTH
DEMON!
GRAHAM
Would you like a cup of tea?
RUTH starts to pray furiously.
GRAHAM
I'm so sorry it had to be this way
Ruth. We're definitely not going to
hurt you and we'll let you go as
son as we can. We were just a
little concerned that you might
call the police.
RUTH
You have been deceived. Deceived by
an agent of Satan himself.
PAUL (O.S.)
You know I'm sitting right here?
GRAHAM
He's not a demon Ruth, he's from
another world and we're helping him
get home. He's not evil. He's just
very rude.
RUTH
How can he be from another world?
There is only one world. Our world,
created by God the Father.
PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.
PAUL
Look, if it makes you feel any
better, my existence only disproves
the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
Christian God, as well as all
single earth theologies. Science
still hasn't categorically rule out
the notion of divinity, even though
evolutionary biology suggest the
non-existence of a creator by
probability alone.
60.
RUTH
How could that possibly make me
feel any better?
PAUL
Jesus Christ, I was just trying to
be nice!
GRAHAM
I think what Paul's trying to say
is, just because there are other
inhabited planets, it's not the end
of the world.
RUTH
This isn't happening! You're a
hallucination. You're not real.
You're a test. A test from God.
PAUL
You can't win can you?
RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
awful noise.
CLIVE
I can't drive like this. We'll have
to drop her off and take our
chances.
GRAHAM
No!
PAUL
Oh, for God's sake.
PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.
GRAHAM
What did you do to her?!
PAUL
I broadened her horizons.
GRAHAM
Can you broaden mine?
PAUL
No, it's tiring.
GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
61.
GRAHAM
Oh please.
PAUL
Come here then.
PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.
CLIVE
Oh great! Everyone knows the
secrets of the universe apart from
me. He always knew what was going
on in Buffy before me because his
mum had cable.
PAUL
Can't I just tell you?
CLIVE
No spoilers!
PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps
CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.
GRAHAM
(WEAKLY)
Maybe I should make that tea?
ZOIL
Given your description of the
intruder, the police felt your call
was perhaps better directed to us.
MOSES BEHE
And who are you?
ZOIL
Secret Service, sir.
MOSES BEHE
I knew it. You know that devil took
my Ruth.
ZOIL
And Ruth's your daughter?
62.
MOSES BEHE
That's right. Her Mama died when
she was born. I good as brought her
up by myself. Wasn't easy either.
Two mouths to feed and this place
to run.
ZOIL
I understand. Do you have a
photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes
intact and with dark hair.
ZOIL
She's pretty.
MOSES snorts.
ZOIL
Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In
case she tries to contact you.
MOSES BEHE
I do...
ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
satellite phone, moving into a different room.
MOSES BEHE
...and she'll call me if she can.
Ruth's never really been outta
Carbon County.
ZOIL
You say they went East?
MOSES BEHE
Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the
191 after Flaming Gorge if they
ain't using the interstate, there's
been a rig spill just South of
Dutch John.
ZOIL
So?
MOSES BEHE
So that means they'll be on the 44.
Only way to go.
ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.
ZOIL
Let's go. Haggard!
63.
MOSES BEHE
Tell me you're gonna kill that
thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what
it is.
ZOIL
We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.
MOSES BEHE
Watch yourself now. I seen its
eyes. It's evil.
ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.
MOSES BEHE
God's speed, Mr. Zoil.
MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police
scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over
the radio.
ZOIL (O.S.)
We do not refer to the target as
"The Alien'.
MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He
glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying
in the foreground on the kitchen table.
We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.
CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.
PAUL
Wow.
Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
looking out through the RV's windshield.
We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking
out across the vista.
PAUL
There it is, boys. Wyoming.
CLIVE
Is that where we're going?
PAUL
Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at
times like these you winder if the
intelligent design crowd aren't
onto something. I mean look at it.
Hey Ruth, get up here.
They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.
PAUL
Ruth!?
CLIVE
Someone should go after her.
Graham?
CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.
CLIVE
Graham!?
GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased
with himself.
GRAHAM
She's going to be fine. I think
your hair looks good by the way.
You look like Storm.
RUTH
Who's Storm?
PAUL
From X-Men.
GRAHAM
Exactly.
RUTH goes to the bathroom.
RUTH (O.S.)
AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!
The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
round, she looks away.
PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.
CLIVE
Small corrections! Small
corrections!
RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.
68.
We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
suddenly, looking rattled.
GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.
RUTH
You don't mind, do you, Graham?
GRAHAM
It looks nice.
PAUL
Hey, we should stop for something
to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?
69.
RUTH
What?
CLIVE
I'm hungry.
PAUL
What's new, fatty?
CLIVE
Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I
happen to be very strong.
PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
it onto the floor of the RV.
PAUL
Pick that up then.
CLIVE
So childish.
RUTH
Maybe I should call Papa.
PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
What?!
RUTH
Look, I've been missing for a whole
day. If he's called the police,
they'll be looking for us and if
they find us, this "amazing
adventure' is going to come to an
end real quick. I just need to tell
him I'm fine and that I'll be back
soon, okay?
PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
PAUL
Right up top!
RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.
PAUL
Too soon?
CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
CLIVE
I did it!
The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a
variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to
a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.
RUTH
I won't be long.
CLIVE
We'll order food and wait for you
at the bar.
RUTH
Okay.
CLIVE
Be careful.
RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each
other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and
CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.
MOSES BEHE
Tap water.
RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Ruth Behe?
RUTH
Yes?
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Please hold, your call is being
diverted.
71.
RUTH
Wait, I...
ZOIL (O.S.)
Ruth Behe?
RUTH
Yes?
ZOIL (O.S.)
Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen
very carefully. You're in great
danger.
RUTH
How did you...?
ZOIL (O.S.)
We know who you're travelling with
Ruth. I need you and your friend to
turn yourselves in.
RUTH
What if we don't want to turn
ourselves in?
ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop
nearby. O'REILLY listens in.
ZOIL
Where are you? Where are you
headed?
RUTH (O.S.)
I don't know.
ZOIL
Look, I know you think you're doing
the right thing but I promise you,
I'm only thinking about you. And
Paul. You care about Paul, don't
you?
RUTH (O.S.)
I don't know how I feel about him.
He's weird and also, rude.
ZOIL
Yes he is.
RUTH (O.S.)
I asked him why he wore shorts and
he said if he didn't I'd see his
big spaceman balls.
72.
Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.
RUTH
Who's there with you?
ZOIL (O.S.)
Ruth, please listen to me. Your
father is worried about you. We
want to get you home. I need you to
tell me where you are.
RUTH
He showed me things.
ZOIL
You're not still talking about his
balls, are you?
RUTH
I... i just want to know what's
real. I'm confused. I... I...
RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.
HAGGARD (O.S.)
WE GOT HER!
ZOIL (O.S.)
Damnit, Haggard!
RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into
two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.
JAKE
Hey, slow down there cyclops.
RUTH
I need to get to my friends.
GUS
Why the hurry? You know I got a
friend with one eye who'd love to
meet you.
RUTH
I happen to have two eyes actually.
I just have a severe stigmatism.
JAKE
You should get that fixed up.
Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the
right light.
GUS
Yeah, the dark.
73.
RUTH
Papa said the Lord would fix it.
GUS
The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing
sweetheart.
RUTH
No shit.
RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,
RUTH returns from the Phone.
GRAHAM
How's your dad?
RUTH
We need to leave now.
CLIVE
We're still waiting on a wet fries.
The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.
JAKE
Holy shit! It's the space faggots
that dinged the fuck-mobile!
CLIVE
Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps
we can exchange insurance details?
JAKE
I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'.
GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.
GUS
These the "friends' you told us
about, baby?
RUTH
Yes, they are.
JAKE
Well whaddya know? Small world.
RUTH
We were just leaving.
GUS
I don't think so.
74.
JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.
GRAHAM
Leave her alone!
JAKE
What did you say?
CLIVE
(timid but resolute)
He said, leave her alone.
At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately
spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their
attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM
grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through
the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and
comes face to face with her father.
MOSES BEHE
RUTH?!
RUTH
PAPA?!
CLIVE
Graham?
MOSES BEHE
I'm taking you home.
RUTH
I... I can't.
MOSES BEHE
Don't talk back to me, girl!
RUTH
PAPA I-
A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.
The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
sit in silence for a while.
GRAHAM
Was that your dad, Ruth?
RUTH nods.
CLIVE
He was so angry.
RUTH
He's always angry.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.
GRAHAM
Are you alright, Ruth?
RUTH nods, still distant.
PAUL
I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
wanna take a walk?
CLIVE
I'm game.
GRAHAM
You want to come for a walk, Ruth?
RUTH
Thanks, but I think I'm going to
turn in. It's been a long day what
with meeting you guys, being
abducted by and alien and having my
whole belief system called into
question.
PAUL
Sorry about that.
GRAHAM
It was amazing though, wasn't it?
Remember when Paul said "Yo
fucknuts'? That was brilliant.
PAUL
You gotta talk the talk, right?
CLIVE
What about when I got smacked in
the nose?
77.
PAUL
Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
want anything Ruth?
RUTH
No, you go, I'll be fine. Here
Clive.
RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
words "JESUS SAVES'.
CLIVE
Thank you.
He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.
GRAHAM
You can sleep in my bunk if you'd
like.
She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.
GRAHAM
I'd use a pen to push the tissues
off the bed. I've had a cold.
GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.
GRAHAM
Now's not really the time, Sausage.
CLIVE
I must have it.
GRAHAM
It's very cheap. Are you sure you
don't want to save up and get a
proper on?
CLIVE
Oh, come on, we've got time.
Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.
KNOCK KNOCK.
85.
RUTH
Where have you been? I was worried.
She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
ZOIL
Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
Service. Your wagon here matches
the description of a recreational
vehicle we're currently looking
for. May I ask, are you alone?
RUTH pauses a second.
RUTH
Yes, I'm alone.
ZOIL
Do you mind taking a look at these
pictures?
ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.
ZOIL
Do you recognise any of these
people, Miss?
She lingers on the picture of herself.
ZOIL
Miss?
RUTH
No, sorry I don't.
ZOIL
Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
RUTH
Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
been driving for 5 days.
ZOIL
Going far?
RUTH
Austin.
ZOIL
Great town.
RUTH
Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
population you know?
(MORE)
86.
RUTH (CONT'D)
Folks gather by the rive in the
evening to watch them fly out. Turn
the sky black. Quite a sight.
ZOIL
Is that so?
RUTH
Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
getting along.
ZOIL
Of course. Thanks for your time,
Miss...?
Beat.
RUTH
Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.
GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From
the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
cover of the comic and back at PAUL.
PAUL
How's it going?
CHILD
Is that you?
PAUL
No.
CHILD
It looks like you.
PAUL
Suppose it does. What's your name?
CHILD
Keith Nash.
PAUL
I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.
They shake hands.
PAUL
You on your own here, Keith Nash?
87.
KEITH NASH
My Mom's shopping for some new
jeans. She lets me wait in here.
PAUL
Sounds like a good Mum.
KEITH NASH
Yes and no. What're you doing here?
PAUL
My friend's buying a sword. He's a
grown man.
KEITH NASH
What a nerd.
PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.
PAUL
You an M&Ms; man, Keith?
PAUL produces his M&Ms.; He offers one to KEITH.
KEITH NASH
I am but I shouldn't.
PAUL
Strangers with candy, right?
KEITH NASH
Right.
PAUL
Well, we've got a lot in common. We
both like comics and M&Ms.; Guess
that makes us pals.
KEITH NASH
Guess so.
KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms.; They turn their
attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.
PAUL
You read this one?
KEITH NASH
No.
PAUL
It's a good one. Take it. Go on.
It's a gift.
KEITH NASH
Thanks Paul.
88.
KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
NASH calling from the street.
KEITH NASH
I gotta go.
PAUL
Catch you later, Keith Nash.
GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
under his arm and a big grin on his face.
CLIVE
Who was that?
PAUL
Keith Nash. How much was that?
CLIVE
$299.99. It's made of a low grade
Turkish alloy.
PAUL
What did you get, speccy?
GRAHAM
X-Men action figure.
PAUL
Jesus Cheeeerist.
MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his
hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.
VOICE (O.S.)
Zoil, what the hell's going on?
ZOIL (O.S.)
They've double back sir. They're
heading toward New Mexico.
VOICE (O.S.)
You better be right about this,
Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of
this shit. I want that little
fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
MOSES smiles darkly.
MOSES BEHE
Looks like you're going the wrong
way, Agent Zoil. That's what
happens when you don't got the Lord
on your side.
The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and
PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is
holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.
PAUL
He likes you, y'know?
RUTH
Graham? D'you think?
PAUL
What are you, blind?
Beat.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Sorry.
Beat.
PAUL
What you got there, a stigmatism?
92.
RUTH nods.
PAUL
You know you can get on operation
for that, right?
RUTH
Papa said the Lord would fix it.
Guess that's not gonna happen,
seeing as we're living in a
gigantic godless universe, with no
hope of salvation.
PAUL
Hey, I don't know categorically
that it's godless. I just said
"probably'.
RUTH
Oh, that's a relief.
PAUL
Look, the way you're feeling now,
that's why religion appeared in the
first place. It's like existential
Prozac. Imagine being five year
sold and having no adults around to
tell you why it snows or what trees
are for. That's how it is for much
of humanity. Faith is a night-
light. It illuminates the scary
corners, fills the gaps, makes the
universe easier to comprehend.
Thing is, it's okay not to know
everything. I mean, who knows
what's really out there? Did you
know astrophysicists recently
identified the equation for the
creation of matter?
RUTH
Yes.
PAUL
Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
If they have the theory, who's to
say at some point in the future
they won't put it into practice and
who's to say someone else didn't do
that 13.5 Billion years ago and
that's how the universe came to be?
Course, then we get the eternal
problem of who created the creator
but that's a whole other car park.
I think Shakespeare said it best.
"There's more in Heaven and earth
than is dreamt of in your
philosophy Horatio".
93.
RUTH
What did you call me?
PAUL
Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You
know, the Prince of Denmark?
RUTH
Denmark has a municipal population
of 508,691.
PAUL blinks.
PAUL
Anyway, if there is a God, didn't
he create doctors and hospitals and
scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't
have to go round fixing people's
lazy eyeballs?
RUTH
I suppose so.
PAUL
The eye is a delicate and complex
thing, Ruth. You should get it
taken care of.
RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.
RUTH
They're back.
PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.
PAUL
Perfect.
CLIVE
What are you going to do with this?
PAUL
Phone home.
VOICE
ZOIL!
ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.
ZOIL
Yes, sir?
94.
VOICE
Satellite's come up with a data
analysis on all the traffic coming
out of Prospect in the last 5
hours. There was only one RV, and
guess what, nimrod?
ZOIL
It wasn't going to New Mexico?
VOICE
That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
You better spin your ass around.
You got some serious catching up to
do. Don't make me come out there.
ZOIL
No, sir. Where are they headed? If
we gun it, maybe we can get the
drop on their destination.
VOICE
They're on the 50, heading towards
Gillette.
ZOIL
What else is around there?
VOICE
Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem
Creek.
ZOIL
Bethlehem Creek?
VOICE
Holy shit!
MOSES listens intently to his scanner.
VOICE (O.S.)
You don't think she's sill there,
do you?
MOSES smiles.
95.
GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits
opposite, staring at PAUL.
RUTH
Maybe I should make some tea.
TARA
Where are my manners? I never
really have guests. Nobody comes up
here. I go whole weeks without
seeing a soul.
97.
TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.
PAUL
Can I do anything to help?
TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.
TARA
I've only just stopped believing in
you, y'know? Spent a very long time
trying to convince folk about what
happened that night. My parents, my
friends. Everyone thought I was
mad. They told me it was a meteor
that squashed little Paul. Took me
away and did tests they did, said
it was for cosmic radiation. They
said I was concussed,
hallucinating, but I knew you were
real. I pulled you from that
spaceship myself. Sat with you till
the men came and took you away. If
Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
would have seen you too. They kept
telling me I'd imagined it but I
knew different. Pop tried to
understand but they filled his head
with "delayed this' and "post-
traumatic that'. He just used to
smile and say "there, there Tara'.
He got sick when I was seventeen
and died a few years later. I
inherited this place. Word got out
about my story not long after it
happened, so I didn't really have
any friends. Kids used to throw
stones at the house and call me
names. I just kinda retreated into
myself. I'd spend whole nights up
on the roof, staring at the sky,
hoping to catch a glimpse of you
again. I always believed that one
day you"d come back and here you
are.
The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.
TARA
Listen to me gabbing. Milk and
sugar?
PAUL
I'm so sorry.
TARA
What for?
98.
PAUL
For killing your dog and ruining
your life.
TARA
That doesn't matter. Don't you see?
You're real. I was right and all
those folk that said I was crazy?
Well, they can all go fuck
themselves.
PAUL
It's good to see you, Tara.
The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.
TARA
Now, where do you suppose that came
from?
PAUL
Fuck a duck! Get out!
GRAHAM/CLIVE
Shit!
PAUL
Tara, where's the back door?
TARA
In back.
The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door
splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.
The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and
continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back
door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL
vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand
across ZOIL's forehead.
ZOIL
Paul, wait-
A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.
PAUL
Clive?
CLIVE
Yes?
PAUL
A little help?
99.
CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.
HAGGARD
Freeze, space monkey!
GRAHAM
We're cut off.
TARA
Storm cellar!
TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,
as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them.
ZOIL
Godammit Haggard!
The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO
paraphernalia. Models, toys, books, souvenirs from every UFO
hot spot in the land. One the wall is the "Take Me To Your
Dealer' poster. PAUL sees it.
PAUL
Not a fucking cent.
ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching
brakes draw his attention as MOSES BEHE's truck skids up. He
gets out, shotgun in hand.
ZOIL
Oh great!
ZOIL sees MOSES run round to the front of the farmhouse.
ZOIL
Help me up!
100.
O'REILLY sees TEAM PAUL running toward the RV from the front
room. He levels his pistol at PAUL and squints.
O'REILLY find his mark. Pull back to reveal he is stood by
the kitchen door, through which we see the cooker, the simmer
of gas in the air.
O'REILLY
Ready or not.
He fires.
KA-BOOM!!!
O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.
CLIVE
I'll drive!
GRAHAM
Punch it!
101.
The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE
pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying.
GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM
exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and
looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.
TARA
My weed!
CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.
GRAHAM
Your dad's persistent, isn't he?
RUTH
You have no idea.
CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.
CLIVE
I think we have a problem.
GRAHAM
What do we do?
PAUL
Go left.
CLIVE
What?
PAUL
GO LEFT!
CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and
bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life.
102.
ZOIL
(TO HIMSELF)
What the hell is he doing?!
VOICE (O.S.)
Zoil. Progress report!
ZOIL
Sir, I-
HAGGARD
In pursuit, sir.
VOICE
Who the hell is this?
HAGGARD
Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been
compromised. I'm assuming command.
ZOIL (O.S.)
Now wait a goddamn minute!
VOICE
I don't give a shit who's in
command. Where' my fucking
mooncoon?!
HAGGARD
Just ahead of me sir. We're heading
East across scrubland just North of
Mitchell Creek.
VOICE
I don't wanna hear from either of
you jokers until that little mother
fucker is under glass.
HAGGARD
Yes sir!
HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.
103.
CLIVE
They're trying to overtake.
PAUL
Don't let him get past.
CLIVE
Shall I ram him?
RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL
YES!
CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.
CLIVE
What are we doing exactly?
PAUL
(TO HIMSELF)
Immense pressure and temperature
drop. High winds, circulating in
the troposphere, two opposed fronts
clashing. Oh, this is going to be a
good one.
CLIVE
A GOOD WHAT?!
RUTH stares out of the window.
RUTH
Oh my God.
104.
MOSES BEHE
HOLY-
ZOIL is sat mouth agape.
ZOIL
-Shit!
CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing
across the ground toward them.
CLIVE
Are you sure you know what you're
doing?!
PAUL
Twenty seconds.
TARA
Paul, we'll get sucked right up.
PAUL
Stay on target.
A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.
CLIVE
Paul!
PAUL
Stay on target.
CLIVE
They're still coming!
RUTH
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO?
PAUL
Ruth, why don't you count back from
10?
RUTH
Okay. 10...9...
PAUL
Back where I'm from, tornadoes are
part of our daily life. We've
learnt how to live with them, how
to understand them.
CLIVE
They're gaining!
PAUL
We've learnt to anticipate their
behavior, know their personalities,
know when they're playing games.
RUTH
3...
GRAHAM
What games?
RUTH
2...
PAUL
Hide and seek?
RUTH
1...
107.
CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes
down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.
CLIVE
Great Caesar's ghost!
RUTH
How did you do that? How did you
know?
PAUL
Evolution baby.
A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck
round, heading back in the opposite direction.
CLIVE
We've lost them.
TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and
whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back.
GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.
GRAHAM
Sorry.
RUTH
Wait, what about Papa?
CLIVE
I only saw one car following us.
PAUL
Where's Tara?
TARA comes out of the toilet.
108.
TARA
The bulb's gone in there.
GRAHAM
That was just awesome. Amazing
driving Clive. It was like G.T.A.
but potentially fatal. Wasn't it,
Clive? Clive?
A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.
CLIVE
Oh no.
ZOIL drives. Scanning the landscape. Searching.
VOICE
Zoil! What the hell is going on?
ZOIL
We got hit by a twister, sir.
Haggard's dead.
VOICE
What about the other one?
ZOIL
I lost him when the ranch exploded.
VOICE
Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been
one fuck up after another. I should
have handled it myself. I want that
little bastard dead by midnight
tonight or you'll be working
security in a convention centre.
Now where's that RV?
ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.
VOICE
Zoil? ZOIL?
ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.
We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a
long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.
They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks
away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.
118.
A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The
PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.
PUBLICIST
Just one item per person please.
He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in
which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.
RUTH
Hey.
GRAHAM
Hey babe. You okay?
RUTH
I'm just taking Tara over to the
autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's
here!
CLIVE
Oh, say hi from us, won't you?
RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.
MAJOR NERD 1
Uh... were you... did you?
GRAHAM/CLIVE
There you go.
SECURITY MAN (O.S.)
Next in line please.
MAJOR NERD 2
Uh... were you... did you?
GRAHAM/CLIVE
There you go.
SECURITY MAN
Guys, if you've had your book
signed please move on.
Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than
former Special Agent LORENZO ZOIL. CRANE up to reveal the
whole convention floor.
THE END
Paul
