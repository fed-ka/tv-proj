A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT
appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small
and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end,
but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware
that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of
wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the
sky. As we move towards them,
we begin to hear their
conversation...and we can see that the two men are
SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.
CHEKOV
(points to sky)
There he is -- there, to the
South!
SCOTTY
(peers upward)
What are ye, blind? That's a
bird.
As they stare up at the sky...

The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and
we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it
is tumbling directly toward the camera...

As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.
SCOTTY
(concerned)
Repelling the Crystalline
Trench... rafting down lava
flows... orbital skydiving. it's
like the man is running a bloody
decathlon across the galaxy.
Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.
CHEKOV
(re: sound)
That should be him now. I think
he's just crossed the sound
barrier.
They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

The bottle gets CLOSER...

A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS
in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is
charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack
and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man
removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He
smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
roller-coaster.
KIRK
Right on target! I jump out over
the Arabian Peninsula... and I end
up here, right on the dime.
Kirk gets to his feet.
CHEKOV
Actually, Captain, your precise
target area was thirty-five
meters...
(points)
That way.
KIRK
Thanks for pointing that out.
Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden
pain in his back.
KIRK
Oh...
SCOTTY
I've warned ye about that back of
yours. You should have a doctor
take a look at it.
Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his
harness.

6A
The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see
that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265.
Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...
6B
6B
Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.
KIRK
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
elliptical jump. That's where you
jump out over Northern China, and
make three complete orbits before
you start re-entry...
CHEKOV
Captain. Perhaps you have
forgotten that tomorrow is the
christening ceremony.
This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
hesitation and irritation cross his face.
KIRK
I'm not going.
(beat)
Scotty, help me with this chute.
SCOTTY
What do you mean, you're not
going? We promised.
KIRK
When I retired, I swore I'd never
set foot on a starship again, and
I meant it.
CHEKOV
Captain...
KIRK
(firm)
I don't want to hear anymore about
it. I'm not going, and that's
final.

The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon.
The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just
missing it.

The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.
19

The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being
pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
ribbon, lashing against the ship.
21

A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector
dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an
immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which
roils and fluctuates in response.

The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling
ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of
energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

The crippled ship turns and heads away...
FADE TO BLACK.

A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about
the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the
water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we
can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.
41
ON THE MAIN DECK
41
Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the
assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in
full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with
cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at
attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
the timbers creak...
Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally
he
nods to Riker.
RIKER
Bring out the prisoner!
A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.
42
ON A HATCH
42
as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is
shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold
him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain.
The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at
him closely.
PICARD
Mister Worf... I always knew this
day would come. Are you prepared
to face the charges?
Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.
TROI
Answer him!
WORF
I am prepared.
Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large,
rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and
begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes
Worf's shackles.
RIKER
"We, the officers and crew of the
U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound
mind and judgment, hereby make
the following charges against
Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did
knowingly and willfully perform
above and beyond the call of duty
on countless occasions. Two.
That he has been a good and solid
officer on this ship for one score
less twelve years. And Three.
Most seriously... that he has
earned the respect and admiration
of the entire crew."
Riker puts away the scroll
PICARD
There can be only one punishment
for such crimes...
(beat)
I hereby promote you to the rank
of Lieutenant Commander, with all
the rights and privileges thereto.
And may God have mercy on your
soul.
Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
shakes his hand.
PICARD
(cont'd)
Congratulations, Commander.
WORF
(smiles)
Thank you, sir.
Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then
Riker steps in.
RIKER
Extend the plank!!
Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is
being pushed out over the water.
CREWMEMBERS
Into the sea with him... feed him
to the sharks... walk the
plank... etc.
Picard gives Riker a questioning look.
PICARD
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too far, Number One?
RIKER
When we went to ancient Rome for
Deanna's promotion, we threw her
to the lions, remember?
Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of
tea, but he'll go along with it.
Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting
patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is
put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike
until Worf is nearly at the end.
Worf finally stops and turns around.
WORF
(a shout)
WAIT!!
Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over
the side at the water below.
WORF
(a little embarrassed)
I can't swim.
LA FORGE
(calmly, to Worf)
The Holodeck safety program is
engaged... The computer won't let
you drown.
BEVERLY
But the sharks are quite
convincing.
Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
SEA
with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS.
Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail,
looking a little confused at the reaction.
DATA
(to Beverly)
Doctor, I must confess I am
uncertain as to why pushing
someone into freezing, shark-
infested water is amusing.
BEVERLY
It's all done in good fun, Data.
Get in the spirit of things.
DATA
Ah.
Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one
hand and hold her over the rail.
BEVERLY
Data...Data -- !
Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data
looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a
little surprised.
GEORDI
Data. that wasn't funny.
Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's
more confused than ever.
43
PICARD AND RIKER
43
are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly
comes up on deck.
PICARD
Well, now that we're all aboard...
(beat, then smiles)
Number One, bring the ship before
the wind.
(savoring the moment)
Let's see what's out there.
RIKER
Aye, aye, sir.
(to Troi)
Take the wheel, Commander.
Troi takes the ship's wheel.
RIKER
(shouts)
All hands make sail! Raise up
tacks and stand by the braces!
The crew springs into action... rushing to their places
aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the
yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great
satisfaction and
contentment.
PICARD
Imagine what it was like, Will. No
engines... no computers... just
the wind, the sea and the stars to
guide you.
RIKER
Bad food, brutal discipline...

No women.
But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's
thoroughly enjoying himself.
COM VOICE
Bridge to Captain Picard.
PICARD
Picard here.
COM VOICE
There is a personal message for
you from Earth.
PICARD
(annoyed)
Put it through down here.

But the best thing about a life at
sea was that they couldn't get to
you.
Picard walks toward the bow.
PICARD
(to com)
Computer, arch.
46A
ANGLE (VFX-P)
46A
A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible
appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see
a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship.
Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the
monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After
a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something
on the screen.

She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.
TROI

Troi moves toward the bow.
48
ON PICARD (VFX-P)

whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has
just read something on the screen which is very
disturbing.
He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi
moves to him.
TROI

PICARD
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse

He turns OFF the screen.
PICARD

Suddenly a com voice interrupts.

Bridge to Commander Riker.
RIKER
Riker here.
COM VOICE
We're picking up a distress call
from the Amargosa observatory,
sir. They say they're under
attack.
RIKER

Red Alert! All hands to
Battle stations! Captain Picard to
the Bridge.
Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general
rush to the bow of the ship...
CUT TO:
50
50
The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see
ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a
complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch
marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)
51
70
The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the
star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of
energy.
71
73
as an old-style Klingon Bird of Prey decloaks near the
observatory.
74
75
The Bird of Prey cloaks and vanishes.
76
77
The Enterprise warps away just as the shock wave
reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery
EXPLOSION.
CUT TO:
78
85
as it goes into warp.
CUT TO:
86
87
nearing Veridian Three. The planet's STAR is visible.
88
90
A large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush. A
single ROCK FACE juts upward, forming a backdrop for the
plateau. Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has
been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex
structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to
a narrow ledge a dozen meters above.
Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's
combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he
looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard.
He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking
at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.
SORAN
You must think I'm quite the
madman.
PICARD
The thought had crossed my mind...
SORAN
The only possible reason you're
here is because you're not
entirely confident you can shoot
down my probe after all. So
you've come to dissuade me from
my horrific plan.
(beat)
Good luck.
Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.
90A
ANGLE (VFX-P)
90A
Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes
into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau,
enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the
outside. OFF Picard's surprise...
CUT TO:
91
93
Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible
forcefield, looking for some way in. Soran is
concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him
on some level.
PICARD
You don't need to do this,
Soran... I'm sure we could find
another way to get you into this
Nexus.
93A
ANGLE (VFX-P)
93A
Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a
probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS
in the middle of the plateau.
The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a
small car.
Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins
working the control panel.
SORAN
(calm, distracted)
I've spent eighty years looking
for another way, Captain. This is
the only one.
(beat)
Of course, you could always come
with me. You fancy yourself an
explorer. Here's a chance to
explore something no human has
ever experienced.
PICARD
Not if it means killing over two
hundred million people.
(beat, then with
meaning)
I wonder... did your wife Leandra
know that she married a man who
was capable of mass murder?
This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark
and ugly flickers across his face.
PICARD
(continuing; pressing on)
When you tucked your children into
bed... do you suppose they ever
suspected that their father would
one day kill millions as casually
as he kissed them goodnight?
Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see
that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he
finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his
eyes.
SORAN
Nice try.
CUT TO:
94
96
Soran is working intently on the Launcher's Control
Panel. Picard is still walking the perimeter of the
Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran,
find some way to get to him.
PICARD
What you're about to do is no
different from when the Borg
destroyed your world.
Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and
conversational.
SORAN
You're right. And there was a
time when I wouldn't have hurt
anyone. Then the Borg came... and
they showed me that if there is
one constant in this universe,
it's death.
(beat)
Afterwards, I began to realize
that none of it mattered. We're
all going to die anyway. It's
only a question of how and when.
You will too, Captain. You might
contract a fatal disease... you
might die in battle...
Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating
look.
SORAN
... or burn to death in a fire.
Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher
with a confident look... he moves closer to where
Picard is standing.
SORAN
You looked surprised. But you
shouldn't be. I've been to the
Nexus, Captain. I know things
about people.
(beat)
Aren't you beginning to feel time
gaining on you? It's like a
predator. It's stalking you. You
can try to outrun it with
doctors... medicines.new
technologies... but in the end,
time is going to hunt you down...
and make the kill.
This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
he struggles for a moment.
PICARD
We're all. mortal, Soran. It's
one of the truths of our
existence.
SORAN
What if I told you I found a new
truth...
PICARD
The Nexus.
SORAN
Time has no meaning there. The
predator has no teeth.
Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns
away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher.
OFF Picard's disturbed expression...
97
98
Picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the
forcefield. He sees something on the ground -- a
GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is
poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through
which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins
racing... he glances at Soran and then picks up a
pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses
the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield.
-- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see
that the bottom border of the field follows the contour
of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch.
-- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.
SORAN
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty
gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't
want to see you get hurt.
PICARD
Thank you.
Soran returns to working on the Launcher. but Picard
looks back down at the root... then walks away,
planning his next move.
CUT TO:
98A

The Klingon ship is FIRING FOUR T0RPEDOES at the
Enterprise. The torpedoes PASS DIRECTLY THROUGH the
ship's SHIELDS and hit directly on the hull.
103
104
The Enterprise FIRES at the Bird of Prey. but the
phaser shots are stopped by the Klingon SHIELDS, which
flash on when they're hit.
The Bird of Prey returns FIRE. The shot carves a
jagged tear in the Enterprise's hull.
105
106
The Enterprise turns and leaves orbit, but the Klingon
ship is right on top of them... FIRING at the
defenseless starship.
107
108
The Enterprise ROLLS and TURNS back toward the planet,
tries to get away from the Klingon ship. But the Bird
of Prey follows its every move.
109
111
The ship begins shimmering- engaging its cloak.
112
115
The ship IMPLODES, completely destroyed. pieces of
the shattered vessel float past the camera.
116
117
Picard has made his way back to the gnarled root. He
stands a few feet away... a couple of pebbles in his
hand.
He glances at Soran, who's absorbed with his work on
the launcher.
Picard then surreptitiously TOSSES a pebble toward the
root. It misses and BOUNCES off the FORCEFIELD. Soran
looks over his shoulder at Picard, who sits down on a
rock. Soran returns to his work.
Picard tosses a second pebble -- this one also hits the
forcefield. Soran turns with a vaguely irritated look.
SORAN
(as if to a child)
Don't you have anything better to
do?
Picard doesn't respond. Soran goes back to work.
Picard waits a moment, then takes aim and TOSSES
another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble
bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -
inside the forcefield. Picard keeps his expression
neutral, but he's found a way in.
CUT TO:
118
121
Soran is finishing his work on the launcher. On one of
the monitors on the control panel, we can now see alien
graphics and numbers ticking by -- obviously a
countdown in progress. Soran finishes and turns off
the control panel. He steps down and looks over at
Picard, who is standing near the forcefield.
SORAN
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I have an appointment with
eternity and I don't want to be
late.
Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding
toward the top of the rock face. Picard watches him
intently for a few moments... then quickly springs
into action...
122
124
LOOKING FORWARD from behind the REAR of the massive
ship. A CRACK appears as the separation process
begins.
124A
129
Moves away from the battle section... before it can
completely escape, the battle section EXPLODES -- the
force of the explosion hits the saucer section,
knocking it toward the planet.
130
132
Picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back -
he's trying to wriggle underneath the root. It's not
easy. he knows there's not much room between the
ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head
and shoulders underneath when he accidentally TOUCHES the
field and it CRACKLES violently around him --Picard is
jolted by the shock.

SORAN (VFX-P)
132A
turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then
draws his weapon. Soran quickly fires at Picard.

THE GROUND (VFX-P)
132B
is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and smoke,
obscuring Picard
and the whole area momentarily.
-- Soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding, his
disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard
somehow survived. Soran peers through the cloud of
dust and debris.
-- The dust from the explosion finally CLEARS... but
Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground
where he was crawling.

The leading edge of the huge saucer TILTS UPWARD
Slightly. and then it HITS the surface. the saucer
begins to PLOW THROUGH the dense rain forest:
As the
ship continues to tear through the jungle, we INTERCUT
the following sequences.:
138A
138D
Outside the ship, we see a huge WALL of metal CRASHING
through the jungle, uprooting trees... dirt flying...
birds scrambling out of the way... an enormous scene of
destruction as it tears through the foliage...
139
142

The saucer has come to a stop in the middle of a RAIN
FOREST. The passage of the saucer has gouged a long
trail through the forest behind the ship. Off this
startling sight...
CUT TO:
143
143
Soran is climbing up the scaffolding. He gets a couple
of levels up, and then suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the
face. Picard has made it inside the field.
A quick fight ensues, during which Picard is knocked a
few levels down on the scaffolding. He LANDS hard --
happens to look up into the sky. He sees something.--
144
PICARD'S POV - THE SKY (VFX-I)

The ENERGY RIBBON can be seen in the distant sky
-- a bizarre snake of color streaking across the deep blue
sky. Time is almost up.

RESUME ACTION (VFX-I)
145
-- Picard avoids a vicious kick from Soran, glances
down at the probe launcher, and realizes he's got one
chance. He rolls to his feet, runs toward the probe
launcher.
-- There is a THUNDEROUS ROAR as the launcher FIRES THE
PROBE into the sky.
-- The plateau is suddenly quiet as the probe streaks
toward the distant sun and disappears from view.
Picard gets to his knees, stares after the probe,
shocked. He's failed.
-- They watch the sun for a silent moment, waiting...

148
PICARD (VFX-I)
148
gets to his feet and stares at the onrushing Ribbon,
the wind whipping up on the plateau. He backs away at
the sight, coming to a stop with his back against the
scaffolding. There's no where to run...
149
NEW ANGLE- THE PLATEAU (VFX-I)

as the RIBBON OF ENERGY TEARS ACROSS THE SCENE IN A
TERRIFYING TORRENT OF LIGHT AND SOUND. THE SCENE IS
WASHED OUT BY A BLINDING FLOOD OF RED LIGHT... Then
suddenly the Ribbon is GONE... and so are Picard and
Soran. The plateau is strangely and utterly SILENT
after the passage of the Ribbon... even the birds have
stopped chirping in the trees.

being led through a darkened HALLWAY. He is wearing a
blindfold. Off screen hands tug and pull at him,
leading him forward down the hall.
He's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's
going on. He tries to resist, but can't... the hands
keep pulling at him...
He is finally brought out into a larger room, dark.
The hands release him and he stands alone. He takes a
beat and tries to take control of the situation.
PICARD
What's going on? Where am I?
Two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove
the blindfold...

The blindfold drops, revealing a blurry kaleidoscope of
COLORS and SHAPES...
153
ON PICARD
153
as he blinks and tries to focus...
154
PICARD'S POV
154
As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see
is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
sparkling with hundreds of lights.
155
REVEAL THE ROOM
155
A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully
decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly
wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas
tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in
the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling
faces, waiting for him to say something.
Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to
react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we
move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties
standing next to Picard.
WOMAN
Go on... say something. They're
waiting.
Picard is stunned.
PICARD
I... don't know what to say...
One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.
GIRL
Say Merry Christmas, Papa!
PICARD
(in a daze)
Merry... Christmas...
The children break out into applause. The woman kisses
him on the cheek, then steers him to a large,
overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the
children starts handing out presents with much laughter
and chatting.
CHILDREN
This one's for you... where's
mine?... I hope this is the book
I asked for... take this one to
Papa...
As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to
feel an immense
sense of satisfaction and happiness.
It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and
contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience.
He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across
his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even
want to understand at the moment, he is very, very
happy.
GIRL
(to Picard)
Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?
Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in
the world.
PICARD
Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly
beautiful. All of it.
All of the children now crowd around the chair with a
single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the
younger boys speaks up.
YOUNG BOY
This is from all of us.
PICARD
Thank you... I can't imagine what
it is.
Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century
SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational
instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and
gleaming brass.
YOUNG BOY
(excited)
It's a sack-tent!
Picard eyes it with delight.
PICARD
You mean a sextant. And it's a
handsome one at that... from about
eighteen twenty, I'd say.
Wherever did you find it?
GIRL
It's a secret.
PICARD
(smiles)
Oh, a secret... well, that makes
it a doubly special gift. Thank
you... thank you all...
The children react with pleasure. They cluster around
him, showering him with hugs and kisses.
CHILDREN
Merry Christmas, Papa... I love
You, Father... etc.
Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection.
The children pull back and return to their own
presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion
as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played
out.
WOMAN
(to Picard)
I'll go get dinner ready.
they'll be starving in a minute.
Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks
around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.
The children continue to chatter and laugh among
themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious
Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks
over the ornaments and decorations...
156
PICARD'S POV
156
of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of
color and light.
157
PICARD
157
His eye is caught by something in particular on the
tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.
158
PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)
158
His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the
top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass
ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a
star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands
outward into the glass sphere.
It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is
reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the
movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way
the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many
ornaments on the tree.
159
PICARD
159
reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve
within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something
he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an
otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the
reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it
aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands
and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby
window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow
soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.
160
PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)
160
reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the
ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes
that this image is not going to go away... he can't
hide from it.
PICARD
No... this isn't right... this
can't be real...
GUINAN'S VOICE
It's as real as you want it to be.
Picard turns to see
161
GUINAN (VFX-P)
161
standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit
seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B.
As they talk, the children and the woman continue to
move about their business as if Picard and Guinan
aren't there.
Picard is stunned.
PICARD
Guinan... what's going on? Where
am I?
GUINAN
You're in the Nexus.
Picard looks around.
PICARD
This... is the Nexus?
GUINAN
For you. This is where you wanted
to be...
PICARD
But I never had a wife, children,
a home like this...
GUINAN
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...
Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on
Guinan.
PICARD
Guinan, what are you doing here?
I thought you were on the
Enterprise.
GUINAN
I am on the Enterprise...I am
also here.
(off his puzzled look)
Think of me as... an "echo" of the
person you know... a part of her
she left behind...
PICARD
Left behind...?
GUINAN
When the Enterprise-B beamed us
off the Lakul, we were partially
in the Nexus. The transporters
locked on to us... but somehow
everyone left a part of themselves
behind.
PICARD
Soran...?
GUINAN
All of us.
PICARD
Where is he now?
GUINAN
Wherever he wanted to be...
Guinan smiles at him.
BOY'S VOICE
Papa, help me build my castle!
Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play
castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego".
For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the
warm embrace of the fantasy...
PICARD
(to boy)
In a few minutes...
Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay
here becoming more powerful.
PICARD
(continuing, awed, to
Guinan)
These are my children... my
children...
GUINAN
(smiles)
Yeah. They're great, aren't they?
You can go back and see them
born... go forward and see your
grandchildren... time has no
meaning here.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Dinner's ready! Let's go!
There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room.
The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and
takes his hand.
BOY
Papa... are you coming?
Picard looks down into the face of his child. His
heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this
out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few
steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye
is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a
moment... torn between the two images. and then, in
one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends
down to the child...
PICARD
Go on... go on without me...
The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then
obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room
to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to
steel his voice.
PICARD
Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?
GUINAN
Why would you want to leave?
PICARD
(insistent)
Can I?
GUINAN
Yes... where would you go?
PICARD
I don't understand.
GUINAN
I told you, time has no meaning
here. If you leave, you can go
anywhere... any time.
Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
PICARD
I know exactly where I want to
go... and when. Back to that
mountaintop on Veridian Three...
before Soran put out the star. I
have to stop him.
GUINAN
What makes you think things will
be any different this time?
PICARD
You're right. I'll need help.
(beat)
Guinan, will you come back with
me? Together, we could --
GUINAN
I can't leave. I'm already there,
remember?
Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives
him an enigmatic smile.
GUINAN
I know just the guy.
Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen.
Picard turns at the sound --
162
162
Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
Architecturally striking house with spectacular views
in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead,
making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is
just starting to adjust to this sudden change in
location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to
look around the corner and sees -
James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks
exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the
Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is
vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying
himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's
no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard
recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
Century Starfleet officer.
PICARD
James Kirk.
Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him.
His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in
Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the
sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
over-powered him.
KIRK
Beautiful day, isn't it?
PICARD
Yes... yes, it is.
Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.
KIRK
Do you mind?
It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk
wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.
PICARD
Oh.
Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a
vigorous chop with the axe.
PICARD
Captain, do you realize what --
But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.
KIRK
Wait a second. I think
something's burning.
Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of
one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the
house, and Picard follows...
163
166
Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and
finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large
RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He
spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse
is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the
precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse
on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come
over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face.
Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a
moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the
ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something
about that jump is nagging at him...
He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels.
The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the
ravine.
Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the
horse makes the LEAP across yet again.
This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an
immediate stop. We can see on his face that something
is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with
a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.
In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a
horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a
long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by
side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
feelings...
KIRK
(re: ravine)
I must have made this jump fifty
times. and every time it scared
the hell out of me. But not this
time.
(beat)
Because... it's not real.
A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular
hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the
bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see
the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
PICARD
(re: woman)
Antonia?
KIRK
(nods)
She's not real either, is she?
Nothing here is... nothing here
matters...
All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of
self-revelation. He glances around.
KIRK
It's kinda like... orbital
skydiving. Exciting for a few
minutes... but in the end, you
haven't really done anything...
you haven't made a difference...
Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way,
he's truly seeing him for the first time.
KIRK
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
PICARD
That's right.
KIRK
Close to retirement?
PICARD
I hadn't planned on it.
There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't
seen until now.
KIRK
Well, let me tell you something -
don't. Don't let them promote
you... don't let them transfer
you... don't let anything take you
off the Bridge of that ship...
(beat)
Because while you're there, you
can make a difference.
The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard
hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the
whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there
is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and
determination.
PICARD
You don't need to be on the Bridge
of a starship. Come with me.
Help me stop Soran.
(beat)
Make a difference again.
A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,
unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.
KIRK
How can I argue with the Captain
of the Enterprise?
(a beat)
What was the name of that
Planet... Veridian III?
PICARD
That's right.
KIRK
I take it the odds are against us,
and the situation is grim?
PICARD
You could say that.
KIRK
(musing)
Of course, if Spock were here,
he'd say I was being an
irrational, illogical human for
wanting to go on a mission like
that...
And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his
eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.
KIRK
Sounds like fun.
The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as
they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
SCREEN, as seen before.
FADE TO RED
FADE IN:
167
167
Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing
Picard.
SORAN
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I have an appointment with
Eternity and I don't want to be
late.
We realize we are watching the same events play out
again.
Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding
toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the
ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath
the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the
field...
167A
SORAN (VFX-P)
167A
turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then
draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.
167B
THE GROUND (VFX-P)
167B
is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris,
obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.
-- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his
hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived.
Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
-- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
several feet of the ground where he was crawling.
167C
SORAN (VFX-I)
167C
Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
kicks him in the head.
168
REVEAL KIRK
168
who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men
begin to fight.
169
NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)
169
as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up
onto the control platform and desperately begins trying
to shut down the launcher...
The following happens very quickly:
-- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.
-- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense
of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is
bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and
alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues
to race by.
169A
THE SKY (VFX-I)
169A
the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...
169B
THE MOUNTAINTOP
169B
Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it
to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...
-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel.
Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting
buttons...looking for other control panels, anything
to affect the launcher.
169C
ANGLE (VFX-P)
169C
Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the
screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in
the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.
169D
PICARD (VFX-P)
169D
begins working the control panel... desperate... he
looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the
probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is
left standing on an invisible platform three feet in
the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to
do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of
the controls.
-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward.
Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk
stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back
in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
movie.
PICARD
(desperate)
Kirk -- there's a control PADD in
his right pocket!
169E
KIRK (VFX-P)
169E
sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down,
pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He
begins working it...
170
CLOSE ON SORAN
170
His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks
around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet
away, just beyond his reach...
171
THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P)
171
Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.
171A
KIRK (VFX-P)
171A
he smiles.
KIRK
The twenty-fourth century isn't so
tough.
Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from
behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor
in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the
weapon at Picard.
172
MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE
172
The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame.
Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs
into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads
toward the sun...
172A
THE PROBE (VFX-I)
172A
makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down
toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the
probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We
hear a muffled explosion.
172B
SORAN (VFX-I)
172B
can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks
into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking
overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he
rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
173
PICARD
173
moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes
flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly
wounded.
174
SORAN (VFX-I)
174
is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward
the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.
SORAN
No...
His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns
to Picard.
SORAN
YOU!!
174B
NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)
174B
He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the
scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He
GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
SORAN IN MID-AIR .
Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead.
The pocket watch has been shattered.
175
PICARD
175
turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his
lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged
breath.
KIRK
Nice shot.
Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.
PICARD
I'll find a way to contact the
Enterprise. You're going to be
all right.
KIRK
Did we do it? Did we make a
Difference...?
PICARD
Yes.
(beat)
Thank you.
KIRK
Least I could do...for a Captain
of the Enterprise.
Kirk coughs again
PICARD
Try to hang on.
Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his
face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his
face
KIRK
It was fun.
Kirk dies.
Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the
quiet clearing.
DISSOLVE TO:
176
176
Close on Picard's hand
as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones.
MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few
rocks on Kirk's grave.
He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
and stands there silently for a few moments.
A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks
up into the sky...
177
PICARD'S POV (VFX-I)
177
An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky
toward the mountaintop.
178
178
The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as
Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D.
security guards jump out to meet him.
WORF
Captain, are you all right?
PICARD
Yes.
LA FORGE
What about Doctor Soran?
PICARD
You needn't worry about the Doctor
anymore.
Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he
notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and
notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on
his face and Worf's uniform is torn.
PICARD
Was there a problem with the
Klingons?
Worf and La Forge exchange a look.
GEORDI
You could say that...
CUT TO:
179

as seen before.
PICARD (V.O.)
