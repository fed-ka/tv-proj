  CLOSE ON a BUMPER covered in STICKERS:  Labor Built This 
  Country,   Trust Me, I m A Lawyer,   How Can You Be Pro 
  Choice and Pro War?   WIDEN to REVEAL a Prius Plug-In Hybrid 
  speeding down a two-lane highway.  Over this we HEAR:

                              DAD (V.O.)
                -- I didn t spit in his face.  Throwing 
                popcorn is not spitting.


  Mereta and Garza emerge to find PROTESTERS holding candles 
  and waving posters.  Jostling through the crowd:

                                MERETA
                -- which is why these people are here.

                              GARZA
                You sure?  Maybe Springsteen is playing.

  Off  Stop the execution!    Gregory Beals is innocent!   

                                MERETA
                No, it s you they want.  On a stake.

  They arrive at their LIMO when from behind Garza, angry:

                                PROTESTER
                You re going to let Beals die, aren t 
                you?

  Garza turns.  He loves to engage detractors.  Especially 
  blonde, blue-eyed, attractive ones.  Mereta rolls her eyes.  
  She knows where this is going.

                              GARZA
                Let me guess -- ACLU.

                                PROTESTER
                Card carrying member.

                                MERETA
                Justice, we really should go.

                              GARZA
                Before you burn a flag in protest,  
                remember a jury unanimously convicted 
                Beals of killing a cop.  Three appellate 
                courts saw no reason to overturn that 
                verdict, but perhaps you know better.  

                                PROTESTER
                I might, if you d let him have a fair 
                trial.

                              GARZA
                I don t  let  people have anything.  I 
                follow the law --   

                                MERETA
                -- you have an eight a.m. call --                                                                                      8.


                              GARZA
                -- if Beals had exculpatory evidence he 
                had to present it at the state habeas 
                hearing.  He didn t. 

                                PROTESTER
                Because he had an attorney who slept 
                through the trial!

                                MERETA
                      (pulling Garza to the car)
                I m sorry to interrupt, but we really do 
                need to go and if you have a problem with 
                the law, maybe you should take it up with 
                the law makers --  

                              GARZA
                -- while you re at it, how about picking 
                up a copy of the Constitution?  If a law 
                violates it, I ll overturn it.  If not, 
                I m Switzerland.

                                PROTESTER
                Wow, would your dad be disgusted right now.  

  Garza stops, turns back.  A nerve s clearly been hit.

                                PROTESTER (CONT D)
                He was a hero of mine.   He was never 
                   Switzerland .  He used the law to give 
                people hope, to lift their spirits, not 
                to shatter their dreams.  He wasn t 
                afraid of anything.

                              GARZA
                He d be terrified of you.

                                PROTESTER
                He d agree with me.  That his son is... 
                is a...

                              GARZA
                Schmuck?

                                PROTESTER
                Yes!

                              GARZA
                Yeah, he used to call me that a lot.

                                PROTESTER
                Does making a joke like that help you 
                sleep at night?                                                                                       9.


                              GARZA
                It s not a joke and I sleep like a baby.  
                Though for you I d be happy to make an 
                  exception.


  Garza gets out.  The Limo pulls away.  Off Garza, alone on a 
  dark corner, we HEAR the DRIBBLING of a BALL --  


  Garza, drenched in sweat, drives hard to the basket above the 
  garage for a lay up.  Venting his aggression, when --

                              AL (O.C.)
                  One-on-none in the middle of the night?  
                This can t be good.

  Garza looks up, sees Al walking up the driveway.

                              GARZA
                  Vidalin s threatening to impeach me.  

                              AL
                What?

                              GARZA
                You know why?  What my sin is?  I won t 
                execute Greg Beals.  

  As he tosses Al the ball --

                              AL
                You re being blackmailed into murdering 
                my client?  

                              GARZA
                But that s not what really pisses me off.

                              AL
                  Something could piss you off more?!

                              GARZA
                Okay, not more.  Nothing s worse than 
                that.  But a close second?  Sidney s 
                right -- I don t belong on the Court.  

                              AL
                What?  Okay, are you drunk?                                                                                    16.


                              GARZA
                No, I m not drunk.  But two hours ago I 
                was sitting in the back of his limo and 
                you know what I was thinking?  

                              AL
                That he s the one who should be impeached?

                              GARZA
                That you were right about Dad.  He used 
                to joke that you and I must ve been 
                switched at birth because you guys agreed 
                on everything.

                              AL
                Not quite everything.  I mean now that 
                he s not around I think it s safe to 
                admit I didn t think  An Inconceivable 
                Truth  was the greatest movie ever made.

                              GARZA
                My whole life I ve thought his ideas were 
                naive, even dangerous.  But I swear to 
                God a few nights ago I was watching 
                  documentary footage of him and weeping.

                              AL
                Weeping?  Really?  Okay, but you were 
                trying to get a girl in bed, right?

                              GARZA
                No, she was already asleep.  
                      (then)
                He never thought people should take 
                  responsibility for their own lives.  That 
                everyone was a victim.  He was like St. 
                Jude.  It was always one lost cause after 
                another.  Remember Jeremy Tuggenberg -- 

                              AL
                You kidding?  The drooler your dad 
                wouldn t cut from our rec league team?
                He let him shoot twelve free throws every 
                time he got fouled.  

                              GARZA
                Exactly.  My dad was willing to bend the 
                rules whenever it suited him.  I hated 
                that.

                              AL
                Are you telling me you based your entire 
                legal philosophy on the Toogs?                                                                                    17.


                              GARZA
                Yes, on following the rules.  On putting 
                the system before the individual.  But 
                now... since the accident... I feel as if 
                by doing that I m hurting the people I 
                should be protecting.

                              AL
                People like Greg Beals?

                              GARZA
                Yeah.  People like Greg Beals. 

                              AL
                So what are you saying?

                              GARZA
                I m saying screw Sidney.


  TV news crews record protestors burning Garza s picture in 
  effigy.  Sidney was right: Garza is viewed as a traitor.

                                CLAIRE SAX (PRELAP)
                Wow, you really can t win...


  Eddie and Lucinda watch Mereta set lunch on a poker table.  
  Takes out poached salmon, grilled vegetables as -- 

                              LUCINDA
                So what are you, his law clerk or his 
                Girl Friday?

                                MERETA
                I try to help Justice Garza, I mean, Mr. 
                Garza, wherever I can.

                              LUCINDA
                Do you sometimes help him on your knees?

  Eddie bursts out laughing, Mereta remains poised.

                                MERETA
                If by that you mean do we have anything 
                other than a professional relationship, 
                the answer is no.  Salmon?

  Mereta sets a plate in front of Lucinda, takes a seat.

                              EDDIE
                Why do I feel like I m at the last 
                supper?  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    22.

                              EDDIE (CONT'D)
                  I graduate number one, I m president of 
                law review, I deserve better than to get 
                one of the top jobs in the country only 
                to have my justice go postal.

                                MERETA
                I think what he s doing is amazing.

                              EDDIE
                What, representing a cop killer?  The 
                state had an eyewitness who said Beals 
                did it.  The medical examiner blew out 
                his alibi at trial.  

                              LUCINDA
                Hey Harvard, if you don t like it, what 
                are you doing eating the salmon?

                              EDDIE
                Don t worry.  My resume s in with Justice 
                  Esposito.  As soon as he gets the okay to 
                add an extra clerk, I am out of here.

  Just then the front door opens, it s Garza and Al.  

                              LUCINDA
                What was that?  I m not sure I heard you.

  Eddie smirks, as --

                              GARZA
                  Excellent.  You re all here.  Mereta, 
                thanks for picking up lunch.

                                MERETA
                There s fruit in the kitchen and drinks 
                in the  fridge.  Since this is our new 
                office, I thought I should stock up.

  Lucinda puckers and makes an ass-kissing sound.

                              GARZA
                I want you guys to meet Al Druzinsky, our 
                new partner.  

                              EDDIE
                You represent Greg Beals.

                              AL
                Only through his last two appeals.

                              GARZA
                Al s the reason Beals is still alive.  
                I just got the briefing schedule.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    23.

                              GARZA (CONT'D)
                It s a nightmare so lets dive in.  I 
                assume you guys have read through the 
                trial transcripts.  Any thoughts?

                                MERETA
                I ll go first.  
                      (off her NOTES)
                It s not based on the transcripts, but 
                Aaron Whelply?  The eyewitness in the 
                case, he told his shrink he never saw 
                Beals the night Pam Hogan was murdered.

                              AL
                He recanted his testimony?  When?  He 
                died in prison six months ago. 

                                MERETA
                Dr. Felicia Moore was his court appointed 
                  therapist.  She just called the office, 
                actually our old office.  I guess with 
                the publicity of you taking the case she 
                decided she wanted to come forward.

                              GARZA
                Will she testify?

                                MERETA
                Uh, I didn t ask her that exactly, but --

                              GARZA
                Call her, get her depo, see if she ll 
                testify.  What else?

                              AL
                There s the time line issue.  Pam Hogan s 
                body was found in a crack house on April 
                8th.  At trial the ME said the killing 
                could ve happened as early as April 3rd.

                              LUCINDA
                The one day Beals doesn t have an alibi. 

                              EDDIE
                Because starting April 4th he was in jail 
                for stealing a truck.  Some alibi.

                              GARZA
                Are the ME s dates solid?  Did anyone 
                ever challenge him?

                              AL
                No, but I came to this case after the 
                habeas hearing.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    24.

                              AL (CONT'D)
                No new evidence was allowed.   And I 
                don t know how you think you re going to 
                get any in now. 

                              GARZA
                Leave that to me.   Meanwhile Lucinda, 
                see if you can shake the ME s story.

                              LUCINDA
                I ll call the body farm.

                              EDDIE
                I don t want to know what that is, do I?

                              GARZA
                Too bad, cause you re going with her.

                              LUCINDA
                  I promise I won t bite.

                              EDDIE
                Can I get that in writing?

                              GARZA
                Now there s a good lawyer.  Okay, 
                anything else?  No?  Cause there s one 
                thing that s bugging me.  I got a call 
                today from the DA.  He wants to set up a 
                meeting with Clark Hogan.

                                MERETA
                The victim s husband?  

                              GARZA
                Seems he s unhappy we ve taken this case.

                              EDDIE
                Can you blame him?  As far as he s 
                  concerned you re trying to free his wife s 
                killer.  He probably hates your guts.  

                              GARZA
                Yeah well, line forms to the left.


  Eddie hovers, uneasy as Lucinda kneels beside a corpse.

                              EDDIE
                Are we here to meet a forensic 
                  anthropologist or an axe murderer?

                              LUCINDA
                These bodies were donated.  It s called 
                science.  I know you right wing wackos 
                have an issue with that, but 
                  unfortunately Jesus isn t around to tell 
                us when exactly Pam Hogan died.

                              EDDIE
                And the maggot eating that guy s eye will?  

                              LUCINDA
                People lie.  Maggots don t.  The secrets 
                of the dead are no different from the 
                secrets of the living.  All you need to 
                know is where to look.

                              EDDIE
                Where do you look for Garza s?  I mean, 
                why d he really quit?  He break the law?  
                Get a girl pregnant?

                              LUCINDA
                O-oh, maybe you re right.  Maybe he has 
                some dark secret.  Does that turn you on?  

                              EDDIE
                What?  No.

                              LUCINDA
                Really?  Because I m starting to think 
                you have some dark secrets of your own.
                You re gay, aren t you?  It s okay.  Just 
                admit it.  

                              EDDIE
                First you think I want to  get in your 
                pants , now you re saying I m gay?  Maybe 
                I just don t find you that attractive.  

                              LUCINDA
                Or maybe you re bi.  I am.  Hey, Steve --

  REVEAL anthropologist STEVEN ZARET, 30s, a ponytailed hippie, 
    approaching, in his hand is a manila ENVELOPE.                                                                                     31.


                              LUCINDA (CONT D)
                -- thanks for helping with this.  Get a 
                chance to look at the autopsy photos? 

                              ZARET
                Yep.  I m ready to go over them with you.    

  As Zaret pulls autopsy PHOTOS from the envelope -- 

                              LUCINDA
                Great.  Oh, and this is Harvard.  He s 
                thinking of coming out.

                              ZARET
                That s cool.  So take a look.

  Zaret lays the PHOTOS on the ground by the corpse.  This is 
  our first look at the brutal murder of Pam Hogan.   

                              ZARET (CONT D)
                Right here you can see the marbled 
                  appearance of her extremities.  That 
                along with the bloating, indicates she 
                died approximately seven degree days 
                before autopsy.

                              EDDIE
                Degree days?  What does that mean?

                              ZARET
                The temperature affects decomposition.  
                The warmer it is, the faster a body 
                  decomposes.  An average temperature of 70 
                degrees would put her death no earlier 
                than April 8.  But if it was below 60, 
                she could ve died as early as April 1.

                              EDDIE
                Three days before Beals was jailed.

                              LUCINDA
                So if it was 60 degrees, Beals has no 
                alibi.  If it was 70, we ve got a case.  

                              EDDIE
                Okay, that s great, but how the hell do 
                we find out what the temperature was 
                inside a Richmond crack house during the 
                first week in April, eleven years ago?

                              ZARET
                Among other things, you ll need access to 
                the Department of Energy s computers, 
                which are classified.                                                                                    32.


                              LUCINDA
                I don t think that ll be a problem.


  Lucinda applies lipstick when Eddie arrives, holding a 
  monogrammed BRIEFCASE as --  

                              EDDIE
                For the record?  I m not a party to this.

                              LUCINDA
                Did you get the stuff or not?

                              EDDIE
                  Everything that s legal.  
                      (re: briefcase CONTENTS)
                  I figured the house Pam Hogan was found 
                in wasn t always a crack den, so I pulled 
                  construction permits.  I got the floor 
                plans, venting and insulation specs.

                              LUCINDA
                  Insulation specs?  How butch of you.

                              EDDIE
                Do you take anything seriously?

                              LUCINDA
                Me?  You re the one who s gonna ditch 
                this case the minute Justice Esposito 
                blows his dog whistle.  You do realize 
                we re trying to save an innocent man s 
                life here, right? 

                              EDDIE
                I ll be sure to mention that when 
                Homeland Security comes in and busts us. 

                              LUCINDA
                Wow.

                              EDDIE
                What?

                              LUCINDA
                I m just picturing the meltdown you re 
                gonna have when your little fantasy world 
                where Homeland Security busts me for 
                flashing my boobs comes crashing down.

                              EDDIE
                Flashing your boobs?  That s your big 
                plan for accessing classified data?                                                                                    36.


                              LUCINDA
                Hey, they re nice boobs.  Not that you ll 
                ever know.

  And with that, Lucinda grabs the briefcase, and heads off.  


  Al hands Garza a Big Gulp as --

                              AL
                It s diet, with a splash of cherry.

                              GARZA
                I take it you heard we lost the shrink. 

                              AL
                Yep.

                              GARZA
                And this is a polite version of I-told-
                      you-we-should ve-taken-the-deal.

                              AL
                Actually it s my macho way of apologizing 
                for walking out on you in court.  But in 
                the I-told-you-we-should ve-taken-the-deal 
                  department, you seen the Richmond paper?

                              GARZA
                Let me guess, Clark Hogan.

                              AL
                Front page.  It basically accuses us, 
                sorry you, of forcing the  hero cop  to 
                relive his worst nightmare.  I know every 
                DA tries his case in public --

                              GARZA
                Only when he s running scared.

                              AL
                I m just saying the judge could be 
                  influenced.

  Just then Lucinda and Eddie bound out of the house -- 

                              EDDIE
                We got it!  Beals  alibi, it holds.
                Lucinda was amazing --

                              LUCINDA
                He s in love with me now.                                                                                    37.


                              EDDIE
                No, it s just -- 

                              GARZA
                It s okay.  We re all in love with her. 

                              AL
                I m not in love with her, no offense.  
                So, what did you find?

                              LUCINDA
                The temperature in the crack house was 
                never below 70 degrees which based on the 
                rate of decomposition means the earliest 
                the murder could ve happened was April 8th.  

                              GARZA
                Five days after Beals was sent to prison. 
                He couldn t have done it.  

                              AL
                Okay, I am in love with her after all. 

  Just then a TOWN CAR pulls into the driveway.  The group 
  watches as a DRIVER opens the door for Claire Sax.

                              GARZA
                Claire.  What a mildly pleasant surprise. 

                                CLAIRE SAX
                  I thought we should discuss your request 
                in person, and since you seem to have no 
                interest in using the office we ve 
                supplied for you --

                              GARZA
                You came to me.  Even better.  Al, Eddie, 
                Lucinda, this is Claire Sax.  Our ATM.  
                      (to Claire)
                We just got some good news on the case. 
                Al, call the court.  Tell them we need 
                more time to file an amended brief.
                      (to Lucinda and Eddie)
                You two start writing.  If we re lucky 
                we ll get  til the morning.

  After they exit and Garza is alone with Claire:

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                So?  You wanted to discuss?  

                                CLAIRE SAX
                You call and ask for $250,000 cash -- ?                                                                                    38.


                              GARZA
                I told you.  It s an advance, to cover my 
                  expenses.  

                                CLAIRE SAX
                Your expenses?  What, like your team?  
                You re paying them in cash?  They re 
                lawyers, not drug mules. 

                              GARZA
                It s not for my team, okay?  I have a 
                personal issue.  And I need you to 
                respect that.  If you can t, I m more 
                than happy to beg.  As I recall you like 
                it when I do that.

                                CLAIRE SAX
                Just tell me this isn t going to get me 
                in trouble.

                              GARZA
                It s not going to get me in trouble.

  She shakes her head, smiling.  She turns to go --

                              GARZA (CONT D)
                Was that a yes?  That s a yes, right?

                                CLAIRE SAX
                      (not turning back)
                Yes!

  On Garza, this guy always seems to get his way...


  Garza pays for a coffee, brings it to Mereta. 

                                MERETA
                Look, I didn t mean to embarrass you in 
                front of everyone.  And you may not feel 
                the same way as I do, and that s okay, 
                but I m glad I got to tell you before... 
                well, you know...

                              GARZA
                Doc Levin is my bookie.

                                MERETA
                What?

                              GARZA
                He s called Doc because no one operates 
                on the spread better.  

                                MERETA
                But he said you only have six months.

                              GARZA
                To pay what I owe.  Turns out no one can 
                beat a six deck shoe.

                                MERETA
                Politico was right?

                              GARZA
                No, they were wildly inaccurate.  They 
                said I owed half a million.  It s only 
                two fifty.

                                MERETA
                So you re not dying?

                              GARZA
                Not unless you want to kill me.

                                MERETA
                You re completely healthy.

                              GARZA
                Listen, about what you said --

                                MERETA
                -- Oh my god.  Everybody heard.                                                                                    45.


                              GARZA
                It s okay.  I talked to them.

                                MERETA
                What did you say?  I mean, other than I m 
                fired.

                              GARZA
                Mereta, you re not fired.  In fact, I 
                feel like maybe it s my fault, saying 
                that I hired you because you re pretty.  
                Maybe that gave you the wrong impression.

                                MERETA
                Yeah, maybe.  Okay, I ll go with that.  
                It s your fault.

                              GARZA
                And as far as what I told them, let s 
                start with the easier part.  The six 
                months.  I didn t mention the debt.  I d 
                rather just keep that between you and me 
                if that s okay.
                      (Mereta nods, then:)
                What I did say is that I ve been having 
                some GI problems and that everything s 
                fine, but that when Doc Levin said I d 
                have to be retested in six months, you 
                heard I had six months to live.

                                MERETA
                And they bought that?

                              GARZA
                People don t ask a lot of questions when 
                you mention GI problems.  Now, about the 
                other part. I m forty-five, never been 
                married, and I don t even know the names 
                of the last three girls I slept with...

                                MERETA
                Cindy Sugarman, Hailey Simpson, Chelsea 
                  Hathaway.

                              GARZA
                      (he has to laugh)
                You are way too good for me.

                                MERETA
                But not good enough.
                      (beat, then bailing him out)
                I ll see you back at the office.  Don t 
                worry, your secret s safe with me.                                                                                      46.


  ON Garza, watching her walk away...


  The CAMERA FOLLOWS a wire from a telephone junction box, 
  mounted on a HOUSE.  It leads into the passenger window of --


  A different kind of family.  Celebrating a victory.  Garza 
  plays hoops with Al and Al s kids (Willa, Luca and BEN).  
  They re all wearing  Garza s Just Deserts  T-Shirts.  So is 
  the mutt.  Music blares from a BOOM BOX.  A cloud of smoke 
  rises from the BBQ revealing Eddie working the grill.  
  Lucinda approaches, looking for seconds -- 

                              EDDIE
                You re loving me now.

                              LUCINDA
                No, I just like your meat.  

  As he puts a brat on her plate -- 

                              EDDIE
                I ll let my Harvard buddies know.

                              LUCINDA
                      (starts to go)
                You do that.                                                                                    59.


                              EDDIE
                By the way, I decided not to go with 
                  Esposito.  I m staying.

                              LUCINDA
                Oh, thank god.  You and I can finally 
                make love among the legal briefs.
                      (beat, off Eddie)
                I m kidding!  Oh my god, you actually 
                thought -- 

                              EDDIE
                No!

                              LUCINDA
                Good.  Because it s not happening.  Ever.  
                Keep your meat on the plate.

                                MERETA
                Can I have a hot dog?

  REVEAL Mereta, approaching with a plate.  

                              EDDIE
                Sure.  One hot dog coming up.

                              LUCINDA
                Is that for you or your lover, I mean 
                boss?

                                MERETA
                      (deep breath then,)
                What I said before was said in a moment 
                of stress and misunderstanding and does 
                not reflect how I truly feel and I 
                  apologize if I put any of you in an 
                  uncomfortable position.

    Uncomfortable position?  Lucinda busts out LAUGHING, leaves.

                              EDDIE
                Don t worry about it.  Sometimes we all 
                say things we wish we hadn t.  Except for 
                Lucinda, who always says things we wish 
                she hadn t. 

  ANGLE ON Garza talking on the PHONE, while watching Al and 
  his kids on the basketball court.  

                              GARZA
                  ...Sounds great.  I ll talk it over with 
                Al and get back to you.   

  He hangs up as Al makes a three-pointer.                                                                                     60.


                              AL
                Claire s hot for you now.

                              GARZA
                  Everyone s hot for us now that we won.  
                That was about a case in Florida.  Some 
                 David  going up against big pharma.

  Just then Willa walks past, gives Garza a Hitler Salute.  Al 
  shakes his head -- 

                              AL
                Maybe you were right not to have kids.

                                MERETA
                Excuse me, Justice.  I mean, Mister Garza --

                              GARZA
                How about Cyrus?

                                MERETA
                There s someone here to see you.  It s 
                one of the neighbors.  He s complaining 
                about the music.

  ON Garza, thinking that s odd...
