      A class of SOPHOMORES stand in pairs at lab stations, each 
      equipped with a blood kit. BAY KENNISH (petite, dark-haired, 
      and dark-eyed) has taken a lot of liberty with her school 
      uniform - rips, patches, acrylic paint drops - and an 
      intricate pen drawing of a building sprawling up her leg. 

      Everyone sticks out their tongue, seeing if they roll. 
      Aaaaaahh...

      Bay sees one guy making a perfect tongue tube.

                                  BAY 
                    Excellent tongue control, Connor! 
                          (winks)
                    Good to know. 

                                  MS. GOLD
                          (sharply)
                    Bay.  

      Bay looks at her innocently. What?

                                  MS. GOLD (CONT'D)
                    Let s begin our blood type tests. 
                    Use the needle to prick a drop of 
                    blood onto each of the four fields 
                    on your test card. 

      Everyone begins to prick their fingers - lots of yelping and 
      laughing as Ms. Gold continues.                                                                                       2.



                                  MS. GOLD (CONT'D)
                    The fields contain antibodies, 
                    which will provoke a reaction with 
                    antigens on your red blood cells, 
                    revealing if you are type A, B, O 
                    or the most rare type, AB.


      The Kennish family - Bay, her parents JOHN & KRISTEN, and 
      brothers TOBY (17) and LUKE (11) settle around the table for 
      a balanced, beautifully prepared meal. (Everyone in the 
      Kennish family except Bay is tall, blonde, blue-eyed.) 

                                  BAY
                      Apparently it s extremely rare. 
                    Only 1% of the population is AB.

      The conversations are fluid and overlapping -

                        TOBYLUKE
      I gotta run after dinner. And I need posterboard for 
      There s this partner thing social studies. 
      for English.

                                  JOHN
                    Bay, it s impossible. Mom and I are 
                    both type A. That means you have to 
                    be either A or O.  

                                  BAY
                    It said AB. And blood don t lie. 

                                  JOHN
                    I m telling you, it s genetically 
                      inconceivable. 

                                    LUKE/BAY/TOBY
                          (Princess Bride)
                      Incontheebable!                                                                                      3.



                                  JOHN
                          (laughing, but insistent)
                    It is! 

                                  LUKE 
                          (Mandy Patinkin)
                     I do not think that means what you 
                    think it means. 

      Bay crosses to the couch, pulls out her blood type card, 
      slaps it on the table. It says type AB.

                                  JOHN
                          (puzzled)
                    This can t be right. 

                                  BAY
                    It s right! I m AB! 

                                  EVERYONE
                      INCONTHEEBABLE! 


      John and Kristen wash up at side-by-side sinks. 

                                  JOHN
                    But it is.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    Are you going to take the Jag in 
                    this week or am I? Because I have 
                    the diabetes fundraiser. 

                                  JOHN
                    The thing is, I kind of remember 
                    when she was a kid - them saying 
                    she had a really rare blood type. I 
                    just didn t connect the dots - that 
                    we re both A and it s not possible. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    And can you take Luke tomorrow?

                                  JOHN
                    Kristen, you re not getting it. If 
                    she s AB, and we re both A, she 
                    can t be our daughter. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Sometimes we may wish she wasn t 
                    our daughter.                                                                                       4.



                                  JOHN
                    Just look at her, Kristen. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    You know there s Italian blood on 
                    my great grandmother s side! She 
                    got her dark coloring from her. 

                                  JOHN
                    We ve joked for years that she was 
                    the mailman s kid. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Well Toby was two years old when I 
                    got pregnant with Bay, and I assure 
                    you I was way too tired to have an 
                    affair.

                                  JOHN
                    There s something wrong here. She s 
                    right. Blood doesn t lie.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Enough with the amateur scientist 
                    bit, okay? Please just let it go. 

                                  JOHN
                    All right, all right.  


      Bay stands frozen, toothbrush in hand, listening to her 
      parents  conversation, which echoes through the pipes. She 
      looks stunned. There s something to this and she knows it.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bay loiters by Ms. Gold s desk a bit hesitantly after class. 

                                  BAY
                    Ms. Gold? Can I talk to you a sec?

      Her serious demeanor surprises Ms. Gold. 


      The other kids have gone now. Ms. Gold and Bay are alone.                                                                                        5.



                                  BAY
                    My family and I have always made up 
                    these elaborate reasons why I don t 
                    look anything like them. Maybe the 
                    answer is the obvious one. 

                                  MS. GOLD
                    Which is what? 

                                  BAY
                    I don t know exactly. But deep 
                    down, I ve kind of always known 
                    something was wrong. 

                                  MS. GOLD 
                    Genes can be a shake of the dice. 
                          (admits)
                    Though I can t explain the blood 
                    type mismatch.

                                  BAY 
                    I ve been researching...There are 
                    places you can go. They take DNA, 
                    do genetic tests...
                          (beat)
                    I know my dad s worried. He s been 
                    secretly looking into it too. 

                                  MS. GOLD
                    There are places like that. I just 
                    think you all really need to think 
                    this through first. Once you open 
                    this box, there s no going back.

                                  BAY
                    If it were you, wouldn t you need 
                    to know?


      Bay sits between Kristen and John, facing a genetic counselor 
      named MARGARET. Everyone looks solemn and extremely anxious. 

                                  MARGARET
                    We ve done extensive 12 marker 
                    testing on all three of you... 
                          (beat)
                    It s 99.9% certain that Bay is not 
                    related to you. 

      Kristen gasps. John grabs Bay s hand.                                                                                        6.



                                  MARGARET (CONT'D)
                    The hospital believes there was a 
                    mix-up.

                                    KRISTEN
                    A  mix-up ...? 

                                  MARGARET
                    Someone wasn t careful matching the 
                    ID anklets. It s extremely rare, 
                    but at a busy hospital...
                          (beat)
                    You took home someone else s baby, 
                    and another family took home yours. 

      Kristen goes pale. 

                                  MARGARET (CONT'D)
                    We re focused on one particular 
                    girl who was also born on October 
                    22, 1995 at North Austin Medical. 
                    They re in the process of locating 
                    and contacting that family now. 

                                  BAY
                    You mean - my real parents. Their 
                    real daughter. 

                                  MARGARET
                    We say  biological , not  real .

                                  BAY
                    But what you re saying is, there s 
                    some girl out there in my house, 
                    with my parents, living my life. 

                                  MARGARET 
                    It s obviously a lot to take in...

                                    KRISTEN
                    And just what are we supposed to do 
                    now? Switch back?  

                                  MARGARET
                    Honestly? In cases like these, 
                    there s no road map.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The kitchen has been turned into a makeshift hair salon, with 
      silver foils, blow dryers, and dyes crowding the counter. 
      DAPHNE VASQUEZ (lanky, blonde, and blue-eyed) is at the 
      kitchen table reading a textbook, highlighting, totally 
      focused. Music plays and the kettle whistles, but she never 
      looks up. The phone rings; on the ceiling, RED LIGHTS FLASH. 

      Daphne s mother REGINA (a short, olive-skinned brunette) 
      hurries in from the other room. 

                                  REGINA
                    Hello?
                          (she listens)
                    No. No. That s impossible. No. 

      Daphne, sensing something wrong, turns - notices the look on 
      her mother s face. Their eyes meet.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      John, Kristen, and Bay are seated in front of Margaret. 
      Daphne and Regina walk in. The Kennishes stand up.  

                                  MARGARET
                    John and Kristen Kennish. Regina 
                    Vasquez. 

      The parents shake hands awkwardly. 

                                      JOHN/KRISTEN/REGINA
                    Hi./ Hello./ Nice to meet you. 

      Margaret turns to the girls. 

                                  MARGARET 
                    Daphne, this is Bay. Bay, Daphne.

      Daphne and Bay stare at each other. After a long beat, Daphne 
      is the first to speak. She uses both her voice and her hands, 
      signing as she says -

                                  DAPHNE
                    Nice to meet you. 

      That s when we see her HEARING AID, notice the way she s 
      speaking, and both we and the Kennishes realize that Daphne 
      is deaf. 

                                                                        FADE OUT.                                                                                       8.



                                  ACT ONE

      NOTE: Regina both signs and speaks aloud when talking to 
      Daphne. Regina also signs when talking to another hearing 
      person if Daphne is around, so that Daphne can understand 
      without reading lips. When Daphne is talking to another deaf 
      person and neither would speak orally, we will caption.  


      Daphne and Regina follow the Kennishes in.  

                                    KRISTEN 
                    I made chicken enchiladas, I hope 
                    that s okay. 

                                  REGINA
                    Actually neither of us eat chicken.                                                                                    10.



                                    KRISTEN
                    Oh no - you re vegetarian? 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Just chicken. My mom used to date 
                    this guy who worked at a chicken 
                    plant. He told us stories...   

      She signs without translating, but it s very clear; she 
      illustrates chickens being hung upside down, electrocuted, 
      feathers plucked, etc. Everyone watches, mesmerized.

                    If you were there, you d never eat 
                    chicken again either.

                                  BAY
                    I love chicken. Can t get enough.

                                  JOHN
                          (crosses to the phone)
                    No problem. We ll order a pizza. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Please don t, I m not even hungry. 

                                  BAY
                    I want pizza.

                                    KRISTEN
                          (to Daphne)
                    Do you have any allergies? Toby and 
                    Luke get terrible hives when they 
                    eat pineapple, papayas - 

                                  DAPHNE
                    - or kiwi.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Yes! Exactly! 

      Both Kristen and Daphne look excited by this.

                                    KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    Bay eats everything except 
                      anchovies. Won t touch them.

                                  BAY
                          (annoyed)
                    Everyone hates anchovies. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    That s not true! Not your father.                                                                                    11.



                                  BAY
                    You mean her father.

      Everyone gets quiet. 

      Kristen sees Toby off on the couch, texting.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Toby, turn that thing off.  

                                  BAY
                          (mumbles)
                    I have homework.

      Bay disappears into her room and Toby goes back to his phone. 
      Kristen sighs, giving up.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    Can I take a look around?

                                    KRISTEN 
                    Of course! Luke, give your sis-
                          (stops herself)
                    give Daphne a tour.


      John enters. Kristen frantically tries to pick the pieces of 
      chicken out of the enchiladas (an impossible task). 

                                  JOHN
                    Honey, stop, stop.

                                    KRISTEN 
                          (whispers)
                    Our lives have been turned upside 
                    down because some nurse -- 

                                  JOHN
                    I know.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Someone has to pay for this. I want 
                    someone to pay. 

                                  JOHN
                    They will. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    She s a complete stranger to us! 
                    Our own daughter!                                                                                    12.



                                  JOHN 
                    Well we re going to fix that.

                                    KRISTEN 
                    How are we going to fix that? You 
                    think that woman is just going to 
                    hand her over??

                                  JOHN
                    I don t know. 

      The door opens and Regina enters. 

                                  REGINA
                    Can I help?

                                    KRISTEN
                    No, no, everything s done!

      She smiles.


      Daphne walks around the house, taking in the fancy furniture, 
      the expensive art, the pool and tennis court. She looks at 
      Luke and signs  wow!  by making  w s with hands on either 
      side of her face and using her mouth to make the  o  in 
      between. Her face is very animated; it s a fun sign to do. 

                                  LUKE
                          (trying it)
                     Wow .

      Daphne adjusts his fingers. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    These are the  w s. And your mouth 
                    is the  o . 
                          (again,  w s wiggling, 
                            eyes lit up)
                    WOW!

      He does it right this time.  

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Perfect!

                                  LUKE
                    Cool.

      They continue walking around the house.                                                                                     13.



                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Are you going to move in? 

      Daphne realizes he said something but didn t catch it. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Face me so I can see your lips.

                                  LUKE
                    Are you going to move in?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I don t think so. 

      He doesn t say anything.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Do you have trouble understanding 
                    me?

                                  LUKE
                    A little.

                                  DAPHNE
                    You ll get used to it. 

                                  LUKE
                    What s it like to be deaf?

                                  DAPHNE
                    What s it like to be hearing? 

      He looks at her blankly.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Exactly. It s just what you know, 
                    right? Same for me. Talking with my 
                    hands is totally normal.

                                  LUKE
                    But everyone else talks with their 
                    voice.

                                  DAPHNE 
                    Not in my world. If you were in a 
                    room full of deaf people, you d be 
                    the weird one. 

      They have arrived at Bay s room - an artistic mess. Stacks of 
      evocative pen and ink drawings, clothes draped everywhere.

                                  LUKE
                    This would ve been your room.                                                                                    14.



                                  DAPHNE
                    I guess it would ve. 
                          (takes that thought in)
                    Kind of creepy, huh?

      She makes the sign for creepy. He tries it. She beams and 
      signs  perfect! 

                                  LUKE
                    What s  crazy ? 

      It s what you d think (fingers twirling by the head).

                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                    How about  stupid ?

      Again, what d you imagine: she knocks her head and makes a 
      face  what a moron!  He grins.  

                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                     Fart !

      She makes the fart sign - clenched fist gradually letting out 
      air. He howls with laughter.

                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                     Poo !

      Another funny sign - one hand in a fist, the other coming out 
      of the hole, making a plop.  

      Bay exits the bathroom, sees them in her room. Watches, hurt, 
      as Luke bonds with Daphne so easily. 

                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                     Boobs! 

      Daphne draws huge breasts coming out of her chest.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Or, if they re small - 

      She makes teeny tiny breasts. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Or really low -

      She draws boobs that hang to her belly. He giggles.

                                  BAY
                    Ex-cuse me?

      They look up and notice Bay standing in the doorway.                                                                                    15.



                                  DAPHNE
                            (signs/encircling her 
                            heart with her fist)
                    Sorry.

      Luke imitates Daphne, encircling his heart with his fist.

                                  LUKE
                    Sorry.

      They both exit. Bay slams the door.  


      John, Kristen, and Regina sit stiffly. John and Kristen have 
      questions, but aren t sure how to broach them. 

                                  JOHN
                    So was she born...you know...

                                  REGINA
                    You can say  deaf . It s not a bad 
                    word. 
                          (then)
                    No. She got meningitis when she was 
                    three. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Poor thing.

                                  REGINA
                          (shrugs)
                    I felt lucky. One in five kids die 
                    from meningitis. 

                                    KRISTEN 
                    But being so different...everyone 
                      staring...that must ve been so hard 
                    on her.

                                  REGINA
                    We got used to it. She toughened 
                    up. I yelled at a lot of people who 
                    thought gawking at a signing four 
                    year old was okay. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    So the...uh...

      She gestures to her ear. Can t say the word.                                                                                     16.



                                  REGINA
                    Hearing aid? She can hear some 
                    sounds, especially in the high 
                    range. It helps her a bit in 
                      conversation. But she s basically 
                    deaf.

                                  JOHN
                    And she goes to school?

                                  REGINA
                    Of course she goes to school! She s 
                    on the track team, student council, 
                    honor society -

                                  JOHN
                    But how...

                                  REGINA
                    She s deaf, John. Not retarded. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    This is just all really new for us.

                                  REGINA
                    Well it s like every other school, 
                    except there s no marching band. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Bay goes to Buckner Hall. Have you 
                    heard of it? 

                                  JOHN
                    Not that school is really Bay s 
                    thing...

      LOUD ROCK MUSIC pounds from the other side of the house. John 
      and Kristen flinch, but ignore it. 

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    She loves photography, art -  

                                    KRISTEN
                            (pleasantly)
                    - music. 

                                  TOBY (O.S.)
                    BAY! TURN IT DOWN! 

      But instead, the volume goes up. Kristen sighs. 

                                    KRISTEN 
                    Ever since we found out...                                                                                    17.



                                  JOHN
                    It s been hard for her. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    It s been hard on all of us. I keep 
                    going over that day at the hospital 
                    in my head...

      The music is still blasting. Regina stands up.

                                  REGINA 
                    Maybe we should go.

                                  JOHN/KRISTEN
                    No, no! Please. We re going to talk 
                    to her. BAY!

      Daphne and Luke enter. Regina stands up, ready to go.

                                  REGINA
                    Let s just all be in touch. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Actually, Luke and I already talked 
                    about meeting up this weekend. 

      Everyone stares at Luke. John looks delighted. 

                                  JOHN
                    Perfect. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      John, Kristen, Luke, and Daphne walk through the fitness 
      room. Luke and Kristen hold tennis racquets. 

                                    KRISTEN
                          (to John, but speaking 
                            quite deliberately, for 
                            Daphne s sake)
                    So we ll see you in about an hour.

      Luke looks to Daphne, and she signs  an hour  for him. He 
      imitates her; she nods happily. Luke and Kristen head towards 
      the tennis courts, leaving Daphne and John alone. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Thank you so much for lunch.                                                                                    18.



                                  JOHN
                    You don t have to thank me! You re 
                    welcome anytime. In fact, I ll put 
                    you on the account.  

      NOTE: lip reading is very difficult, highly inaccurate, and 
      requires a ton of concentration. Often Daphne isn t sure what 
      is being said but she doesn t like to constantly ask for 
      clarification, especially with people she doesn t know well. 
      She thinks he just offered to put her on the family account 
      but is too nervous to ask. Instead she changes the subject.

                                  DAPHNE
                    I ve actually never played golf. 

                                  JOHN
                    Do you want to try?

      Daphne nods and signs  yes  vigorously.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    But is that safe? I mean, what if a 
                    ball comes flying at you and you 
                    don t hear the warning?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Really, how often does that happen? 

      He acknowledges - not too often. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Honestly, I can do anything you can 
                    do - except maybe sing. 

      Suddenly John becomes aware that everyone has stopped working 
      out and is staring at them. (Perhaps noting her voice, her 
      hearing aid, or just a girl they ve never seen, with John.)

                                  JOHN 
                          (flustered)
                    Maybe we should go find Luke and 
                    Kristen.

                                  DAPHNE 
                            (good-naturedly, loudly)
                    I m deaf, not blind - so I can 
                    actually see people staring.  

      Everyone quickly goes back to their machines. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    So can we? Hit some balls?                                                                                    19.



      John nods, a bit dumbfounded by how she handled that.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    But if I break a nose, you re 
                      explaining it to my mom.
                          (off his look)
                    I m kidding! Man, for an ex-pro-
                    athlete, you re a nervous wreck. 


      Regina folds laundry as her mother ADRIANNA (early 60s, 
      Puerto Rican) sets the table. (Adrianna lives here, too.)

                                  REGINA
                     The poor little deaf girl! How she 
                    must have suffered! What a terrible 
                    childhood she must have had!    

                                  ADRIANNA
                    It s a common reaction, you know 
                    that.  

                                  REGINA
                    I just know they re going to try to 
                    swoop in and impose their ignorant 
                    agenda --

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Reggie,  these people  are her 
                    parents.

                                  REGINA
                    Mom. Don t even start with that.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Well what would you call them?

                                  REGINA
                      Strangers. 

      She carries the laundry basket into Daphne s room. Adrianna 
      takes a beat to digest what her daughter just said. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                          (following her)
                    Am I allowed to ask how you feel 
                    about the fact that you ve spent 15 
                    years revolving your life around a 
                    child who technically, isn t yours?                                                                                    20.



                                  REGINA
                          (turns/firmly)
                    Please stop saying that. 


                                  ADRIANNA
                      Sweetheart, I love her, too. All 
                    I m saying is, they have a right -

                                  REGINA
                          (adamantly)
                    Nothing I ve learned in the past 
                    three weeks changes anything. 
                    Daphne is my daughter, no matter 
                    what the DNA says. And nothing 
                    around here is going to change. 

      She starts putting Daphne s clothes away. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Aren t you forgetting someone?

      Regina stops, looks at her blankly. 

                                  ADRIANNA (CONT'D)
                    Your other daughter?  

      Regina waves off that thought.

                                  REGINA
                    She doesn t need me. Not like 
                    Daphne.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bay enters, walks through the living room, as she has done a 
      thousand times before. But this time, she stops. The mantel 
      is covered with PHOTOS. Ski trips, beach vacations, Christmas 
      portraits. Four tall blondes and one petite brunette. Now the 
      truth is unavoidable: she isn t one of them.  

      Kristen stands in the doorway to her bedroom, sees Bay 
      staring at the pictures.                                                                                      21.



                                    KRISTEN
                    Honey? You want to talk?

                                  BAY
                    I m fine.

      Bay hurries into her room. Kristen sighs, lets her go. 


      John drives Daphne home in his Jaguar. He pulls up in front 
      of her house, taking in the less-than-stellar neighborhood. 

                                  DAPHNE
                            (cheerfully)
                    We know all the cops. 

                                  JOHN
                    Well that s helpful. 

      The front door opens and Regina comes out. Daphne pulls a set 
      of brand new GOLF CLUBS from the backseat to show her.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    Look!

                                  JOHN 
                    She seemed so interested in 
                      learning...

      Now Adrianna emerges from the house.

                                  REGINA 
                    John, this is my mother, Adrianna.

                                  JOHN
                    Wow, you re the spitting image of 
                    Bay. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Really?! I can t wait to meet her. 

                                  JOHN
                    I know Bay would love that.  

                                  REGINA
                    Daphne, come in. It s cold. 

      Adrianna follows her inside, leaving Daphne and John alone. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Thanks again. That was really fun.                                                                                      22.



                                  JOHN
                    Are you kidding? You re a natural!  

      Daphne grins and heads towards her house. John turns back to 
      his car, sees that she forgot her hat on the passenger seat. 

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Daphne! 
                          (she doesn t respond)
                    DAPHNE!

      She still doesn t turn around. And then John remembers - 
      she s deaf. He had actually forgotten for a minute. 

      But instead of getting back into his car, he stands there for 
      a beat, very still, listening to the sounds of the city. The 
      cars, the dogs, the radios, the crickets, the kids playing. 

      And the realization that she can t hear any of it makes him 
      profoundly sad. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kristen sits on the floor, flipping through an OLD PHOTO 
      ALBUM. The first picture is of her nine months pregnant. The 
      next is of her, just minutes after delivery, proudly holding 
      her BABY. The next is of two-year-old Toby meeting his BABY 
      sister for the first time. Kristen holds the photos beside 
      each other, COMPARING the two BABIES. Both are pale, 
      squished, eyes shut, wrapped in the same hospital blanket. 

      She turns to the next page, touches the FIRST LOCK OF HAIR, 
      the FIRST TOOTH, the BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Every photo, every 
      item filled with new meaning now. 

      The door opens. Kristen quickly closes the album. It s John. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Oh hi, I thought you were Bay. Did 
                    you check on her?

                                  JOHN
                    She s sketching, headphones on. 
                    Doesn t want to talk. 

      Kristen nods, he s getting the same response she did. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    You got Daphne home okay?                                                                                    23.



                                  JOHN
                    East Riverside. 

      Kristen winces, reacting to the neighborhood. He sits. 

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    I went online, trying to educate 
                    myself on all this...Apparently 
                    there s some kind of electronic 
                    device that lets deaf people hear. 
                    Have you heard of it?

      Kristen looks at him skeptically.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Sounds a little too good to be 
                    true.

                                  JOHN 
                    It has a microphone and a speech 
                    processor -- it s like a bionic ear 
                    or something. And the best 
                      candidates are kids who were born 
                    normal but went deaf in childhood.

                                    KRISTEN
                    But that s Daphne. 

      He looks at her - exactly. 

                                    KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    Then why on earth doesn t she have 
                    it?

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    24.



                                  ACT TWO


      Regina opens the door. It s John. 

                                  JOHN
                    Hi! So I just found out about this 
                    cochlear implant thing -

                                  REGINA
                          (correcting his 
                            pronunciation)
                      Co-chlear.

      He strides into the living room, excited.  

                                  JOHN
                    I got an appointment with an 
                      audiologist at the Austin Hearing 
                    Center next week. Now I know the 
                    surgery s expensive - 

                                  REGINA
                    About 100 grand, with speech 
                    therapy and follow-up.

                                  JOHN
                    And maybe it wasn t something you 
                    were able to offer Daphne - which I 
                      completely understand - but Kristen 
                    and I are more than happy - 

                                  REGINA 
                    If I had wanted it, I would ve 
                    found a way to get it for her.  

                                  JOHN
                    Wait. Why wouldn t you want it?

                                  REGINA
                    You think she needs to be  fixed,  
                    right? That she can t have a good 
                    life unless she s just like you.

                                  JOHN
                    Like me - or the rest of the 
                    planet. What am I missing? She s 
                    disabled, and technology is 
                    offering her a chance to be normal. 
                    Why wouldn t we give her that?? 

      Regina glares at him at the use of the word  normal.                                                                                     25.



                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    You know what I mean.   

                                  REGINA
                    Daphne s comfortable being deaf. 
                    She likes it.

                                  JOHN
                            (bewildered)
                    Who could like being deaf...?

      GREEN LIGHTS flash with the ringing of the phone. Regina 
      heads to the VIDEOPHONE. A man we will come to know as her 
      best friend PENN appears onscreen and they sign briefly. John 
      watches, amazed, never seen anything like this. 

      Regina finishes and turns back. Tries to explain, calmer now. 

                                  REGINA 
                    The cochlear rewires the brain to 
                    hear electronically. It isn t a 
                    cure.  

                                  JOHN
                    Sounds like a miracle to me.

                                  REGINA
                    No, it s work. It requires months 
                    of therapy after. The way you and I 
                    are talking right now -- we re not 
                    trying, it s not a  skill.  It s 
                    language. Effortless. But even with 
                      a cochlear -- listening, using her 
                    voice, it d always be this --
                          (she furrows her brows, 
                            showing intense focus)
                    Whereas signing is --

      She breathes out, sighs. You see?  

                                  JOHN
                    Ok, so it s work. It s worth it. 
                    The rest of the world can hear. She 
                    can join it.  

                                  REGINA
                    Listen, you just found out you have 
                    this kid and you want her to be 
                    just like you, I get it. But Daphne 
                    will never be like you, even with a 
                    cochlear. And the sooner you accept 
                    that --                                                                                    26.



                                  JOHN
                    I see the way she struggles to 
                    follow the conversation. If she had 
                    that surgery, she wouldn t need to 
                    read lips or rely on you or anyone 
                    else to translate for her. 

                                  REGINA
                      Interpret.

                                  JOHN
                    Or is that it? Keeping her deaf 
                    keeps her dependent on you.

      Regina turns on him, furious. 

                                  REGINA
                    I want what s best for her. She s 
                    my daughter.

                                  JOHN
                    She s my daughter, too. 

      There s a knock at the door. Regina opens it. It s a CLIENT. 
      Regina signs  hello/come in ; the client signs back. (She s 
      deaf.) And suddenly John feels like the outsider here.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    This conversation isn t over. 


      John drives off, talks on the phone to Kristen.  

                                  JOHN
                    - giving me some hogwash about how 
                    being deaf is just as good as being 
                    able to hear. 


      Kristen is grocery shopping at a gourmet deli. 

                                    KRISTEN
                          (checks her phone)
                    That s the school. Bay must ve 
                    ditched again. I gotta go. 
                          (clicks over)
                    Hello?
                          (sighs)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                    KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    No, she doesn t have a bone marrow 
                    biopsy to see if she s compatible 
                    candidate for a transplant. She 
                    should be in bio. 


      Bay sees the principal, her father, and Daphne, obviously on 
      a tour. Bay is dumbfounded. She had no idea about this. 

      The GIRL next to her leans over. 

                                    STUDENT  
                    Who s that girl with your dad?

                                  BAY
                    Just some scholarship kid he s 
                      sponsoring. 

      She returns to her paper, pretending she doesn t care at all.                                                                                     33.




      Daphne wanders through the halls, taking in the trophy 
      display, the academic plaques, the list of colleges where 
      last year s senior class matriculated: a lot of Ivys. 

      An African American sophomore named LIAM walks past her, on 
      his way back to class. He s surprised to see a pretty girl 
      he s never seen before roaming around alone.  

                                  LIAM
                    Do you go here...?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Just taking a tour. Do you like it?

                                  LIAM
                    I ve gone here since kindergarten. 
                    It s pretty much all I know.

                                  DAPHNE
                    I ve gone to my school since 
                      kindergarten, too. 

                                  LIAM 
                    Where?

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s called Carlton? 

                                  LIAM
                    Never heard of it. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s for deaf kids. I m deaf.

                                  LIAM
                    You re what -- ?

      Daphne thinks he s making fun of her, making a deaf joke.                                                                                    34.



                                  DAPHNE
                          (annoyed)
                    Deaf.  

                                  LIAM 
                    Oh. I thought you said you were 
                     death .

      Daphne takes this in. They both start to laugh. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    What would that mean, exactly? 
                    Like,  I m here to come get you? 

                                  LIAM
                    I didn t know! I was scared! 

      He s teasing. And the ice is officially broken. She gestures 
      to his jacket, which says JENSEN S. 

                                  DAPHNE 
                    Awesome mac and cheese. 

                                  LIAM
                    My dad s the head chef there.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Shut up! My mom s going to flip!  

                                  LIAM
                    Ever tried the Dr. Pepper marinated 
                    pork chop?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Only like seven times. 

                                  LIAM 
                    Get this: peanut butter and jelly 
                    bread pudding. New. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Okay -- yum.

                                  LIAM
                    You should come check it out. And 
                    ask for me. I ll make sure you get 
                    some free sides. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    I totally will! What s your name?

                                  LIAM
                    Liam. Wait...                                                                                    35.



      He fingerspells L-I-A-M, a little clumsily.

                                  LIAM (CONT'D)
                    We learned the alphabet in first 
                    grade.

                                  DAPHNE
                    I m Daphne. But my name sign is -

      She makes a  D  by her chest. 

                                  LIAM
                    What s a name sign?

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s a shorthand so you don t have 
                    to fingerspell someone s name each 
                    time you use it. Mine is the sign 
                    for  happy , with a  D.   

                                  LIAM
                    Because you re always happy?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I guess I was when I was four. My 
                    teacher gave it to me. 

                                  LIAM
                    I need a name sign! What s the sign 
                    for  exceedingly handsome ?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (smiles)
                    You can t name yourself. It s like 
                    a rule. A deaf person has to do it.

                                  LIAM
                    A  rule ? Like I d get in trouble?

      She knows he s teasing. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s just kind of bad form.  

      The BELL rings. Doors burst open and KIDS swarm the hallway.  

                                  LIAM
                    Bye -

      He makes the sign for  Daphne.  She smiles. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Bye, Liam.                                                                                     36.




      Kristen heads towards the school. A motorcycle speeds by. She 
      looks twice - realizes that s Daphne on the back.                                                                                     40.




      John is at his desk doing paperwork. Kristen enters.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    Promise not to be mad?

                                  JOHN
                    No.

                                    KRISTEN
                    I just went crazy when I saw her on 
                    that motorcycle...I thought, what 
                    kind of mom lets her 15 year old 
                    daughter get on one of those -

                                  JOHN
                    Kristen. What did you do?

                                    KRISTEN
                    I hired a private investigator.

                                  JOHN
                    You did what?!

                                    KRISTEN
                    Just to see who this woman is. 

                                  JOHN
                    And?

                                    KRISTEN
                    She has two DUIs.


      Regina and Penn enter, find a table. Penn is looking at his 
      iPhone and we see the wallpaper photo is a picture of him 
      with his arm around his partner SAM and their son, Emmett. 

                                  REGINA
                    She was spying on me?

                                  PENN
                    She wants to get to know you. It s 
                    sweet. 

                                  REGINA
                    It s just better to leave well 
                    enough alone.                                                                                     42.



                                  PENN
                    What is that supposed to mean?

                                  REGINA
                    It s too complicated. Nobody wants 
                    two moms! 
                          (then, re: his situation)
                    Yes I know, Emmett has two dads. 
                    Two dads is way easier than two 
                    moms, trust me. 

                                  PENN
                    I know you. You re just scared of 
                    trying to bond with her in case she 
                    doesn t like you. 

                                  REGINA 
                    You should see their house! What 
                    would she want with me?

                                  PENN
                    That s not even funny. 

                                  REGINA
                    I m serious! A hairdresser who 
                    works out of her kitchen who can 
                    barely make rent? I don t think any 
                    teenage girl is going to give up a 
                    tennis court and pool for that.

      She laughs. She s pretending to be joking, but she s not.

                                  PENN
                    Regina. It s not her or Daphne, you 
                    know that, right? You can be a mom 
                    to both of them. 

                                  REGINA
                    And how exactly would that work? 
                    No, no. Better to just leave things 
                    the way they are. No mess. 


      Kristen and John consult with their attorney, JOY BARWICK.

                                  JOY
                    My understanding is the court tends 
                    to give full custody to the parents 
                    who raised the children, with 
                      visitation to the biological 
                    parents.                                                                                     43.



                                    KRISTEN
                    But the DUIs mean she s unfit to 
                    parent. 

                                  JOY BARWICK
                    A case could be made for that. But 
                    is that a road we want to go down 
                    at this point?

                                  JOHN
                    We just need to know how to get 
                    Daphne back without losing Bay.

                                  JOY 
                    The only way to get this settled is 
                    to take it to court. But you know 
                    how these things go: they get 
                    appealed, they go on for years. 
                    With a lot of collateral damage, 
                      especially for the kids. May be 
                    worth it to you, I just want you to 
                    think about it. 


      Regina bursts into the police station, frantic. Her daughter 
      is indeed sitting there calmly waiting for her.

      But it s not Daphne.  

      It s Bay.

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    45.



                                  ACT FOUR


      Bay sits in a folding chair between Regina and Kristen. 

                                  BAY
                    I told you, I thought it was 
                    Simone s car, it looked just like 
                    it. And she was too drunk to drive. 
                    I was doing the responsible thing! 

                                    KRISTEN
                    How is that the responsible thing 
                    when you don t even have a license!

                                  REGINA
                    So whose car were you driving when 
                    you parked in front of my house? 

                                    KRISTEN
                    What are you talking about? 

      Bay shoots Regina a look. 

                                  REGINA
                    Nothing. 

      John exits the cashier area, puts his wallet away. 

                                  JOHN
                      Everything s taken care of. 
                          (to Bay)
                    We re due in court on the 24th. 

                                    KRISTEN
                          (under her breath)
                    That should sound familiar.

                                  REGINA
                    Excuse me?

      John glares at Kristen. But it s too late. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    We know about the DUIs.

                                  REGINA
                    What...? That was 12 years ago... 
                    How did you...                                                                                    46.



                                    KRISTEN
                    Were you drunk when she got sick? 
                    Did you wait too long to take her 
                    to the hospital? Is that why her 
                    fever got so high? Is that why 
                    she s deaf?

                                  REGINA
                    Because being deaf is the worst 
                    possible thing you could imagine 
                    for your daughter, right? You don t 
                    know a thing about her or me.

                                    KRISTEN
                    We know you are not responsible -

                                  REGINA
                    May I remind you that we re in the 
                    police station because of the 
                    daughter that you two raised. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    We intend to get an attorney and 
                    get Daphne back.

      Regina freezes. She waves a finger at them.

                                  REGINA
                    Don t even think about it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Bay...? BAY!

      They all turn. She s gone. 


      Adrianna and Daphne sit on the couch, under blankets, 
      drinking tea. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    What do you think I should do?

                                  ADRIANNA
                    This is your decision. You know 
                    that.

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s a really good school. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    But do you want to go just to make 
                    them happy?

                                  DAPHNE 
                    I don t know. I m so confused. It s 
                    all so confusing. You re not really 
                    my grandmother.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Don t be ridiculous! Of course I 
                    am. I m just also her grandmother. 
                          (realizing)
                    And you have two other grandmothers 
                    that you ve never met.

      Daphne closes her eyes...ugh. This is getting so complicated.  


      John drives, Kristen looks out the window.                                                                                    48.



                                    KRISTEN
                    What if something happens to her?

                                  JOHN
                    Nothing s going to happen to her. 

                                    KRISTEN
                      I should ve made her talk to me. 

      John is silent, also feeling guilty. Kristen s voice breaks.

                                    KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    How could I not have known...?

                                  JOHN 
                    What about me? I hadn t just gone 
                    through 17 hours of labor. I wasn t 
                    doped up on Vikodin. Why wasn t I 
                    more attentive to little details 
                    like which baby they brought back 
                    from the nursery? 

                                    KRISTEN
                    It s different for me. I carried 
                    her. She was part of me. 

                                  JOHN
                    Stop this. Kris, come on. 

                                    KRISTEN 
                    I wasn t there for her growing up. 
                    I ll never be able to make up for 
                    that lost time. 

                                  JOHN
                    Being a mother doesn t end when 
                    they turn 15. We ve got the rest of 
                    our lives with her. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    But Regina got her. Regina got my 
                    baby. It s so unfair.

                                  JOHN
                    And we got Bay. If you had figured 
                    it out at the hospital, we never 
                    would ve gotten Bay.  

      The profoundity of this hits Kristen. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    So are we supposed to feel angry 
                    that it happened? Or grateful?                                                                                    49.




      Regina pulls over beside a WOMAN walking with her YOUNG SON. 

                                  REGINA
                    Excuse me, I m looking for a 15 
                    year old girl, dark hair, dark 
                    eyes. Wearing...what was she 
                    wearing? Oh god, I can t remember. 
                    What is wrong with me? I didn t 
                    notice. 

      She starts to cry. 

                                  WOMAN ON STREET
                    I m sorry, I haven t seen her.

                                  REGINA
                    It s my daughter. She s my 
                    daughter. 


      Regina walks in. She looks weary. 

                                  REGINA
                    They think she s probably at a 
                    friend s house and she ll call when 
                    she s ready. 

      Adrianna signs to Daphne behind Regina s back.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Talk to her.
                          (then, aloud)
                    I m going to bed. 

      She exits. Daphne follows her mom into the kitchen. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    I need to talk to you.

      Regina is surprised at how serious she sounds. Daphne is so 
      impassioned and emotional that she doesn t speak the 
      following; she only signs, and we caption. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    I need you to stop lashing out at 
                    the Kennishes. As uneducated as 
                    they are about deaf culture, they 
                    mean well. 
                          (Regina starts to sign)
                    Let me finish.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    50.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                          (Regina drops her hands)
                    You are my mother, you will always 
                    be my mother. But I need to get to 
                    know them, too. 
                          (deep breath)
                    I took a tour of that hearing 
                    school where Bay goes. They really 
                    want me to go, and I think I m 
                    going to say yes. So I need you to 
                    support my decision. Okay?

      Daphne waits. 

                                  REGINA
                      Absolutely not. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    What?!

                                  REGINA
                    You want to be that weird deaf girl 
                    with the interpreter following her 
                    around all day? You know what 
                    happens to deaf kids at hearing 
                    schools. They re outsiders. They 
                    struggle academically. Daphne, you 
                    can do anything you want with your 
                    life. I ve always told you that. 
                    You re a thousand times smarter 
                    than any of those hearing kids who 
                    used to tease you and make you feel 
                    stupid.

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s not going to be like that! I m 
                    not five years old, I don t need 
                    you to protect me anymore. 

                                  REGINA
                    Yes, you do. Now I have to protect 
                    you from yourself. You know what s 
                    right for you but you are letting 
                    these people pressure you because 
                    you re so desperate for their 
                      acceptance. Well let them love you 
                    for who you are, not who they think 
                    you should be. 
                          (beat)
                    This is your choice. But I think 
                    it s a huge mistake.

      She strides out, leaving Daphne alone and very confused.

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    51.



                                  ACT FIVE


      Bay stands on a deserted corner, trying not to look nervous. 
      An Audi pulls up. Bay opens the door and hurries in.

      Toby drives off. Bay doesn t say anything.

                                  TOBY 
                    You re welcome.  

                                  BAY
                    You should be thanking me, I 
                    probably saved you two grand by 
                    ending your night early. 

                                  TOBY
                    You are such a brat.

                                  BAY
                    Why, because I m not reacting well 
                    to finding out that I m part of 
                    some plot device in a Mark Twain 
                    novel? Excuse me for not handling 
                    this better. 

                                  TOBY
                    You re the one who started this! 
                    You could ve left it alone, but no, 
                    you had to go dragging mom and dad 
                    to that genetic counselor -

                                  BAY 
                    I didn't expect the answer to be 
                    yes! I said I did, but deep down I 
                    was kind of hoping there d be some 
                    other explanation. Toby, every 
                    single thing I took for granted 
                    about myself was just yanked away. 
                    My mom s not my mom. My house isn t 
                    my house. I don t even know what my 
                    name is. I m supposed to be Daphne, 
                    not Bay. I mean Jesus, who the hell 
                    am I?

      Toby is quiet for a beat.

                                  TOBY
                    You re right, this is wacked.                                                                                       52.



                                  BAY
                          (wipes her eyes)
                    Forget it, I know you can t 
                      understand. No one can.

      Beat.

                                  TOBY 
                    Actually, that s not true. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Daphne is in bed, awake. Suddenly she sits straight up. 
      There s something MOVING outside her window. She gasps.

      A FACE appears. It s Bay.

      Daphne hurries to unlock the window. Bay climbs through. 

                                  BAY
                    Hi.

      Daphne switches on the light.

                                  BAY (CONT'D)
                    Don t do that!

                                  DAPHNE
                    I can t read lips in the dark. 
                    Besides, this is my room? 

                                  BAY
                    It s actually my room, technically 
                    speaking.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Very funny. 

      Daphne puts in her hearing aid. The two girls face each other 
      for the first time.  

                                  BAY 
                    This is all pretty weird, huh?

                                  DAPHNE
                    That s the understatement of the 
                    year. 

                                  BAY
                    So what exactly are we to each 
                    other?                                                                                     53.



                                  DAPHNE
                    We have the same parents. Does that 
                    make us sisters? 

      But the word doesn t sit right with either of them.

                                  BAY
                    We re swisters. 

      Daphne laughs. Bay looks around. Sees a shelf of CDs. 

                                  BAY (CONT'D)
                          (nods approvingly)
                    Temper Trap, Broken Bells...
                          (then)
                    Wait. Why do you have music?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I can hear the beat if I turn it 
                    really loud. 

      Bay is surprised by that. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    So did you like, run away tonight?

                                  BAY
                    I don t know. Not really. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Well everyone was pretty 
                      hysterical.

                                  BAY
                    Not like if you d run away. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    You think I like that? Everyone so 
                    concerned about the deaf girl? 

      Bay hadn t thought about it like that.


                                  DAPHNE
                    She s just scared of change. And 
                    she hates to show weakness.

                                  BAY
                    Yeah, I m the same way.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Well, there you go.

      Beat.

                                  BAY 
                    So I came to tell you that if you 
                    want to go to Buckner, it s fine. 
                    I ve gotten suspended so many times 
                    I m sure I won t be there much 
                    longer anyway.   

                                  DAPHNE
                    I don t want to go.

                                  BAY
                    You don t?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Not right now.

      Bay almost looks disappointed.

                                  BAY 
                    So then what s the plan? I mean... 
                    you want to get to know my family. 
                    And I guess I should get to know 
                    yours.

                                  DAPHNE
                    This is like some wonky version of 
                    The Parent Trap.

      They start to laugh. 


      Regina starts to laugh, too. 

                                  DAPHNE (O.S.)
                    Let me go tell my mom that you re 
                    here.

      Regina quickly tiptoes away from the door.                                                                                     55.




      Daphne is over the stove, stir frying noodles and garlic. 
      Regina sets the table, Bay s on the phone.  

                                  BAY
                    Okay, I ll see you in the morning.
                          (she hangs up)
                    They said it was fine if I spent 
                    the night.

                                  REGINA
                    Good. 

      Adrianna walks in.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Nobody invited me to the party. Oh! 

                                  REGINA
                    Mom, this is Bay. Bay, this is -

      Adrianna grabs her, gives her a big hug. Bay chokes up a 
      little. This is the first time anyone has given her that kind 
      of greeting throughout this whole thing. 

                                  REGINA (CONT'D)
                    ...your grandmother.

      Regina and Daphne watch. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    You re gorgeous! You really are the 
                    spitting image of me.

      She grins. Bay wipes her eyes, hoping no one saw. 

                                  BAY
                    I guess I know where I got my dwarf 
                    genes from...

                                  ADRIANNA
                    You re a quarter Puerto Rican, 
                    young lady. 

                                  BAY
                    Then it super sucks that I ve been 
                    taking French for nine years. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    My mom s Spanish is terrible, too.                                                                                     56.



                                  REGINA
                    It is not! 

      She whacks her playfully as she grabs four bowls. 

                                  BAY
                    Regina, can I ask a favor? There s 
                    one thing I ve always wanted to do 
                    but my mom would never let me. 

      Regina looks a bit nervous. 


      Kristen is cleaning up the breakfast dishes. Bay walks in - 
      Kristen gasps. Bay s hair is streaked with blue. 

                                  BAY
                    Regina did it.

                                    KRISTEN
                          (being positive)
                    Ah. Well it s very...

                                  BAY
                      Temporary.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Thank god.

                                  BAY
                    They re outside. 

      Kristen glances out the window. Sees Regina and Daphne 
      waiting in the car. John walks in. 

                                  BAY (CONT'D)
                    She s not going to Buckner. At 
                    least not now. 
                          (beat)
                    But we had another idea.

                                                                            CUT TO:
