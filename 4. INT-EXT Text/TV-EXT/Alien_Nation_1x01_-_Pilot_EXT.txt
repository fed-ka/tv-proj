      on the edge of Slagtown is being used as a refuge by a 
      group of hoboes. A fire is burning in an oil drum, casting 
      flickering shadows across the crumbling walls.

      A hulking MAN enters the frame, lumbering toward the group 
      - and as he gets closer we see that these aren't human 
      hoboes, but NEWCOMERS. Getting loaded on SOUR MILK. The man 
      reacts with disgust and annoyance, veering off toward an 
      inner part of the structure where a smaller fire is 
      burning. He steps over a couple of unconscious Newcomers, 
      seeing

      A HUMAN VAGRANT - AMONG THE SHADOWS

      shifting uncomfortably in some squalor.

                                  THE MAN
                    Lincoln? That you?

      The Vagrant grunts affirmatively. The Man sits nearby.

                                  THE MAN
                    Good t'see a human. Gettin' so y'can't even 
                    find a decent place to crash any more.
                            (pulling out a bottle)
                    Damn, but I hate those slags. Can you 
                    believe they're trying t'give 'em the right 
                    t'vote? Shoot. They don't even get drunk 
                    right. Whoever hearda getting loaded on 
                    sour milk when y'can have some good 
                    squeeze.

      The Vagrant's body SHIVERS, he GROANS. He's suffering.

                                  THE MAN
                    Y'don't sound too good. Y'want a taste?

      He extends the bottle to The Vagrant, who leans forward, 
      bringing his face into the flickering firelight. It's 
      grotesque. Splotched with ugly SORES. There are dark 
      patches of SLIMY STAIN on his clothes. His hand is likewise 
      infected with sores as he grabs the bottle. Takes a greedy 
      slug. Holds it back out to the man                                  THE MAN
                    Uh... why don't y'keep it. ...What happened 
                    t'you, Linc?

      The Vagrant's breathing grows MORE labored. He torches one 
      of the sores, flinches in AGONY. His breathing accelerates.

                                  THE MAN
                    Hey, y'know there's a free clinic over on 
                    third and -

                                    A VOICE
                    Mr. Lincoln... I've been looking for you.

      The man looks up to see a NEWCOMER in a Salvation Army 
      uniform. The Newcomer smiles with benevolent concern.

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    We've been worried about you at the 
                    mission, you missed several meals and -

      The Vagrant stares at the Newcomer, then suddenly BELLOWS 
      with pain. His eyes flash wildly!

                                  THE MAN
                    Linc! What the hell!?

      The Vagrant skitters clumsily away from the Newcomer, 
      shoves The Man aside. ROARS!

      THE NEWCOMERS BY THE FIRE DRUM

      react, startled when they see The Vagrant barreling blindly 
      toward them, HOWLING! He plows violently through them, 
      knocking them aside, overturning the fire drum, rushing 
      headlong against a wall. He rebounds, his hands clutching 
      his head, trying to suppress the searing PAIN within! He 
      runs in aimless agony up a decaying staircase.

                                  THE MAN
                    Linc! Stop! Don't go up there!

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    Mr. Lincoln!

      But The Vagrant rushes higher, bouncing off the old brick 
      walls. The Salvation Army Newcomer is nervously pursuing 
      him up the rickety stairs - finally reaching a high landing       where The Vagrant has sunk to his knees in excruciating 
      torment.

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                    Mr. Lincoln, please - let me -

      He reaches out, but The Vagrant SHOUTS, recoils violently 
      against the rusty handrail - which gives way. He looks 
      down, cries with pain -

      And JUMPS three stories to his DEATH on the rubble below.


      carrying a flowering plant with a ribbon on it, is walking 
      toward a house where a moving van is unloading. A few other 
      PEOPLE stand or pass nearby, their focus also on the house. 
      They seem curious, stand-offish, and not at all pleased.

      The woman reaches the front door just as a NEWCOMER WOMAN, 
      SUSAN, appears, wearing jeans and a faded Dodger 
      sweatshirt. They startle each other.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Oh! Sorry.

                                  SUSAN
                            (smiling)
                    S'okay.
                          (to a mover with box)
                    In the dining room... thanks.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    I'm Diane Mitchell. The blue house over 
                    there.

                                  SUSAN
                    Susan Francisco. Hi.

                                  DIANE
                          (re the plant)
                    A little "welcome to the neighborhood" 
                    gift.

                                  SUSAN
                            (surprised, touched)
                    It's beautiful. And really nice of you. 
                                  (MORE)                                  SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

                                  DIANE
                    Well, I've moved a few times myself. 
                    Sometimes it can be kinda traumatic.

      Susan has been glancing out at the less friendly neighbors.

                                  SUSAN
                    Yeah.

                                  DIANE
                    I was going to bring some of my world - 
                    famous chocolate fudge, ...but I didn't 
                    know if you ate that sort of -

                                  SUSAN
                    I love it. But my hips don't.
                              (mischievously)
                    ...Bring it anyway.

      A frowning nine year old NEWCOMER GIRL appears.

                                  THE GIRL
                    Mom - I don't feel good.

                                  SUSAN
                    Probably just nerves, honey. This is 
                    Emily. ...Ms. Mitchell.

                                  DIANE
                    Diane. Hi, Emily.

                                  EMILY
                    Hi.

                                  DIANE
                    Wow, you sure look like your mom. ...Uh, I 
                    mean, y'know...

      Emily shrugs, shyly. Another mover approaches.

                                  SUSAN A MAN (O.S.)
                    That goes in the kitchen. Sus? Susan? Just 
                    a sec!                                  EMILY
                    Mom, my stomach hurts.

                                  DIANE
                    Look, I know you're busy. My phone number's 
                    on the card there if I can help.

                                  SUSAN
                    That's dangerous, y'know. I just might 
                    call.

                                  DIANE
                    Do.

                                  SUSAN
                          (a smile)
                    Wouldn't want to interrupt you making 
                    fudge, though.


      A ten year old (JILL) and her frowning MOTHER watch as 
      George kisses Susan and Emily goodbye.

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    I can't believe it, after all we paid for 
                    this house and all we've put into it.

                                  JILL
                    What's wrong?

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    Our property's not gonna be worth half of 
                    what we've paid.

                                  JILL
                    Why?

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    Why do you think. ...Damn slags.

      The woman casts a last searing look toward George's house, 
      and walks back inside, muttering an angry profanity. Jill 
      watches her, then looks back at Emily, who meets her eyes.


      marks the final resting place of "Sergeant William Tuggles, 
      LAPD - B:1950 D:l991." A man's hand places a small bunch of 
      flowers on the grave.

                                  THE MAN (O.S.)
                    Can't believe y'been gone a month already, 
                    Tuggs.

      ANGLE ACROSS THE GRAVESTONE TO THE MAN

      This is Detective Lieutenant MATTHEW SIKES. He stares at 
      the grave, speaks quietly...

                                  SIKES
                    ...Really miss ya, man.
                          (a pause)
                    ...Least I nailed the slag who got you, 
                    huh? ...Yeah. Big deal.

      He stares at the grave a moment longer, feeling the       frustration of his loss and inability to have done more. 
      Finally he sighs and turns away.


      Dead. Staring. His face splotched with ugly SORES. Dark 
      patches of SLIMY STAIN are on his clothes.

                                  SIKES
                    Jeeze. Look at those sores. That slime. Bag 
                    him. Bluckh.

      He turns away, nauseous. The group of curious ONLOOKERS, as 
      well as the BILLBOARDS nearby, include a number of Newcomer 
      faces. One billboard shows a smiling human shaking hands 
      with a Newcomer. The Copy reads, "Let's ALL vote! Yes on 
      16." George approaches with the SALVATION ARMY NEWCOMER.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt, this is Philip Adelphia. He said -

                                  SIKES
                    Wait a minute: Phil Adelphia?

                                  MR. ADELPHIA
                    I'm afraid so. But I hear it's the City of 
                    Brotherly Love, so at least that's 
                      something.                                  GEORGE
                    He works at the Mission over on third.

                                  SIKES
                    You know the deceased?

                                  MR. ADELPHIA
                    Peter Lincoln was the name he used, poor 
                    man. He came regularly for his meals. When 
                    he missed two of them, I came looking. He 
                    seemed to be out of his mind from the pain 
                    of those sores. He broke away from me, ran 
                    up those stairs and jumped.

                                  SIKES
                    Okay. Could you just give your statement to 
                    one of those officers. ...And thanks.

                    I woulda jumped, too, if I had all those 
                    zits. Suicide. Let's get a doughnut.

                    him t'wrap fish in his paper - that's all 
                    it's worth.


      on the back of a pickup is shouting through a megaphone.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Yes, I'm a Purist, and I'm proud of its 
                    These damn slags were bred to be slaves - 
                    so let 'em be slaves!

      A MOB of two hundred of MIXED ETHNICITY is gathered outside 
      the school. Many SHOUT agreement. Others, including a few 
      Newcomers, BOO loudly!

                                  THE WOMAN
                    And they breed like rabbits - only four 
                    months instead of nine - pretty soon there 
                    won't be any room left for the rest of use

                    every other Mexican you see is illegal - we 
                    don't need any more damned aliens!

      SHOUTS from BOTH viewpoints, "Damn rights Tell 'em!" - 
      "They're smarter than you are, lady!" etc. Police cars roll 
      in, Sikes & George among them.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    We shouldn't give 'em the right to vote and 
                    we shouldn't let 'em into our schools! This 
                    has always been a good school. We gotta 
                    keep it that way! We don't want her kind 
                    here!

      The woman points toward Emily, being held shelteringly by 
      Susan - and facing a line of parents with their arms 
        interlocked, blocking entrance into the school. A SUPPORT 
      GROUP around Emily REACT ANGRILY against the woman's 
      contingent.

                                    A SUPPORTER
                    She's got a right to go to schools

                                  THE WOMAN
                    They've got schools in Slagtown!

                                    ANOTHER SUPPORTER
                    She doesn't live there anymore.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    Let her move back!

      More VOCALIZATION from the mob. Some for, others against. 
      It's getting ANGRIER. George has found Susan and Emily. 
      Sikes holds back slightly.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    They learn too fast. It's unnatural They're 
                    already taking too many jobs. Our jobs! We 
                    let her in here now, there'll be a hundred

                    Their quarantine wasn't long enough! The 
                    ACLU got 'em released too soon! How do we 
                    know they're really safe!?

      The crowd REACTS LOUDLY both PRO and CON. Jill watches 
      Emily, who's stoic.

                    I say we run 'em back to Slagtown - and we 
                    do it now!

      Both factions of the crowd ROAR! But those on Emily's side 
      are clearly outnumbered. There's about to be a RIOT. 
      Suddenly a GUNSHOT startles everyone! They look toward the 
      man with the smoking gun. It's Sikes. He takes stage, 
      BELLOWING -

      The black man can't sustain the intensity of Sikes glares 
      The man drops his eyes, and his arms. The line is broken.

      George and Susan watch as Sikes walks Emily to the door,

      He gives her another wink. Her eyes hold on his for a beat. 
      She gathers in some of his courage, and goes inside. The 
      Black Teacher puts a welcoming arm around Emily's shoulder.

      Sikes watches her disappear, has a PRIVATE MOMENT of his

      Sikes looks away.

      is on a swing, enjoying herself. She notices a group of 
      kids nearby talking, laughing, and glancing at her. Then 
      one of them, MARK, a boy her age in a WHEELCHAIR, rolls up.

                                  MARK

                    Sure.

      She hops off the swing and moves-toward the group. One of 
      the kids tosses the large rubber ball to Emily who catches 
      it - then reacts. The ball is covered with gooey RUBBER 
      CEMENT. The other kids HOWL with LAUGHTER.

                    town, spongehead.

      He laughs, wheels back toward the laughing kids. Emily 
      stands there awkwardly. Trying to figure out how to get the 
      mess off of her hands.

      A couple of other kids nearby SEEM SYMPATHETIC, but say 
      nothing. Then Emily's neighbor, Jill, passes by, speaking 
      aside:

                                  JILL
                    Just let it dry a little, then rub your 
                    hands together. It'll come right Off.

      Jill keeps walking past, but glances back to see if Emily 
      heard. Emily is about to say thanks, but Jill disappears       among some other kids. Emily is curious about her.

      Sikes doesn't answer. He has bent open a section of chain

      looking gang of six OLDER NEWCOMER YOUTHS, all speaking in

      The gang rolls over him like a tsunami, spinning him into a 
      bunch of trash cans, jumping into his van and driving away 
      shouting catcalls out of the open back door.

                                  FIRST ROWDY
                    Yeah! We got that Ol' slag good!

                                  SECOND ROWDY
                    Didn't we, though! Y'shoulda seen it, man - 
                    Johnny threw a little salt water on this 
                    slag and he started to fizz! Salt water 
                    burns 'em like acid!

                                  FIRST ROWDY
                    He musta run all the way back to Slagtown!

      They hoot and laugh, then one sees something, nudges the 
      others.

      DOWN THE BLOCK - CATHY

      is closing and locking her car door. she turns and sees the 
      rednecks crossing toward her, grinning.

      Cathy tries to move toward her building, but is cut off.

                    That's right. Get t'know ya. ...Real good.

      He starts to maul her - and she brings up her knee hard in 
      his groin - SHOUTING ANGRILY to a passing car -

                                  CATHY
                    Help me!

      The car keeps going, the third man tries to muzzle her - 
      but she sinks her teeth deep into his hand! He YELLS!

                                  SECOND ROWDY
                    You little slag bitch!

      He backhands her, spinning her against the car - but Cathy 
      comes right back and nails him with a powerful roundhouse 
      left. She breaks away, stumbles, scrapes her knee. The 
      first man grabs a handful of her shirt - rips it violently, 
      exposing her back, but she kicks at him, keeps going.

      She runs around a corner and right into - Sikes.

                    lover, Sikes?

      Sikes glares at him.


      is jogging, wearing a lived-in sweat suit. She's been at it 
      a while, and tiring, but determined. Then ahead of her she 
      sees a FEMALE NEWCOMER, walking the same direction. Unusual 
      for this neighborhood. Her clothes are poor, but clean. 
      Susan reaches her just as the female starts up a walk 
      toward a house.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hiya.

                                  THE FEMALE

                    Nice t'see another shiny head. I Didn't 
                    know anybody lived around here but us.

                                  THE FEMALE

                    Three houses up on the right.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    Oh, well, I don't. I just-

                                    ANOTHER WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Miranda?

      They look up to see the fifty-ish HOMEOWNER. Red hair and 
      clothes are trendy but overdone.

                                  TEE HOMEOWNER
                    Get on up here, girl. I suppose you're 
                    going to tell me the bus was late again.

                                  THE FEMALE
                    Yes, maam it-

                                  THE HOMEOWNER
                    Never mind, just get on in here and get to 
                    work. And what'd I tell you about not 
                    bringing your friends along-
                          (to Susan)
                    You get along, missy. You're probably late 
                    for your job, too.

      The homeowner turns abruptly and hustles her Newcomer maid 
      inside. Susan stares after them, amazed, amused, and 
      pissed.


      Sikes and George are moving from their car past other black

      TWO STREET PEOPLE STANDING NEARBY

      Reporter Burns glides into the b.g. quietly with his

                    It did not have six arms!

                                  SECOND STREETPERSON
                    It only had four.

      A pause. Sikes stares at the person. In the b.g., Burns 
      reacts also.

                                  SECOND STREETPERSON
                    And it wasn't all shiny either. Parts of it 
                    seemed sort of bristly-like.

      Sikes stares at this one a moment, then sighs. Speaks 
      loudly:

                                  SIKES

                    more units in here.


      peer from an alley. One is the young tough who had seen 
      Buck and company yesterday. He is pointing out to the other 
      where Buck's gang has taken up residence. The youths look 
      vengeful.

                    Here! Over here!

      Sikes & George and a few others come to her, peer down into 
      some rubble. Burns joins them. Puente is very nervous.

                    What the hell by that?

      Sikes & George move slowly down closer to what appears to 
      be part of a leg - but hollow. George uses a stick to lift 
      aside some trash paper revealing      THE SKIN OF A NEWCOMER

      Dried out, husk-like, as if it has been SHED like a 
      snakeskin. He indicates a MOIST TRAIL that stretches away.

      stoically. Sikes snarls, shoves him down and storms off. 
      Burns is CLICKING OFF some shots of the shed skin.


      Burns hurries across the wet pavement toward a liquor store 
      which also has a display of brand name sour milk in the 
      window. Then he catches sight of a man waving to him from 
      the shadows. He looks a bit healthier than the average 
      street person.

      Make their way down a ragged hillside. The L.A. skyline can 
      be seen in the b.g., but the f.g. is very unsettling: a 
      dump with abandoned cars, ratty furniture, and a large 
      concrete tunnel, spattered with graffiti, which disappears 
      into the ominous darkness of the hillside. The Informant 
      points.

                                  BURNS
                    What?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    I dunno. Mighta been a body.

                                  BURNS
                    How long ago?

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    Just before I -

      With a FEARSOME SHRIEK - THE CREATURE is upon them!      The action and cutting are frenetic Giving only 
        IMPRESSIONISTIC GLIMPSES as Burns and The Informant try to 
      fend off the beast! It is definitely INSECT-LIKE and taller 
      that they are! It slashes at them with frightening, 
        pincher-like claws on the ends of two long, and two shorter 
      arms!

      What we glimpse of the body is black, part husk-like, part 
      bristling, and shiny with slime!

      Burns tries to bring his camera up, but it is knocked away. 
      The Creature's horrific face rears up in the shadows over 
      Burns. Before he can get a good look, a spray of liquid 
      causes his clothes to smoke and smolder. It's acid!

      He yelps and scrambles to one side, clutching his hand and 
      leg which have also been ravaged by the acid. He hears 
      SCREAMS:

                                  THE INFORMANT
                    No! Help me! For God's Sakes

      Burns looks back, dazed, and sees The Informant being 
      dragged off quickly toward the tunnel by the thick-legged 
      beast.

                                  BURNS
                    Help! Somebody! HELP!

      Burns struggles against his pain, grabs his camera, and 
      fires off a few flash photos just before The Creature 
      disappears into the darkness and The Informant's cries are 
      drowned in a hideous gurgle!

      Burns lies on the filthy ground, breathing hard, panicked.


      leads George among wrecked autos. Notices George BLINKING.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Right down this way. Gettin' a cold, huh?                                  GEORGE
                            (rubbing his eyes)
                    Yeah.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Just got over one. Ain't one thing it's 
                    another. See that bug story they're layin' 
                    on us now? What a loada crap. There it is.

      He points toward a dark station wagon. There are a series 
      of two-inch holes blown out down the side of it.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Poor guy... what was his name?

                                  GEORGE
                    Tuggs.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Yeah. Never had a chance. Lookit them 
                    holes.

      George walks slowly along beside the car. Touching the 
      holes. There is dried blood around the last one.

                                  THE MANAGER
                    That's where he bought it. You're lucky 
                    it's still here. Order came down to scrap 
                    it a week ago. I just been too busy.

                                  GEORGE
                    ...Who signed the order?

                                  THE MANAGER
                    Have t'check.

                                  GEORGE
                    Would you?

      The man nods and walks away. George looks more closely at 
      the last hole - then notices a much smaller hole nearby it. 
      He inspects it carefully - reacting to something unusual.


      in his wheelchair, and two other boys are Suppressing 
      giggles as they approach Emily who is eating by herself and 
      reading. Just as they get up to her, one of the boys whips       out a can of BUG SPRAY and sends a cloud of it at Emily.

                                  MARK
                    Oh no! RAID'S HERE!

      The other boys shout out in mock terror, "Raid! Oh Not 
      Argghh! etc." grab at their throats and fall "dead" across 
      the table.

      Emily closes her book. Gets up almost regally, and leaves 
      them convulsed with LAUGHTER behind her. Jill is coming 
      toward her with a tray full of lunch.

                                  JILL
                    Hey, Em, I was just -

                                  EMILY
                    Why don't you go play with your friends.

                                  JILL
                    Hey, c'mon, I -

      But Emily's gone. Jill stares after her. Turns gruffly.

                                  JILL
                    Fine. Forget it.


      Buck and his gang are bringing in more stolen furniture.                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah, this's great man! Just like home!}

                                  BLENTU
                    {Better'n home.}

                                  BUCK
                    {Damn straight.}

      Suddenly part of a wall crashes down, revealing EIGHT BLACK 
      YOUTHS. Tough-looking and dangerous.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    You picked the wrong place to hunker, 
                    slags!

      And they erupt at Buck's gang, one has a C02 extinguisher! 
      It's spray incapacitates one of the Newcomers.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    How 'bout a little salt water, dude!?

      He squirts it right in Svabo's face! Svabo yelps as the 
      water burns and smokes on his skin like acid!

      Buck dives onto the black leader. The fighting is furious - 
      hand to hand - and the blacks quickly realize they may have 
      underestimated the Newcomers' prodigious strength.

      Svabo throws one through a window.

      Blentu fights his way through the C02, grabs his opponent 
      throat. Slugs him mercilessly.

      Another black kid dives on Buck, knocking him down into the 
      area where The Vagrant had been in scene one. Buck gets 
      some of the SLIME on his jacket.

      The blacks pound him, but Buck's fury is no match for them. 
      He hurls the one away, bouncing him off a wall. During the 
      struggle, a real PISTOL falls from one kid's pocket. Buck 
      looks up to see the leader pull out a pistol of his own - 
      and FIRE a SHOT at Buck.

      Buck scrambles across the floor, scoops up the fallen 
      pistol as another BULLET RICOCHETS near him. He rolls over 
      and FIRES - hitting the leader in the stomachs The youth 
      drops, gasping.      Buck stares - amazed and frightened. The others have 
      reacted to the shot - startled! The blacks break off the 
      fight, panicky, two rush to their leader, SHOUTING EPITHETS 
      at the Newcomers. There are distant SIRENS approaching.

                                  SVABO
                    Out! Get him out or we'll kill you all!

      The blacks retreat, carrying their badly wounded comrade. 
      The Newcomer gang is jubilant around Buck.

                                  BLENTU
                    (Great shot, Finiksa!}

                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah! You see that sucker fold up! Boom?!}

                                  BLENTU
                    {I think you killed him, man! That'll teach 
                    'em!}

      The SIRENS are closer.

                                  SVABO
                    {C'mon, let's dust it.}

      They start to run off, look back at Buck who's frozen in 
      place, pulse racing, breathing hard, staring.

                                  BLENTU
                    {Finiksa! C'mon, man!}

      Buck comes into the moment. Pockets the gun. Runs with 
      them.


      says, "Vote YES on 16" - but has a big "NO" sprayed on it. 
      Sikes & George, DRESSED AS VAGRANTS, shuffle around a 
      corner. George is blinking less, but he and Sikes are still 
      restrained.

                                  SIKES
                    Who?

                                  GEORGE
                    The guy Tuggs pulled out of the car just 
                    before he got killed.

                                  SIKES
                    You talked to him?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. Said he couldn't swear to it, but he 
                    thought he did hear a gunshot come from in 
                    front of Tuggs.

      Sikes looks at him. George keeps looking forward, checking 
      out the streets and alleys, while Sikes reviews...                                  SIKES
                    Alright. So Tuggs is doing this research on 
                    why you all were such submissive slaves, 
                    hears about these Overseers who may have 
                    been in charge of you, gets the address of 
                    a plant owned by a underworld type-

                                  GEORGE
                    Which smelled like the inside of our 
                      spacecraft...

                                  SIKES
                    Right. And somebody kills him - but makes 
                    it look like he died in action.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe. Did they exhume his body?

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah. Autopsy's tonight. Let's check down 
                    this alley.

                                  GEORGE
                    There's nothing down there.

                                  SIKES
                    It's pitch black, how - You see as well as 
                    you smell, huh?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. How 'bout over there?

      Sikes nods. They cross toward another dark street.


                                  SIKES
                    Your not blinking so much. Your cold's 
                    better, huh?                                  GEORGE
                    Yes, thank you.

                                  SIKES
                    Good. So who sent down the order to have 
                    the car scrapped? "Captain" Grazer?

                                  GEORGE
                    No. A man named Donald Wilks.
                            (off Sikes' reaction)
                    I take it you know him.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah. ...He's the assistant D.A.

      For the first time tonight they really LOOK at each other. 
      Then George looks off sharply, SNIFFING the air.

                                  SIKES
                    What?

                                  GEORGE
                    Formic acid.

      They both react. George indicates a direction.

      A NEARBY FACTORY AREA - GEORGE & SIKES

      peer warily through industrial equipment. Their eyes widen.

      THEIR POV - INTERCUT

      glimpsed through the shadows is The Creature! Sikes 
      whispers:

                                  SIKES
                    Holy...! Look at that thing!

                                  GEORGE
                            (into a two-way)
                    This is 13, we've got a target in the 
                    factory yard, 1200 Alameda. Request Air 
                    Ten.

                                  SIKES
                    C'mon - we're gonna lose it.                                  GEORGE
                    ...Like hell.

      George takes the lead, skirting in the shadows.

      They catch another glimpse of The Creature, moving through 
      a broken door into the factory.

      They edge warily along the side. Find a panel in the metal 
      wall which is bent out. Without looking back, George slides 
      through and inside.

      THE FACTORY

      which is damp, dark. Rusting heavy-duty chains and pulleys 
      hang from the darkness above. George moves carefully. Sikes 
      close behind, gun drawn, tense. They whisper...

                                  GEORGE
                    Where'd it go?

                                  SIKES
                    Beats the hell outta me.

      From outside comes the sound of an approaching helicopter - 
      and suddenly it's white-hot ARC LIGHT knifes in through the 
      overhead windows, cutting sharp streaks through the gloom - 
      and revealing the silhouette of The Creature - on a large 
      generator right behind and above them! It reacts! Sikes 
      spins!

                                  SIKES
                    There!!

      He squeezes off three SHOTS as The Creature SHRIEKS and 
      lands on top of him - simultaneously knocking George into a 
      shallow concrete pit.

      The helicopter roars outside. The blazing, moving streaks 
      from its arc light provide bizarre illumination against the 
      stark blackness as Sikes struggles in the grasp of the 
      beast's four arms!

      George is scrambling to get out of the pit!

      Sikes sees an ugly sphincter in The Creature's neck 
      articulate and he can guess what's coming - he shoves his 
      arm in front of it, just as the acid spews out - deflecting       it from his face, but getting it on his hand! He shouts 
      with pain! Fights harder, digging his hand into The 
      Creature's bristling back!

      George gets up to the edge of the pit, tries to get a clear 
      shot - but is fearful of hitting Sikes. Finally he aims 
      lower and FIRES two shots, hitting The Creature in the leg!

      It SCREECHES and drops Sikes - skitters clumsily into the 
      darkness. George rushes to him.

                                  GEORGE
                    Acid?!

                                  SIKES
                    On my left hand! Ahhg!

      George whips out a plastic bag of white powder and pours it 
      over Sikes wounded hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    Alkali, it'll cut the acid and - What?

      He sees that Sikes is looking at something clutched in his 
      good right hand. Sikes is amazed...

                                  SIKES
                    ...Son of a bitch.

                                  GEORGE
                    Is that a piece of it?!

      Sikes leaps to his feet, furiously running after The 
      Creature.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt? Matt!?

                                  SIKES
                            (bellowing)
                    - It's Velcro!

                                  GEORGE
                    - What!?

      THE CREATURE

      is scrambling through the darkness. Sikes leaps on it's       back!

                                  SIKES
                    You son of a bitch!

      He digs his hands into The Creature's bristling back and 
      RIPS it apart - revealing the back of the MAN inside!

      George rushes to help, and together they strong-arm the 
      "Creature" to the floor, pulling the heavy costume back 
      revealing the huge brute within - who still struggles - 
      until George presses his gun against the brute's neck.

                                  GEORGE
                    Stop fighting or die.

      Potent words. Resistance ceases. Sikes pulls harder on the 
      costume, revealing ANOTHER MAN, very small and thin, inside 
      the costume in front of the brute - providing the second 
      pair of arms.

      Sikes & George share a glance of amazement - then hear:

                                    A MAN'S VOICE
                            (urgent whisper)
                    Bernie? Bernie? You here?

                                  SIKES
                            (prods the brute)
                    Answer him. Call him, dammit.

                                  THE BRUTE
                    Over here!

      Two men move forward through the shadows.

                                  THE MAN'S VOICE
                    What the hell happened? Are you-

                                  GEORGE
                    Hands on your heads. You're under arrest.

      They start to run. George FIRES in the air.

                                  GEORGE
                    DID you hear me?!

      The men stop. Comply.                                  GEORGE
                    Walk this way.

      They come slowly into the light. One of them is The 
      Informant whom Burns thought had been killed. The other 
      is... The Purist Leader. Sikes & George glance at each 
      other. Sikes blows out an incredulous PUFF, and George goes 
      back to work...

                                  GEORGE
                    You have the right to remain silent...


      are playing happily together. We watch their enjoyment.

                                  JILL'S MOTHER (O.S.)
                    I can't believe it. I'm really embarrassed.

      REVERSE - A CAR

      containing Jill's Mother - and the Purist Woman who was 
      inciting the crowd at Emily's school.                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                    I'll put a stop to it right now.

      She starts to open the car door, but the Woman restrains 
      her.

                                  THE WOMAN
                    No, no, no... let them play.

                                  JILL'S MOTHER
                            (confused)
                    What?

                                  THE WOMAN
                    This little friendship is something we can 
                      definitely use to our advantage.

      Jill's Mother looks at the woman curiously. The woman keeps 
      focused on the two little girls, and smiles enigmatically.
