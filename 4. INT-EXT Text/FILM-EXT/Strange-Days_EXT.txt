TRAIN YARD - NIGHT
A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
track at night.
The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.
IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
pointlessly to her chest.
She is swearing and crying,
runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
face.
Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
sexiness.
Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
of curly red hair.
She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
life has just begun to harden her features.
She looks
lost and without hope, in fear of her life.
Her breath
comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.
She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
behind her frequently.
A police helicopter is circling.
Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
the cars.
She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
as the beam passes over.
Looking under the cars she sees
an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.
It moves on.
She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
the patrol car.
She reaches a chain-link fence.
Crying,
she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
dress.
Another patrol car passes two blocks away.
She
crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
sight.
CUT TO:
ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT
Iris sprints down an alley between buildings.
Rats
scatter into the shadows ahead of her.
She doesn't seem
to notice.
All she cares about are the police lights, and
the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.
She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
lit street beyond.
There are people here: downtown low-
life street people.
A half-block away is a brightly lit
sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.
She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
glance at her.
LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
and boots of winter.
SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
behind her.
IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
They look intense.
Revved up.
They are BURDEN SPREG, a
massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
ferret.
ENGELMAN
She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
the book.
We can pick her up later.
SPREG
No.
Now.
IRIS knows the cops are behind her.
She is terrified to
turn.
Finally she can't stand it any more.
She breaks
into a run.
The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring
after her.
Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
runner.
The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
her and the cops jump out.
Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-
tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose
groceries go flying.
CUT TO:
LENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
IT'S 4 AM.
Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
into the center court of his ratty building.
The pool
furniture is in the pool.
Gang graffiti marks the walls.
Bars on all the windows.
One of the doors looks like
somebody opened it with an ax.
The pool lights give the
place an eerie, dead glow.
Can out slick Lenny really
live in this dump?
Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we
hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the
F.G.
BEEP.
And...
IRIS (V.O.)
Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be
there, you got to help me, come on,
pick up, pick up...
Through the window we see Lenny fishing in his pocket for
his keys.
CUT TO:
ALL NIGHT GAS STATION - NIGHT
Iris at a pay phone in the cold of an all-night gas
station.
IRIS
... you got to be there for me...
COME ON!
Shit, I'll call later.
CUT TO:
ALL NIGHT GAS STATION - NIGHT
Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung
up.
She looks desolate, without hope.
CUT TO:
PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE
A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached
Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and
a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
She tries the door of the car: locked.
She looks toward
the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny.
Better not.
She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a
note on the label: "HELP ME.
IRIS." She drops the tape
through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces
off the seat, onto the floor.
She looks through the windshield, totally distraught,
trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the
reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.
She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out.
And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground,
crying, afraid to move.
CUT TO:
CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Lenny and Iris come out the front door.
IRIS
It's a bad situation... if they get
me I know they're going to -- OH
SHIT!
She bridles like a startled horse.
Lenny looks at what
she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.
Must be
the cops.
He turns back...
She's gone.
What the hell?
He looks back at the red light... and edges around the
corner to see what the cops are up to...
It's not a cop car.
It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on
the hook.
Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a
biker only meaner.
LENNY
Hang on, that's my car--
TOW DRIVER
Not anymore.
Belongs to the bank.
LENNY
Hey wait a second...
Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift,
and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm.
The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in
Lenny's face.
LENNY
Oh, yeah, that's the answer!
Two
million years of human evolution and
that's the best idea you can come up
with?
(driver continues
with the hoist)
Okay.
Look, whattya get to repo a
car?
Two hundred?
Two fifty?
I'll
pay you three fifty, right now.
All
you gotta do is drop it off the hook
and say you came by, your mark
wasn't here.
Simple.
Make a few
bucks.
Do a good deed.
Huh?
DRIVER
You got the cash on you?
LENNY
I was going to write you a check, if
that's--
The guy is getting into his truck.
LENNY
Okay, okay, I totally respect that
call.
I would want cash.
They'll
take my check inside... I can see
you're pressed for time, just give
me two minutes... here keep my watch
for collateral.
He hands the guy his watch.
LENNY
It's a Rolex.
Be right back.
Two
minutes.
Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns
just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.
Lenny runs
after his car, yelling, watching it recede.
LENNY
Son of a bitch!
Lenny walks back to the bar.
He sets his Haliburton up on
the truck of a car and pops it open.
He takes out a tiny
digital cellular phone and dials a number.
While it's
ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of
the briefcase and slips it on.
CUT TO:
CORAL LOUNGE - NIGHT
A black limo pulls into the lot.
It is a Continental
armored stretch, downsized from today's standards.
The
door opens and Mace gets out.
She is compactly built,
dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket,
heavy rubber-soled shoes.
She glances around as she heads
for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping
gaze of a security professional.
CUT TO:
ST. JAMES CLUB - NIGHT
Mace's limo wheels up to the hotel on the strip.
A soberly-dressed Japanese executive is waiting next to
the doorman.
INSIDE the car, Mace spots him and scowls.
MACE
Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.
Lenny opening the door before the car stops.
LENNY
What's his name?
MACE
Fumitsu.
LENNY
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
Leonard Nero, Security Express.
Lornette Mason here is just
completing our routine driver
evaluation.
We do it to make sure
that out VIP clients, such as
yourself, are always treated as
honored guests.
I just need to ride
up front and take some notes, if you
don't mind.
Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for
him.
Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front
passenger door.
MACE
Um, excuse me.
(can't stand to say
it)
Sir.
Excuse me.
Mr. Nero.
She walks calmly to him.
MACE
(hissing through her
teeth)
What the fuck are you doing?
LENNY
(winning smile,
innocent)
Coming with you.
MACE
You will not live to see the
morning.
CUT TO:
HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT
As the limo stops at an elegant home in this top-bucks,
old-line residential area.
There is a loud party in
progress, with a couple of hundred guests spread through
the house and backyard.
Mace scowls deeply as Lenny gets
out of the car and starts into the party with Mr. Fumitsu.
They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old
friends.
CUT TO:
HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT
Mace, having a cigarette with other security drivers,
watches Lenny through the tall windows of the old Spanish
house.
She sees him working the room, rubbing up against
the money, networking.
No dialogue.
A pantomime of Lenny
working his prime turf.
She stares at him for a while,
then looks at her watch.
Sighs.
CUT TO:
HANCOCK PARK HOUSE/GARDEN - NIGHT
... as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's
path, a top cop named PALMER STRICKLAND.
STRICKLAND
Nero.
LENNY
(uh-oh)
Strickland.
STRICKLAND
Commissioner Strickland.
LENNY
Sure.
Whatever.
See, since you
shitcanned my career, I don't even
have to call you sir.
One of life's
small pleasures.
STRICKLAND
Aren't you peddling your wares a
little far from your usual gutter?
LENNY
I was invited here by a close
friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right
over there.
Lenny waves.
Fumitsu waves back from across the room.
STRICKLAND
I don't like disappointments, Nero.
And do you know what disappoints me
very much?
LENNY
Your sex life?
STRICKLAND
Your existence.
CUT TO:
HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT
Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular.
MACE
Now listen to me... you have to get
to bed young man.
I mean it.
No
watching "Tales from the Crypt".
I
don't care what Cecile says.
I'll
see you in the morning, baby.
Night, night.
As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to
see...
Lenny flying over a hedge.
He lands on the sidewalk, then
scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES
loom toward him.
He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
dignity (but quickly) toward the car.
MACE
Are we having a bad night?
LENNY
(glancing back)
Let's talk in the car.
CUT TO:
MACE'S LIMO - NIGHT
As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
trodes to his head.
Mace glances at him in disgust.
He
hits his playback button.
Lenny's POV as he talks to Faith.
Back when things were
good.
He's wiring her.
They are playful, like a couple
of kids.
FAITH
I feel like you're turning me into a
VCR.
LENNY
I just want to see what we're like
together through your eyes.
He turns OFF the record button.
STATIC.
Then TAPE
RESTARTS.
We see the two of them standing together,
reflected in a mirror.
We are Faith now.
FAITH
I don't feel anything.
Is it on?
LENNY
Forget it's there.
FAITH
Make me forget it, baby.
He turns her to him.
They begin to make love.
Faith's
face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy
passion.
A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.
Lenny opens his eyes to see...
Mace's glowing countenance.
She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head
and tossed them out the window.
Now she's yanking him out
of the car by his lapels.
LENNY
Hey, careful on the jacket.
This is
Armani.
(he looks at her)
You angry?
MACE
I've had enough of this shit.
(getting back into
the car)
You're on foot, Lenny.
LENNY
In LA?
Are you crazy?
Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters
himself on the hood.
Mace pretends she doesn't see him.
LENNY
(as they drive along)
Can I come in please?
I'm having a
hard time hearing the stereo.
Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of
the car.
Now she starts to move forward...
LENNY
I need my case.
It's still in the
back.
MACE
Get it.
He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
door.
Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting
out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.
LENNY
Listen, can we talk a little bit
here, like two rational adults?
Mace hits a button on the dash.
The privacy divider rises
suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.
LENNY
That would be no.
MACE
I've had it.
No more wirehead shit
in my car.
You understand?
You
want to poach your lobes, do it
somewhere else.
LENNY
Okay, you got my attention, but this
is cutting off the circulation to my
head, here.
D'you mind?
She lowers the divider, releasing him.
Lenny straightens
his jacket and tie.
Runs a hand through his greasy hair.
LENNY
I thought we were friends.
MACE
No, see a friend is more than one
person constantly doing favors for
another.
You just suck people along
with your schemes and your scams and
your slick act.
Well I'm out.
I
got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
husband someplace who doesn't send
me a dime of support... I'm just
trying to hold on here.
LENNY
So am I.
Just trying to get by.
MACE
No, you're just trying to get off.
LENNY
Macey... I've never seen you like
this.
MACE
Lenny, you're turning into some
kinda squid-head low-life.
You're
always broke, you just go from one
score to the next.
And you're
getting strung out... you don't even
see it.
Getting high on your own
supply like some crack dealer.
LENNY
I know you wouldn't be saying all
this if you didn't care about me.
Thanks, Mace.
Really.
MACE
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
LENNY
You still like me, don't you?
We're
still buddies?
She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.
MACE
(a tiny smile)
Yeah.
I don't see a way out of it.
LENNY
Macey, I know you're tired, but can
you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
It's on your way.
MACE
Jesus, Lenny.
LENNY
Begging?
Groveling?
Any pathetic
behavior at all?
Will that help?
Faith's there tonight, and I've got
to talk to her.
MACE
Sure, Lenny.
(she puts the car in
gear)
The only thing worse than a junkie
is someone in love.
CUT TO:
RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT
As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens
the door.
LENNY
Come on, let me buy you a drink.
Let's drink and make up.
(Mace shakes her
head)
Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
That means you can watch me suffer.
I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
much better.
Total and thorough
payback, whatdya say?
Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman.
CUT TO:
RETINAL FETISH
Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside.
A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.
Lenny brushes
off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the
entering crowd.
CUT TO:
ALLEY/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT
Beemer shoves Lenny into the alley and shuts the door
behind him.
LENNY
I recognize you.
You're Wade
Beemer.
Running back for the Rams,
am I right?
Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses.
BEEMER
Yeah, that's right.
LENNY
I saw you play, man.
You were good.
Like a fucking freight train I
remember saying.
So what happened,
injuries or what?
BEEMER
Bullshit politics.
LENNY
It's always politics.
Like this
thing we're in here, he's paying you
to tune me up, right?
But I could
pay you more not to.
See what I
mean?
I could write you a check
right now--
BEEMER
Come on, let's go, I got to get
back.
LENNY
(pulling money out
of his pocket)
Okay cash!
Logical.
Here's
everything I have on me, what do you
say?
How about a Rolex?
BEEMER
(barely a glance at
it)
I already got a real one.
Come on,
it won't be too bad.
It's not
personal.
LENNY
(taking off the
Armani carefully)
Just not the eyes.
Beemer swings.
CUT TO:
PARKING LOT/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT
As Lenny approaches the car, moving painfully, dabbing at
a bloody nose.
Mace looks at him pityingly.
LENNY
They oughta get some lights back
there.
A person could get killed
slipping on those stairs.
Let's go.
CUT TO: an eerie NIGHT VISION SHOT of Mace and Lenny
getting into the limo.
Then we see: Spreg and Engelman,
the two street Hun cops.
Watching.
CUT TO:
PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT
Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls
into the lot and slides up to Max's car.
Max is sitting
in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings
from a take-out carton.
He looks up as Lenny and Mace get
out of the limo.
Sees their expressions.
MAX
Ohhhh shit.
TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,
has his head propped in his hands.
His eyes are
distant... replaying.
Still shocked to his soul.
Mace
paces nearby.
Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes
on, playing back the tape.
His face is transformed into
an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.
With
shaky hands he stops the deck.
Opens his eyes.
Long beat.
He glances down at the dim-
sum carton in his hands.
MAX
Well... I've lost my appetite.
(lofts it into a
nearby dumpster)
For about a year.
He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace.
MACE
No way.
Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket
and takes an eye-watering pull.
Offers it to Lenny, who
follows suit.
MAX
You alright?
Y'okay?
LENNY
Yeah.
No, not really.
MAX
Let's work it.
LENNY
Not now... I don't want to think
about it--
MAX
Come on, Lenny.
You used to be good
at this stuff.
Play it down.
What's the perp doing?
LENNY
He stalks her.
He rapes her.
Then
he does her...
MAX
And he records it.
Thrill kill.
Wants to see it again.
And again.
LENNY
He records himself raping and
killing her--
MAX
But at the same time he's sending
the signal to her--
LENNY
So she feels... what he feels...
while he's in her.
The thrill while
he's killing her... is sent to her,
heightening her fear... which in
turn heightens the turn on for him.
(turns to him)
I've seen a lot, Max.
MAX
So've I.
Too much.
LENNY
But this is a bad one.
MAX
Top ten.
LENNY
He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction... killer and
victim merging... orgasm and agony
merging.
And he records it all.
MACE
And gives it to you.
LENNY
Wants to share.
MAX
That's right.
He wants to share.
Needs an audience.
This is one sick
puppy.
LENNY
Why me?
Mace is hugging herself.
Edgy and tense.
MACE
Cause you're the man, right?
The
Magic Man.
If it's got something to
do with the wire, sooner or later it
washes up on your beach.
LENNY
I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never.
Everybody knows that.
MAX
He's skull-fucking you, bud.
Trying
to get a reaction.
Maybe pushing
you to do something.
MACE
Maybe he just figures Lenny will
appreciate what he's created.
It's
the dark end of the street, Lenny.
How do you like it now?
LENNY
Jesus, Mace.
Back off.
MACE
This guy is someone you know, one of
your squid-head contacts.
MAX
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
MACE
Take the tape to the cops.
LENNY
Uh unh.
No way!
They'd crucify me.
MACE
So some psycho wire-freak gets to
keep running around--
MAX
Naw, he's right.
They'll figure
Lenny's the perp, or go through his
client list, ruin his life... such
as it is.
Look, I'll call the guys
in Homicide... tell them she was a
friend of mine and they'll keep me
in the loop.
Get me the forensics
and all that.
(he opens his car
door)
Get some sleep.
I'll call you when
I get something.
(he starts his car)
And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
were you.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo.
Mace is
disassembling the Beretta without looking at it.
She
chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go.
Lenny
brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage.
He
is high from winning the fight.
LENNY
Is this great fabric or what?
MACE
You ever wonder why you get beat up
a lot?
LENNY
Never really thought about it.
CUT TO:
MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY
Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco
house in Inglewood.
It's dawn.
A neighbor is walking the
dog.
Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of
toys left scattered in the front yard.
Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and
eating a bowl of cereal.
Behind him, on the couch, is
Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.
Zander frowns at
her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.
ZANDER
Where were you Mom?
Did you meet a
guy?
MACE
Just Lenny.
ZANDER
Right.
That explains it.
MACE
Are you going to make me beg?
Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around
her.
Big hug.
MACE
(looking at weird
stuff in cereal)
What is that?
ZANDER
Cheerios and wieners.
I made it
myself.
It's good.
MACE
Well give me some then... I'm
starving.
CUT TO:
A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY
Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church
where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One.
The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further
off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control
cops.
MAX
Not a whole hell of a lot.
They've
just been saying words over Jeriko.
Tensions running pretty high down
here.
I'm telling you.
WHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes
out of the church with Faith next to him.
Corto, Vita,
Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around
them as the press bears down, shouting out questions.
Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after
her.
The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the
car as it pulls away.
CUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.
LENNY (V.O.)
Faith OK?
MAX
Yeah.
She's leaving with Tran so I
got to boogie.
Real quick... Iris
checked into the Sheraton last night
under a false name.
Paid cash.
LENNY
Looks like she was holding out.
MAX
Yup.
Hey, so I heard you dropped in
on Tran last night.
Another slick
Lenny move.
LENNY (V.O.)
He's in this somehow... I don't know
how.
Just stay close to Faith.
MAX
I'm on her, amigo.
No worries.
Gotta jam.
CUT TO:
MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY
Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
day of this millennium.
There are cops in body armor and
helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
Helicopters orbit endlessly.
And a National Guard tank
rumbles down the street.
State of siege.
The car radio
is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
Millennium LA party.
POOR MAN
... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
the century.
Ten square blocks of
madness, with live music, fireworks
and the actual rich and famous of LA
hobnobbing with us peons.
Also
yours truly the Poor Man will be
there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
T-shirts by the truckload--
Lenny is keyed up and tense.
He keeps looking out the
back window.
MACE
Will you relax.
There's nobody back
there.
LENNY
Mace, the guy had a knife.
To my
throat.
In my living room.
Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
MACE
You better keep a low profile for a
while.
LENNY
No shit.
You got someplace in mind?
CUT TO:
BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY
On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five.
Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand
choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander
laugh.
Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself.
Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like
to see more of.
Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS,
and Curtis' friend VEJ.
These two guys are about 18,
dressed in gangsta garb.
They are listening to "The
Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a
dispassion that flirts with distaste.
ZANDER
What do you got?
LENNY
(pulls a tape out of
his pocket)
Today I have...
MACE
(seeing the tape)
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
LENNY
Easy, there, Mom.
Easy.
This is
audio only.
(hands tape to
Zander)
John Coltrane.
"A Love Supreme."
Give it a listen, let me know what
you think, maybe you won't go for it
now, but it'll get in your head and
grow like a seed into something
really beautiful.
ZANDER
Let's play it now!
LENNY
Later.
Your mom'n I are heading
right back out.
Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from
Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.
Cecile even
musters the gumption to speak up.
CECILE
Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
full 24 hours, I have to get ready
for the party tonight...
MACE
Cecile.
Mace frosts her with a look.
You don't mess with Mace.
MACE
(to a disappointed
Zander)
You're not the only little boy I
have to look out for, honey.
Zander nods: OK.
Lenny gives him the grip.
Zander's hand
outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.
CUT TO:
SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK
6:05
P.M.
The last night of this millennium is falling.
Mace's limo
pulls to the curb.
The yard is located in the vast no-
man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near
harbor piers.
The impound office is locked.
Closed for
New Years Eve.
CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with
the long-handled bolt-cutters.
They enter the yard.
Mace
is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.
A
TAZER.
Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.
Mace
fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low
amperage, not lethal).
It whines and flips over twice,
then runs off behind some parked cars.
LENNY
That's a handy little attitude
adjuster.
(sees his car)
Damn.
I'm boxed in.
Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other
cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.
He unlocks
the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace
covers them with the tazer.
A puppy-like whine comes
occasionally from behind some cars nearby.
We catch a
glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them
warily.
Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,
still wrapped in the note.
He reads the note: "HELP ME.
IRIS."
MACE
What's it say?
He crumples the note.
LENNY
Nothing.
Let's go play this back.
CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.
As they
reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.
It is
the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but
looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and
Mace.
They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or
later he would lead them to the tape.
SPREG
Give me the tape.
Right now.
LENNY
What tape?
I'm just trying to get
my car back but the place is
closed--
SPREG
Shut the fuck up Nero.
Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's
head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.
MACE
(cool and even)
Lenny, give them the tape.
LENNY
It's in my case.
Okay?
I'm going
to open my case...
ENGELMAN
Facing us, where we can see it.
Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton.
He takes out the tape
and holds it out toward Spreg.
LENNY
Take it and turn her loose.
Okay?
SPREG
Absolutely.
And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that
way.
Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.
Then he
points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--
Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through
the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
Engelman's leg.
Engelman screams in pain.
Mace twists
out of his grip.
Engelman shoots the dog.
Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and
dives for the car.
The case takes three rounds from
Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.
Mace just seems to vanish.
She reappears over the trunk
of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's
chest, knocking him down.
Lenny and Mace scramble into
the car, starting it up.
Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
armor stopped the slugs.
No blood.
He comes up firing.
He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
pulls away.
No damage.
They realize the limo is a bullet
proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked
nearby, to give chase.
Spreg's face is a mask of rage.
He slams the truck in
gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even
has the door closed.
CUT TO:
LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT
Mace has the big car floored.
She looks in the rear-view
as the truck gains on them.
Mace is doing her thing...
what she's trained for.
Security driving.
She whips some
moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.
LENNY
(holding on)
Oh no, we're not being followed,
Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.
They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.
The
truck is right behind them.
LENNY
Shit!
MACE
Take it easy.
The glass is bullet
resistant.
LENNY
Bullet resistant?
Whatever happened
to bullet proof?
MACE
Lenny.
Calm down.
This is what I
do.
THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a
parked van.
Mace accelerates.
The truck stays with them.
Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
AK-47 assault rifle.
He rips off several burst which
riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.
The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the
rounds don't come all the way through.
Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.
The impact
drives them sideways.
Mace swerves to miss a light-
standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
buildings which front the harbor.
The truck stays right with them.
Engelman fires bursts at
the tires, shredding them off the rims.
The limo thunders
along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange
sparks.
Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.
No way to
turn.
Ahead is a short concrete pier.
She hits the
brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,
stopping before it reaches the end.
They are trapped.
CUT TO:
SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT
Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover
behind it.
They rake the limo with bursts from their AK-
47s.
INSIDE THE CAR.
Lenny and Mace keep their heads down
below the door frame.
It sounds like they are inside a
steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.
But the
armored body panels hold.
Lenny is punching his cellular.
LENNY
Goddamnit!!
911 is busy!
MACE
It's okay, Lenny
(he looks at her
hopefully)
They'd never get here in time
anyway.
Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door
on her side (away from the bad guys).
It is jammed from
the sideswiping.
Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
gallon gas can.
He uncaps it and throws it across the
pavement.
It slides under the limo, glugging its contents
onto the ground.
Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the
seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.
He tosses the flare under the limo...
KA-WHOOMPH!!
The gas can explodes in a fireball.
The
Continental is engulfed in flames.
From the inside all
Lenny and Mace can see is fire.
All the windows are
covered in roaring flames.
MACE
(matter-of-fact)
This is bad.
LENNY
The gas tank's going to go any
second!
Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.
The powerful
Lincoln thunders forward.
It crashes through a chain-link
fence and launches right off the end of the pier.
A
fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
water.
Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.
The car
sinks.
UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting
there amid the junk.
Shafts of light play down from the
big streetlights at the end of the pier.
INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.
LENNY
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
MACE
Fire's out, isn't it?
She scrambles into the back seat.
She wrenches at the
rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the
huge trunk.
Water is up around their legs.
She grabs her
shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.
MACE
Get in here.
Come on Lenny, move
it.
MOVE!!
Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.
MACE
Get ready to hold your breath.
She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.
MACE
Lenny, kick out hard, then just
follow me. Okay?
He nods.
BLAM!!
She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.
The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.
Lenny
and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.
ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
the slimy concrete wall.
Lenny comes up beside her,
spluttering.
Her hand goes over his mouth.
They are in
the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road
ties.
Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the
black water over the barrels of their AKs.
SPREG
Let's get out of here.
They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.
Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,
chest-deep in the water.
They hear the truck pulling
away.
They let out a big exhalations of relief.
CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes
squishing.
They leave a shiny trail behind them.
MACE
I can't believe we had to give them
the damn tape.
LENNY
Yeah, me neither.
It was one of my
favorites.
Me and Faith in a hot
tub on my birthday.
I'm going to
really miss it.
He feels around in his jacket pocket.
He pulls out the
MYSTERY TAPE... nice and dry in its plastic case.
He
holds it up to show a grinning Mace.
LENNY
Are we impressed yet?
CUT TO:
FREEWAY AND CURTIS' CAR - NIGHT
7:45
P.M.
Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of
Curtis' car.
CURTIS
(pissed)
I got better things to do on New
Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
chauffeur...
MACE
Hey Curtis?
Just drive.
Curtis swears.
But he shuts up and drives.
LENNY
Those two guys were cops.
MACE
You sure?
LENNY
It's the walk.
Something.
Anyway,
they'll run your plates and get your
address.
We gotta keep moving.
Mace takes it in.
She nods.
CUT TO:
STREET AND CIVIC - NIGHT
Sirens pierce the night.
Two pillars of fire are visible
blocks away.
There are dark crowds of people everywhere.
People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.
There are
flashes and explosions.
It could be a celebration, or a
war zone.
Maybe both.
Or one about to turn into the
other.
Mace is driving, scanning the streets.
She has her .380
auto in her hand, resting in her lap.
Lenny is riding
shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back
seat.
CUT TO:
CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is gang territory pure and simple.
Blacks and
Hispanics.
Graffiti everywhere.
Burned-out buildings.
Lenny sees abject poverty, here.
Even so, people are
partying.
They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building
and get out.
There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who
give Mace the local hand-sign.
She returns the sign
automatically as she carries Zander past them.
ONE OF THE BOYS
Yo, Mace.
Whatup wit you, homegirl?
You never come roun' here no more.
Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag.
The homeboys give
Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.
Mace chills them
with a glare.
MACE
He's with me.
CUT TO:
MAX'S CAR - NIGHT
As Max drives along a crowded downtown street.
MAX
(into phone)
Don't talk to anybody.
Anybody.
You're invisible.
Okay?
Just meet
me at Tick's in a half hour.
And
Lenny... don't get pulled over.
CUT TO:
CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving.
CECILE
Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
off everything on me?
We had plans
tonight--
MACE
(steely)
Listen to me, little sister.
There's something going on, and it's
very big.
Now you've got to take
care of Zander.
And stay off the
streets tonight... you hear me on
this?
Cecile gets the message.
She nods.
MACE
Curtis.
What about you?
Do we
understand each other?
You stay
put.
CURTIS
Yeah.
I'm wit it.
Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car.
CURTIS
(to Cecile)
Damn!
She worse than you.
CUT TO:
CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT
Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver
the dark streets.
Xenon searchlights crisscross the
rooftops nearby.
They see patrol cars passing on cross-
streets, lights flashing.
It feels like the entire LAPD
is looking for them.
Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street
parties in progress.
People drinking and firing bottle
rockets.
The police watch everything.
LENNY
So, let's see, I've got Tran's
goons, some squidhead psycho and the
LAPD all trying to kill me.
Happy
new year, Lenny.
MACE
Well, look at the plus side.
LENNY
There's a plus side?
MACE
Yeah.
You gave up your hot tub tape
to save me.
That's real progress
for you.
LENNY
It was a tough call.
MACE
I still can't square the psycho
smarts of whoever did Iris with
those two cops.
LENNY
I don't think those cops did Iris.
I think whoever Iris was wearing for
killed her.
MACE
Why?
LENNY
To break the trail.
If those cops
had gotten hold of her, they would
have beat it out of her who she was
wearing for, and then gone after
them too.
Our killer is running as
scared as we are.
Which makes him
really dangerous.
Judging by how
scared I am.
They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the
seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security
pass and the cop waves them on.
Lenny lets his breath out slowly.
CUT TO:
RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT
Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the
club into a van in the alley.
Lenny and Mace ENTER FRAME
and we follow them between the roadies, going through the
doors into...
RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT
Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him
to the car.
As they are putting him in the car, TWO LAPD
OFFICERS come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding
Lenny.
MAX
Everything's cool.
Too much to
drink.
Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half
out of the car.
The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls
out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.
Mace's eyes go wide.
The boot of one of the cops is
inches from it.
MACE
Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
stairs.
We're taking him to
emergency.
(to the nearest cop)
Excuse me.
The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up
in the seat.
She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the
car, over to the driver's side.
COP
Go to Cedars.
It's closest.
Mace nods and goes around the car.
Max starts asking them
questions and the cops turn away, distracted.
She picks
up the tape and gets in.
Closes the door.
Let's out a
big breath.
CUT TO:
STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT
11:07
P.M.
IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.
IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
downtown L.A.
Arc lights sweep the sky.
There are two
outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.
There are
lasers, strobe-lights.
People are literally dancing in
the streets... if they can move at all.
Huge projection
video screens are set up all over the place.
LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
zones.
The excitement has been building all evening as
midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
blow-out.
Madness in the streets.
And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
it.
The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
Mardi Gras.
People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
they go by, or press their faces against the glass.
It
may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
middle of a third world revolution.
MACE
That's it.
Let's bail.
And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the
protesting horns behind her.
And we see that she's
wearing a short black cocktail dress.
Lenny comes around
the car, through the wild crowd.
He's in his other suit.
Snappy.
Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
.380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.
She pulls
the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
her upper thighs.
In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
quarter anywhere on her body.
The dress is cut low at the
top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
legs.
High heels doing great things for her calves.
Her
braids now loose and full, like a mane.
Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.
He is
caught by a sudden realization:
LENNY
Mace... you're a girl.
MACE
Good, Lenny.
I can see why the
detective gig didn't work out.
Come
on.
They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.
Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the
fore.
The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.
Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an
unparted Red Sea of man and machine.
They will move through the various strata of society as
they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.
It
is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed
into a few square blocks.
There are cops everywhere.
Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.
Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...
metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500
dollar-a-plate ticket.
LENNY
Got your ticket?
MACE
No.
They must have sent it to my
beach house by mistake.
Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace
follows.
They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
feet away, his back to them.
REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG.
His black eyes scan the
crowd.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among
the street crowd who don't even notice her.
She holsters
the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.
The sky
explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off
overhead.
A crack like thunder follows.
Then more
flashes.
The countdown to midnight has begun.
The party is
building to a crescendo.
It seems to have a surreal,
nightmarish quality.
She passes a MIME in a clock suit,
who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight.
CUT TO:
STREET PARTY/HOTEL
Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking
for a way back in.
She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the
crowd, not twenty feet from her.
He is looking right at
her.
Not recognizing her for a moment.
Then... he
realizes who she is.
He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the
way, breaking into a run.
Engelman charges after her,
pulling out his rover to call Spreg.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the
crowd.
Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he
charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.
He
hammers through anybody that gets in his way.
Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian
runner.
Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead
of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black
shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a
doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.
Death watches her
pass.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
Spreg as he searches for Mace.
He sees her from behind,
walking near one of the stages.
He moves up behind her,
aiming his pistol at the back of her head.
She turns
and...
... it isn't Mace.
Another girl in a similar dress.
Spreg curses and looks around.
Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.
He points to
her position and Spreg charges after her.
He has his
baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
out of the way as he runs.
Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
out of her way.
Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.
Spreg fires at her.
People drop, their screams drowned
out by the pandemonium.
The gunshots don't register above
the concussions from the fireworks.
No one notices the
shootings.
Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
block his shots.
Mace won't fire back in the crowd.
ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
tower.
He has lost sight of her.
He starts to reload his
pistol.
Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
of her pistol.
Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
her forearm.
Her .380 clatters to the ground.
Mace
bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
palm up under his chin.
His head raps off the metal.
Mace is like a she-panther.
She rips the baton out of his
hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.
He drops
to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.
A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.
She
spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.
Before he can
fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
using him as a human wall.
She clamps an arm around his
neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.
She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.
He
convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
like a fish.
She holds the current on him while she goes
over and kicks his gun away.
She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.
Spreg glares at
her through the blood running into his eyes.
She raises
the baton.
MACE
All the way down!
RIGHT NOW!!
He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.
Now that
she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.
The crowd of partiers stares.
Can't believe what they're
seeing.
Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
wrist to the base of the tower.
That's when THREE LAPD
COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
police baton.
The cops advance toward her.
MACE
Wait.
Let me tell you what's going
on here--
The nearest shoots her with a tazer.
She spasms and goes
to her hands and knees.
One of the cops kicks her down.
She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the
breath as the batons start to fall.
The crowd around them
watches fascinated, gasping.
Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.
MACE
NO!!
NO!!!
They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay
down.
Another one kicks her in the stomach.
A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
cops.
And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
then half a dozen.
Just normal people... black, white,
Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
It becomes a brawl.
Then cops are running in from everywhere.
We see the
trigger point of a full-scale riot.
Cops in full riot-
gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
space.
A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
like the divine light of God.
Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
the way, forming a human wall.
They get the crowd settled
down.
Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
and several ranking officers.
He surveys the scene.
Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.
The beat
extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.
Then...
He points at the two prone cops.
STRICKLAND
(to the nearest
officers)
These two are under arrest for
murder.
Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's
squid tape.
Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are
over.
The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an
otherworldly quality.
Like they are in some celestial
court of judgment.
STRICKLAND
Get some medical attention for this
woman.
Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.
He runs to
Mace and kneels next to her.
LENNY
Are you okay?
A trickle of blood runs down her face.
She nods weakly
and reaches for him.
They hug, then they both wince in
pain.
Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and
Engelman.
One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.
MACE
I got 'em, Lenny.
ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the
closest cop.
He waves them back with it.
Then puts it in
his mouth and fires.
He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting
blood.
Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
bathing in his blood.
You see him going insane, right at
that moment.
His face is suddenly demonic.
SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.
His
glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.
He has Engelman's gun
in one blood-drenched hand.
Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.
He keeps
the pistol down along his side.
Spreg exists at the
center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.
He
has a gun so they can't rush him.
But he's a cop, so they
can't shoot him.
Several officers shout at him to drop
the weapon.
You barely hear them over the pandemonium of
the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.
LENNY
SHOOT!
Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,
completely unhinged, lurches toward them.
Engelman's body
slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a
foot wide.
SPREG
YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!
He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...
Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take
the fire, and...
POW POW POW!
The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.
He drops like a sack of cement.
The smoke clears.
Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.
He faints.
Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.
He
opens his eyes.
LENNY
Yeah, what?
CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.
Mace and Lenny are being
escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of
cops who part the rowdy mob before them.
Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.
Lenny's
arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.
They
support each other like two soldiers after a battle.
Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,
passing near them.
She is in handcuffs and her eyes are
dull.
Mace turns back to Lenny...
MACE
Are we under arrest?
LENNY
Naw.
They just have to ask us a
few questions... for about six
hours.
They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his
arms.
Life out of Death in the endless continuum.
Lenny
pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.
They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.
The EMT
guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit
jacket.
Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad
car.
Lenny sees...
The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at
midnight.
We hear a roar passing through the crowd.
A
huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as
everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.
CROWD
TEN!
NINE!
EIGHT!...
Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.
CROWD
SEVEN!
SIX!
FIVE!...
Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance
from darkness.
CROWD
FOUR!
THREE!
TWO!
ONE!
HAPPY NEW
YEAR!
The exultation of the moment flows through them as the
people lift their voices in a great cheer.
Balloons are
released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.
Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.
MACE
(grinning)
Hey, Lenny.
We made it.
LENNY
Yeah.
We did.
She hugs him.
Then pulls back.
Friends... yes.
And
always.
But there's that line that she can't cross.
Only
he can do that.
MACE
Well...
(she shrugs)
Get going.
You're still bleeding.
LENNY
See you downtown.
MACE
Yeah.
See you there.
TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.
They open the back door for him.
The walk is
hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the
hysteria of the crowd.
He looks back at Mace as the
paramedics help him up into the ambulance.
The back doors
close.
ON MACE, watching him go.
A cop gently takes her arm,
opening the squad car door for her.
She turns away, her
face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.
She gets into
the back seat.
The door slams.
Strickland gets in next
to her.
The driver starts the car.
They start to move,
and...
There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...
The door is wrenched open...
A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...
Lenny.
His eyes are full of emotion.
He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like
there's no tomorrow.
She grabs his head and won't let him
break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.
Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his
watch.
Reflex.
Because if there's one time you don't
need a watch, it's...
12:01
A.M.
JANUARY 1, 2000
PULL BACK AND UP as Lenny and Mace stay locked together,
while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again.
