                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   Wait a minute -- time out -- I've got 
                   a few questions here, do you mind?  
                   First, how is it we're here, 
                   dressed like -- Robin Hood and Maid 
                   Marian, but we still _think_ like 
                   Lois and Clark?
                        (off Wells)
                   And how come you haven't changed
                   one bit?

                                    WELLS
                   Actually, the truth is... I have no 
                   idea.  But perhaps the answer lies 
                   in the fact that this is about 
                   _your_ lives, _your_ circle of 
                   friends, _your_ destiny, not mine.
                   I'm merely... a guide.  Like a 
                   narrator in a play.

                                    CLARK/THE FOX
                   Yeah, but why am I here?  I mean,
                   I'm not even from this planet.

                                    WELLS
                   Perhaps Clark Kent isn't, but your 
                   soul -- comes from a place beyond 
                   planets, beyond Time.  Where we all 
                   come from.  You see, time travel 
                   has given me a glimpse at the Great 
                   Design.  Enough of a glimpse to see 
                   that the power of this universe is 
                   energy, and the power of your love 
                   is what brings your souls together,
                   time and again.  That's the one 
                   absolute -- wherever she is, you 
                   are.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   Yeah, together, but eternally
                   teased.

                   Time is short, M'lord.  You'd                     (X)
                   better come with us to our cave
                   before Baron Tempos returns with
                   his troops.

                                    JON
                   She's right, if Tempos discovers
                   your secret identity, he'll have
                   your head!

                                    LOIS
                   Oh, no, not this secret identity

    outfit and stacks it on a rock.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   I'm not saying I'm buying into any 
                   of this stuff yet, but it is kind 
                   of bizarre that Tempus, of all 
                   people, is behind the curse.  I 
                   mean, _Lex Luthor_, I could 
                   understand, but --

    She turns and ogles at Clark, who comes around from behind a 
    boulder wearing only tight black pants and lace up leather 
    boots.  He self-consciously reacts to her reaction:

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   What... ? It's the pants, isn't it?  
                   They're too tight.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                        (transfixed)
                   Tight?  No, they're, uh... perfect.
                   I just never get over how well --
                   _defined_ you are.

    She hands him a black leather jerkin with an attached 
    flowing cape.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Thanks...

                   Here, let me help.

    She adjusts the cape then helps him lace up the vest.  They 
    feed off each other's body heat, struggling to fend off 
    their natural urges.  He strokes her cheek.  She strokes his 
    exposed biceps.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE (CONT'D)
                   You know what I think... ?

                   honeymoon A.S.A.P.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   That's what I was thinking.

    Melting into each other, they move to kiss, when Wells 
    appears around the corner and CLEARS his THROAT.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Yes... ?

                        (looking back)
                   Sorry, but your... parents just 
                   told me something very interesting.  
                   Apparently, Sir Charles and Lady 
                   Loisette are secretly in love.  
                   That's why he... I mean, The Fox... 
                   I mean, _you_ ambushed Tempos, to 
                   get her away from him.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Sounds like something I'd do in any 
                   life.

                                    WELLS
                   The problem is that could very well 
                   be the event that triggered the 
                   curse.  If so, we may already be 
                   too late.

    Marta and Jon approach and present Clark with a shiny, King      (X)
    Arthur-like sword.

                                    MARTA
                   Your sword, Sir Charles.

    She hands it to him, then curtsies.

                   You'd better get back to Baron                    (X)

    A SOLDIER nails a parchment WANTED POSTER to a post.  It
    bears a crudely sketched LIKENESS of THE FOX (masked), and
    reads:  PROCLAMATION, FOR THE CAPTURE OF THE FOX, 1000 GOLD
    PIECES.  REVEAL Clark/Sir Charles, as he rides up,
    dismounts, and reacts to the poster, before entering:



    Clark/Sir Charles, black cape flowing, rides up to Lois and

    nearby.

                   It's about time, Clark, I was
                   getting worried about you.

                        (dismounts)
                   I'm supposed to be out searching
                   for The Fox.  Baron Tempos wants me
                   to duel him for your love.

                   You fighting you for me?  That
                   should be interesting.

                                    WELLS
                   What about the curse, has it been

                   I don't think so, but you don't
                   want to mess with that sorcerer,
                   believe me.  The guy's married to                 (X)
                   a rat.

                   My point is, I think the original
                   Sir Charles came back for Lady
                   Loisette like I'm doing, but ran
                   off with her, never to return --

                   able to marry her.  That's gotta be
                   what triggered the curse.

                   Do you ever wonder if our

                   Not just here, everywhere.

                   No, I'm serious, Clark.  Maybe 
                   we're missing the obvious here.  
                   Maybe it's time we stopped 
                   pretending, started looking at the 
                   writing on the wall.  It just seems 
                   like every time we turn around, 
                   every time we try to take the next 
                   step, something's in our way trying 
                   to keep us from getting there.

                   I don't know... When you add it all
                   up like that, it's a lot.  But,
                   maybe, that's the point.  Maybe
                   what it really is, is a test... to
                   see how badly we want to be
                   together.  Maybe it's up to us to
                   decide of t's meant to be or not.                 (X)

                   I think there's a reason why we're
                   soul mates.  A very, very good
                   reason.

                   Sorry, but time is of the essence 
                   and I think I might have an idea.
                   What would happen if we could find 
                   a way to get The Fox to duel Baron 
                   Tempos, himself -- and _lose_ to 
                   him?

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   It'd keep the curse from being
                   cast, I guess.

                   Yeah, but we'd be leaving The Fox 
                   to spend the rest of his life at 
                   Tempos's mercy.

                                    WELLS
                   Isn't that preferable to the 
                   alternative -- him having to endure 
                   the first in a never-ending string 
                   of tragedies?

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Well, what about Lady Loisette?  We 
                   can't just let her get stuck with 
                   Tempos.

                   she can handle him.

    just right and --

    rides alone, then suddenly gets knocked off his horse by
    Clark and onto the ground.  Clark hops to his feet, hand on

                   Careful, you wouldn't want to make
                   a martyr out of me, would you?

    Tempos holds up a hand to stop them, then gets to his feet.

                   Is there a more noble way to die
                   than to die for love, Sir Charles?

    Decision time.  Lois and Clark hold an intimate look.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   I don't want to die... But if 
                   that's what it takes for us to be 
                   together... that's easy.

    He smothers her protest with a kiss, then turns to meet the
    challenge.

    Wells gently grabs her, knowing this is how it must go down.

    Tempos LUNGES again, but Clark's ready for him.  Adrenalin       (X)
    pumping, he overtakes Tempos in a furious barrage, knocking      (X)
    him to the ground.

    But instead of going for the kill, Clark turns to look at 
    Lois, _intentionally_ allowing Tempos time to regain his 
    feet and go back on the attack.  Clark allows Tempos to 
    defeat him as he falls backward onto the ground.  Tempos 
    straddles him for the kill.

                   was defeat Tempus.  He did that.

                   Well, temporarily perhaps.  I just 
                   had a conversation with a 
                   passing -- what do you yanks call 
                   them... a _buckaroo_, who informed 
                   me that Tempus Tex is holding 
                   hostages, near and dear to Lulu.
                   Insurance, apparently, to make sure 
                   the wedding goes through.  In 
                   short, you haven't defeated Tempus, 
                   until you save them first.

                   -- Have we met before?  You look

                   any more rescuing.

    Clark, who turns and WHISTLES for his horse.

                   More than understandable.  After

                   be taken lightly.  Especially in

    Lois elbows Tempus in the gut -- the gun GOES OFF, the
    bullet just missing Clark, who then KICKS the gun out of his
    hand.  Tempus Tex takes off in a full sprint.  Clark chases
    him down, tackles him hard into the ground, then yanks him

                   doorstep as a baby.  Weird, huh?

                                    LOIS/LULU
                   Hey, I'll trade parents with you
                   any day.

    Mary and Jonas brush that off, then:

                                    MARY
                   You saved our town from the evil 
                   Tempus Tex.  How can we ever repay 
                   you?

                        (off Lois)
                   You already have, or _will_.

    Mary smiles at that, although she's not sure why.

                                    WELLS
                        (clears his throat)
                   It's _time_.

    Lois turns to Mary and Jonas.

                                    LOIS/LULU
                   We have to go.

                   But we'll see you soon.

    And, as Wells pulls out The Device --
