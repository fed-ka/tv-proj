      CAPTAIN JIM DASHELL, 39 and a tad pissed off from the moment 
      he wakes up, stands before a roomful of seated cops.

                                    DASHELL
                    Anybody know what tonight is?
                          (a few hands go up)
                    Don t say  poker night ...
                          (a hand goes down)
                    And do not tell me it s the season 
                    finale of  Glee. 
                          (two more hands go down)
                    Fuckin  hate that show.  Carla.                                                                                      3.


      PAN to Officer CARLA SANCHEZ, young go-getter, hand raised.

                                  CARLA
                    One-year anniversary of the first 
                    zombie sighting, Captain.

                                    DASHELL
                    That s exactly right, Carla.

      Officer JOHN-JOHN JOHNSON, seated next to Carla, leans over 
      with a napkin in his hand.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                          (wiping her face, sotto)
                    Here, you got a little Captain-ass 
                    on your nose.

                                  CARLA
                    Just like you will when I m running 
                    this place.

                                    DASHELL
                    It was a year ago tonight that 
                    zombies began besmirching our fine 
                      community.
                          (then)
                    That s right, besmirching.  And 
                    with the zombies came the vampires 
                    and the werewolves, and with them 
                    came my personal promise that I 
                    will not rest until we ve 
                      eradicated this problem completely.

                                    STUBECK
                    I thought you said we re just 
                    trying to contain the problem.

                                  DASHELL
                    Well, you tell me -- are you 
                    satisfied containing the problem?
                          (then, for the cameras)
                    No, don t be silly.  Stubeck, 
                    where s your partner?

                                  STUBECK
                    He s in the can, sir.  He had 
                    himself a couple of Choco Tacos, 
                    and I tell him all the time he s 
                    lactose intolerant, but the guy-

                                  DASHELL
                          (holding up hand)
                    That s fine, Stubeck.
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      4.

                                    DASHELL (CONT'D)
                    You explain to Officer Wilbur that 
                    we re on high alert tonight, okay?  
                    We ve been picking up some chatter -
                    - the vamps are definitely up to 
                      something, and I for one am not 
                    taking any chances.  So let s be 
                    vigilant, let s all stick together, 
                    and let s let these nice people 
                    from Channel 5 get their story and 
                    get home in one piece.

      The CAMERA PANS to our BOOM MIC GUY and another CAMERA 
      OPERATOR.

                                    DASHELL (CONT D)
                    Final piece of business, we have 
                    someone joining our unit today:  
                    Officer Landry.
                          (gesturing)
                    Kristen, stand up.

      KIRSTEN LANDRY, young and fresh-faced, waves shyly and sits 
      back down.  Carla gives her a dismissive glance.

                                    DASHELL (CONT D)
                    Officer Landry is new on the job, 
                    but I m sure she s no rookie when 
                    it comes to zombies.

                                    KIRSTEN
                    Actually, I ve never seen one.

                                    DASHELL
                    Well, trust me, it ll take you 
                    about two hours around here to lose 
                    your cherry.
                          (then)
                      Metaphorically, of course.  I m not 
                      suggesting you re actually-... and 
                    I m certainly not suggesting you 
                    aren t.  It s not my business how 
                    you conduct your affairs.  And I 
                    don t mean actual  affairs,  that s-
                          (changing subject)
                    Any other business?  Okay, then, 
                    let s get out there and kill 
                      something.

      As Dashell claps his hands and everybody gets up...


      The officers walk past actor LAURA PREPON, who s at the 
      booking desk out front speaking to a CLERK.                                                                                      5.


                                  LAURA PREPON
                          (clearly upset)
                    Guys, I'm talking broad daylight in 
                    the middle of Los Feliz.  I had 
                    lunch at Figaro, and I walk back to 
                    my car and there's some drooling, 
                    dead-eyed zombie with a split in 
                    his head just wandering around 
                    behind Skylight Books.  That is 
                    some EFF-ed up S!  Seriously, do 
                    your jobs and keep these things in 
                    the valley!!

      As John John and Carla exit the station, they look back.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Isn t that, y know...?

                                  CARLA
                    Yeah, Laura Prepon, she goes to the 
                    same Coffee Bean as me.


      Stubeck sits behind the wheel of a UTF Cruiser, Billy riding 
      shotgun.  Stubeck talks over his shoulder to camera. 

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    What s going on tonight?

                                    STUBECK
                    We re staking out this motel for 
                    vampire prostitution. 

                                  BILLY
                    Staking out, vampires, get it?

      Stubeck shakes his head at Billy.

                                    STUBECK
                    Blood for sex is a big problem in 
                    the Valley.  A lot of desperate 
                    guys with no cash willing to do 
                    whatever it takes to get a little 
                    action in.  

      Billy puts sunglasses on and turns towards the camera.

                                  BILLY
                    That s right.                                                                                      6.


                                    STUBECK
                    Take those off, it s nighttime!

                                  BILLY
                    Whatever dude.

                                    STUBECK
                    Come on.

      Stubeck turns to address camera.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    What was I saying?

                                  BILLY
                            (sarcastically)
                    Zombies, vampires.

                                    STUBECK
                    I don t talk like that. 

                                  BILLY
                    Whatever, man.

                                    STUBECK
                    I don t. 

      Stubeck turns to face camera.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    Zombies, vampires.  I know a lot of 
                    guys who would cut and run, but not 
                    me.  You wanna know why?

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    Why s that?

      Stubeck reaches up and takes a picture of his family out from 
      the visor and shows it to camera.

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.) (CONT D) 
                    Is that your family?

                                    STUBECK
                    Damn right.  I risk it all for 
                    them.  I m proud to.

      He puts the picture away.

                                  BILLY
                    You wanna know why I do it?

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    Ah, sure.                                                                                      7.


      Billy fishes out his iPhone and holds it up to camera.  It s 
      a picture of two hot, naked chicks making out. 

                                  BILLY
                    I do it for them.

                                  DIRECTOR
                    Nice.

                                    STUBECK
                    Let me see that. 

      Stubeck grabs the phone and takes a look.  He s annoyed.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    That s a picture of naked women 
                    groping each other!

                                  BILLY
                          (smiling)
                    Yeah, I know.

                                    STUBECK
                    I said I do this for my family.

                                  BILLY
                    I ve had this JPEG so long it s 
                    like my family. 

      Billy considers this.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                      Technically, I guess that makes it 
                    incest. 

                                    STUBECK
                    Stop it.  Come on, grow up!  Stop 
                    it!

      Stubeck notices a JOHN walking into the motel.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    Hey, hey, hey!  Here we go -- a 
                    fish is taking the bait.

                                  BILLY
                    What fish?

                                    STUBECK
                    A fish is tak-.  Jesus Christ, 
                    Billy, a man is going in with a 
                      prostitute.                                                                                       8.


                                  BILLY
                    Oh!

                                    STUBECK
                    Come on, lets go.

                                  BILLY
                    Well, lets go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.

      Billy pulls out his iPhone again.

                                    STUBECK
                    What are you doing?

                                  BILLY
                    I m gonna take some pictures.

                                    STUBECK
                    No, stop it.  Put that away.

                                  BILLY
                    Come on.

                                    STUBECK
                    Now don t-....  Alright, let me get 
                    my gun. 

      Stubeck pulls out his gun and poses.  Billy points his iPhone 
      at Stubeck.

                                  BILLY
                    Give me a good one.  A little more 
                    pissed.

      Stubeck makes a mean face.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Yeah, yeah, right there.  Got it!

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      9.


                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Stubeck and Billy stand outside the door of a motel room, 
      guns drawn.  Stubeck kicks the door in, and the camera crew 
      rushes in after them.  They find NADIA, a vampire prostitute, 
      straddling a half-naked JOHN who s tied down to the bed.  He 
      has IV s in his arms, and blood is being slowly drained.

                                    STUBECK
                    Okay, everybody, hands in the air.

                                  BILLY
                    That means you, vampire tits.

                                    STUBECK
                    Really?  Vampire tits?

                                  NADIA
                    I wasn t doing nothing.

                                    STUBECK
                    Okay, Nadia, how many times are we 
                    gonna do this?

      The John fidgets uncomfortably in the bed. 

                                  NADIA
                    Come on, Stubeck, leave working 
                    girl alone.

                                  BILLY
                    You weren t working, you were 
                    humping this guy for blood.
                          (straight into camera)
                    Am I right?

                                    STUBECK
                    What are you doing? 

                                  NADIA
                          (in Russian)
                    Screw you, pig!

                                  BILLY
                    Sorry, I don t speak vampire.

                                    STUBECK
                    It s Russian, you idiot.  Come on, 
                    Nadia, you know the drill.  Hands 
                    behind your back.                                                                                    10.


      Stubeck starts to cuff Nadia.  The John squirms on the bed.

                                  JOHN
                    This isn t what it looks like.  I 
                    thought she was a regular 
                      prostitute. 

                                  BILLY
                          (mocking the John in a 
                            shrill voice)
                    I thought she was a regular 
                      prostitute.
                          (beat)
                    Are we in a cow pasture?   Cause I 
                    smell bullshit.

      Billy smiles at camera.

                                    STUBECK
                    Go check the bathroom.

                                  BILLY
                    I m going to go check the bathroom. 

      Billy gives the camera another cocky cop pose.

                                    STUBECK
                    I just told you to do that, so 
                    you re following an order right 
                    now.

                                  JOHN
                    So if I don t have sex, do I still 
                    have to give blood?


      JOHN-JOHN and CARLA cruise the streets.  Carla drives as John-
      John rides shotgun.

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    So, if there are monsters in the 
                    valley, why don t people move out?

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    I dunno,  cause that s where they 
                    live.  Shit, I live in the valley.  
                    You wanna buy me a place in Malibu?  
                     Cause I ain t stopping you.                                                                                    11.


                                  CARLA
                    I bet you could pull that off.  
                    Living in a beach house, being 
                    neighbors with Mel Gibson and 
                      whoever...

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    No, no, not Mel Gibson.
                          (he and Carla laugh)
                    Ah, what the hell, Mel Gibson, I m 
                    cool with that.

      They laugh again.

                                  CARLA
                          (to the Director)
                    Believe me, if this monster shit 
                    ever spread to Malibu or Brentwood 
                    or the Hollywood Hills, they d call 
                    in the SWAT team.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                          (defensive)
                    Hey, we are the SWAT team. Everyone 
                    in this unit is a highly-trained 
                      specialist who takes their job very 
                      seriously.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Billy walks into the bathroom with his gun drawn.

                                  BILLY
                    It smells like a cat s balls in 
                    here.

      A snarling, foul VAMPIRE PIMP jumps out from behind a door 
      and throws Billy across the room, knocking him out.

      Stubeck hears this and turns in time to see the Vampire Pimp 
      heading straight for him.

                                    VAMPIRE PIMP
                    You re dead, pig!

      Nadia, still handcuffed, starts jumping around laughing.

                                  NADIA
                    Kill him!

      Stubeck pulls out his UV-11 Anti-Vampire Night-Stick and 
      burns the Vampire Pimp in the face.                                                                                      12.


      The Vampire Pimp recoils in pain but recovers, grabs Stubeck 
      by the throat and lifts him up against a wall.  The John is 
      freaking out tied to the bed.

                                  JOHN
                    Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!

      The Vampire Pimp growls at Stubeck as he chokes him.

                                  NADIA
                    Kill him!

      Billy wakes up in the bathroom and runs out to help.  He 
      grabs the boom pole from the Boom Mic Guy but the Boom Guy 
      struggles to hang on to it.

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    Whoa, whoa -- dude, come on, this 
                    is like a $500 boom.

      Billy hits the Boom Guy in the nuts and gets the boom.  He 
      breaks the pole in half and thrusts the pointed edge through 
      the Vampire Pimp s chest, spraying black blood everywhere.  
      The pimp moans in pain and drops lifelessly to the floor.  
      The John is still losing his mind.

                                  JOHN
                    Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!

                                  BILLY
                    Shut up!
                          (a beat)
                    You know what they say about boom 
                    poles, don t you?
                          (he puts his shades on)
                    You never hear them coming.

      Stubeck pops up from the floor.

                                    STUBECK
                    That was a pretty good one.

                                  BILLY
                    Fuck yeah.


      Dead quiet.  Captain Dashell stares out his office window at 
      Kirsten, who s at her desk, stretching her neck.  Dashell 
      walks out into the bullpen and approaches her.

                                    DASHELL
                    So.  You handling everything we 
                    threw at you today?                                                                                    13.


                                    KIRSTEN
                    I ve... been sitting at my desk for 
                    four hours.

                                    DASHELL
                    I know that, I ve been watching 
                    you.  Not continually, I ve also 
                    been catching up on my paperwork.
                          (then, defensive)
                    Which is just a small fraction of 
                    my job, I m actually out on the 
                    beat quite a bit.

                                    KIRSTEN
                    I d love to be out on the beat.

                                    DASHELL
                    In time, Kristen, in time.

                                    KIRSTEN
                    It s, uh... Kirsten, actually.

                                    DASHELL
                    What d I say?

                                    KIRSTEN
                    Kristen.

                                    DASHELL
                    Say it your way.

                                    KIRSTEN
                    Kirsten.

                                    DASHELL
                          (a beat, then)
                    I ll be honest, I m gonna have a 
                    little trouble with that.  
                    Anyway...
                          (trying)
                      Krieeeerrsten...
                          (moving on)
                    ...I know you wanna get out there 
                    and show me what you can do, but 
                    the valley s a long way from... 
                    where d you say you re from again?

                                    KIRSTEN
                    I didn t.  Carefree, Arizona.

                                    DASHELL
                    Carefree, Arizona.  That s perfect.  
                    What do you in Carefree?  You don t 
                    look like a golfer.                                                                                    14.


                                    KIRSTEN
                    Actually, I m a 12 handicap.

                                    DASHELL
                    That means nothing to a zombie.  
                    You gonna kill a zombie with your 
                    golf club?

                                    KIRSTEN
                    Well, if I had it on me, sure.  You 
                    wanna destroy the brain, right?

                                    DASHELL
                    Exactly.  Shoot him through the 
                    eyes, run him over, smash his head 
                    in with a crowbar...

                                    KIRSTEN
                    How s a crowbar different than a 
                    golf club?

                                    DASHELL
                     How s a crowbar-...   It... it 
                    just is, okay, Kriersten?

      The door opens.  Stubeck pushes a handcuffed Nadia inside.

                                    DASHELL (CONT D)
                    Well, well, well... if it isn t my 
                    favorite prostitute.
                          (then, to Kirsten)
                    I m joking, I don t know any other 
                      prostitutes.

                                    STUBECK
                          (cuffing Nadia to a bench)
                    Found our friend here draining the 
                    red vein.  Billy almost got his 
                    brains bashed in by her pimp, but 
                    he managed to impale the assailant 
                    with a boom pole through the chest.

                                    DASHELL
                    Kebabed the fucker, huh?  Good for 
                    him.  So, where s Billy now?

                                    STUBECK
                    In the can, sir.

                                    DASHELL
                    Choco Taco?

                                    STUBECK
                    And a Slurpee.                                                                                    15.


                                  NADIA
                          (struggling with cuffs)
                    Your partner killed wrong vampire. 

                                    DASHELL
                    Yeah, well, I guess we ll have to 
                    live with that, won t we?

                                  NADIA
                    Don t be so sure, Stubeck.

                                    STUBECK
                    Ooh, scary...
                          (tossing keys to Dashell)
                    Alright, Nadia, you enjoy lock-up, 
                    I m heading home to my nice warm 
                    bed -- which I use for sleeping, 
                    not sex.  And y know why?  Because 
                    I am a happily married man.

      Stubeck signs off to Dashell and Kirsten and heads out.


      Stubeck knocks on the bathroom door.

                                    STUBECK
                          (calling)
                    Billy, let s blow this joint.
                          (a beat, he knocks harder)
                    Billy?

      Stubeck opens the door and walks inside.  Bends down low and 
      sees... no feet in the stall.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    Billy??

      Stubeck approaches the stall.  After a beat, he KICKS IN THE 
      DOOR -- BANG!  The stall s empty, except for something laying 
      on the floor:  Billy s iPhone.  As Stubeck picks it up, he 
      notices a smear of BLOOD on the bottom edge of the stall 
      door.  He backs out, pulls his gun and searches the bathroom, 
      panicked.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                    Billy!!!

      And we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                          ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Chyron:  4:04 a.m., North Hollywood

      Carla and John-John are still driving along.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                          (to the Director)
                    I m telling you, I got tons of good 
                      inventions.  I mean, when I was a 
                    kid I used to put water in a bottle 
                    and carry it around, I just never 
                    tried charging two bucks for it.

      Then, 

      The radio crackles.

                                  RADIO
                    Unit 23, unit 23, do you copy?

                                  CARLA
                    Officer Sanchez here.  I copy.

                                  RADIO
                    We have a report of a 1-11 in 
                    progress at Wigley s Donuts, 1327 
                      Chatsworth.  Please report, over.

                                  CARLA
                      Affirmative.  Officer Johnson and I 
                    are on route, over.

      John-Johm smiles.  He pulls brass knuckles out of his front 
      pocket and puts them on.

                                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                    What s a 1-11?

                                  CARLA
                      Slow-walker zombie. (*ADD) The 
                    fresh ones can move pretty well, 
                    but a 1-11 s been undead too long.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Wigley s Donuts, now that s what 
                    I m talking about.  I can go for a 
                    bear claw.  Hit the lights, baby.

      The lights and siren kick in and the car speeds away.                                                                                    17.



      Stubeck sits across from Capt. Dashell in a closed-door 
      meeting.  We see Kirsten out in the bullpen at her desk, and 
      the BOOM MIC GUY staring out at her, smitten.

                                    STUBECK
                    Nadia s not talking, but whoever 
                    snatched Billy sent us a video on 
                    his cell phone that s giving me the 
                    creeps.  Check this out.

      As Stubeck and Dashell huddle together to look at the video, 
        a DISHEVELED MAN shuffles over to Kirsten in the b.g.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                          (scrolling through pics)
                    Hang on...
                          (then)
                    Nope, that s the naked chicks...
                          (scrolling)
                    Celebrity Nip Slips... Man, Billy s 
                    got a lot of porn on this thing.
                          (then)
                    Okay, here we go.

      Stubeck starts the video, which shows several VAMPIRES 
      standing over a HOODED MAN, Al-Quaeda style.  As one of the 
      vampires reads a statement...

                                    DASHELL
                    You think that s really Billy?

                                    STUBECK
                    I dunno.  But I can t say it s not 
                    him, right?

      In the b.g., Kirsten helpfully points the Disheveled Man 
      somewhere, clearly thinking he s homeless, until... HE LUNGES 
      AT HER, MOUTH AGAPE.  RACK FOCUS on Kirsten and the ZOMBIE as 
      they tussle behind an oblivious Dashell and Stubeck.

                                    STUBECK (CONT D)
                          (re: video)
                    Here s where they tell me go to a 
                    warehouse off Balboa at ten minutes 
                    before sunrise -- unarmed, alone.

                                    DASHELL
                    Shit.  Then I guess that s what 
                    we re doing.

                                    STUBECK
                      Seriously?  No backup?                                                                                    18.


      Kirsten kicks the Zombie in the groin, backhands his face and 
      FLIPS HIM OVER HER BACK onto the floor (blocked by her desk).  
      Hearing a THWUMP, Stubeck and Dashell look up, see nothing 
      and resume talking.

                                    DASHELL
                    Well, did they say what happens if 
                    we bring backup?

                                    STUBECK
                          (dismissive shrug)
                    Yeah, they ll kill Billy.

                                    DASHELL
                    Then there you go.

                                    STUBECK
                    Yeah, but, they always say that.  
                    They have to say that.

                                    DASHELL
                    Doesn t mean they won t do it.

                                    STUBECK
                    I m not going in without backup.

                                    DASHELL
                    C mon, don t be a pussy.

                                    STUBECK
                          (in disbelief)
                     Don t be a p- 

      CRASH!!!  Kirsten has taken a PLANTER and SMASHED IT OVER THE 
      ZOMBIE S HEAD, sending a SPRAY OF BLOOD SPATTERING HER FACE.  
      Dashell and Stubeck look up and see only Kirsten standing 
      over the shattered planter.

                                    DASHELL
                    Fine, whatever, you ll have backup.

      Dashell raps on the glass and motions Kirsten to come in.  He 
      turns back to Stubeck as Kirsten SPITS on the zombie and 
      heads over.

                                    STUBECK
                    How s she working out?

                                    DASHELL
                    Eh.  I m not that impressed.


      The camera crew follows John-John and Carla as they enter 
      Wiggly s.  The place is a mess.  Boxes all over the floor, 
      donuts scattered everywhere, and the fluorescent lights are 
      flickering.  The zombie takes no notice of them and continues 
      to stumble around aimlessly. 

      John-John ignores the zombie and starts putting donuts in a 
      box.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Yeah, yeah.

                                  CARLA
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    What do you mean what the hell I m 
                    doing?  Uh, I m in a donut shop.  
                    You see all these lovely juicy 
                    donuts?  Chocolate twists and 
                      everything, I m getting a dozen. 

                                  CARLA
                    You can t wait?

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Uh, I don t think he s going 
                    anywhere.

      John-John points at the slow-moving zombie who is slowly 
      eating.

                                  CARLA
                    Fuck it, get me some coconut.  Dos.                                                                                     21.


                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Dos?

                                  CARLA
                    Uh-huh.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Okay, I feel ya.

      Carla keeps her gun drawn on the zombie as John-John gets the 
      donuts. 

                                  CARLA
                    Y know, you re not helping the cop 
                      stereotype with this donut shit.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Who cares?  It s the only 
                      stereotype worth living up to.

      Carla moves closer to the zombie.

                                  CARLA
                    Hey, look, John-John.  Big man 
                    still has a donut in his mouth. 

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Yo, that s not a donut, that s a 
                    hand.

      A sudden crash causes the camera to whirl around to catch the 
      Boom Guy accidently knock something off the counter.

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    Whoa, I am sorry.  My bad.  I 
                    didn t see-

        Unexpectedly from the back room a FAST MOVING ZOMBIE runs out 
      and grabs the Boom Guy by the shoulder. 

                                  BOOM MIC GUY (CONT D)
                    Ah!  Jesus!

      John-John runs behind the counter, pulls the zombie off the 
      Boom Guy and hits him in the head the bat. 

                                  CARLA
                    Jesus, John-John.

      She shoots the slow moving zombie in the head, sending a 
      spray of blood and brains across the donut shop.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    What?                                                                                    22.


                                  CARLA
                    You wanna check the back!?

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    Sound still speeding.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Shut the fuck up.  Be still.

      The boom guy gives an apologetic wave.

                                  JOHN-JOHN (CONT D)
                    No, I don t want to check the back, 
                    I wanna get a bear claw. 

                                  CARLA
                    Check the back.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Damn.

      John-John pulls out his gun.

                                  CARLA
                    Oh!  We re pulling our gun out I 
                    see.  I thought we liked it 
                    intimate. 

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Shit, fuck that.  You see how dark 
                    it is back there?  It s like the 
                    god damn black hole. 

      John-John walks towards the back-room.  He stops to kick the 
      dead zombie and then continues to the back with his 
      flashlight and gun drawn. 

      He shines his light around the darkened room and finds a pool 
      of red liquid.

                                  JOHN-JOHN (CONT D)
                    Oh, shit.

                                  CARLA
                    What happened?

      John-John looks above the pool to see an overturned bucket of 
      strawberry topping.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Nothing.                                                                                     23.


      He continues to survey the back room.  Revealed in the halo 
      of his flashlight are two snarling  FRESH  ZOMBIES eating a 
      body.  They re still dressed in their tattered, soiled aprons 
      and filthy paper hats.  One of them is missing his right 
      hand.  They notice John-John s light and rush at John-John, 
      who opens fire.  One of the zombies immediately jumps at 
      Carla.  Chaos breaks loose as the crew scatters, while the 
      camera tries to catch all the action.

      Carla fends off her zombie attacker.  They scuffle on the 
      floor.  She gets a good punch in before the zombie trips her 
      again.

      John-John punches the other zombie and hits it several times 
      in the head with the aluminum bat.

      Carla crawls away from the zombie and kicks him in the head.  
      The zombie recovers and lunges at her.  She does the splits 
      to avoid him.  He eventually gets Carla by the throat and 
      pins her against the wall.

      The other zombie lunges at John-John s neck.  John-John is 
      able to kill the zombie with the bat.

      Carla manages to kick her zombie attacker off and bashes his 
      head in with a fire extinguisher. 

      Both zombies are out and the Boom Guy is losing it. He stands 
      screaming.

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    Oh God!!!

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Whoa, shut up!

      John-John slaps the Boom Guy in the face.

                                  JOHN-JOHN (CONT D)
                    Shut the fuck up.

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    Alright.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    God, damn.  You re acting like a 
                    pussy. 

                                  CARLA
                    Calm down.

                                  JOHN JOHN
                    Shit, get some balls.                                                                                     24.


      The Boom Guy takes a breath and starts laughing. 

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    I mean, this fucking night. 

      Suddenly, a new zombie lunges out from the back room and 
      grabs the Boom guy s arm.  The zombie bites into his arm, 
      tearing the flesh off.

      Carla pins the zombie s head down on the counter and shoots 
      him spraying blood onto the counter and floor.

      The Boom Guy sits on the floor holding his gnawed arm.  Carla 
      and John-John stand over him inspecting his condition.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    Check this shit out.

                                  BOOM MIC GUY
                    What are you guys looking at?

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    You got bit, man.  Means you re 
                    done. 

      Carla pulls her gun and aims it at the Boom Guy.

                                  CARLA
                    Real done. 

                                  BOOM GUY
                    What are you guys talking about? 
                    I m your sound guy.

      John-John lowers Carla s gun with his left hand and picks up 
      his bat.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    It s the valley, man.  There s lots 
                    of sound guys.

      John-John winds up to take a swing.

      We hear the aluminum bat hit as everything goes to black.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      He pads down a dark hallway toward a shaft of light leaking 
      from under a closed door.  He reaches the door and is about 
      to knock when it s opened by a TALL, RAVEN-HAIRED VAMPIRE.  
      Stepping inside the dimly lit room, Stubeck sees two more 
      VAMPIRES, DARKLY ATTRACTIVE, lounging on overstuffed couches.

                                    VAMPIRE #1
                    You re punctual.  Our master will 
                      appreciate that.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      John-John and Carla are listening on HEADPHONES.

                                  CARLA
                    He s in.

                                  JOHN-JOHN
                    My man is gonna get this shit under 
                    control, you just watch.

                                                                            CUT TO:


                                    STUBECK
                    Where s Billy?

                                    VAMPIRE #2
                    Don t worry, our master will take 
                    you to him.

                                    STUBECK
                    Where s your master?  Enough 
                    jerking around -- I smell pot, 
                      incidentally, and I m not above 
                    busting every one of you unless 
                    someone has a valid prescription.                                                                                    26.


      VAMPIRE #1 nods at VAMPIRE #2, who takes Stubeck by the arm -- 
      Stubeck resists, then relents -- and walks him to another 
      door.

                                    VAMPIRE #2
                    He s expecting you.

      Vampire #2 opens the door.  Stubeck hesitates, then walks 
      inside the dark room as he hears the door shut behind him.  
      Suddenly, a LAMP flicks on, and a familiar-looking OLD MAN in 
      a club chair peers out at Stubeck.

                                    STUBECK
                          (a beat, in disbelief)

                                    STUBECK
                    What are you doing here?  Wait -- 
                    you re not the boss, are you?

                                  ABE VIGODA
                    Master.  But, y know, it s all the 
                    same crap.

                                  ABE VIGODA
                    What do you mean?  I grew up in 
                    Russia in the 1600 s, I ve been a 
                    vampire since clocks were invented.

                                  ABE VIGODA (CONT'D)
                    Not a Master, I mean, I started at 
                    the bottom like everyone else.  
                    Season 4 of Barney Miller I got 
                    very busy and I almost quit, but I 
                    kept up with it during hiatus and, 
                    knock wood, here I am, 360 years 
                    old and still able to go to work 
                    every day.

                                    STUBECK
                    Well, you look 80.  Tops.

                                  ABE VIGODA
                          (shrugs)
                    It s one of the perks.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Abe Vigoda s a vampire.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Look, I know why you re here, and 
                    to be honest I d like to go back to 
                    bed.  I don t sleep so well these 
                    days, I get up to pee three or four 
                    times a night, more if I ve been 
                    drinking blood.

                                    STUBECK
                    I want to see Billy.

                                  ABE VIGODA
                    I want you to quit killing my top 
                    people and start staying the hell 
                    out of my business.

                                    STUBECK
                    Not if your business is drugs and 
                      prostitution.

                                  ABE VIGODA
                    Then I guess we ll have to agree to 
                    disagree.

                                    STUBECK
                    I want to see Billy -- now.                                                                                    28.


                                  ABE VIGODA
                    You ll see Billy.  But first, could 
                    you get me a little nosh from the 
                    fridge?

      Abe Vigoda indicates a full-sized REFRIGERATOR along one 
      wall.

                                    STUBECK
                    What do you want?

                                  ABE VIGODA
                    Anything.  What s in there?

      Stubeck walks over to the refrigerator and opens the door.  
      He looks inside, and staring back at him is BILLY S SEVERED 
      HEAD ON A PLATE -- SKIN DRAINED OF COLOR, EYES WIDE OPEN.

      Stubeck is catatonic, speechless, then suddenly emits a LOUD, 
      WORDLESS WAIL AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      John-John and Carla rip the headphones off their ears.

                                  CARLA
                    Let s go.

      Carla jumps out of the car and races for the warehouse with 
      John-John on her heels.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Stubeck lowers his shoulder and BLOWS THE DOOR OFF ITS 
      HINGES, running past the Vampires and down the hall to the 
      outside.
