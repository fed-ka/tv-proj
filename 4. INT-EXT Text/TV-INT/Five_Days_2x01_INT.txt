    The BABY is now being carried along in his seat, down an 
      unidentifiable corridor. 

      A vague impression of a public place, and a few other people 
      walking purposefully. 


                                                                                  1                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




    The car belongs to driver LAURA  LAURIE  FRANKLIN, aged 36, 
      charging about the crowded car park in search of a place. Her 
      mother JENNIFER  JEN  MASON, 71, is panicking in the 
      passenger seat.

                                    JEN
                    We ll be late.

                                      LAURIE
                              (the hundredth time)
                    We won t be late!

                                    JEN
                    I told you but you never listen.

                                      LAURIE
                    Who are all these bloody people and 
                    why can t they just stay at home?



    The baby s CARER gets to an unidentified door and opens it, a 
    bit furtively. 

    One or two of the people walking down the corridor now come 
      into focus. They are NURSES and PATIENTS. We see enough now 
    to understand we are in a hospital.

      Nobody notices the CARER slipping inside with the BABY and 
      locking the door. 



      Still tight on that baby. Still inside his experience. 

    An unidentifiable hand straightens his clothes, and caresses 
    his face.

    The hand opens a window latch for fresh air.

    The sound of the lock turning, and then the door closing 
      quietly as the CARER departs.

      A beat. It s very quiet.

    For the first time, we come out of the baby s pov.We get a 
      proper look at his situation. 

    The BABY is plonkedin his buggy seat on the floor in a 
      corner of a public disabled toilet.

    He is all alone.

    It seems pretty scary now. Ordinary noises, sounding 
      strangely threatening. There s a tap dripping. The window is 
      open and creaking in the breeze. A distant emergency siren.

      A bit of a wriggle in the seat. And then a whimper, not quite 
      resolving into a weak cry.



      Staff and patients, coming and going along this long, long
      corridor, walking fast, passing the disabled loo and paying 
    it no attention.

      They clear to reveal a fortyishWest African cleaner, 
      DIEUDONNE DIDI  MPUTU.The only person here who is not in a 
      hurry, DIDI is tooling slowly along the corridor in the 
      distance. 

    His machine whirring and humming, DIDI is thinking of home.



      LAURIE and JEN are sitting on the train, which is still in 
    the commuter station and going nowhere. JEN has a notepadin 
      front of her. She is drawing a small circle on it.

                                      LAURIE
                    No, Mum, how many more times, you 
                    need to make it bigger.

                                    JEN
                    Stop going on at me.



                                                                                  5                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    JEN is carrying on with her small circle and now she is 
      putting a clockfaceon it.

                                      LAURIE
                    I m not, I m just saying... God, is 
                    this train ever going to leave?

                                      GERARD
                    It s the new timetable. They ve 
                    made a right mess of it. 

      GERARD HOPKIRKis a bright-eyed elderly gentleman, kittedout 
    for a serious country walk in boots and breeches and day sac. 

                                      GERARD (CONT D)
                    And last week I were stuck two 
                    hours cos of blooming thieves 
                    stripping out the copper wire.

    He is smiling at the women and clearly hoping to be drawn 
      into their conversation. 

                                      GERARD (CONT D)
                    It runs alongside the track. 

    Too much information. LAURIE blanks him.

                                      LAURIE
                    That s it, ten to two.

    JEN draws ten to two, but she thinks LAURIE is being rude, 
    and explains to GERARD:

                                    JEN
                    My daughter s been living down 
                    south.

                                      GERARD
                    Poor lass!

                                    JEN
                    Where are youfrom?

                                      GERARD
                    Wrong side of Pennines, me, can t 
                    you tell?

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum, concentrate please, just show 
                    ten to two, it s always ten to 
                    two... God.

      LAURIE checks her WATCH nervously.

    The train doors slam, to her great relief.



                                                                                  6                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      DIDI has cleaned his way all down the long corridor towards 
    the disabled loo.

    At first, DIDI doesn t hear the faint crying. He passes by 
    the door.



    As the train gathers speed, JEN is still going through her 
      paces under her breath. But she is getting nervous.

                                    JEN
                    Apple penny table. Apple penny 
                    table. Apple penny table. 



      A CAT suddenly jumps through the open window on to the window 
      ledge.



    The CAT lands near the baby. Too close.



    The cat peers into the crying baby s face and puts out a not 
      very nice paw.



      A faint cry from inside the loo.

      DIDI switches off his machine and stretches.

    The cry intensifies, just a little.

      Just when we think he s missed it, DIDI turns. Listens. 

      Looks up and down the silent corridor, which is now empty.

      Puts his ear to the door. Crying again.

      DIDI is not sure what to do; he doesn t want to intrude if 
      there is just a mother in there changing her baby. 

    His accent is French West African.

                                    DIDI
                    Madame?

    He looks up and down the corridor, hoping for advice.



      Cheery young conductor DANIEL  DANNY  PRESTON is making his 
    way down the train. He is just leaving a smartly dressed 
      black jobseeker, JAMAL MATTHEWS, 27.

                                    DANNY
                    Any more tickets please.



                                                                                  8                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE gets to her feet, reaching for her purse.



      DIDI knocks gently on the door.

                                    DIDI
                    Madame?



      Suddenly: a blow on the whistle, and the train brakes, 
      throwing LAURIE down the carriage.

      DANNY catches her before she falls. 

      A loud bang.

    In JAMAL s wondering point of view: something unidentifiable 
      flying past the window.

                                    JAMAL
                    We ve hit something.

      LAURIE looks up as she hears him.



    ... The baby now crying his head off.

                                    DIDI (O.C.)
                    Madame, I am coming in now. OK. 
                    Please don t be afraid. I am 
                    coming.

      Gently, he opens the door.

    The cat squeals past him and away.



      Quietly, calmly, with great tenderness, DIDI crouches down to 
    the BABY, undoing his straps. 

                                    DIDI
                    Tu es tombedu ciel, quoi?Maisou
                    es tamaman?Tu l asperdue, mon
                    petit? Tu l acacheequelquepart? 

    He lifts the child out into his arms. This is a man who knows 
      babies. 

                                    DIDI (CONT D)
                    Where is your Maman?



      DANNY has the cab to cab phone in his hand but the driver is 
    not answering.

                                    DANNY
                              (into phone)
                    Can you pick up? Pat, just pick it 
                    up, for God s sake.

      He s frantically pulling on a  High Vis  - the high 
      visibility vest train workers must wear if they might have to 
    go on the track.



      Everyone on the train is peering out of the windows and 
      trying to work out what s going on. 

                                      GERARD
                    We definitely haven t been 
                    derailed, because if we had of 
                    done, there dhave been gravel and 
                    all sorts flying past the window.

                                    JAMAL
                    Looks to me like we ran over 
                    someone.

      KIMBERLEY BRIGGS is a 16 year old girl shopper, out with her 
      friend ROWAN PORTER. Everyone now talks over each other.

                                    JEN
                    It might have been just something 
                    on the track.

                                      KIMBERLEY
                    Yew, what if we have run over 
                    someone.

                                      LAURIE
                    Shh, Mum, just let s get sat down.

                                      GERARD
                    More likely thieves, or vandals.

    Out of long habit, as LAURIE sits her mother in a new seat, 
    she inspects the other passengers: they include SOHEL
      HUSSAIN, a 29-year-oldAsian, who is describing the situation 
      into a mobile phone in muttered Punjabi.


                                                                                11                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    JAMAL
                    How long we going to be stuck here?

                                    ROWAN
                              (into her phone)
                    It s me, guess what, we ve run over 
                    someone. No, no on the train.

    She carries on talking excited gibberish to her Mum in the 
      background, while we stay with the other characters.

                                      GERARD
                              (enjoying himself)
                    The rules say they ve got ninety 
                    minutes now to get the train 
                    rolling again.

                                    JAMAL
                              (appalled)
                    Ninety minutes! I ve got a job 
                    interview.

                                    JEN
                              (of the girl shopper)
                    Does she have to shout?

                                    ROWAN
                    I m talking to my Mum!

      Ticket collector DANNY comes out of the back cabin.

                                    JAMAL
                    Can you open the doors?

                                      GERARD (B/G)
                              (annoyed)
                    Of course he can t open the doors. 
                    There are trains out there!

    On DANNY s face, set and white and anxious as he walks 
      through the crowd. We are moving into his POVand will stay 
      there for the rest of the sequence. 

                                    JAMAL
                    Next station s only round that 
                    corner. I could walk from here. 
                    Catch a bus.

                                      KIMBERLEY 
                    I ll come with you.

                                    JEN
                              (stage whisper)
                    In those shoes?




                                                                                12                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                              (amused)
                    Keep your nose out, Mum.

    The chat moves into the b/g as we leave the scene with DANNY.



      DANNY moves from bright day to relative darkness, as he 
      enters the forward part of the train under the bridge.

    The TROLLEY GUY is there, picking up some of his wares which 
      fell off the trolley during the emergency stop.

                                    DANNY
                    Run up and down for me, do a free 
                    issue.

    He keeps going forward, making for the driver s cabin.

    We hear the TROLLEY GUY arrive at the bright end of the 
      train, and everyone cheer up.

                                    JEN (O.C.)
                    Oohyes please, I d love a cup of 
                    coffee.

    But by now we have reached the door to the driver s cab with 
      DANNY. He knocks on it, quite gently.

                                    DANNY
                    It s me, Danny. Let me in mate. Let 
                    me in.

      A long beat, and the door opens.



      DANNY enters the driver s cab and shuts the door behind him. 
    The driver is PATRICK  PAT  DOWLING, early fifties.

                                    DANNY
                    First off I thought someone had 
                    managed to lock themselves in that 
                    bloody loo again and pulled the 
                    passcom.

    PAT can t speak. He clings to the controls. DANNY talks too 
      fast, too much, filling the space.

                                    DANNY (CONT D)
                    I looked out of the window but the 
                    warning light weren t on so I knew 
                    that weren t it and that s when I 
                    saw them. Bloody kids.


                                                                                13                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    PAT
                    She looked straight at me.

      DANNY, shocked into silence, now realizing they have hit 
      someone. PAT is shivering now. 

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    She had her arms out like this. 
                    Like this.

    But he can t take his hands from the controls. His hands are 
      rigid and white and he can t move. DANNY touches his arm.

                                    DANNY
                    It s all right, mate. 

      Poor PAT just starts trembling and crying. 

                                    PAT
                    I can t move.

                                    DANNY
                    I ll do it.

                                    PAT
                    She chose me. 

      DANNY reaches across him to a big red emergency button and 
      presses it importantly.

                                    DANNY (INTO PHONE)
                    Hello? Hello? Control? Can you hear 
                    me? I m the conductor on 101275 and 
                    we ve struck a member of the 
                    public. 

    PAT starts to laugh.

                                    PAT
                    I only came in for the overtime.



      DANNY comes storming back down the train and meets the 
      TROLLEY GUY sorting himself out. 

    He shows DANNY his takings, grinning.

                                    DANNY
                              (whisper)
                    I said freeissue, you tosspot.

    The TROLLEY GUY s face falls, as DANNY storms onwards. 

      LAURIE is at a window with GERARD.



                                                                                14                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      GERARD
                    I d expect to see that signal on 
                    red by now. 



      GERARD looking very satisfied with himself.

                                      GERARD
                    They ve an emergency button in the 
                    driver s cab.

      LAURIE is looking at him quizzically, wondering how he knows 
    so much train stuff. He grins, enjoying her interest.

                                    DANNY
                    I m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, 
                    I m still not sure what s happened 
                    here, but I don t think we ll be 
                    moving for a while yet.

                                    JAMAL
                    Oh man.

                                    DANNY
                    Can I just ask if we ve got any 
                     competent person  here? 

      It s a technical term - all look blank, and a bit insulted. 

                                    DANNY (CONT D)
                    I just mean, anyone who works for 
                    the railways?

      No-one. DANNY sighs. It was a long shot. Then, reluctantly:

                                      LAURIE
                    I m a police officer.

      Everyone looks amazed, pleased, or anxious. DANNY looks 
      really relieved.

                                    JEN
                    It s her day off! Oh, honestly.

      LAURIE gets up to go with DANNY, who is heading for the back 
      cab. DANNY speaks very quietly.

                                    DANNY
                    We ve had a person under our train.



                                                                                15                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    Right. What do you want me to do?

                                    DANNY
                    Can you just give me a minute.

    To her great surprise, DANNY goes in and closes the door 
      behind him.



      DANNY urgently fiddling in the pockets of his jacket. He 
      finds his mobile phone and switches it on, cursing the couple 
    of seconds  delay as it organizes itself. As soon as it 
      works, he tries to ring.

      He s got hardly any signal and not much battery. Just 
      splutter and interference from the other end.

                                    DANNY
                    It s me. I m sorry, I m not going 
                    to make it. Oh God, can you hear 
                    me? I m really sorry, Nuss, really 
                    reallysorry, I ll get there as 
                    soon as I can...

    The cab to cab phone buzzes and he picks up, instantly calm.

                                    DANNY (CONT D)
                    Yes, Pat.

                                    PAT (OUT OF PHONE)
                    Ambulance, need to ring the 
                    ambulance...

                                    DANNY
                    Control will sort it all out.

                                    PAT (OUT OF PHONE)
                    It s so dark.

      DANNY rests his head against the wall of the cabin and takes 
      a deep breath.



      DANNY comes back out of the cab to rejoin LAURIE. He s calm 
    now and in control, buttoning up his High Vis vest, clearly 
      proposing to get out of the train.

                                      LAURIE
                    You re not going on the track?




                                                                                16                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    DANNY
                    Signal s on red, so he s right, is 
                    Pat, it s quite safe.

                                      LAURIE
                    Yes, but...

                                    DANNY
                    He s scared she s still alive out 
                    there.

      They both know there is no hope of that.

                                      LAURIE
                    I m Laurie.

                                    DANNY
                    Danny. You know you re going to get 
                    a jumper one day. You train for it, 
                    but...

      LAURIE indicates the driver s cab.

                                      LAURIE
                    I ll sit with him.

                                    DANNY
                    Member of the public, you re not 
                    allowed in the cab...
                              (giving in)
                    Yeah, OK. Thanks.  

                                      LAURIE
                    You put that old trainspotterin 
                    charge of keeping my Mum happy. And 
                    Danny... no need to go closer than 
                    you have to.

    He grins briefly and walks away.

      LAURIE watches him reach GERARD, have a quick word, then 
      reach up with his key and unlock the door. 

                                      KIMBERLEY
                    Where do you think you re going?

      DANNY jumps out of the train and locks the door behind him.

                                    JAMAL
                    One law for him and another one for 
                    the rest of us. 


      SCENE DELETED4040




                                                                                17                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      LAURIE enters the cab and shuts the door quietly behind her. 

    She finds PAT fumbling to light a cigarette. She clocks the 
    No Smoking sign.

                                    PAT
                    Yeah, smoking kills.

    He puts his cigsand matches down. LAURIE picks them up. A 
      beat, and then she lights two and offers one to him.

    He takes the cigarette off her and draws.

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    I don t want to talk about it, all 
                    right.

                                      LAURIE
                    All right.

    In silence, they sit there for a beat and stare into the dark 
      tunnel. 

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Just don t tell my mother you 
                    caught me smoking.

      Despite himself, PAT laughs. 

                                    PAT
                    Supposed to be my day off.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mine too.Your first time, Pat?

                                    PAT
                    Yeah.

      Loud banging on the door ends the moment.

                                    JAMAL (O.C.)
                    Nobody s telling us anything out 
                    here!



      LAURIE opens the door to see furious JAMAL stood there.


                                                                                18                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    JAMAL
                    I miss this job because your 
                    train s late and I m going to sue. 
                    You want to tell him in there to 
                    get on to his governors and get 
                    this train moving. You want to tell 
                    him to open the bloody doors.

                                      LAURIE
                    I don t want to do any of those 
                    things. Please go and sit down, 
                    sir.

      JAMAL tries to peer inside the cab, and LAURIE tries to fill 
    the space in the doorway without actually pushing him.

                                    JAMAL
                              (to Pat)
                    There s people on here getting in a 
                    right panic. That old lady s 
                    claustrophobic.

                                      LAURIE
                    That old lady is my mother and 
                    she s nothing of the kind. Please 
                    go and sit down and stop winding 
                    the other passengers up.

    She does almost push him now, to his delight.

                                    JAMAL
                    That s assault, that is. What s 
                    your number? Go on, give me your 
                    number.

                                      LAURIE
                    DC Laurie Franklin 100893. 
                    Complaints phone number is 0845 
                    935276. Be my guest. 

    She slams the door on him.



      GERARD and JEN bonding in moral superiority against the other 
      passengers, most of whom are ranting into their mobiles, 
      drumming their fingers, trying to get some shuteye.

                                    JEN
                    The older you get, the less time 
                    you have left, the more of it you 
                    spend hanging around waiting for 
                    God knows what. 

      GERARD smiles at her, a bit sadly. He understands.

                                      GERARD
                    Draw some more of your clocks. 
                    Passes the time.

    JEN giggles. Then whispers:

                                    JEN
                    See that lad over there?

    She means SOHEL, sitting with his rucksack on his knee.

                                      GERARD
                    What about him?

                                    JEN
                    Do you think he s a terrorist?

      SOHELsees them watching, and though he didn t look furtive 
      before, he does now, under their scrutiny.

                                      GERARD
                              (giggling)
                    Shhhh!



    PAT is crying. LAURIE sits and waits for him to stop. In a 
      bit, he subsides and blows his nose.


                                                                                20                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    I don t suppose the thought of you
                    ever crossed her mind, Pat. She 
                    just saw a train. She thought - 
                    escape. She didn t think, there s 
                    someone looking out of that window 
                    who doesn t deserve this.

      A beat. PAT dries his eyes.

                                    PAT
                    I was three miles out of Castlebury
                    and had just passed the signal on 
                    green... 

                                      LAURIE
                    Save it, Pat. British Transport 
                    Police will be here soon.

      PAT, agitated, desperate to talk about it.

                                    PAT
                    They re always bloody hours.

                                      LAURIE
                    You don t want to go through it all 
                    twice. 

                                    PAT
                              (dogged)
                    I was three miles out of Castlebury 
                    and had just passed the signal on 
                    green. 

      Reluctantly, LAURIE gets her pocketbook out of her bag, and 
      starts to take notes.

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    I was taking power when I saw her 
                    looking down at me. She stood on 
                    the bridge and she looked into my 
                    cabin and then all of a sudden she 
                    was jumped up on the bridge and on 
                    her way down. Arms out like this, 
                    like wings flapping. And she fell 
                    and her eyes were wide open. She 
                    fell right into the path of my 
                    train. 



      LAURIE and PAT.

                                    PAT
                    I thought, she s going to come 
                    right into the cab, she s going to 
                    smash right through the window and 
                    land right on me... 
                              (beat)
                    She were a looker, too, under all 
                    that bloody black sheeting they 
                    wear.

      LAURIE s face - what?



    The West African cleaner DIDI stands in a corner looking a 
    bit nervous and aggrieved, as medical and nursing staff 
      bustle about unpickingthe baby s clothes and sticking 
      thermometers in him and so on. Among them, a young senior 
      registrar from Iraq, DR ADELHAYDAR, and a nursing sister, 
      SIOBHANDOOLE.

    In the foreground, a bossy young woman social worker, COLETTE 
       COLLY  TRENT, black or mixed race with a Caribbean 
      background.

                                    COLLY
                              (into the phone)
                    We ve acquired a baby down here in 
                    A&E who s lost his mother. Can 
                    you...? Thanks, yeah.
                              (tothe nurses)
                    Maternity unit are checking now if 
                    any of their mothers and babies 
                    have parted company. In the 
                      meantime...

                                    DIDI
                                (interrupting)
                    Not that way. You hurt him.



                                                                                22                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    All look dischuffedat this intervention from a cleaner, and 
      gimlet eyes stare at him.

                                    COLLY
                    They re nurses. They do know what 
                    they re doing.

      COLLY can see he is genuinely concerned, and her face 
      softens. She tries to jolly him out of it.

                                    COLLY (CONT D)
                    When I was a few days old, my 
                    mother left me outside the baker s 
                    shop. Half an hour before she 
                    realized. 

                                    DIDI
                              (stony)
                    The lady who abandoned this baby 
                    did not make a mistake.

                                    COLLY
                    She made sure to leave him 
                    somewhere he would be found by kind 
                    people. 

                                    DIDI
                    She did a terrible thing. For who 
                    will be his mother now?

                                    COLLY
                    That llbe social services. Or to 
                    put it another way, me. Oh don t 
                    look so worried! I ll get him a 
                    proper foster mother who knows 
                    which end is up.

      DIDIis not amused and is beginning to look a bit upset.

                                    COLLY (CONT D)
                    What s your name, flower?

                                    DIDI
                    DieudonneMputu.

      COLLY looks a bit stricken, and tries not to laugh.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    The police are here.

      COLLY looks - a pretty uniformed policewoman who looks about 
    12 stands a little way off. PC NATALIE CRYER is actually 
      pushing 30. She is asking directions from another nurse. 

                                    COLLY
                    Babies, babies, everywhere.



                                                                                23                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    She hurries off to greet PC CRYER in the b/g.

    At the sight of the uniform, DIDIshrinks into a corner, but 
    his voice is urgent now.

                                    DIDI
                    Why is she laughing at me?

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    Well, Doody whatever your name 
                    is... 

                                    DIDI
                      DieudonneMputu.You can call me 
                    Didi.

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    OK, Didi. With abandoned babies, 
                    sometimes they like to name him 
                    after the person who found him. And 
                    your name... well. Bit of a 
                    mouthful.

                                    DIDI
                    My brother is called Michael.

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    Michael. Nice. 

      DIDI stands there and suddenly he is all smiles.

                                    DIDI
                    Michael.

    He gazes down at baby MICHAEL, beaming. 

      COLLY and PC CRYER come back in.

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    Didihas a brother called Michael.

    She turns to smile at DIDI, but he has melted away.

      COLLY looks down at the baby, and accepts.

                                    COLLY
                    Hello, Michael.



    The passengers are sitting in sullen heaps now, asleep, or 
      eyes shut anyway, locked behind their I-pods or Sudokusor 
      textingaway on their mobiles.

    The only ones talking are GERARD and JEN, sitting together, 
    all friends. 


                                                                                24                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      GERARD is fanning her with his ordnance survey map. It is 
      very hot in the train now, and she is visibly wilting.

                                    JEN
                    She has me practising every time we 
                    go. She reckons they always ask the 
                    same question. I can t remember if 
                    they do or not! 
                              (beat)
                    Oh dear. It s awfully hot in here, 
                    awfully hot.
                              (aboutthe trolley guy)
                    Has he got a bottle of water on 
                    there?

                                      GERARD
                    All I can see is two cans of 
                    Stella.

                                    JEN
                    I really think I need to get out of 
                    this train. 

    She is starting rather quietly to move into a panic attack; 
      pale and sweaty and sad rather than loud and annoying.

                                      JEN(CONT D)
                    I really think...

    She throws up - not much, just a possetreally, but enough to 
      upset everyone. GERARD just about manages to dodge it. 

                                    JAMAL
                    Right, that s it. I m getting off 
                    this train.

                                    ROWAN
                              (sneering)
                    What you going to do, storm the 
                    doors? 

                                      KIMBERLEY
                              (admiring)
                    Cool!

    At this moment, DANNY arrives back and lets himself in. 

      A very determined look on the faces of all his passengers.

      But, surprisingly, it s SOHELwho launches himself at DANNY.



      LAURIE charges down the carriage, to find a melee by the door 
    as passengers queue up to get out of the train.

                                      LAURIE
                    What do you think you re doing?

                                    JAMAL
                    What does it bloody look like? 
                    Unlawful imprisonment, this is.

      JAMAL jumps.

                                      KIMBERLEY
                    Wait for me!

    Now KIMBERLEY jumps, to ROWAN s alarm. 

                                    ROWAN
                    Kimberley, no!

      LAURIE appears in the doorway to find JAMAL helping KIMBERLEY 
    up. And here s DANNY, pulling himself to his feet, winded and 
      nursing his pride.

                                      LAURIE
                    What happened to you?

                                    DANNY
                    Pushed me out of bloody carriage.

    He indicates SOHEL, now some way off. JAMAL walks away too.

                                      KIMBERLEY
                              (to Rowan)
                    Come on!

    So ROWAN jumps out too, and the girls set off after him.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum, I m going to have to get off 
                    the train, it s armageddonout 
                    there.

                                    JEN
                    Don t be long.



                                                                                26                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE climbs out of the train to join DANNY.

                                    DANNY
                    You got any idea how many forms I m 
                    going to have to fill in after this 
                    adventure...

                                      LAURIE
                    I m a police officer. Filling in 
                    forms is what I do. 

      Behind her, GERARD has climbed out and is holding up his arms 
    to JEN.

                                      GERARD
                    Come on, love, I ll catch you.

                                      LAURIE
                    You will not! 

                                    JEN
                    I don t mind him catching me.

                                      LAURIE
                    You re staying on that train!
                              (toGerard)
                    You came out to go walking, right? 
                    So off you go. Ten miles in those 
                    boots by teatime. 

      GERARD walks away, glowering.

    It is at this point that the British Transport Police walk 
    up, and find LAURIE apparently leading a passenger revolt.

    The officers are both uniformed men: SGT DON PARKER, 40s, and 
      andPC PAUL TAIT, small and thin, in his mid 20s.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    What the hell is going on here? Get 
                    those people back on the train.

                                      LAURIE
                    I did my best, but they ve all got 
                    places they d rather be, sarge.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    I d rather be in Lanzarotemyself 
                    but I ve got a job to do.

                                      LAURIE
                    Since it s clearly a suicide...

                                    SGT PARKER
                    I don t think that s for you to 
                    judge, is it.



                                                                                27                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE shows her warrant card, and he peers at the name.

                                      LAURIE
                    DC Laura Franklin. The driver says 
                    she threw herself off that bridge 
                    with open arms...

                                    DANNY
                    Those two lads I saw on the track, 
                    they must have seen her.

                                      LAURIE
                    Witnesses, good.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    OK, Miss Franklin, I should say 
                    that s quite enough of you for now, 
                    so why don t you get your tanks off 
                    my lawn and think about what you ll 
                    say to your gaffer when you get a 
                    tug tomorrow for unauthorized 
                    evacuation of a train. 
                              (toPc Tait)
                    Shove this numptyand her mates in 
                    a corner and glower the buggery out 
                    of the lot of them. Where is my 
                    driver?

    He marches off towards PAT. DANNY gives LAURIE a look - 
      aren t you going to stand up to those cheeky gits?

                                      LAURIE
                              (dismissive)
                    Railway bill.

    But when he smiles and turns away, she checks her watch again 
    and despairs. 



      COLLY and PC CRYER are sitting together, winding up their 
      formal multi-agency meeting to plan their response to the 
      day s events. PC CRYER is shoving paperwork into a briefcase, 
    and COLLY hanging on the phone to the fostering service. The 
      atmosphere is urgent but professional.

                                    PC CRYER 
                    If I get off now I can get an 
                    appeal out by dinnertime...

                                    COLLY
                    Asking her to come forward...

                                    PC CRYER
                    ... as she may be in need of 
                    medical attention etc.


                                                                                28                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    COLLY
                    OK.
                              (into phone)
                    Using our powers under the Children 
                    Act, yeah.
                              (to PC Cryer)
                    Catch up with you later.
                              (intophone)
                    Great, I ll try her first then.

    PC CRYER leaves as COLLY ends the call.

                                    COLLY (CONT D)
                    Fostering service have given me 
                    some numbers.
                              (toSister Doole)
                    Everyone on the ward does know, 
                    don t they, that he isn t to be 
                    released? Whoever turns up, even if 
                    she claims to be the mother, he s 
                    in our care and he s not going 
                    anywhere?

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                              (cheerful)
                    It ll be like Fort Knox in here. 



    As COLLY hurries down the corridor, DIDI is holding forth in 
    his shy way to a little group of his admiring cleaner 
      colleagues, including MAUREEN HARDY, early 40s.

                                    DIDI
                    It was just good luck for me, I 
                    turned my machine off, and I heard 
                    a little cry, and I pushed the 
                    door, and there he was.

    He pushes the door open, and all peer in.

      COLLY passes, smiling, thinking  famous for 15 minutes .

                                    DIDI (CONT D)
                    Colly! Can my friends go to see 
                    Michael?

                                    COLLY
                    You can ask, but I don t think 
                    they re going to want tourists.

    She sails on, watched in a faintly hostile manner by MAUREEN.

                                    MAUREEN
                    I wonder what his real name is.



                                                                                29                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    DIDI
                              (firm)
                    His real name is Michael. After my 
                    brother.



    We are in the cab with PAT as he drives the train on to its 
      destination.

    He exits the gloom of a bridge and bright light suddenly 
      bathes his face. He closes his eyes with relief.

      LAURIE and JEN in the back of IBRA s taxi, DANNY in the front 
      passenger seat.

                                      LAURIE
                    It s really kind of you.

                                    IBRA
                    It s on our way, pretty much.

                                      LAURIE
                    It s just if you re in a hurry...

                                    DANNY
                    It s fine, really.

    He is checking his watch. It s not really fine.


                                                                                32                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    IBRA
                    You ve got no chance anyway, now.

      A beat, and DANNY relaxes, and smiles. He is trying to agree 
      it s fine after all.

                                    JEN
                    Very nice having your own personal 
                    taxi driver.

                                    DANNY
                    Except for the earache. Never stops 
                    talking, this one.

                                    IBRA
                    Just sociable. Might as well be 
                    friendly as not, isn t it?

      IBRA is a bright, cheerful Pakistani in his 40s, who came to 
      this country as a small child. He drives fast and likes to 
      chat. 

                                    JEN
                    Where are you from then?

                                      LAURIE
                    Oh, I m sorry, she asks everyone.

                                    IBRA
                    No problem. I m from Skipton.

    He laughs. And then catches LAURIE s eye in his mirror.

                                      LAURIE
                    Her appointment was supposed to be 
                    12o clock.

                                    IBRA
                    In a hurry, yeah? Join the club! 
                    Look at this traffic, mad innit.
                    Where they all going, all these 
                    people? 

                                    JEN
                    We were on the train before.

                                    IBRA
                    Rubbish trains, taxis better!

                                    DANNY
                    Careful!

    The men giggle. JENperseveres.

                                    JEN
                    A girl went under our train. Killed 
                    herself. On purpose. 


                                                                                33                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      IBRA s face in the mirror, smiling indulgently.

                                    IBRA
                    That s right, love. That s why 
                    Danny boy called me out.

                                    JEN
                    She was one of yourgirls.

      IBRA s face, no longer smiling.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum...

                                    IBRA
                    An Asian girl?
                              (to Danny)
                    You never said.

                                    JEN
                    You might know her.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum, just because she was Asian... 

                                    IBRA
                    No, your Mum s right, if she were 
                    from round here I probably do know 
                    her. Know everybody, me.

    He laughs. And then catches LAURIE s eye in his mirror.

                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    Sad world innit, love, sometimes.
                              (beat)
                    It s against our religion, you 
                    know.

                                    DANNY
                    Suicide? You could have fooled me.

      A beat. And IBRA laughs.

                                    IBRA
                    See the respect my son-in-law shows 
                    me. 

    But they are both laughing, the best of friends really.

                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    Everybody doing wishful thinking, 
                      innit.We ve got lads think all you 
                    got to do is grow a long beard and 
                    tie a bloody scarf round your 
                    bloody head and that makes you a 
                    Muslim.

                                                                                34                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009


                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    And we ve got politicians think all 
                    they got to do is shout louder. 

                                    DANNY
                    You ve sent him off on one now!

                                      LAURIE
                              (ignoring Danny)
                    And what do youthink?

      A beat, and IBRA is now serious.

                                    IBRA
                    I think you can t just do what you 
                    like with the body God gave you.

    JEN is starting to look a bit green.

                                    JEN
                    Are we nearly there?

                                      LAURIE
                    You re not going to...

                                    JEN
                    I ll be all right! Ooh, you do 
                    fuss.



      LAURIE crashes through a door into a corridor, dragging JEN 
      behind her. 

    She sees a PORTER pushing an empty wheelchair. She 
      commandeers it.

                                      LAURIE
                    Just for a minute.

      LAURIE flashes her warrant card and sits JEN down in the 
      wheelchair.

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Police.

    She runs off, pushing the chair with JEN in it.

                                    JEN
                    Naughty!

      LAURIE laughs. Wheeeee!She balances on the wheelchair, as 
    JEN giggles and screams.

      They pass the disabled toilet.

    As they round a corner they fly straight into MAUREEN, the 
      cleaner. They knock her bucket flying.

                                      LAURIE
                    Oops! 

                                    MAUREEN
                    You could kill someone!

                                      LAURIE
                    Sorry!




                                                                                36                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    MAUREEN
                    I ll give you sorry, what about 
                    this mess!

      MAUREEN is upset - a bit more upset than is warranted. She 
      looks close to tears as she surveys the water everywhere.













































                                                                              36A                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE and JEN sail on regardless. Euphoria, adrenaline, as 
      they approach a set of double flapping doors.

                                      LAURIE
                    Words!



      LAURIE, JEN and wheelchair crash through flapping doors into 
      a covered walkway.

                                    JEN
                    Apple penny table!

      They crash through a door marked Geriatric Medicine.



      LAURIE and JEN simmer right down as soon as they reach the 
      clinic which they have been trying to get to all day. They 
      have still got the giggles, but are trying to control it.

      LAURIE sees the clock on the wall reads 13.53.

    The reception room is empty. Chairs, empty. Piles of 
      magazines, neat.

    The glass partition is shut.

                                    JEN
                    Oh no. They ve gone.

                                      LAURIE
                    No chance. They re facing the full 
                    might of The Law!

    JEN giggles, as LAURIE calms herself and bangs on the glass. 
      Turns, still giggling, and tries to send her mother an 
      encouraging look.

      After a moment, the glass opens.

                                      CLINIC NURSE
                    Can I help you?

                                      LAURIE
                    Mrs Mason. Jennifer Mason. She s 
                    here for the memory clinic. I know 
                    we re really late, but God, if you 
                    had any idea what our journey s 
                    been like...





                                                                                37                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      CLINIC NURSE
                    Oh, clinic s been cancelled. All 
                    the appointments rescheduled. We 
                    did write to you. 

      A beat. We will be expecting LAURIE to lose her rag. We see 
    her beat it down.

                                      LAURIE
                    I ve come a very long way and I 
                    need my Mum to see a doctor.

                                    NURSE
                    As I say, we did write to you...

                                      LAURIE
                    You deal with patients like this 
                    all the time and I imagine you have 
                    a good idea how well they cope with 
                    random envelopes.

                                    JEN
                              (helpfully)
                    Apple penny table.

      They both look at her, aghast.

                                      CLINIC NURSE
                    Have you been rehearsing her?

                                    JEN
                    I practise all the time, don t I, 
                    Laurie? I want to get it right.
                              (beat)
                    What s the matter?

      LAURIE can see the CLINIC NURSE is very cross now. LAURIE 
      loses it.

                                      LAURIE
                    If you don t want us to cheat, you 
                    could try changing the bloody 
                    questions once in a while. It s not 
                    her fault, is it, if your stupid 
                    rules mean she has to keep on 
                    passing the same bloody test to 
                    prove she s worth you even 
                    bothering to bloody treat her. 
                              (beat)
                    Oh, God, you want me to beg you? 
                    Have you got a mother, nurse?

      A noise behind her, and LAURIE and the CLINIC NURSE both look 
    at JEN.

    JEN is having a seizure.



                                                                                38                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      Baby MICHAEL, safe and happy in his cot.

    All around him, the people who have been looking out for him. 
      COLLY, SISTER DOOLE, DR HAYDAR, PC CRYER. 

    And now NICK, his new foster father, reaches down into the 
    cot and picks MICHAEL up to cuddle.

                                    NICK
                    Hey, mister. What are we going to 
                    do with you, eh?Come here, that s 
                    it.

      NICK settles down into a chair, and SISTER DOOLE gives him 
    the bottle. He feeds the baby.

      Everyone looks soppy and says  aah . 

                                    COLLY
                    His mother will still have had all 
                    on, concealing her pregnancy. 

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    We don t knowthat she concealed 
                    it.

                                    COLLY
                    No, but usually... Listen to me, 
                    what s with the  usually , I ve 
                    never had one of these before!

    In the background, an NS NURSE comes to fetch DR HAYDAR quite 
      urgently away to deal with Jen, and he exits.

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    She ll come back for him, surely.

      Baby MICHAEL snuffles away.

      NICK looks up at COLLY, smiling.

                                    NICK
                    I m kind of hoping she doesn t!

      It s only a joke, and COLLY smiles. 


      OMITTED6969



      A man s pub, with a big TV screen for the sport.

    The train driver PAT enters and pushes his way to the bar.

                                    PAT
                    Pint of best. 

    The BARMAID starts pulling. 


                                                                                41                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    And a whiskey chaser.

    Now PAT speaks to her and to nobody in particular.

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    It s my day off.



    DR HAYDAR and the NS NURSE enter a cubicle to find JEN on the 
    bed looking bedraggled, and LAURIE sitting beside her.

                                    JEN
                    I m all right, really I am, and I d 
                    like to go home if it s all the 
                    same to you.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    We ll just have a little look at 
                    you first, if we may. Is that OK?

    JEN looks at LAURIE for confirmation. Wearily, she nods.

                                    JEN
                    Apple, penny...

                                      LAURIE
                    No need for that now, Mum.



      LAURIE, waiting alone outside the cubicle. Impatient, 
      frustrated.

    DR HAYDAR comes out.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    This medication your mother has 
                    been taking...

                                      LAURIE
                    Look, I know, maybe it was wrong to 
                    coach her, but if you had seen the 
                    way she was before, the confusion, 
                    the tears... 

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    Perhaps nobody went through the 
                    reported side-effects with you?

      LAURIE is silenced for a beat. Then a little laugh as she 
      realizes she already knows the answer.



                                                                                42                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    Dizziness? Nausea? 

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    And fits, yes, I m afraid so. Only 
                    in a minority of patients, but...

      LAURIE doesn t know where to put herself.

                                      LAURIE
                    She can t be in the car more than 
                    ten minutes or she s sick. That s 
                    why we had to come on the stupid 
                    train.
                              (beat)
                    Will she have to come off it? Cos 
                    it s given her back to me, you 
                    know. Given her back to herself.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    We need to have a good look at her. 
                    I d like to keep her in, if I can 
                    find her a bed.

      LAURIE bites back tears.

                                      LAURIE
                    Square one. Square bloody one.



      PAT, still in the pub, alone, brooding.



      LAURIE sits by her mother JEN, who is asleep on a trolley in 
    the corridor. SISTER DOOLE passes.

                                      LAURIE
                    No sign of that bed yet?

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    I m sorry. We re all counting the 
                    days till they open the new wing.











                                                                              43A                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    My Mum s going to be on this 
                    trolley all night, isn t she?

      SISTER DOOLE looks non-committal.

      LAURIE waits there, bored and hungry. Then, checking her 
      mother really is asleep, she goes looking for coffee.



      DANNY sits at the table, supposedly filling in forms, *
      actually staring into space. IBRA walks in and sits in a *
      chair to read the newspaper.*

                                      DANNY*
                    Chain of care, they call it. *
                    Someone from human resources brings *
                    you a cup of tea and you get a bit *
                    of stroking and a chocolate *
                    biscuit.*
                              (little laugh)*
                    And in return you get a bucket load *
                    of forms to drown yourself in.*

                                    IBRA*
                    Good to get it done tonight. Then *
                    you don t have to think about it *
                    any more.*

      IBRA goes back to his newspaper and DANNY thinks about it, *
    but doesn t believe it.*

                                      DANNY*
                    Yeah. Hope so.*

                                    IBRA*
                    Same in any job, Danny. Go mad if *
                    you dwell on the bad stuff.*



      LAURIE clocks a coffee machine and walks towards it. 

      NICK is there, sorting through his pockets for change.

                                    NICK
                    Haven t got any change, have you? 

    She scrabbles in her purse.

                                      LAURIE
                    I haven t got enough change for 
                    either of us.



                                                                                44                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      Suddenly, in front of this stranger, she gets tearful.

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Ignore me. Bloody long day 
                    wrangling my mother up hill and 
                    down dale. 

                                    NICK
                    Hard work being a carer.

                                      LAURIE
                    Oh it s not full time. She s still 
                    pretty independent, thank god. 
                      Physically, anyway. It s just I m 
                    not very good at it. I get so 
                    snappy with her, and she doesn t 
                    deserve it.

                                    NICK
                    Live on her own does she?

                                      LAURIE
                    She lives with me! Or I live with 
                    her. It was supposed to be 
                    temporary, just till I got her back 
                    on her feet, I mean my life s down 
                    south now, but... Sorry. What am I 
                    like? Ranting on. Are you here 
                    looking after someone?

                                    NICK
                    A little baby.

                                      LAURIE
                    I m so sorry.

                                    NICK
                    Oh, no, wrong idea, nothing wrong 
                    with him. Apart from his mother 
                    abandoned him. 
















                                                                              44A                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    NICK (CONT D)
                    Left him in the disabled loo in 
                    here this morning. 

      NICK smiles wearily and turns to walk away.

                                    NICK (CONT D)
                    Takes all sorts.

      LAURIE thinks about it and stops him.

                                      LAURIE
                    Not Asian, is he, your baby?



      Baby MICHAEL lies there asleep, wearing the bright green 
      outfit COLLY bought him earlier. Around him, LAURIE, NICK, DR 
      HAYDAR, SISTER DOOLE, PC CRYER.

                                    NICK
                    He s not been circumcised.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    Too young. Seven days is more 
                    normal. That s assuming he comes 
                    from a Muslim family.

                                      LAURIE
                                (disappointed)
                    Maybe I m barking up the wrong 
                    tree. Now I m looking at him he 
                    does look pretty white.

      During DR HAYDAR s next speech, COLLY bustles in.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    It s honestly quite hard to tell 
                    when they are so small. And he is a 
                    bit jaundiced, which makes his skin 
                    coloureven harder to interpret. 

                                    COLLY
                              (trying to joke)
                    You re going to have to knock this 
                    idea on the head, guys. I ve 
                    already named him Michael. Which is 
                    so not a Muslim name.

    The joke falls very flat and NICK gets cross.

                                    NICK
                    Oh, come on, we don t even know if 
                    he s brown yet, leave alone if he s 
                    Muslim.



                                                                                45                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    COLLY
                    Since when were all Muslims 
                     brown , as you so charmingly put 
                    it?

      They glare at each other, and SISTER DOOLE mends it.

                                      SISTER DOOLE
                    I think Michael is a lovely name.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    The Archangel Michael (PRON: 
                    MIKA EEL) is mentioned in the Holy 
                    Qu ran, actually.

                    Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and 
                    His angels, and His Messengers, and 
                    Gabriel, and Michael, then surely, 
                    Allah is an enemy to such 
                      disbelievers.

                    In our tradition, Michael lives in 
                    the seventh heaven and has wings of 
                    emerald green.

      Charmed by this thought, they all gaze at the baby in his 
      suit of bright green.

                    See, Colette, you got the green bit 
                    right.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                    Michael is the angel of blessings.

                                      LAURIE
                    Tell that to his mother.

    Her tone is harsh, and spoils the sweet moment. COLLY glares - 
    who the hell is this?

                                    NICK
                    This is Detective Constable

                                    COLLY
                    So is that his mother in the fridge 
                    downstairs or not? 

                                      LAURIE
                    No idea, I m afraid. And no chance 
                    of finding out till after the 
                    weekend.



                                                                                46                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE moves away to the door, cheerful enough, dismissing 
    the whole problem from her mind.

                                    COLLY
                    You mean I ve dragged myself back 
                    in here for nothing?

                                      LAURIE
                    Suicide is not a crime, is it. So 
                    the girl in the morgue is not 
                    urgent. She s not even interesting. 
                    She ll be waiting her turn for a 
                      pathologist with all the boring
                    dead people.

    She exits. NICK gives COLLY a cross paternal frown, and gets 
    an adolescent look back.

                                    COLLY
                    Up herself, or what?

                                    PC CRYER 
                    Wait!

    She follows LAURIE.



    PC CRYER stops LAURIE in the corridor.

                                    PC CRYER
                    I m just thinking - if there is any 
                    chance of a link between my baby 
                    and their body, maybe I should call 
                    the transport police back out?

                                      LAURIE
                    Rather you than me, love!

      LAURIE walks away, leaving PC CRYER confused and anxious.

    PC CRYER takes out her mobile phone anyway and dials.



      LAURIE arrives back to the A&E corridor where she left her 
      mother.

    The trolley is empty. Panic!

    The NURSE appears.





                                                                                47                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    Where is she? Where s my Mum? 
                    You re supposed to be looking after 
                    her!

    JEN appears round the corner, on the arm of an NS NURSEwho 
    has found her wandering. She smiles broadly at LAURIE.

                                    JEN
                    There you are! I ve been looking 
                    for you to tell you they found a 
                    little baby in the toilet. 

                                      LAURIE
                    Really? Good Lord.

    JEN picks up her handbag to leave.

                                    JEN
                    I ll be glad to get home.

      LAURIE sighs. No chance.

                                      LAURIE
                    They re looking for a bed for you, 
                    remember?

                                    JEN
                    Of course they are, how could I 
                    have forgotten that. 

    She slumps back down on the trolley, and LAURIE sits by her.

                                    JEN (CONT D)
                    I m losing my marbles, aren t I.

                                      LAURIE
                    Marbles all present and correct 
                    last time I looked. 

                                    JEN
                    There s no need to stop here with 
                    me, Laurie. I ve got more pride 
                    than to turn up my toes in this 
                    horrible place.

                                      LAURIE
                              (jocular)
                    Don t even think of it unless your 
                    bra and pants match.

                                    JEN
                    Supposed to be meworrying about 
                    you! Can t remember now when it 
                    turned the other way round. Lots of 
                    things I can t remember.



                                                                                48                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      LAURIE
                    It s all going to be all right.

                                    JEN
                    No it s not.

      They don t touch. They definitely do not hug. They don t even 
      really look at each other properly. They just sit there in 
    the moment and try not to cry.

                                    JEN (CONT D)
                    But we ll have some fun while we 
                    can, eh.And now go home, love. You 
                    need your sleep.

                                      LAURIE
                    I ll just sit here with you for a 
                    while.

                                    JEN
                    You don t have to.

                                      LAURIE
                    I want to.

      LAURIE takes her mother s hand - an unusual gesture, for 
      them. We leave them together in silence.



      DANNY is making a cup of tea for IBRA.

                                    DANNY
                    There s me thinkingit might upset 
                    her, but no, her eyes light up and 
                    she starts textingher mates for 
                    the gossip.

                                    IBRA
                    You worry too much about her. 

                                    DANNY
                    Ibra, she s still not right.

      They hear the door open and shut up.

      NUSRAT comes in to find DANNY putting on the kettle again. 
    She is bright, a bit glittery, maybe a bit too cheerful.

                                    IBRA
                    Hello love, what s the gossip then?

                                      NUSRAT

                    OK, the party line is your dead 
                    girl can t be a Muslim, or if she 
                    is, she can t have killed herself 
                    on account of it s a sin.

      IBRA gives her a look - yeah, right!

                                      NUSRAT (CONT D)
                    Actually, Amira thinks it s some 
                    sort of runaway bride thing, 
                      Shaistasays Amira s been reading 
                    too many detective stories, and 
                    Rukhsanasays 
                              (mimicking)
                    if that dead girl s mother-in-law 
                    is anything like mine I don t blame 
                    her for jumping in front of a 
                    train! 

                                    IBRA
                    Someone knows her.

                                      NUSRAT
                    She won t be local. No Asian girl 
                    could go missing from round here 
                    without you dknow about it 
                    already. 

      IBRA laughs, but his face is full of questions.

                                    IBRA
                    Someone knows what s going off.


      SCENE DELETED8181



      A big thundering splash.

      A human body powering through the water. Goggles, speedos, 
      bubbles. Pure sporting adrenalin.

      A group of serious competitive swimmers are training. They 
      charge up and down the pool in strict lanes, under the 
      watchful eye of a young woman coach, SALLY SMALE.All her 
      dialogue is background.

                                    SALLY
                              (shouting)
                    Bring your arm further round, bring 
                    it round, yes, you.

      A mobile phone goes off in the coach s tracksuit pocket. She 
      gets it out and looks.



                                                                                50                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                    Mal. Mal! Lane six!

    One swimmer reaches the end of the pool and looks over to 
      her. This is Detective Inspector MALCOLM  MAL  CRAIG, aged 
    43.

    He takes his goggles off and she waves the phone at him.

    MAL starts to climb out of the pool. All the others are 
      finishing their round now, and the coach throws them straight 
      into the next exercise. 

                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                    Good effort, right, now we re going 
                    to do a set of ten one hundreds on 
                    140. Go off the red top. OK.

    And the rest of the swimmers start to race again.

    MAL gets to the coach s side and she hands him the phone.

                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                    Things some people will do to get 
                    out of training.

    He says nothing. He just grins.



      NICK has nodded off on his chair by the cot. He looks 
      vulnerable and tired sitting there.

      A shadow crosses his face, and he wakes suddenly.

      DIDI is standing there.

                                    NICK
                    Who the hell are you?

                    I am Didi.

                    I don t think you re supposed to be 
                    in here. There s supposed to be 
                    security.

                                    DIDI
                    They said I can come and check up 
                    on him whenever I like. I m Didi. 
                    They must have told you about me.

                                    NICK
                    No.

                                    DIDI
                              (hurt)
                    I found him. I saved him. He is

                    No. I m his foster father.

                                    DIDI
                    Where is your wife?

      NICK is a widower, so this line of questioning is not 
      pleasant for him.

                                    NICK
                    Nobody here but us chickens, pal.

                                    DIDI
                    But your wife is his foster mother?

                                    NICK
                    There s no wife and no mother. 
                    There s only me.

                                    DIDI
                    But that s not natural.

                    Well now, if your country s so 
                    bloody marvellous why don t you 
                    just sod off back there?

      A beat.

                    Since I came to England nothing 
                    good has happened to me except for 
                    this child. He was given to me and 
                    I will always watch over him. I 
                    warn you. Always.

      DIDI, walking home, shrinks away from MAL and SGT PARKER as 
      they enter the hospital. 


                                                                                53                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      NUSRAT sits up in her pyjamas at a little desk, reading an 
      online adoption site advertising  Children Who Wait .

      DANNY enters with two cups of tea.

                                      NUSRAT
                    One here described as half Turkish.

                                    DANNY
                    Muslim?

                                      NUSRAT
                    Doesn t say. They re looking for a 
                    one or two parent adoptive family 
                    of similar mixed ethnicity, or you 
                    know, the usual, yaddayadda,  able 
                    to broadly reflect her ethnic 
                    origins .

                                    DANNY
                              (looking)
                    She s six years old though. What 
                    about him? Six months old. He s got 
                    a lovely smile.

                                      NUSRAT
                    Irish mother, Ghanaian father.

                                    DANNY
                    Oh look, lookat those two little 
                    sisters. They re Asian.

                                      NUSRAT
                    Bangladeshi. Not going to give them 
                    to a Pakistani, are they. 

                                    DANNY
                    It s mad this. I don t care whether 
                    they re pink blue or mustard 
                    coloured.All these little kids 
                    needing homes. 

                                      NUSRAT
                    Don t come out with any of that 
                    nonsense tomorrow, will you? 

      DANNY does a zippy mouth, and NUSRAT laughs. They have a 
      little hug.

                                    DANNY
                    I love you. Did I ever tell you 
                    that?




                                                                                54                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                      NUSRAT
                    Ten times a day for ten years. 
                                (pretendyawn)
                    Boring!

    But she snuggles into his arms, and the pretend yawn turns 
      into a real one, and makes her laugh.

                                      NUSRAT (CONT D)
                    I bet I don t sleep a wink tonight.



    JEN has fallen asleep on her trolley. LAURIE creeps away.



      LAURIE is about to enter the ladies, but she stops and 
      thinks. Goes back. 

    She clocks the signs for all three possible loos: the gents, 
    the ladies, and the disabled loo. 

      Then she opens the door to the disabled loo.



      A quiet, still moment, as LAURIE enters the disabled loo and 
      looks around it.

      A moment where we see her make a connection in her mind.

    And she leaves, very excited.



      LAURIE runs out of the disabled loo and down the corridor. 



      LAURIE haringdown the stairs.



      MAL, SGT PARKER and PC CRYER are there with DR HAYDAR. MAL 
    has a handwritten cleaning log in his hand.

                                    MAL
                    This cleaning logpretty well rules
                    out a linkthough, doesn t it.



                                                                                55                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    PC CRYER
                    Looks like it.

                                    MAL
                    Anyway, makes no difference...

                                    SGT PARKER
                              (relieved)
                    ...to you deciding toreclassify it 
                    as a suspicious death? 

                                    MAL
                    Safe side, yes, I m going to call 
                    in the Home Office pathologist 
                    first thing in the morning. In the 
                      meantime...

      LAURIE races in, looking for PC CRYER, the one in charge of 
    the baby story.

    She clocks MAL, a stranger to her. And blunders on anyway.

                                      LAURIE
                    Why did his mother leave him in the 
                    disabledtoilet?

                                    PC CRYER
                    As opposed to...?

                                      LAURIE
                    Why not the ladies?

                                    MAL 
                    Why not the gents?

    SGT PARKER is sniggering now, which mystifies LAURIE. 

                                      LAURIE
                    Nobody would leave a baby in the 
                    gents. Not even a caveman would 
                    leave a baby in the gents. 

    MAL just looks at her steadily. She challenges back.

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    DC Franklin. And you are?

                                    SGT PARKER
                    My boss, DICraig.

      LAURIE is surprised: a Detective Inspector s involvement.

                                      LAURIE
                    Sir?




                                                                                56                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    MAL
                    You think this woman left her baby 
                    in the toilet and then went to 
                    throw herself under your train.

                                      LAURIE
                    It s a hypothesis. 

                                    MAL
                    The train hit your victim at 10.09. 
                    Want to know what time the cleaner 
                    found the baby?

                                      LAURIE
                    Well...
                              (defeated)
                    10.09?

                                    MAL
                    Near enough. I ve got the cleaning 
                    rota here if you want to check. 

      A beat. And LAURIE fights back.

                                      LAURIE
                    No, listen, that s right, if she d 
                    left him here herself, she would 
                    have left him in the ladies, right.
                              (excited)
                    Even if she had a sister or a 
                    friend to help her, they d have 
                    done the same. But a manwouldn t 
                    risk being caught in the ladies. 

                                    PC CRYER
                    No, Laurie, listen... 

                                      LAURIE
                    If Michael was abandoned by his 
                    father, that could still be his 
                    mother under our train.

      LAURIE is very pleased with herself. But SGT PARKER is 
      laughing at her.

                                    DR HAYDAR
                              (kindly)
                    The body under your train wasn t 
                    his mother.

                                      LAURIE
                    You don t know that. 

                                    MAL
                    The body under your train wasn t 
                    anyone s mother.



                                                                                57                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE looks blank.

                                    MAL (CONT D)
                    It s a man.

    Her face, completely shocked.

                                    MAL (CONT D)
                    The driver was deceived by the 
                    clothes. Your train hit a man.



      ROSS and LUKE, whispering on the bunk beds in Ross s scruffy 
      council flat. They re still dressed, well past bedtime. 

                                    ROSS
                    Show us again.

                                    LUKE
                    No point.

                                    ROSS
                    Go on.

                                    LUKE
                    You keep saying you can t see 
                    anything anyway.

                                    ROSS
                    I might this time.

      LUKE hands him up the mobile phone, on which they shot their 
      wobbly bit of video by the railway track earlier.

      ROSS hangs down over the edge of his bed. We see the screen, 
      bright and flickering in the darkness, but we can t see what 
    it shows.

                                    ROSS (CONT D)
                    It just looks like a seagull or 
                    something.

                                    LUKE
                    Don t have seagulls on tmoors.

                                    ROSS
                    They do and all!

      Ross s father shouts from downstairs.

                                      ROSS S DAD (O.C.)
                    I told you once to send that lad 
                    home!

      A beat of scared silence. Then LUKE grabs his phone back.

                                    ROSS
                              (whispering)
                    I m not saying you didn t see 
                    owt... 

                                      ROSS S DAD (O.C.)
                    I said, it s time to bugger off 
                    home!




                                                                                59                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    LUKE
                    There s you, right. There s that 
                    lady what jumped off. And there...

      LUKE jumps up, doggedly watching the footage on the mobile 
      phone screen.

                                    LUKE (CONT D)
                    Not a seagull. A person, up there 
                    on the bridge behind her.

    Now at last we see it: a flickering image: a shape standing 
    on the bridge. At the last moment, a second figure seems to 
      hurtle up. The two figures become one for a single moment - 
      grabbing? Shoving? A fight? Or a reunion? 

    The shot veers away.

                                    ROSS
                    Luke. Luke! You can t tell noone.

      LUKE replays it again.

                                    ROSS (CONT D)
                    Promise, you ll not tell noone.
