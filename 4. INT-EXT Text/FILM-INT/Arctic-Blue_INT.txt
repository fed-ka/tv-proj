DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
Eric bolts up in bed.
Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him.
All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.
After a
moment, Eric kisses her.
He shakes off the dream and lies
back down.

Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
Haul Road.
ANNE MARIE
What are you doing?
ERIC
He still might be around.
I saw
fresh tire tracks coming in.
HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
north and south.
In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road.
Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine.
BACK TO SCENE
Eric hurries down the footpegs.
ERIC
Man and a jeep, about a mile and
a half down.
He jumps into the Scout.
Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback.
As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.
SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.
TRAPPERS' JEEP
They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.
It's
oddly well-equipped, however.
Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen.
They zoom off.
SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric stomps on the gas.
The dust from the jeep obscures his
view but he's gaining on them anyway.
Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust.
TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
His entire outfit is made of animal hide.
He has long red
hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer.
While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
LEMALLE
Where the fuck did you drop
Corbett off?
In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
looks grim.
He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes.
He's dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg.
Despite his intimidating air,
confrontation is not his style.
He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
creek.
MITCHELL
He's over there.
SCOUT
Eric opens his door.
To Anne Marie:
ERIC
Stay here.
ANNE MARIE
Be careful -- there're two of
them.
Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie.
ERIC
If I unzip my parka, stick this
out the window.
11
Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
CORBETT
(to LeMalle)
No shooting.
Let's see who's so
interested in us.
Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.
He throws his
traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
MITCHELL
(to Corbett)
Ain't worth it, Ben...
13
SCOUT
Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window.
(CONTINUED)
15
CONTINUED:
ANNE MARIE
(unnerved)
Great idea -- pointing a lousy
dart gun at some nut with a
high-powered hunting rifle.
ERIC
Bastards took off, though, didn't
they?
16
TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
Corbett broods while driving.
Mitchell looks out the
window.
The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
LEMALLE
All this fuckin' land, and we're
locked out.
Makes me puke.
CORBETT
Jawing about it won't change it.
LEMALLE
Three hundred seventy-five
million acres in this state.
I'm
real tired of runnin' into
people.
MITCHELL
Then don't look to your left.
18
TRAPPERS' JEEP
LeMalle grabs his carbine.
CORBETT
Leave it here.
(CONTINUED)
19
CONTINUED:
MITCHELL
Let's keep going.
We're only an
hour from Devil's Cauldron.
CORBETT
(pats Mitchell's shoulder)
Relax.
I just want to ask them
how the hunting is.

KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell."
There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window.
The trappers come in.
Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off.
One of his wool socks is wet.
He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.
Wilder is short
and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years.
CORBETT
Hullo, Sam.
Slow day?
WILDER
(wary)
Ben...boys.
Yeah, real slow, and
I'd like to keep it that way.
CORBETT
(conciliatory)
Just passing through.
A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses
behind the counter.
He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store.
LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.
Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.
Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.
(CONTINUED)
23
CONTINUED:
CORBETT
(continuing; re boot)
Needs patching.
KENAI
Twenty-five dollar.
CORBETT
(smiles)
Sure have learned to worship the
white man's god.
Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out.
Corbett pays
him.
Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the
corkboard.
MEYERLING
I hope I can count on you
gentlemen to vote for The
People's Friend this November.
CORBETT
Share some of that oil company
money in your pocket and you can.
Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on
the wall.
LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the
poster between Meyerling's spread fingers.
Meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh.
Meyerling looks to Wilder for
support.
WILDER
(to Meyerling)
One flier comes loose and I shoot
you for littering.
MEYERLING
(exiting; grudgeless)
Have your fun... just remember
The People's Friend come election
day.
WILDER
(shakes his head)
Oil Company candidate running on
that slogan makes about as much
sense as a rat fucking a
grapefruit.
CORBETT
Hard to work up an interest in
politics, way we live.
You're
the first people we've seen in
two weeks.
(CONTINUED)
23

LEMALLE
(to Kenai)
How about a quart of Jack
Daniel's?
KENAI
How about it is right.
Back in
the primary this town was voted
dry.
LEMALLE
(to Corbett)
Aw, shit.
Let's go.
Leave a
note for Viking Bob, tell him to
meet us in Cache.
CORBETT
Relax.
One more day without
drink won't kill you.
Right,
Sam?
WILDER
I'm living proof of that sad
fact.
CORBETT
Can we buy the Marshal some
dinner?
WILDER
No, I better stay at my post.
Even without the hootch riling
'em up, you know how
mean-spirited folks get when they
smell winter coming.
24
RENTAL CABIN
Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.
LeMalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon.
Mitchell hunches
over a table.
He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone.
He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.
MITCHELL
So much for the walking weather
you predicted.
(CONTINUED)
25
CONTINUED:
CORBETT
Had no choice...
(pointedly, at LeMalle)
...Given the situation.
MITCHELL
I know.
Least you didn't shoot
all of them.
LEMALLE
Fuck you, Mitchell.
Woulda been
my ass if Ben didn't waste that
prick.
CORBETT
(after a beat)
Mitchell, look, it don't take
three of us to wait for Viking
Bob.
Mitchell glances at LeMalle, then at Corbett.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Go ahead.
Take the jeep.
I'll
come to Cache with Bob when he
gets here.
MITCHELL
Okay by me.
You're the one likes
these hot springs so much.
CORBETT
Leave my traps.
We'll tag up,
couple days.
26
HOT SPRINGS SPA
Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker, DIXIE.
He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.
Eric holds
Corbett's boots, which have been repaired.
Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett.
There is a flash of recognition between
them.
ERIC
Ben Corbett?
CORBETT
Yep.
Afraid you have me at a
disadvantage.
ERIC
Kenai at the general store asked
me to bring these.
Didn't expect
we'd already met.
CORBETT
No big deal.
We just got off on
the wrong foot.
What's your
name?
Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the
floor next to Corbett's tub.
Corbett's magnum rests on top
of it, well within reach.
Corbett notices Eric's interest
in it.
He leans back and smiles.
ERIC
Desmond.
CORBETT
New to the country, kid?
ERIC
Six months.
Ecological study for
Northland Oil.
CORBETT
Ecology.
Folks use that term for
everything but what it means:
who's eating who.
Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and
gets out of the tub.
His sinewy body, resembling a
scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.
He
wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric.
(CONTINUED)
30
CONTINUED:
CORBETT
(continuing)
Now, why don't you get around to
saying what you want.
Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a
revolver, which Eric has been hiding inside one of the
boots.
CORBETT
(continuing; smiling)
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
WILDER (OS)
But I would.
NEW ANGLE
Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Corbett
with a 12-gauge shotgun.
He kicks Corbett's magnum out of
reach.
CORBETT
All this for laying traps on
private land?
WILDER
You left a footprint at the
Sportsmen's camp.
Only pretty
sight there, Ben, 'cause the two
men you didn't shoot and mutilate
died of exposure.
Corbett shakes his head but remains implacable.
CORBETT
Christ if I shouldn't know better
than to step in soft earth.
I've
seen footprints in the tundra a
hundred years old.
WILDER
(to Eric)
I got it from here.
Thanks.
CORBETT
(to Wilder)
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks
out of my kit, will you?
31
NEFF'S HOUSE
Wilder pushes Corbett inside past Neff.
WILDER
I need to call Fairbanks.
Neff just stares at Corbett.
WILDER
(continuing)
Neff!
Dial it up.
State police.
With a "what can I do but oblige?" look to Corbett, Neff
sits in front of the RCA Alascom radio telephone and dials.
(CONTINUED)
33
CONTINUED:
NEFF
(on phone)
Fairbanks Alascom?
Patch me
through to the State Police.
After a moment, he hands the receiver to Wilder.
Wilder
takes it, keeping one eye and the shotgun on Corbett.
WILDER
(on phone)
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in
Devil's Cauldron.
Had some
killings here.
I got a suspect;
be real nice if someone came and
took him off my hands.
STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
(thru phone)
On a good day I couldn't spare a
crosswalk guard.
But now, no
way.
Folks're batshit with the
weather turning sour.
Bring him
in yourself.
WILDER
(on phone)
Next plane's not coming 'til next
Monday.
STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
(thru phone)
Sit your suspect out in the cold.
He'll keep.
WILDER
(on phone)
This man's friends ain't gonna
look favorably on his
incarceration.
STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
(thru phone; Mr. Glib)
So shoot him.
Won't have to feed
him that way --
Angry, Wilder slams the receiver down.
34
WILDER'S CABIN
In one room, there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley
heat stove, a table, a bunk and a small window.
Behind a
cloth partition is an eight by six holding cell.
The frame
of an iron-bar door is securely cemented to the log walls.
Wilder comes in with Corbett and locks him in the cell.
(CONTINUED)
34
CONTINUED:
CORBETT
Mind if I get some stuff from my
kit?
Wilder does mind.
He locks the duffel bag and Corbett's .44
in his desk drawer.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend
my man.
Other guy drew first.
WILDER
If that was all, fine.
But
carving him up, stranding the
others, that's too fucking much.
Is everything that walks, crawls,
flies or swims fair game to you?
CORBETT
(softly)
I'll get loose before that plane
comes.
WILDER
Don't try me.
I'll kill you if
it comes to it.
35
THE TURTLE
Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's
research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies.
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and
white prints.
All are of man-made objects whose presence is
juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.
Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at
the door and kisses him.
Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped
package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's
preparing dinner.
ANNE MARIE
Did you catch Corbett?
ERIC
Sure did.
He was one of the
trappers we rousted from the Haul
Road.
ANNE MARIE
Was there any trouble?
ERIC
He was sitting in a hot tub with
a hooker.
ANNE MARIE
Going after killers isn't the
same as chasing poachers, Eric.
ERIC
(grins)
Can't help myself.
Corbett's
type always pisses me off.
(hands her the package)
Oh, I found this at the post
office.
Had your name on it.
(CONTINUED)
37
CONTINUED:
Perplexed, she looks at the return address --
Bloomingdale's.
Delighted, she tears it open.
Inside is a
pretty, elegant dress.
Anne Marie kisses him.
ANNE MARIE
Oh, sweetheart.
It's beautiful!
ERIC
You were looking at it in the
catalog.
Don't know where you
can wear it...
ANNE MARIE
I'll wear it for you.
And I can
wear it when we go home.
We
won't be here forever.
ERIC
(frowning)
You make it sound like a prison
sentence.
ANNE MARIE
That's not what I meant.
ERIC
It's exactly what you meant.
ANNE MARIE
Look, why get into this again.
As long as it's working, let's
leave it alone.
It's been nice
so far.
We're together --
ERIC
-- Permanently?
ANNE MARIE
(sighs)
Do I want to be with you
permanently?
Yes, I think I do.
But be with what you do and the
way you live?
That I don't know.
C'mon, Eric, until I met you,
coming back to Alaska was totally
out of the question for me.
But
I'm here.
I'm getting great
pictures, and I'm having fun.
(slips her arms around him)
I love you.
(kisses him)
So shut up and let's eat.
38
WILDER'S CABIN
Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob, then turns
to Corbett.
(CONTINUED)
39
CONTINUED:
WILDER
Back against the bars.
Now.
Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face,
covering his mouth.
Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips
outside.
As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge.
40
WILDER'S CABIN
Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth.
He pries one
of his boots off and kicks it through a window.
CORBETT
Bob!
They got me on a murder
charge!
42
THE TURTLE - NIGHT
Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES.
On the monitor, it SHOWS footage of the traps under the
pipeline piling.
Eric comes out of the back module holding
two ELT pendants.
He glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly.
ANNE MARIE
I still can't believe I'm being
financed by an oil company.
Especially when they get a look
at these pictures.
Technology in
the wilderness; not too pretty.
(re ELTs)
What's that?
ERIC
I thought I should check our
emergency transmitters.
Eric activates the ELT's.
They emit an SOS pattern of radio
waves -- three short, three long and three short.
This is
visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Marie's video
MONITOR.
ERIC
(continuing)
Avalanche season is coming.
(CONTINUED)
43
CONTINUED:
ANNE MARIE
Winter.
Two straight months of
night -- we may never get out of
bed.
(kisses him)
Which would suit me fine.
ERIC
Prolonged darkness makes people
crazy.
ANNE MARIE
Not me.
I'm equipped.
She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the
room lights.
ANNE MARIE
(continuing)
Allow me to give you a practical
demonstration of low-light
infrared photography...
She does so by seductively undressing for the camera.
She's
SEEN on the MONITOR, illuminated by the "light" from the hot
stove.
Eric appreciates the show.
He crawls toward her.
ANNE MARIE
(continuing)
High-tech in the wilderness.
Gets me excited, too.
ERIC
Come here...
Laughing, he wrestles her to the rug.
44
THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE - NIGHT
Eric and Anne Marie are asleep.
Eric starts awake at the OS
sound of a high-pitched vehicle HORN and an approaching
ENGINE.
47
THE TURTLE
Eric, Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module.
Anne
Marie, nervous, wearing a down robe, serves coffee.
She
stares at Corbett, trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor
with what she saw that afternoon.
Corbett smiles at Eric.
WILDER
(to Eric)
...You give us a ride in the
Cessna you got hangared at the
pumping station, we'll be in
Fairbanks in a few hours.
ERIC
That's what we should've done in
the first place.
WILDER
I could've sat tight for the
transport, 'til Bob came poking
around.
CORBETT
(to Wilder; re Anne Marie)
A lot to ask, dragging him away
from such a good-looking girl --
ERIC
(irritated)
-- To take you to jail?
It'll be
my pleasure.
WILDER
(to Eric)
You better get some sleep.
CORBETT
Good idea.
Flying over mountains
can give you some nasty
surprises.
Go too low, one of
the clouds might have a big rock
inside it.
(CONTINUED)
48

ERIC
(hard)
I'll get you there all right.
Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module, leaving Wilder
with his prisoner.
CUT TO:
49
THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT
A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder.
Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.
Corbett is awake.
He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him.
He eyes Wilder's .357.
It's in a lefty Sam Browne
holster.
No way to take it without waking Wilder.
Corbett stands and inches toward the door.
As he pulls it
open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.
Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair.
WILDER
Goddammit, I don't need this
aggravation.
I'll shoot you,
Ben.
Bank on it.
CORBETT
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
WILDER
I'm not too old to knock the snot
out of you!
CORBETT
Nothing personal.
Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands
are in front of him.
He reaches for his .357.
Corbett
butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.
Amazingly,
Wilder stays on his feet.
Corbett hurries back to the door.
Wilder lunges,
bull-determined to hold onto him.
Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands.
Wilder goes down
hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there.
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing.
But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module,
Corbett flees.
50
THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE
Eric is pulling on his pants.
51
THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
Eric rushes in.
The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor.
His holster is empty.
Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder.
Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment, coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle.
Unfamiliar with weapons, Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle.
52
THE TURTLE
Eric leads Corbett in.
Anne Marie is cradling Wilder's
head. She's crying.
Eric looks at Wilder.
There is blood
coming from his ear and he's fading fast.
WILDER
(thickly)
Fetch him back?
(Eric nods)
Don't let him walk...
Eric nods again.
Wilder holds his gaze on Eric, then simply
stops breathing.
(CONTINUED)
53
CONTINUED:
Eric is stunned.
Quietly, Corbett sits down.
Clutching the
rifle, Eric sits on the floor and glares at Corbett.
CORBETT
(softly)
Does he have people?
ERIC
(after a beat)
A daughter in Oregon.
CORBETT
Send him down to her.
There's
money in my duffel bag, back at
his cabin.
Corbett's benign attitude is chilling.
ERIC
I better call in.
He turns the shortwave radio on.
It SPARKS and burns out.
The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it.
ERIC
(continuing)
Thought of everything, huh?
CORBETT
Surviving is what I know --
ERIC
-- Killing is what you know.
(to Anne Marie)
Pack some food while I prep for
the flight.
(off her look)
I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Covering Corbett with the rifle, Eric handcuffs him to the
sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit.
54
BEAR SIGN INN - NIGHT
Meyerling's campaign posters cover the walls.
Many have
been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd.
In a booth covered with grafitti, Mitchell squints and works
on his scrimshaw.
LeMalle, somewhat sober, eats a plate of
muktuk -- whale blubber.
Viking Bob pours him more coffee.
MITCHELL
(to Viking Bob)
...Ben never sent a signal.

MITCHELL
Meaning he'll need a plane.
VIKING BOB
Closest planes for hire are here
in Cache.
MITCHELL
Hang on...
(to LeMalle)
Remember that Cessna we saw at
the pumping station on the Haul
Road?
Belongs to the guy they
got patrolling the pipeline.
LEMALLE
There you go.
Wilder's always
chummy with the fuckin'
Bambi-lovers.
VIKING BOB
It's a long shot.
MITCHELL
You got a better idea?
57
THE TURTLE
Corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit.
Terrified about being alone with Corbett, Anne Marie
cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him.
CORBETT
How long have you been up north?
ANNE MARIE
(after a beat)
Six months.
CORBETT
Can't be.
Too keen a sense of
this place in your pictures.
(CONTINUED)
58
CONTINUED:
ANNE MARIE
Six months this time.
I was born
in the Aleutians.
CORBETT
Your people Alaskan?
Anne Marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but Corbett is
so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite
herself.
ANNE MARIE
My dad was a Navy doctor.
CORBETT
Knew you had no native blood,
even with your dark hair.
Blue
eyes give you away.
My wife had
blue eyes.
ANNE MARIE
Had?
CORBETT
She's dead.
ANNE MARIE
Oh.
CORBETT
Had some good years.
Met her in
'66.
She showed up one day in
Coldfoot.
No one knew her.
One
Sunday morning, she marched into
a bar and announced she was
available as a wife to the
highest bidder.
Didn't work out
in three months, she'd return the
money and leave, no hard
feelings.
(off Anne Marie's amazed
look)
My bid was eight thousand
dollars.
Beautiful girl.
ANNE MARIE
How did she..?
CORBETT
I was gone, in September, laying
traplines.
She went to our cache
for some meat.
Got mauled by a
bear.
Tore open her skull.

Anne Marie shudders.
Smiling good-naturedly, Corbett looks
around, spotting the package Anne Marie's new dress came in.
CORBETT
(continuing)
What about you -- why come back?
Classy girl like you seems more
suited to the finer things.
ANNE MARIE
That's why I left, moved to
Washington.
When I met Eric I
was doing day shoots -- products
and fashion, mostly.
Pretty
dull.
Eric was teaching college,
and then he got the job with
Northland Oil.
We wanted to stay
together, so we talked them into
funding some wilderness
photography... and here I am.
As she's talking, the Turtle ROCKS slightly.
She looks out
the tiny window.
HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW
Eric is putting Wilder's body inside an enclosed storage
compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle.
BACK TO SCENE
Horrified, Anne Marie turns away.
CORBETT
You should know something.
ANNE MARIE
I don't want to talk any more.
CORBETT
Wasn't my intention to hurt
Wilder.
I'm telling you the
truth.
I liked the man.
I only
meant to get loose... to survive.
Your cheechako boyfriend better
understand that.

Eric comes in, none too thrilled about Anne Marie chatting

ANNE MARIE
(translating)
Outsider.
He carefully stuffs Wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores
Anne Marie's disparaging look as he does.
ERIC
(to Corbett)
Let's go.
ANNE MARIE
Wait a second.
59
THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE
Anne Marie leads Eric out of earshot from Corbett.
Eric
keeps a cautious eye on him.
ANNE MARIE
Maybe you should drive him into
Devil's Cauldron, let them decide
what to do with him.
ERIC
(reassuringly)
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight.
I'll be back by dinnertime.
Realizing he's determined, she sighs and kisses him.

The wind whips through the shot-out wing window.
Corbett's
handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon
rope.
62
SCOUT - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric pulls up to the hangar.
Suddenly, LeMalle steps out
from behind the building.
64
SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric slams on the brakes and turns the Scout around.
CORBETT
Let me out and keep going.
They
catch us, they'll kill you.
Eric doesn't need any convincing of that.
He tears out.
66
SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric slows, shifts into four-wheel drive and continues,
driving on the rim.
68
TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT)
As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it
disappears from sight over a hill.
71
SCOUT
Eric stops the vehicle.
He grabs a five-gallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back.
73
SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric speeds away.
CORBETT
They'll still catch us.
All
you're doing is pissing them off.
76
HANGAR - CESSNA
Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.
81
HANGAR - CESSNA
Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.
The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use.
83
HANGAR
Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip.
85
CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
It picks up speed and takes off.
ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
Below, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads.
LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down.
87
CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him.
88
CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.
ERIC
How the hell were they smart
enough to find us?
CORBETT
Smart?
Sure.
That's why I'm
sitting in this plane and they're
down there blowing me kisses.
Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest.
Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure
of the controls.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Been driving long?
ERIC
I needed a pilot's license to
take the job here, so I got one
in six weeks.
CORBETT
That makes the flight more
interesting.
Eric ignores the jibe.
He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
landscape all the more immediate.
Corbett stares out the window and broods.
He spots an open,
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness.
CORBETT
(continuing)
See the blood?
Pack of wolves
took down a moose.
Greedy,
gut-ripping sons of bitches.
I'd
kill the last wolf on earth,
right in front of the President
of the U.S.
Stinking, cowardly
predator, the wolf.
(CONTINUED)
89
CONTINUED:
ERIC
Sounds like professional
jealousy.
CORBETT
Hunting and trapping was a damn
fine life.
(beat)
Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,
we were teams.
I'd always go
with Mitchell.
Good man,
Mitchell.
I'd let Bob worry
about goddamn LeMalle.
We'd hire
a plane in October.
On the way
to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
we'd drop supplies.
We'd land,
tell the pilot to come back for
us a few days before Christmas.
ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
CORBETT
The idea was to get to the
supplies before the bears did.
Along the route we'd set our
traps.
Made our year's living in
three months.
Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
the tree line.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Lot of times we didn't even have
a landing strip.
We'd set down
on a plateau, like that one
there.
Yeah, that one's easy;
you could glide right in...
Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot.
The plane flies erratically.
With his right foot, Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
jamming it on.
90
CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.
Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.
Corbett's move was too
fast and too outrageous.
In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop.
Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
CORBETT
Hope you got your money's worth
on those lessons.
92
CESSNA
It rests upside down in the snow.
The men are dazed.
Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
down, leaks gas.
In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.
Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt.
He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
seat.
Corbett pushes the passenger door open.
Panicking,
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
wrenching his ankle.
94
NYLON SHELTER
The men huddle inside the tarp.
Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.
It's swollen to the
size of a softball.
CORBETT
Still quite a hike to Devil's
Cauldron.
(beat)
Days.
A long stretch to go
without sleep, my friend.
You
can hide behind that pistol for
now, but take your eyes off me
long enough to sneeze --
ERIC
-- Turn around.
While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the
granite elbow, then locks it back up again.
He's learning.
FADE TO:
99
NYLON SHELTER
The light hits Eric's eyes.
He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep.
Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.
He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture.

THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY
Trying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the
darkroom she's made from the front bathroom.
She glances at
her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return.
104
THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
Anne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up
to dry.
Outside, (OS), a car HORN blares a couple of times.
Grinning, she runs to the door.
105
THE TURTLE
Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up.
Anne Marie comes outside.
Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric.
As Meyerling
climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's
snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle.
MEYERLING
I've been trying to raise you on
the shortwave for two days.
He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle.
ANNE MARIE
Have you talked to Eric?
MEYERLING
I have not, but I very much want
to.
What do you know about the
trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
ANNE MARIE
I was hoping you had some news --
MEYERLING
-- Get this straight: I'm the
District Supervisor.
Whatever
you do reflects on me.
It wasn't
my idea to bring you people up
here, but I'm stuck with you.
You are absolutely not to involve
yourself in any local disputes.
Whichever side you take, you
alienate the other.
Mr. Corbett
is quite well-known in this
region.
People admire him --
ANNE MARIE
-- Corbett's a killer.
(CONTINUED)
105

MEYERLING
I don't care if Ben Corbett makes
meatloaf out of nuns and babies,
he's not your concern.
Understood?
Anne Marie just glares at him.
Meyerling examines the
damaged shortwave.
MEYERLING
(continuing)
What happened here?
ANNE MARIE
The radio's on the fritz.
MEYERLING
Where'd you say Eric is?
ANNE MARIE
Somewhere along the pipeline.
MEYERLING
What about that hotheaded
marshal, Sam Wilder?
I heard he
was in the middle of this mess.
ANNE MARIE
Sam?
We haven't seen him.
MEYERLING
Really.
I thought maybe that was
his snowmobile outside.
(beat)
By the way -- your truck also 'on
the fritz?'
ANNE MARIE
(blanching)
Why?
MEYERLING
It's out by the pumping station,
shot full of holes.
Noting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he
crosses to the door.
MEYERLING
(continuing)
Still nothing to tell me?
(no reply)
Suit yourself.
106
BEAR SIGN INN - CACHE - EVENING
Outside, a STORM rages.
LeMalle is drunk, but still able to
stuff himself with a thick steak.
Mitchell drums his
fingers and listens to everyone talk.
With them at the bar
are the Miners, LOGGERS, CAT SKINNERS (bulldozer drivers)
and some leathery WOMEN.
MINER #1
...Figures, Corbett getting
hauled off by a Federal marshal.
God almighty, how I hate the U.S.
government.
LOGGER
We should pass a hat.
Send
Corbett a few bucks.
We owe him.
Someone's hat comes off.
It quickly gets filled with bills.

LEMALLE
He's full of shit.
We got run
out of there by some fuckhead
driving a Northland truck.

Viking Bob hurries in and whispers something in Mitchell's

Mitchell shoots LeMalle a look and gets up.
The
threesome hastily exit, leaving behind the hat full of
money.

BEAR SIGN INN
Viking Bob, Mitchell and LeMalle stand in a quiet corner
near the front door.
VIKING BOB
I called the cops in Fairbanks,
see when Ben is standing trial.
They don't know shit about Ben or
Wilder!
LEMALLE
Get the fuck out of here.
VIKING BOB
It's a three-hour flight.
They
shoulda got there yesterday.
LEMALLE
Maybe they went back to Devil's
Cauldron.
MITCHELL
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends
in town.
VIKING BOB
That plane might've been to throw
us off the track.
Remember the
bait-and-switch Wilder pulled
with the Eskimo and his truck?
(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE
Wilder still woulda made
Fairbanks by now.
Fuck a duck!
Ben musta got loose.
VIKING BOB
Okay, let's backtrack, try to
pick up his trail.
You know the
kid out on the pipeline that
Wilder's buddies with?
MITCHELL
(smiles)
We were just talking about him.
111
NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT
Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.
The STORM
rages outside.
Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner.
Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.
A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.
Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.
Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease.
113
NYLON SHELTER
Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.
CORBETT
I need your pocket knife.
(Eric hesitates)
I have to eat, too.
After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.
Smiling,
Corbett admires the fancy knife.
Then, BELOW FRAME, he
skins and guts his catch.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow
down when we were on those
baldheaded mountains.
It
continues, we better stay put.
ERIC
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
CORBETT
I'm still figuring: You're either
real brave or real dumb.
(CONTINUED)
113
CONTINUED:
ERIC
I just want this over with.
CORBETT
(laughs)
Where in hell Meyerling dig you
up?
ERIC
You know Meyerling?
CORBETT
Sure.
The People's Friend.
Kiss
your ass with precision if
there's a vote in it.
Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style.
Raw.
He uses the
knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth,
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice.
Eric stares, disgusted.
Off his look:
CORBETT
(continuing)
Always eat your meat raw when the
weather's cold.
Does you more
good, long as the entrails look
clean.
Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood
from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open,
next to his leg.
ERIC
I'll hold onto that.
With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric.
While Eric eats his dinner, Corbett listens to the STORM and
watches him eat.
CORBETT
Sure love to know where you fit
in up here.
ERIC
I'm here to do my job.
CORBETT
You want to fool yourself about
that bullshit job, fine.
Damn

Look, I'll

Take the

ERIC
Don't fucking insult me.
Corbett smiles -- maybe he's beginning to understand Eric.
CORBETT
Folks come to Alaska for a real
short list of reasons:
Money.
Adventure.
Solitude.
Those
cover most everyone.
But
frontiers also draw another type
of man.
One with a demon in his
gut.
He comes to the edge of the
world to face that demon, and lay
it to rest.
ERIC
Yeah?
CORBETT
Yep.
Sometimes they do, but
usually they end up crazy or
dead.
Eric ponders Corbett's words as he eats.
114
THE TURTLE - NIGHT
Anne Marie is frantic with worry.
She has the AM/FM RADIO
on for company.
RADIO (VO)
...This is "Tundra Topics" on
KFAR.
Remember, as the nights
get longer, be sure to stay on a
regular sleep schedule.
The
depression from the coming of
winter that doctors call
'Seasonal Affective Disorder' --
or 'Arctic Blue' to us lay folk
-- is preventable.
Anne Marie tunes the radio to "Pipeline of the North" on
KIAK.

...John Byers was hospitalized in
Fairbanks today for an infection

Mr. Byers

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.
Someone is outside.
Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window.
No sign of a vehicle or a person.
As she pulls on her
parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall, but doesn't touch it.
115
NYLON SHELTER
Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter.
Corbett's
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it.
He
huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and
listless.
ERIC
Stay awake!
You want to go
hypothermic?
CORBETT
If that means freeze my balls
off, no thanks.
(yawns)
I'll be okay.
Eric examines him.
Corbett's skin is white and rigid, his
lips are pale blue.
He scowls at Eric.
CORBETT
(continuing)
Told you I'm fine!
ERIC
(holds up three fingers)
How many do you see?
CORBETT
(irritable)
What?!
Fuck off.
Save yourself.
ERIC
You don't feel cold?
CORBETT
It's a spring day...
He starts to doze off.
The shivering he's been repressing
now racks his body.
Eric sits him up, closer to the fire,
and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders.
With his
foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to

Corbett's legs.
Eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't

Eric loathes the specter of death, even Corbett's.
He shakes him, trying to keep him awake.
ERIC
Wake up, goddammit!
You've got
classic hypothermia --
crankiness, fatigue, can't feel
your coldness.
Worst thing you
can do is fade out.
Corbett is headed someplace far away.
Sighing, Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire.
He unbuttons Corbett's
shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett.
Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.
Corbett's
teeth chatter.
He's completely unconscious.
ERIC
(continuing)
One more thing -- this doesn't
mean we're going steady.
DISSOLVE TO:
Later, Corbett rests fitfully.
It could go either way.
Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively.
DISSOLVE TO:
It's night.
Some color has returned to Corbett's skin.
Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt.
His eyes open.
He tries to sit up, but he's too
weak.
ERIC
Stay still.
CORBETT
Where's my ELT?
ERIC
Emergency transmitter?
All your

Ducking from sight below the window,

Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.
She closes it

The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is

You were real resourceful out

Got me thinking of this

fingers one winter.
So he hacked
the tips off and sharpened the
exposed bones.
Gets along better

Yeah, maybe I
underestimated you.
ERIC
I liked you better frozen.
You

CORBETT
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this
country before it's ruined, gone
for good.
You saw wonders you'd
only dreamed of.
That alone
makes you different than the
sorry bastards back where you
came from, because you have
dreamt them.
Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric.
CORBETT

Remember that demon in the gut?
Sometimes it's nothing more than

Outside the wind HOWLS.
Eric enters and walks into the

Startled, he turns around.
It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.
DIXIE
Earl says you get discount.
Twenty-five dollar.

It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining

WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
Neff paces nervously.
Corbett smiles at him and Kenai.
NEFF

Look, Ben, we don't want any

CORBETT
Relax.
I'll get loose in time.
KENAI
Any traps you don't want, I'll
pay cash money.
CORBETT
Guess someone should use them.
Open the bottom drawer in
Wilder's desk.
My kit's in
there.
Might as well unload
everything.
Kenai tugs on the drawer.
It's locked.
Undaunted, he
jimmies it open with a knife.
Neff groans.
Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.
He checks
for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.
Satisfied, he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars.
With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings:
clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books.
He looks up and shrugs.

HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.
His foot rests on a stool.
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a
hot towel draped over his face.
Above him, on a wall
bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.
The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.
She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now
wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.
Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.
DIXIE
I wash your back for you.
You
will like it.
Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again.
It's
Meyerling.
He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and
she scurries away.
(CONTINUED)
154
CONTINUED:
MEYERLING
I hate to interrupt playtime, but
why the hell are you caught up in
a local matter when I gave you
express instructions to the
contrary?!
ERIC
Cut the shit, Leo.
I might need
your help...
155
TRAPPERS' JEEP
With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone
WHORE out of her parka.
He's got the motor running for
warmth.
Her gold tooth glints in the light from the
building next to them.
The locating screen on the beat-up
radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS
phosphorescent green.
WHORE
They got nice beds upstairs,
honey.
LEMALLE
I'm standin' guard duty.
Besides, rather spend the room
money on sloppy seconds.
Over the sound of LeMalle's exertions there begins an
insistent succession of BEEPS.
The Whore looks over
LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device.
WHORE
Hey, Tiger --
LeMalle turns and immediately loses interest in the Whore.
Pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's HORN three
times.
157
HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
Eric and Meyerling are in the middle of an argument.
ERIC
...I won't let a killer walk!
(CONTINUED)
157
CONTINUED:
MEYERLING
Alleged killer.
ERIC
What does this matter to you?
MEYERLING
(sneering)
You can't see past your lousy
little assignment, sniffing
around the pipeline.
The few
voters there are in this district
look up to Corbett, and I'm not
about to alienate them.
ERIC
I should release Corbett because
you want some votes?
MEYERLING
This miserable wilderness is a
state of the union.
Policy's
made here the same way as in the
civilized world: at the ballot
box.
That's the beauty of it --
these icebox cowboys are living a
century too late.
Get them on
your side, it's like buying
Manhattan for beads.
With a
handful of votes you control the
greatest frontier since white men
stumbled onto the New World.
ERIC
Some day these people'll wake up,
and you'll be the first one
they'll run out of here.
Eric's attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV
screen.
There are three short bursts, followed by three
long bursts.
Something about it is very familiar.
Scowling, he sits up.
ERIC
(continuing)
Shit...
(to Meyerling; distracted)
Do what you have to.
So will I.
Eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on.
158
WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps.
The
door bursts open and Eric hobbles in.
Gun drawn, Eric
unlocks the cell door.
He rips Corbett's shirt open.
Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the
cot.
Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag
an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.
Furious, he flings it against the wall, smashing it.
159
TRAPPERS' JEEP - CHUKFOKTULIK - NIGHT
The green dot on the screen and rhythmic BLEEP go suddenly
dead, just as Viking Bob and Mitchell run up to the jeep.
LEMALLE
Northwest.
Devil's Cauldron.
LeMalle dumps the half-naked Whore out onto the snow.
Viking Bob starts the jeep and they roar off.
160
WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT
Eric shoves Kenai and Neff out the door.
NEFF
What's wrong?
ERIC
Just stay out of my face until
I'm gone!
He slams the door.
Corbett smiles his Cheshire smile.
ERIC
(continuing; picks up ELT)
Emergency transmitter?
What
happened to signal mirrors or
two-tone smoke fires?
CORBETT
Lets us watch each other's backs
over a wide area.
Only thing
messed me up this time was
getting arrested in the baths.
ELT was in my duffel bag, not
around my neck where it should've
been.
ERIC
No way they'll find you on a
five-minute signal.
And no way
-more-
(CONTINUED)
160
CONTINUED:
ERIC (Cont'd)
they'll get here in eight hours
in this weather, unless they're
right around the corner.
CORBETT
They haven't disappointed me yet.
161
WILDER'S CABIN
It's 5:30 AM.
Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops
from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam
cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then
seals it with masking tape.
Watching him from the cell,
Corbett smiles.
CORBETT
Flashbomb, eh?
Eric doesn't answer.
He pulls on a heavy overcoat of
Wilder's.
Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk,
Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.
He puts it and some
speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.
163
DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE
Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall.
He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.
He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he
stands motionless in the snow.
Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse.
After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.
He
climbs up into the catwalk.
As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing.
Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway.
END MONTAGE
164
HOT SPRINGS SPA
Eric's unexpected appearance startles Kenai.
ERIC
I need to rent a cabin.
KENAI
What's the problem with Sam
Wilder's place?
ERIC
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
KENAI
Pretty clever:
If the trappers
got that signal beacon and get
here in time, Sam's is the first
place they'll look.
They may
figure you're waiting for an
airplane, so you can't stay in
the shack by the airstrip.
Last
place they'd expect you is on the
far side of town.
(shakes his head)
I can't afford any trouble --
ERIC
(takes out all his cash)
-- Here's a hundred dollars.
And
if you or anyone else will back
me up on this --
KENAI
(grabs money)
-- Forget it.
And try not to
bleed on my throw rugs.
(walks away, then turns
back)
Why do this?
ERIC
If you have to ask, you wouldn't
understand.
NEW ANGLE
Outside, there is the high-pitched WHINE of a snowmobile
(OS) driving into town.
Eric cautiously follows the SOUND.
165
NEFF'S HOUSE
Shaken, Neff opens the door and lets Eric in.
NEFF
I was just on my way to your
ladyfriend's, but I guess she
found you.
ERIC
Yeah.
Sorry I barked at you last
night.
NEFF
I'm the one should be sorry...
Goddamn Kenai, always out for a
score.
I never should've let him
go over there.
(CONTINUED)
165
CONTINUED:

ERIC
I'd sure like that favor you
offered a while back.
Neff gets a seasick look on his face.
NEFF
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count
on it turning this ugly.
ERIC
What are you talking about?
NEFF
Bastards killed Sam, you think
they won't kill the rest of us?
ERIC
There'll be three, four men at
the most.
I have some backup,
nothing will happen.
NEFF
I'm real sorry.
In a while,
you're gone from this country.
But we live here.
No one wants
to mix it up with those hombres.
Neff opens the door for Eric.
ERIC
(angry)
You don't care enough about Sam
to --
NEFF
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin.
He's why I came to Alaska.
All
his letters, saying what a
paradise it is.
But me ending up
dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
166
WILDER'S CABIN
Corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell.
CORBETT
Could've told you no one would
help...
Seeing Anne Marie, he smiles.
CORBETT
(continuing; to Anne Marie)
Maybe you can talk sense into
your boyfriend.
ERIC
Shut up!
CORBETT
(to Anne Marie)
Either way, you better clear out.
I don't want anyone innocent
getting harmed.
This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.
Angry,
Eric throws Corbett a coat.
Corbett puts it on.
Reaching
through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together.
ERIC
We're moving.
Let's go.
As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver.
168
RENTAL CABIN
The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a
beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove.
Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream.
Eric checks his watch.
6:15 AM.
He bolts the door and
blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from
outside.
He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney.
Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter.
ERIC
You'll catch a chill by that dumb
waiter shaft.
Sit on the cot.
(hands her the .44)
Keep this pointed at him if I get
preoccupied.
(CONTINUED)
168
CONTINUED:
Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun.
Trying to allay
her fears, Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face.
Corbett intently watches them.
Before he can say anything,
Eric shoots him a cold look.
Corbett stays quiet.
169
DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
A pall hangs over the town.
People know to stay inside.
Time crawls by.
In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.
He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside.
In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.
All the stalls are
empty.
In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow.
Dixie comes up behind him and puts her
hands on his shoulders.
He looks up at her, glum.
In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return.
In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.
10:45 AM.
170
RENTAL CABIN
Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor.
Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall.
After a moment of
silence, from outside, not too far away:
LEMALLE (OS)
Ben!
Speak out before I torch
every dump in town!
Eric points the magnum at Corbett.
ERIC
Answer and I'll shoot!
CORBETT
You kill me, you sign your death
warrant.
(re Anne Marie)
And hers.
173
RENTAL CABIN
His mind racing, Eric stares at Corbett.
Despite the
freezing temperature of the room, he's sweating.
CORBETT
They know I'm here.
I don't say
something, they'll plow this town
under.
You willing to accept
that responsibility?
Setting his resolve, Eric drags Corbett to the window.
He
pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbett's cheek.
ERIC
Say you're okay.
Tell them I'll
kill you if they rush us.
Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave
front.
Despite the gun in his face, Corbett remains calm.
CORBETT
(shouts through window)
Bob?
175
RENTAL CABIN
Eric pulls Corbett away from the window.
He shoots a look
at Anne Marie.
They're in a bind and she knows it.
177
RENTAL CABIN
Eric glances at Corbett, whose grim look certifies LeMalle's
boast.
CORBETT
Snow's to their advantage, kid.
You can't see them, but soon as
that plane comes, they'll sure as
hell know where we're going.
Wise up.
Take me to the Yukon.
I'll give you that money and
guarantee you'll walk away.
ERIC
Why offer a buyoff with your
gunmen waiting outside?
CORBETT
The time has passed for men like
them and me.
I know it.
But
they're still fighting for
survival, like cornered animals.
That's why they'll kill you.

(CONTINUED)
178
CONTINUED:
CORBETT (Cont'd)
(smiles)
Be rude to let that happen after
you kept me from freezing back
there.
Anne Marie tries to hide how tempted she is by Corbett's
offer.
ANNE MARIE
(to Eric)
He's right about the snow.
We're
blind.
Eric sighs -- is she against him, too?
From outside:
VIKING BOB (OS)
Ben?
The trappers are obviously much closer.
Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer.
NEW ANGLE
Eric and Corbett face the window.
They don't notice as Anne
Marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb
waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin.
Eric turns,
gasping as he realizes she's gone.
Corbett smiles
sardonically.
CORBETT
At least your girl had the sense
to jump ship.
Too bad she's the
only one small enough to fit
through that dumb waiter.
179
RENTAL CABIN
Eric looks at his watch.
10:55 AM.
183
RENTAL CABIN
Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft.
Anne Marie wriggles back
inside.
Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers
over his mouth.
She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3.
ANGLE ON TV
A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.
It's Devil's Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.
The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene.
Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes.
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. --
are pink and red.
And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi.
The trappers.
BACK TO SCENE
Corbett is amazed.
Eric smiles at Anne Marie.
(CONTINUED)
184
CONTINUED:
ERIC
Your infrared camera?
ANNE MARIE
(nods)
Technology in the wilderness.
Only problem is talking to you on
your way to the landing strip.
ERIC
I've got an idea.
We'll have to
work fast.
He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies,
then stops and looks up.
Outside, there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD.
The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance.
185
DANCE HALL
Anne Marie has turned on the rusty TV near the pulpit.
While watching the infrared IMAGE of the action outside, she
holds the microphone wired to the old PA.
ANGLE - THE TRAPPERS
Viking Bob gestures to Mitchell and LeMalle to separate.
ANNE MARIE (OS)
(over PA)
They're fanning out.
Angry, LeMalle BLASTS his rifle in direction of her VOICE.
LEMALLE
(to Viking Bob)
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck
she seein' us?
VIKING BOB
Doesn't matter.
We know where
they're going.
C'mon.
Stalking, anxious, LeMalle follows Viking Bob.

MITCHELL
splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow.

Corbett can't help but smile.

Watching the TV screen, Anne Marie sees one of the red blips
change direction and head toward her.
ANNE MARIE

One is moving back toward the
cabins.

DANCE HALL
The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.
Anne Marie
keys the PA microphone; it's dead, too.

KENAI'S HOUSE
The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder.
Kenai

Dixie looks
at him.
DIXIE

KENAI

Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside.
197
HOT SPRINGS SPA
It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING.
LeMalle looks around.
The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention.
He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.
He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up.
Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for
balance.
LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.
He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below.
Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.
The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.
With a
yelp, he splashes into the water below.
NEW ANGLE
Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.
ERIC
(to Corbett)
That'll keep him out of the cold.
LEMALLE
climbs out of the central pool, soaked.
He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down.
199
HOT SPRINGS SPA
Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's
ransacking for things to wear.
Kenai turns, startled, when

KENAI
(disgusted)
Lookit this damn mess.
Where in
hell's Wilder?
NEFF
(after a beat)
Dead.
Trappers killed him.
KENAI
Aw, Jesus.
Told you this was
trouble.
(to Meyerling)
What about you, big shot?
Do
something.
Who's side are you
on, anyway?
MEYERLING
Hey, I thought you people loved
Corbett and his wild men!
KENAI
This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for
business.
I'm sick of it.
MEYERLING
What about you, Neff?
NEFF
Well... two of the trappers are
down already --
MEYERLING
(suddenly on the bandwagon)
-- One left; three of us.
Let's
finish it.
NEFF
What about Eric Desmond?
MEYERLING
I'll handle him.
206
CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
removes his Walkman headphones.
Hearing LeMalle's
continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his two-way radio.
PILOT
(into radio mic)
Circle, this is BMY-955.
I just
touched down in Devil's Cauldron.
Nobody's here to greet me like
usual, and there's gunfire.
I'm
getting scarce.
With that, he STARTS his engines up again.
CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT
who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
life OS.
211
CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off.
He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly
opens.
WIDER
Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
ANNE MARIE
You can't leave yet.
PILOT
It's my responsibility to get
this aircraft out of here safely.
Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
PILOT
(continuing)
You got to be kidding.
ANNE MARIE
Leave the engines idling.
Go
back and open the side door.
Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
and obliges the little lady with the big gun.
212
AIRSTRIP DEPOT
The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof.
Boxes, wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about.
Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane.
Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.
Eric goes
for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door.
Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers.
Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
forward.
MEYERLING
Nobody wants any more killings;
we all agree to that, correct?
(no one argues)
That's good.
Now, Eric, you're
gonna hand your prisoner over to
us.
ERIC
Fuck you.
MEYERLING
This isn't your concern.
It's
over, here and now.
CORBETT
(to Meyerling)
Sure, when you put a bullet in my
back on the way out.
Easier for
all involved.
MEYERLING
Not a bad idea.
Face it, Ben.
There's no room in Alaska for you
any more.
Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-
and bear-spears.
MEYERLING
(continuing)
You're as antiquated as this
shit.
Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.
(CONTINUED)
212
CONTINUED:
ERIC
Keep back.
CORBETT
You're quite a piece of work,
Meyerling.
The tide changes, you
ride right along with it.
Eric looks at Neff.
ERIC
Neff, you know better than
this...
NEFF
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.
Step aside; stay out of it.
Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.
Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.
NEW ANGLE
Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet.
His right side is bathed in
blood.
Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
dead.
In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
massive Remington.
He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm.
Bracing
himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.
Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.
Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands, and hurls it.
There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.
LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest.
Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
the muzzle blast.
NEW ANGLE
There is a moment of silence.
Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.
Threatened,
Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.
Before Eric can do
anything, Meyerling FIRES.
The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.

With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp.
Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
and Neff pull them apart.
Eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
ERIC
(continuing)
Anybody moves and I'll shoot!
Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.
Bleeding
from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
ERIC
(continuing)
Can you walk?
CORBETT
Wound's a through-and-through.
Missed my liver, I think.
ERIC
Let's get out of here.
Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett
get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.
213
CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
While Eric takes Corbett's handcuffs off, Anne Marie looks
at his wound.
He waves her away.
ERIC
How come you didn't let him shoot
me?
CORBETT
(softly)
Like I said, I'd still be up on
that mountain, frozen solid, it
wasn't for you.
ERIC
We'll get you to a hospital, soon
as we get to Fairbanks.
(CONTINUED)
215
CONTINUED:
CORBETT
So they can patch me up and put
me in a cage?
Forget it.
Meyerling's right -- I'm a
dinosaur.
Greedy bastards like
him, it's their turn with this
land.
Put me in the woods, let
me live or die on my own.
He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.
CORBETT
(continuing; peers out
window)
Look down there, tell me what any
of this matters.
Struggles of
men get swallowed by the bigness.
Soon there won't be a trace of
our troubles... or us.
ERIC
You're wrong.
Everything we do
leaves its mark.
You said it
yourself -- there are hundred-
year-old footprints in the
tundra.
Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.
He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it.
EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAW
The exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a
grizzly beside a wilderness creek, with trees and mountains
in the background.
CORBETT
clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes.
NEW ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood --
on the back of his hand.
He stares at Corbett for a long
moment.
Then, resolved, he climbs up front and says
something to the Pilot.
Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts his
controls.
CUT TO:
216
CARGO PLANE
As it rolls to a stop, Eric throws open the cargo door.
Corbett sits up, surprised.
He and Eric exchange a long
look, then Corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly
steps down onto the snow-covered runway.
218
CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.
She kisses him.
The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.
PILOT

Too damn crazy in this state
anymore.
I'm moving back to L.A.
220
CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,
ice blue sky.
It banks and turns south.
Behind it, the
mountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.
FADE OUT
