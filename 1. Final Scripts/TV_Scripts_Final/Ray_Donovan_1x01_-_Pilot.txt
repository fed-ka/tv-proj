                                                             The Bag or the Bat  

                                                                                05/26/11       INT.  WALPOLE PRISON MASS. - DAY

      A man, MICKEY DONOVAN, hard, mid- 70's, is being released. 
      As he is being processed out by a WARDEN and a SOCIAL WORKER.

                                      WARDEN
                    Different world out there, Mickey. 
                    Stay out of trouble.

      Mickey signs the final paperwork, is presented with some
      clothes from the 80's.

                                      WARDEN (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck is that, a leisure
                    suit?

      They all get a laugh out of them.  Mickey pushes them back,
      you keep them.  An emotional moment.  None of them knows
      what to do or say.  Mickey swallows hard and exits.

      EXT.  WALPOLE PRISON - DAY

      As Mickey looks up at the blue, blue sky.  Freedom.  It's
      been a long time coming.  No one is there to meet him.  It
      is winter, there is snow banked along the streets.

      EXT. HOUSE - DORCHESTER

      An old wooden house.  Mickey pays off a sketchy looking guy
      in his 50's, who steps aside as he opens up the door.

      INT.  HOUSE - DORCHESTER

      Mickey takes it in.  He is flooded with memories.  No time
      for this now.  He peeks through the window to make sure the
      caretaker is waiting by his car at the curb.  Then Mickey
      counts the wooden steps up to the second floor.  He stops at
      10.  Leans down and unpries a floorboard on the stairs. 
      Reaches inside and gets a small steel box.  Opens it up. 
      Inside is a gun.

      INT. CHURCH BASEMENT APT. - NIGHT

      An elderly man is getting ready for bed.  Listening to
      liturgical music.  Loud.  He is startled suddenly by movement
      in the doorway.  He looks up to see Mickey, who closes the
      door and approaches him quickly.  Before the Man can shout
      or try to escape, Mickey wrestles him down to the bed, forcing
      the gun into his mouth.  It is a terrible thing to watch.                                                                                        2.

                                      MICKEY
                    How does it feel you cocksucker? 
                    You like it?

      After a moment or two of this, Mickey removes the gun.  Aims
      it at the man, who is now resigned to his fate.  Something
      in his posture and eyes tells us he has been waiting for
      this moment a long, long time.  Mickey backs up a few steps
      and fires.  The sound is swallowed by the music.  Mickey
      turns and leaves the room, taking the gun with him.

      CREDITS ROLL and we cross fade the MUSIC with --

      Doris Day singing "Hooray for Hollywood", in her cheerful
      sunny voice.

      EXT. SUNSET BLVD. LOS ANGELES -MORNING

      As we cruise along the Sunset Strip.  Ghostly quiet this
      early.  We pass many iconic sights, until we see the boxy,
      modern Mondrian up ahead.  We stop, and then move up across
      the facade of the building.  Past the awning of the Penthouse
      and through the balcony into the dark rooms beyond, where
      the sunlight is just penetrating.

      INT. MONDRIAN PENTHOUSE - MORNING

      A young black basketball star, DEONTE FRASIER, is just coming
      to.  The room is dark.  Lots of bottles, evidence of a party. 
      He yawns, sits up.  Next to him, in bed, a naked young woman
      with a bad nosebleed and fake tits.  Her eyes are open.  It
      takes DEONTE a moment to realize she is dead.  As he freaks --

      We move back out of the room, faster now, along Sunset, the
      huge iconic mansions -- zipping through Beverly Hills,
      everything verdant and lush, the jacaranda blooming like
      mad.  And we begin to HEAR THE SOUNDS OF RAP MUSIC, over the
      other music now --

      The camera swoops over bluffs now, down to the aqua Pacific,
      along the Coast, past beautiful palaces perched on the edge
      of the sparkling water, and finally lands in a neighborhood
      with a mix of huge houses, all in wildly disparate
      architectural styles --

      CALABASAS

      EXT.  RAY'S HOUSE -MORNING

      RAY DONOVAN, 45, is in bed, sleeping, next to his wife ABBY. 
      The dulcet sounds of Doris Day have been totally replaced by
      the heavy thumping.                                                                                          3.

      Rap music coming from somewhere in this upscale neighborhood. 

                                    ABBY
                      Goddammit.  

      Ray throws an arm across her.

                                    RAY
                    Go back to sleep.

      She sits up on an elbow, stares at him.  He is a handsome
      man.  Abby is in her early forties, has more of a Boston
      accent than Ray, who has mostly gotten rid of his.  

                                    ABBY
                    You think they'd put up with this
                    shit in Beverly Hills?
                          (beat)
                    We're freaking moving, Ray.

      Ray's cell phone rings.  He looks at it.  It says DEONTE. 
      He has to take it.

      We INTERCUT between Ray and DEONTE at The Mondrian --

                                    RAY
                    Yeah, Deonte --what's up?

                                      DEONTE
                          (whispers)
                    I'm at The Mondrian.
                          (beat)
                    I got a strange female in the bed
                    with me.

                                    RAY
                    Alright, what's the problem?  She
                    want money?

                                      DEONTE
                    I think she's dead.

                                    RAY
                    Did you kill her?

      Ray looks at Abby, she knows to get up and leave, she is
      used to this.

                                      DEONTE
                    No, dog,I didn't even fuck her!  She
                    was doing blow all night!  I think
                    she overdosed!  Oh my god!                                                                                        4.

                                    RAY
                    Take your hand and put it under her
                    nose.

                                      DEONTE
                    I can't!  I think there's blood there. 
                    She had a nosebleed.  My dick is
                    covered in blood!  This is so
                    extreme!!

                                    RAY
                    Do it now, Deonte.

                                      DEONTE
                          (starts to cry)
                      I can't!!!  Oh my god, what if she
                    passed?

                                    RAY
                    You think you're the first person
                    I've dealt with woke up in bed with
                    a dead body?  Take your fingers and
                    feel for a breath.  If she's alive
                    we need to save her life.

      Deonte does.

                                      DEONTE
                    She's dead, dog.
                          (beat)
                    I don't even know her!  I met her
                    last night in the Sky Bar!  I don't
                    even do drugs --I'm an athlete!

                                    RAY
                    Alright, listen to me.  Don't touch
                    anything, don't call anyone.  I'm
                    sending someone.

                                      DEONTE
                    I just signed an 80 million dollar
                    contract, cuz!!  TMZ was following
                    me last night!

                                    RAY
                    Calm down.  I'm on it.  Just sit
                    tight.

      Ray hangs up.  Makes a call.  Connects with someone on the
      other end.  This is AVI THE JEW, his #1.  Avi is enormous --
      just huge.  Solid muscle with a thick overlay of fat.  Maybe
      Mossad once?                                                                                          5.

      He is sitting alone at Nate and Al's, in front of a staggering
      amount of food.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Av?  We have a situation at The
                    Mondrian.  Deonte Frasier's got a
                    dead girl in his bed.  I think she
                      overdosed.  Get over there and hold
                    his hand, see what's what.

                                    AVI THE JEW (V.O.)
                    I'm on it, Raymond.

      RAY hangs up, goes into action, dials another number.  This
      is his #2, LENA, 28.  She is dark, intense.    We Intercut --

                                    LENA (V.O.)
                    Yo, boss.

                                    RAY
                    Lena, honey.  Get to the office now. 
                    I'll call you back in 10 minutes
                    when I'm on the road.  Deonte
                    Frasier's in bed at the Mondrian
                    with a dead girl, maybe a hooker.

                                    LENA (V.O.)
                    I hate when that happens.

      She hangs up, turns to the young woman next to her in bed.

                                    LENA (CONT'D)
                    I have to leave.  Get dressed.

      Back to Ray, who is madly hurrying now, grabbing clothes and
      slamming into the shower.

      INT.  KITCHEN - CALABASAS - MORNING

      Ray is dressed, a button up cashmere polo, nice jeans,
      loafers.  He carries a garment bag, lays it down across a
      chair.  Abby is sitting having a cup of coffee.  Ray pours a
      cup, downs it fast.  The thumping of rap music continues.

      Their kid, BRIDGET, 14, already dressed for school in some
      tarty outfit, has a huge poster board she is finishing gluing
      a piece onto.  It is a family tree for a school project.

                                    RAY
                    You're not going to school in that.                                                                                        6.

                                    ABBY
                    This is how they dress in Calabasas. 
                    You want her to dress different, she
                    needs to go to Buckley or
                      Harvard/Westlake.  

                                      BRIDGET
                    I'm not wearing a uniform.

      Ray grabs his keys, then stops, can't help himself -studies
      the family tree for a moment.  On Abby's side, lots and lots
      of siblings with kids.  On his side, his brothers TERRY and
      BUNCHY, with no children underneath.  And a sister, BRIDGET,
      with the word "deceased" under it.  Also, his father and
      mother, both with "deceased" under their names.

                                    RAY
                    That's nice, honey.

                                    ABBY
                    She needs to talk to Bunchy and Terry. 
                    She has to interview everyone.

      Ray nods okay, but he doesn't seem thrilled by the idea.

                                      BRIDGET
                    How come they didn't have any kids?

                                    ABBY
                    Terry's got Parkinson's, honey.

      Their son, CONOR, 12, comes in.  He's a tough little fucker,
      has a bruise under his eye.  Ray is about to walk out,
      immediately notices it. 

                                    RAY
                    What's that?

                                    ABBY
                    Your son's getting in fights.

                                      CONOR
                    Bullshit.  I fell at soccer.
                          (he's heard the
                            Parkinson's comment)
                    Does that mean we're gonna get it?

                                    RAY
                    No, Terry got it from boxing.  He
                    got hit in the head too much.

      He is at the door when --                                                                                        7.

                                      CONOR
                    So why didn't Bunchy have kids?

      A beat.  Ray doesn't like talking about them.  At all.

                                    ABBY
                    He has issues.

                                      BRIDGET
                    He got molested by a priest when
                    they were little.

      Ray shoots Abby a dirty look, can't believe she shared this
      with Bridget --

                                      CONOR
                          (he's never heard
                            this)
                    Really?

                                      BRIDGET
                    Yeah, that's why Dad was always so
                    obsessed about no one touching our
                    privates.  And it's why we don't go
                    to church.

      Abby, furious at the continued thumping, gets up and starts
      to do her version of a hip-hop dance, exaggerated and obscene. 
      Conor laughs, Bridget is disgusted.  Ray watches her, they
      still dig each other.  He grabs his garment bag --

                                    RAY
                    I gotta go, where's my i-Pad?

      Abby has it, has been reading his Calendar.  He grabs it
      from her,  pissed off.

                                    ABBY
                    You didn't tell me you're doing
                    something for Stu Feldman -- 

      Ray won't discuss his clients --

                                    ABBY (CONT'D)
                    He's on the board at Marlborough.

      Ray still doesn't say anything.  Finally --

                                    RAY
                    I'll try.                                                                                        8.

                                    ABBY
                    Not good enough, Ray.  Promise me.

      Conor looks at Ray nervously.  Ray nods, moves to the door--

                                    ABBY (CONT'D)
                    Say it.

                                    RAY
                      I promise.

      Ray goes to Conor.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    You're fighting, I want to know.

      Conor ignores him.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    You hear me?  Con?

                                      CONOR
                    Yes.

      Ray cups his face with his hand, examines the bruise, then
      kisses the top of his head and leaves the room.

      INT.  RAY'S CAR- MOVING -DAY

      He's driving fast through Calabasas.  Passes a huge vulgar
      mansion where the LOUD RAP MUSIC is coming from.  Ray pulls
      over, sits studying the house for a second.  He's on the
      speaker phone with Avi.    Intercut between Ray and Avi, now
      inside the Mondrian Penthouse with --

      Deonte, who is sitting in a chair, his head in his hands.  

      Avi is busy spraying the room to find fingerprints.  As they
      appear, he wipes them down.  A large black case is on the
      bed, with his tools.

                                    RAY
                     You got it under control?

                                    AVI THE JEW
                    So far, so good.

      Ray gets beeped.  It is Lena. 

      THE SCREEN SPLITS INTO THREE PARTS NOW, WE SEE EACH OF THEM
      IN CLOSE UP AS RAY JUGGLES CALLS.                                                                                          9.

                                    LENA
                    I called our plant at TMZ, nothing
                    about anything with Deonte or The
                    Mondrian --

                                    RAY
                    Good. Get me Lee Drexler -- 

      Ray has already pulled away from the rap house, zips onto
      the freeway.  

      As Lena connects him with this call --  THE SCREEN NOW SPLITS
      INTO FOUR PARTS, TO INCLUDE LEE DREXLER, 50, with a short
      silver buzz cut.  He is a power broker, one of the handful
      of lawyers who control the town.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                          (to Lena)
                    Hold on, doll --
                          (talks to LEE)
                    Lee, where are we with the Tommy
                    Jenkins thing?

      LEE DREXLER is apoplectic.

                                    LEE DREXLER
                    Where are we?  His career is finished,
                    that's where we are.
                          (beat)
                    Guy has a 200 million dollar
                      heterosexual movie coming out in a
                    month?!!! Picks up a trannie on Sunset
                    Blvd?

      We HOLD ON A CLOSE UP OF RAY.  The wheels are spinning --

                                    RAY
                    Can you get him in to your office
                    now?  Ten minutes or so?

                                    LEE
                    Yeah, I'll teleport him.

                                    RAY
                    Get him there as soon as you can, I
                    got an idea -- we can kill two birds
                    with one stone.

      Lee hangs up to do it, and Ray suddenly pulls off the freeway,
      horns beeping, as he whips his car onto an off ramp. 

      As he reconnects with Lena --                                                                                        10.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Call Avi back, tell him to finish
                    cleaning the room.  I'll be there in 
                    thirty minutes.

      He is almost zen calm now, because he knows exactly how he
      is going to handle things. 

      EXT.  GOODMAN/DREXLER LAW FIRM

      The enormous building on Wilshire which houses the law firm
      that is Ray's biggest client.  As Ray zooms into the
      underground parking.

      INT. GOODMAN/DREXLER

      Ray enters LEE DREXLER'S OFFICE.  Lee, 50, is screaming at --

      A young actor, blonde, built, TOMMY JENKINS, 20's, who nods
      at Ray as Ray comes in --

                                    LEE
                          (to Ray)
                    You know what this asshole just told
                    me?  He was raised to help a woman! 
                    A woman?!
                          (to Tommy)
                    Women don't have cocks, you moron! 

                                      TOMMY
                    It was the middle of the night --she
                    ran out of gas!

                                    LEE
                    Shut the fuck up!

                                      TOMMY
                          (to Ray)
                    I didn't know it was a guy!  On my
                    life. 

                                    LEE
                    Yeah, what about the one who called
                    Marty Gross at Stalkerazzi saying
                    you picked him up a month before
                    that?  

                                      TOMMY
                    You know how many guys look like me? 
                    People are asking for the Tommy
                    Jenkins body at my gym!                                                                                        11.

                                    LEE
                    You fucking cocksucking liar!!  You
                    know what's gonna happen to you? 
                    You're gonna be taking it up the ass
                    in 3-D!  For the rest of your life!!

      Ray turns to Lee --

                                    RAY
                    Lee, lemme handle this.

                                      TOMMY
                    I didn't know it was a guy!  I swear!!

                                    LEE
                          (shouting)
                    Guy had an adam's apple the size of
                    my fist!!  
                          (beat)
                    I'm not your lawyer anymore!  Your
                    career is over!

      Ray is waiting.  Tommy starts to cry.

                                    RAY
                    Tommy, look at me.

      Tommy does.

                                      TOMMY
                    I'm so sorry!  I'm so embarrassed! 
                    It's like I'm addicted or something.

                                    RAY
                    Tommy, listen to me.  I have a way
                    to get you out of this.  

                                      TOMMY
                    How?  What?

                                    RAY
                    You're gonna go away for six weeks. 

                                      TOMMY
                    Away?  Away where?

                                    RAY
                    Rehab.  If you do what I tell you,
                    you'll get your career back.  You
                    wanna do that?

      Tommy nods tentatively.                                                                                        12.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    But once we put this in motion,
                    there's no turning back.  You're not
                    gonna like the medicine.  But it'll
                    save your career.  You want your
                    career back?

      A long beat.  Tommy nods yes.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. SUNSET STRIP - MORNING

      He and Tommy are racing to The Mondrian.  Ray's back on the
      phone with Lena.

                                    RAY
                    Call TMZ and leak the news that Tommy
                    Jenkins is at The Mondrian with a
                    dead girl.  Then get over there and
                    represent him.  You're his press
                    agent, or you work for the studio.
                    You try to control the story.

                                    LENA
                    Got it, boss.

      Tommy Jenkins looks panicked as the seriousness of this starts
      to hit him.

                                      TOMMY
                    Did I kill her?

                                    RAY
                    No.  She overdosed.

                                      TOMMY
                    I'm gonna throw up.

      INT.  PENTHOUSE - THE MONDRIAN

      Ray and Tommy are both there.  So is Deonte.

                                      DEONTE
                    Thanks for doing this, man.  I'll
                    get you front row seats to all my
                    games, dog.

      Tommy is too freaked out to talk.  He keeps staring at the
      dead girl, her fake tits.                                                                                        13.

      Avi finishes vacumning pubic hairs off the bed with a hand-
      held dust buster.

                                    RAY
                          (to Deonte)
                    What'd you tell your wife?

                                      DEONTE
                    That I got back from Vegas early, I
                    missed her.  Gonna take her to The
                    Ivy.

                                    RAY
                    No, have breakfast here, that way if
                    someone sees you here, you're with
                    your wife, nobody connects you with
                    the dead girl.

      Avi takes out a syringe and draws fresh blood from inside
      the dead hooker's nose.  Injects it into a little plastic
      cup, then hands the cup to Tommy.

                                    AVI THE JEW
                    Go smear this on your dick.  She had
                      a nosebleed and bled on your dick. 
                    Bring the cup back to me.

      Tommy looks like he's going to faint.

      EXT.  THE MONDRIAN - MORNING

      Out in front.  TMZ, who has offices down the street, have
      taken minutes to get there.  Other Papparrazi have gathered. 
      Lena is there, she and the manager are keeping everyone behind
      a roped off area.

                                    TMZ GUY
                    Is he in there?

                                    LENA
                    Yes, I can confirm that Tommy Jenkins
                    is in the hotel.  That's all I can
                    tell you at this point. 

      She's good.

      INT. THE MONDRIAN - MORNING

      Avi is checking the hallway.  He nods once to Deonte, who
      waits just inside the room.  Deonte strolls out of the room,
      down the hallway, Avi just in front of him, on the lookout
      for anyone who might fuck this up.                                                                                        14.

      EXT.  THE MONDRIAN - MORNING

      The crowd is really getting huge now.  This is a big, big
      story.  Lena watches as a cop car pulls up.  A uniform cop
      gets out, with another cop.  Lena reads his nametag --

                                    LENA
                    Officer Davis, my client is inside. 
                    I believe he's in some trouble. 
                    Could I come in with you?

                                      OFFICER DAVIS
                    Yeah, come on.

      EXT.  THE MONDRIAN TERRACE - MORNING

      Deonte is holding the hand of his gorgeous blinged out, bi-
      racial wife.  They are having breakfast in the outdoor living
      room.

      RAY -- walks past them, on his way out.  He and Deonte nod
      to each other.

      EXT.  THE MONDRIAN - MORNING

      Ray has parked on the street by the side of the hotel.  He
      gets into his car and takes off.  Immediately calls Lee.  We
      intercut --

                                    LEE
                    This gonna fly?

                                    RAY

                    him go in a few hours, we put him
                    straight into Promises.

                    I was gonna go see Ezra.                                                                                        15.

                                    LEE
                    Ezra's fine.  He's grieving.  You'll
                    see him tomorrow at the service. 
                    Get over to Paramount.  

                                    RAY
                    Lee?  Do me a favor.  Don't tell me
                    what to do.

      Ray hangs up on him. 

      Lee simultaneously picks up a call from Marty Gross at
        Stalkerazzi.

                                    LEE
                    Marty, my friend! I told you he's
                    not a fag!!  You see that trannie? 
                    I would have fucked that trannie!
                    You drop the fag stuff, I'll get you
                    the first interview with him from
                    rehab.  

      Ray has turned around in the hills, pulls in front of The
      Mondrian to get back onto Sunset just as Tommy Jenkins is
      brought out by Officer Davis.  Lena is with him.  The
      Papparazzi go nuts. 

      As Ray drives past them, we pan up to reveal a huge billboard
      of Tommy, cradling an Uzi.  It reads "Bo Bronson Back to
      Save the World" with the single word "May" underneath.

      EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS -MORNING

      Ray drives through the gates to valet parking.

      INT. STU FELDMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Anorexic, late 30's, with a kind of intense unearned intimacy. 
      He has a red string tied around one of his wrists.  He touches
      it incessantly.  Ray sits across from him.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    I been seeing this chick, I want you
                    to follow her, see if she's fucking
                    around on me.

      Ray nods.  His phone is vibrating.  He looks at it.  It says
      "Terry."

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm married.  Lee told you that,
                    right?                                                                                        16.

      Again Ray nods.

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    You think I'm a scumbag, right? 
                    Married, but I'm fucking around with
                    this chick? 

                                    RAY
                    I'm not here to judge you.  It's not
                    what I do.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    You don't think I know what you do? 
                    Lee says you're the best PI in town.
                          (beat)
                    I love my wife but this chick has
                    her claws in me.  Sexually.  My wife
                    doesn't want to have sex with me
                    anymore.  I don't feel good about
                    myself.  You ever do growth hormone?

      Ray shakes his head no.  Stu Feldman continues to play with
      the red string on his wrist.

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    You think it's Kabbalah, right? 
                    It's not.  It's to remind me it's
                    the hand of taking.  It should be
                    the hand of giving.  I want to give
                    more.

      Ray thinks about the Abby thing for a moment, the fact that
      he is on the board of Marlborough.

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    I don't want her to know I'm having
                    her followed, she has trust issues.

                                    RAY
                    No problem.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    She was one of those Disney kids,
                    parents stole all her money.  Now
                    she's a singer. Like Britney. Maybe
                    I'll help her cut a comeback album.

      When Ray just looks at him.

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    Alright, good.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        17.

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    Let me know when you know something. 
                    Either way.  I gotta know.

      He and Ray shake hands.

                                    RAY
                    I'll be in touch.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    You don't talk alot.  I like that. 
                    I'm gonna start doing that.  Makes
                    you very mysterious.  I think I give
                    away my power too much.

      He waits for an answer from Ray.  There isn't one.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT.  BEVERLY HILLS - MORNING

      As Ray gets out of his car outside a small brick office
      building.  Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he sees a
      beautiful woman approaching, fast.

                                      DIVORCEE
                    You prick.

      She goes to hit him, Ray catches her hand, holds it tight.

                                    RAY
                    Relax.  I got you a good settlement. 
                    He would have given you nothing.

      He gives her a look --"are you gonna cut it the fuck out if
      I let go of your hand?".  He does, she moves off.

      INT.  RAY'S OFFICE - MORNING

      An old walk-up brick building in Beverly Hills.  A trellised
      patio.  Ray has the top floor.  It's elegant, well-decorated,
      three female assistants work at desks in separate rooms. 
      AVI THE JEW sits waiting for someone to come back on the
      line.  LENA appears in the doorway, holding a piece of paper,
      hands Ray a big heavy leather bag --which he goes through,
      checking equipment.

                                    LENA
                    Terry's called three times.

      Ray nods, processing this.                                                                                        18.

                                    LENA (CONT'D)
                    Your neighbor? He's a rapper.  Def-
                    Kon 3.  He moved to Calabasas two
                    years ago from Atlanta.  He's been
                    busted four times already -- weapons
                    stuff, DUI, marijuana bust at LAX.  

      As Ray digests this.  To all --

                                    RAY
                    I'm gonna go sit on Feldman's girl.   

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

      Ray is driving towards Malibu.  The water sparkles.  He's
      listening to James Brown.  "It's a Man's World".

      Over this music we cut to--

      A SHITTY ROOM IN A BY THE HOUR HOTEL -BOSTON

      Mickey Donovan, the man we saw kill the priest, is sitting
      with a towel wrapped around his waist.  He is with A BLACK
      HOOKER, who passes him a joint.  As he takes a deep toke --

                                      HOOKER
                    Easy, baby.  Stuff's alot stronger
                    now.

      The MUSIC segues into "Pappa's got a brand new Bag". Mickey,
      stoned, gets up and does a dance that went out of fashion
      twenty years ago.  He's feeling good.  Over this --

                                                                                BACK TO:

      EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

      Ray talks to his phone set-up, instructing it to call back  --

                                    RAY
                    Terry --

      INT.  TERRY DONOVAN'S FITE CLUB - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

      The music carries over. A pay phone on the wall rings and
      rings. 

      TERRY DONOVAN, Ray's brother, is in the ring, training a
      black guy in his mid-20's, DARYLL.                                                                                        19.

      Terry is in his early 40's, with thick glasses and a buzz
      cut.  He  moves beautifully, with grace and ease.  Until he
      steps out of the ring --when the tremors from his Parkinson's
      kick in.  He drags one foot and has a raspy voice, muscles
      in his neck strained despite the Botox injections that help
      the tremors.

                                      TERRY
                    That's it!  Go to the body, then
                    upstairs!  Everything behind the jab --

      Percussive blasts from Daryll, which Terry absorbs easily
      with pads.

      POTATO PIE, an elderly black man, who is Terry's cut man,
      all around factotum, approaches, swings up to Terry --

                                      POTATO PIE
                    Your brother's on the phone.  Ray.

      Daryll pays close attention to this.  As Terry limps out of
      the ring to the pay-phone, Potato Pie glares at Daryll with
      an intense hatred.

                                      POTATO PIE (CONT'D)
                    You too old to be a fighter.  And
                    you ugly.

      Daryll sighs, used to this abuse from him.  He starts to
      jump rope, as Potato Pie takes Terri's pads with him as he
      exits the ring.

      TERRY: answers the dangling phone.  INTERCUT with Ray driving.

                                    RAY
                    What's going on Terry?

                                      TERRY
                    Bunchy had a slip.

      A long silence.  He HOLD on Ray's face.  He is phobic about
      his brothers and this is upsetting news.  

                                    RAY
                    Where is he?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. SNAP MEETING - CHURCH - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

      An acronym for the Survivors Network of those Abused by
      Priests.  A 12 step meeting kind of thing.                                                                                          20.

      BUNCHY DONOVAN sits wearing a wool cap, despite the heat. 
      He's drunk.  About twelve men sit in folding chairs in a
      small room in the basement of this church.  One of them,
      Kevin, is talking.

                                      KEVIN
                    He was a big, charismatic guy.  Tells
                    my parents I'm an athlete, he thinks
                    I should play tennis.  This was a
                    big deal in my family, a priest paying
                    attention to me.  I was so flattered.

                                      BUNCHY
                          (shouting out in
                            sympathy)
                      Motherfucker!

      Kevin is overcome.  Someone shushes Bunchy.

                                      KEVIN
                    Takes me to this health club and
                    tells me we gotta shower first.
                          (beat)
                    That was the first time he molested
                    me.  I was shaking so hard after, I
                    couldn't hold the racket.  Drops me
                    off and winks at me.  I come in the
                    house, my mother says "how was it,
                    Kev, was it thrillin"?

      He is quiet for a long beat.

                                      KEVIN (CONT'D)
                          (shouting)
                    I'm gonna tell my mother this man
                    raped me?  This man's next to God!

      Bunchy's eyes fill up listening.  He can't help himself --

                                      BUNCHY
                    That's God's representative on earth!

                                      KEVIN
                          (encouraged by Bunchy))
                    Rape a child on Friday?  Rape another
                    child on Saturday, and then hold
                    Mass on Sunday?

      Bunchy's phone rings.  People turn to look at him, pissed. 
      He gets up and goes outside to take the call.  It is Ray,
      driving in his car.  Intercut --                                                                                        21.

                                    RAY
                    Hey Bunch, what's up?

                                      BUNCHY
                    You talk to Terry yet?

      Ray is quiet for a beat.  Do they know about their father
      getting out?

                                    RAY
                    Yeah, what's going on Bunchy?  Talk
                    to me.

      Dead silence.  Then --

                                      BUNCHY
                    My settlement just came through. 
                    1.4 million dollars cause a priest 
                    messed around with me when I was a
                    kid?
                          (beat)
                    I thought I'd be so happy when the
                    money came.

                                    RAY
                    You want me to send someone?  Come
                    get you?

                                      BUNCHY
                          (hurt)
                    Send someone?
                          (beat)
                    Nah, I ain't done drinking yet.

      He hangs up on Ray, who looks very concerned.



      EXT. MALIBU - DAY

      A private stretch of beach.  Multi-million dollar homes
      crammed next to each other with only inches between them. 
      But the view, the air.

      Ray is down the beach, with binoculars.

      POV: through binoculars, he sees a man, mid-30's, balding,
      who is hiding behind a pillar that supports an old wooden
      house.  He is gazing up at the house next door.  He is
        surreptitiously masturbating, to the sight off --                                                                                        22.

      ASHLEY RUCKER: a gorgeous, fresh-faced young pop star, late
      20's, who is practicing yoga on her deck.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. MALIBU - DAY

      Avi and Ray are standing on the street, the Pacific Coast
      Highway behind them, cars zipping past.  They watch as the
      stalker drives away in a small beat up car.  Avi lowers
      binoculars, finishes writing something on a small pad.

                                    AVI THE JEW
                    I got his plates, I'll call it in to
                    Lena for an address.
                          (beat)
                    I got a bad feeling, this is a bad
                    guy. 

      Ray is quiet for a long moment, makes a decision, starts to
      move towards Abby's front door.

                                    AVI THE JEW (CONT'D)
                    Ray, what are you doing?  You can't
                    fucking do that.  You gonna give up
                    Feldman?

      Ray keeps on, ignores him.

                                    AVI THE JEW (CONT'D)
                    You said you weren't gonna do this
                    shit anymore.  She's not the client! 
                    Stu Feldman's the client!  Goddammit,
                    Ray!

      He's pissed.  He gets in his van and leaves.

      EXT.  ASHLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

      Ray has rung her bell.  She comes to the door, opens it.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Jesus.  Ray Donovan.

                                    RAY
                    You always open the door like that? 
                    Without asking who it is?  

      She laughs, taken aback.                                                                                        23.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I do when it's you.  How the hell
                    are you, Ray?

                                    RAY
                    Pretty good.  You?

      She shrugs.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Better than the last time I saw you. 
                    What was I, 16? 
                          (beat)
                    Trying to get my fucking money back
                    from my parents.  Assholes.  Did I
                    ever thank you?

                                    RAY
                    You did.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I'm a musician now.

                                    RAY
                    I know.  My kids like you.

                                      ASHLEY
                          (teasing him)
                    Your kids? 

      He smiles, embarrased.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    So, what are you doing here, Ray?

                                    RAY
                    You have a stalker.

      She starts to laugh, looks behind him for a camera crew --

                                      ASHLEY
                    I'm being punked, right?

                                    RAY
                    No.

      There is something about his demeanor, his absolute
        seriousness, that shoves the laugh down her throat.  

      She steps aside and ushers him in.                                                                                        24.

      INT. BAR HOLLYWOOD- DAY

      Bunchy's drinking a beer, talking with a red faced bruiser
      who sits next to him.  Other misfits, regulars, who sit
      drinking the day away.  A tough crowd. 

      TERRY: enters the dark bar, it takes a moment for his eyes
      to adjust.  He spots Bunchy.

                                      TERRY
                    Party's over, Bunch.  Let's go.

      The man next to Bunchy, swivels around on his stool, takes
      in the sight of Terry, who is limping towards Bunchy.

                                    MAN AT BAR
                    What are you, his fucking mother? 
                    We're conversing.

                                      TERRY
                    I'm not talking to you.

      He imitates Terry's raspy voice, then gets off his chair,
      starts to imitate his walk, dragging one foot --

                                    MAN AT BAR
                    I'm not talking to you --

      Before he can get the sentence out, Terry jabs him with a
      single perfect jab, lightning fast.  He goes down.  One of
      his friends stands up.  So does Bunchy, who faces this new
      guy.  Another rough looking drunk approaches Terry.  It's
      on. 

      INT.  ASHLEY'S HOUSE - MALIBU

      She is shaken by Ray's news about her stalker.  Ray is doing
      a security check on her doors, windows.  He walks around
      testing everything.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Should I get a gun?  Should I move?
                          (beat)
                    I'm alone here.  I love my freedom. 
                    I have to look over my shoulder every
                    minute now?

      Ray doesn't say anything.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    But how did you even know about him?                                                                                        25.

      Again, Ray is quiet.  She can't compute it, and then suddenly,
      it hits her --

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    Look at me.

      Ray does.  Her vulnerability is turning him on.  It always
      does --

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    It's Stu, isn't it?  He hired you to
                    spy on me.

                                    RAY
                    Yes.

       She gets up, starts to pace. 

                                      ASHLEY
                    That fucking asshole!  He's married,
                    did you know that?  What does he
                    want from me?

      She pulls out of a bottle of vodka from her freezer, pours a
      glass, slugs it down.  Gestures to Ray, does he want one? 
      He shakes his head no.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    Why are you telling me this?

                                    RAY
                    I don't like women getting hurt.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Oh my god!  Hurt?  Who is this guy?

                                    RAY
                    I don't know yet.
                          (beat)
                    There are things we can do to mitigate
                    it.

                                      ASHLEY
                      "Mitigate" it?
                          (beat)
                    I don't want a dog.  My last dog
                    died of cancer, I can't handle it
                    right now.

      Ray nods sympathetically.  She continues drinking.                                                                                        26.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD ARMS APT. - DAY

      Avi watches from his van as Ashley Rucker's stalker pulls
      into the underground parking structure for a shitty building
      in a bad neighborhood.

      INT.  ASHLEY'S - DAY - EVENING

      She is hitting the vodka hard now.  They are sitting across
      from each other.  

                                      ASHLEY
                    I won't betray you.  To Stu.

                                    RAY
                    I'm not worried about him.

                                    ABBY
                    What about your job?

                                    RAY
                    I'm not worried about that either.

      She laughs.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Are you for real, Raymond?

      Ray smiles. She leans over and takes his hand, turns it over
      and studies it --

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    This is your dominant hand?

                                    RAY
                    Yeah.

      She traces a line on it with her finger --

                                      ASHLEY
                    Your heart line.  You fall in love
                    easily --

      Ray turns his hand back over, pulls her to him.  They kiss.

      He stands her up, backs her against the wall.  They continue
      to kiss, savagely.  She starts to make strange sounds and
      then her eyes roll back in her head.  Ray lowers her to the
      ground, where she continues to convulse quietly.  After a
      few long moments the storm of seizures stops and she comes
      back, looks up at him with total mortification --                                                                                        27.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god!  I'm so embarrassed!

                                    RAY
                    It's okay.  You're gonna be okay --

      She starts to sob.  She sits up and leans against him.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I have epilepsy and I stopped taking
                    my meds -- and I've been trying to
                    cure it with yoga and herbs and I'm
                    not supposed to drink, the sugar
                    fucks me up --

      She is crying hard now.  Ray holds her and she sort of rocks
      against him.

                                    RAY
                    You're gonna be alright.  Is there
                    someone I can call?

                                      ASHLEY
                    No, I'm all alone!  What am I doing
                    with my life?  What the fuck am I
                    doing?  Why am I seeing Stu?  He's a
                    terrible person!  I'm so fucked up --

                                    RAY
                    It's okay.
                          (rote, a line he has
                            used before)
                    You're in the solution now.  

                                      ASHLEY
                          (tasting the words)
                    You're in the solution now.  I
                    remember that.  I love that.  
                          (beat)
                    What does it mean?

                                    RAY
                    It means you're gonna start doing
                    what you need to do to get your life
                    in order.  Stop opening the door to
                      strangers.  You need to get a dog. 
                    Not a gun.  You get a gun, they use
                    it on you. Get a security system. 

      She digests this.  He kind of wants to split, at the same
      time, feels a need to protect her, make sure she is okay.                                                                                        28.

      INT. JAIL - NIGHT

      Bunchy and Terry are in a holding cell.  Daryll has come to
      get them.

                                      DARYLL
                    You alright, Terry?

      Terry is having very bad tremors.  He steadies one hand with
      the other.

                                      BUNCHY
                    He's got fucking Parkinson's, he
                    needs his pills.
                          (beat)
                    Call Ray.

                                      DARYLL
                    Alright.  You want a soda, Terry?

                                      BUNCHY
                    He's not a fucking diabetic.

                                      DARYLL
                    Alright, sorry.  Let me go call Ray.

      INT.  ASHLEY'S HOUSE - MALIBU - NIGHT

      Ray has put her to bed.  He sits by the side of the bed, she
      reaches for his hand, holds it.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Thank you.  You're my knight in
                    shining armor.
                          (beat)
                    God, I really need yoga right now.  

                                    RAY
                    My wife does yoga.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Where?

                                    RAY
                    Pt. Dume.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Me too!  The best.  What's her name?

                                    RAY
                    I think it's Shiva or something.                                                                                        29.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Not the teacher, silly, your wife --

      Ray is uncomfortable.  Why the fuck did he mention his wife? 
      He doesn't answer her.  Pulls his hand away.  What the fuck
      is he doing?

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    Look, can I see you again?  I know
                    it's weird, but I always thought
                    there was something major between
                    us.  I'm so attracted to you.

      Ray is miserable now.

                                    RAY
                    Let me make sure you're okay.  Do my
                    job.  With this guy.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Okay.  Thank you, Ray.
                          (rote, but maybe not)
                    I love you.

                                    RAY
                    Alright.

      He leans in and kisses her on the cheek.  Gets up to leave
      as his phone starts buzzing.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Lock the door after me.  And no yoga
                    on the deck.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Yes, Daddy.

      Ray smiles, distracted.  

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                          (beat, flirtatious)
                    I'm grateful you're in my life again,
                    Ray.

      Ray answers his phone as he crosses to her front door --

                                    RAY
                    Yeah?

      Listens for a beat.                                                                                        30.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    What?

      His face falls.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    I'm on my way.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  GYM - NIGHT

      Ray and Terry sit in Terry's office.  Outside, the gym is
      still busy, people jumping rope, working the bags, sparring. 
      Bunchy stands near them, slumped with shame, pretending to
      be busy with some paperwork.  DARYLL lingers nearby, keeps
      walking past the door, just outside the office.

                                    RAY
                    Alright, it's not the end of the
                    world.  I got someone can get the
                    charges dropped. 
                          (to Bunchy )
                    C'mere. What are you doing? C'mere. 

      Bunchy walks over, his head hanging.  Ray hugs him.  Bunchy
      is a hugger, holds on.

                                      BUNCHY
                          (upset)
                    I been sober 10 months, 3 days until
                    this!

                                    RAY
                          (nods, not convinced)
                    I know, Bunch.  What's going on? 

      Bunchy shrugs, looks at Terry for Terry to tell him.

                                      TERRY
                    Remember Dad's girlfriend, Claudette?

                                    RAY
                          (where the fuck is
                            this going?)
                    Yeah?

      A long, long beat.  Finally -

                                      TERRY
                    They had a kid.                                                                                        31.

                                    RAY
                    They what?!

                                      BUNCHY
                    They had a kid, Ray.

                                    RAY
                    When?

                                      TERRY
                    Before he went to Walpole.

                                    RAY
                          (pissed)
                    How long have you known?

                                      TERRY
                    Awhile.

                                    RAY
                    How long?

                                      BUNCHY
                          (to Terry)
                    I told you we should have told him.

                                    RAY
                    How fucking long?

                                      TERRY
                    A long time.  He's grown.  His name
                    is Daryll.

      Suddenly, Daryll, who has been lurking in the doorway, steps
      in.  Bunchy shakes his head no, don't do it, but Daryll does
      it anyway.  Bunchy starts to cry.  Daryll starts to cry. 
      Daryll hugs Bunchy.  They both cry.  Then he turns to hug
      Ray.

                                    RAY
                          (puts his hand up to
                            stop him)
                    No.

                                      BUNCHY
                    He don't like strangers touching
                    him.

                                      TERRY
                    Alright, we can work up to that.

      A long beat.                                                                                        32.

                                      TERRY (CONT'D)
                    We didn't think you could handle it.

      Ray leaves, furious -- Terry follows him, as Bunchy remains
      behind in the office with Daryll.

                                      BUNCHY
                    Did I say come in?  I didn't say
                    come in.

                                      DARYLL
                    You said my name!  I thought that
                    meant come in!

      As Terry limps across the gym to catch up to Ray, who stops
      at the entrance.

                                      TERRY
                    He and Claudette came out here about
                    ten years ago.  She got sent away
                    for writing bad checks, got out and
                    wanted to start over.

                                    RAY
                    Ten years you been keeping this from
                    me?

                                      TERRY
                    A little longer.  Before you moved
                    us out here and I got the gym.  Dad
                    wanted us to get to know him.

                                    RAY
                    Guy who threw rocks during the busing
                    thing, screaming "niggers go home?"
                          (beat)
                    Is this a fucking joke?

      Terry starts to have a particularly bad tremor, tries to
      steady one hand with the other.  It's bad.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Alright, take it easy.  I'm not mad
                    at you.

                                      TERRY
                    Ray, something else --

      Ray waits --

                                      TERRY (CONT'D)
                    He got out.                                                                                        33.

                                    RAY
                    Who got out? What are you talking
                    about?  

                                      TERRY
                    Dad made parole.

                                    RAY
                    He wasn't supposed to be out for
                    five more years!

                                      TERRY
                    He's out, Ray.

      Ray, more upset about this than even the news about his half-
      brother, Daryll, just stares at Terry, shakes his head.

                                    RAY
                    Listen to me. You let him back in,
                      everything you have'll go up in smoke. 
                    The gym.  All of it.

                                      TERRY
                    I'm sick, Ray.  He's family.

                                    RAY
                          (low, deadly)
                    He's not my family.

      He turns and leaves.

                                      TERRY
                          (calling after him)
                    Ray, come on.  Don't leave!

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  HOLLYWOOD ARMS APT. NIGHT

      ROBERT LEPECKA, Ashley's stalker, enters his crappy apartment,
      flicks on the light.  Has the scare of his life when he sees --

      RAY: calmly sitting in a chair, facing him.  On the table in
      front of him, stacks of fan magazines featuring Ashley Rucker
      when she was a teen singer.  Next to them, stacks of porn
      magazines.  He's making a collage --cutting out Ashley's
      head and putting it on porn pics.   

      Ray has a baseball bat across his lap and is holding a brown
      paper bag.                                                                                        34.

                                    RAY
                    The bag or the bat, Bob?

      Robert knows this has something to do with Ashley.  Thinks
      hard for a moment, deliberating.

                                      ROBERT
                    The bag.

      Ray stands up, picks up the bat, and still holding the bag,
      approaches him --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      INT.  HOLLYWOOD ARMS APT. EVENING

      Robert Lepecka is in a hot bath --the water has been dyed a 
      deep Kelly green.  Packages of Rit Dye opened and discarded
      on the floor, along with the brown paper bag they came in. 
      Lepecka has been dyed green as well, and the tears he is
      crying are streaking the dye on his face. 

      Ray sits across from him on the closed toilet seat.

                                    RAY
                    Stop crying --you're streaking the
                    dye.

      Robert nods, can't.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Stand up.  Cup your fucking genitals --
                    I don't want to look at that shit.

      Robert Lepecka stands up, cupping his genitals.  His entire
      body is dyed green.  He continues to cry.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                          (beat))
                    It's over.  No restraining orders,
                    no seeing her in court.  We're not
                    gonna do any of that.

      A long beat, then --

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    You come near her again, I'll kill
                    you. 
                          (beat)
                    You understand me?                                                                                        35.

      Robert nods, sputtering.  Ray gets up and leaves, taking the
      bat with him.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



      INT.  CALABASAS - NIGHT

      Close on Ray's green hands.  Still have dye on them from the
      bathtub.  He is opening a safe in his closet.  A manila
      envelope.  He opens it, pulls out a few black and white
      photos.  One is of his Dad, surrounded by his boys, all of
      them in boxing clothes.  Another with his father and a black
      woman, Claudette.  Was she pregnant then?

      Ray is startled suddenly by Abby, behind him.  Ray puts the
      photos away and closes the safe. Goes into the bathroom. 
      Begins to scrub the green dye off.  Abby walks in, studies
      him for a long beat.

                                    ABBY
                    Rough night?

      Ray nods, guilty about the aborted kiss with Ashley. He
      continues to scrub and try to get the dye off.

                                    ABBY (CONT'D)
                    You talk to Stu Feldman about
                      Marlborough?

                                    RAY
                    Something came up with Terry and
                    Bunch --

                                    ABBY
                    How many years you gonna look out
                    for them?  What about your own son? 
                    Your daughter?  What about us?

                                    RAY
                      Everyone's fine.  Stop being dramatic.

                                    ABBY
                    We're not fine!  I hate it here! 
                    It's like the friggin Jersey Shore
                    of L.A.!

                                    RAY
                    Why'd you tell Bridget about Bunchy
                    getting abused?                                                                                        36.

      She stares at him hard for a long beat and walks out.

      INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

      Ray, dressed in a sharp suit, stares at Bridget's family
      tree as he waits for Abby to finish getting dressed.  Finally,
        exasperated, he walks to their bedroom and watches as she
      zips a dress.  There is a big pile of discards on the bed.

                                    RAY
                    You look fine, Abs. Can we go, please? 
                    This is the most important person in
                    my life.

      Abby looks at him, stunned, and hurt.

                                    ABBY
                    Good to know.

                                    RAY
                    I didn't mean it like that.
                          (beat, a moment of
                            real reflection)
                    He made all this possible, that's
                    all.  We owe him alot. 

      Abby looks at him --why so philosophical suddenly?

      EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD. TEMPLE - LATE MORNING

      Ray and Abby greet Lee Drexler outside the temple.  Abby is
      dressed beautifully but we can see now she is not a match to
      the women who are pouring in, all in black, covered in jewels. 
      Photographers and papparazzi snapping pics of all the heavy
      hitters who are arriving --

                                    RAY
                    Tommy's in rehab.  Worked like a
                    charm.

                                    LEE DREXLER
                    Very smart, Raymond.  Excellent.  
                          (kisses Abby)
                    Hi, sweetheart.  You look beautiful. 
                    How's Calabasas?
                          (beat, referring to
                            Ray)
                    What I have to pay him? He could
                    move you to Bel-Air.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        37.

                                    LEE DREXLER (CONT'D)
                          (loves to bust his
                            balls in front of
                            Abby)
                    Who lives in Calabasas anyway? 
                    Sinbad?  Howie Mandel?  Jesus, Ray.  

      Abby sinks. Ray shoots him a look, he loathes Lee Drexler. 
      He and Abby enter the temple as Lee hurries to greet someone
      else.

      INT.  WILSHIRE BLVD. TEMPLE

      EZRA GOODMAN:

      This is the senior partner of Goodman/Drexler.  He is Lee's
      partner and Ray's mentor and great friend.  Although Ray
      freelances, they are his biggest clients.  Ezra is in his
      early seventies, handsome and vital.  He is greeting all the
      studio folk, heavy hitters, as they arrive.  Abby comes and
      kisses him.

                                    ABBY
                    I'm so sorry, Ezra.

                                    EZRA
                    Thank you darling, I love you.  Ruth
                    loved you.

      He takes Ray by the arm, walks him towards a small, private
      alcove.  Turns to him with great solemnity --

                                    EZRA (CONT'D)
                    We've done bad things, Ray.  I've
                    asked you to fix things that never
                    should have been fixed.

      Ray is stunned.

                                    RAY
                    You're upset, Ezra --

                                    EZRA
                          (cuts him off)
                    Terrible things.
                          (beat)
                    I'm gonna come clean on all the things
                    we've done.  Ruth would want that.

                                    RAY
                    Ezra, you're under a huge strain.                                                                                        38.

                                    EZRA
                    I gotta come clean, Ray.  All of it. 
                    Every fucking thing we've done.  The
                    cheating, the phone tapping --

      Ray is literally speechless.  Behind them, Ezra's long time
      mistress, DEB, skinny, chic, mid-50's, kisses Abby.  Ezra
      sees her.  He looks totally freaked, walks over to them.

                                    EZRA (CONT'D)
                          (to Deb))
                    What are you doing here?  How dare
                    you?

                                    DEB
                    You told me to come, Ezra.  You begged
                    me.

                                    EZRA
                    A shanda!  Who would do such a thing?

      Deb turns away, stunned and hurt.  Abby walks her out, as
      people try not to stare.  Ray stares at Ezra, what the hell
      is happening to him?  Ezra turns and goes inside.

      Just then, a huge commotion as one of the biggest stars in
      Hollywood --

      SEAN STEVENS, comes bounding up the steps.  In his 40's. 
      Movie stars are movie stars because they look like this.  He
      is stunning.  As the Papparazzi go nuts, he makes eye contact
      with Ray.  Flashes his famous grin for the cameras, then
      sees Ray.  As Ray makes his way towards him, Sean tries to
      read his face.  Ray pulls him aside, where they won't be
      overheard.

                                    RAY
                    Listen, I don't want you to worry
                    about this.  What I'm gonna tell
                    you.
                          (a beat)
                    My father's getting out.  He made
                    parole.

                                    SEAN
                    Are you fucking kidding me?  Tell me
                    you're fucking kidding me.

      When Ray doesn't say anything --                                                                                        39.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    How did this happen, Ray?  How the
                    fuck did this happen?

      Ray shrugs.

                                    RAY
                    He made parole.  

                                    SEAN
                    Tell me you're taking care of this.

                                    RAY
                    I took care of it then, didn't I?

                                    SEAN
                    Yeah, but now he's out. 
                          (beat)
                    He better not be coming here, Ray.

      Just then, a reporter rushes them with a camera crew.  Ray
      hurries back inside, looking for Abby. 

      The service is just beginning now.  He takes his seat next
      to Abby, who looks at him with concern.  Ray takes her hand
      and holds it tight.  He loves her, he fucked up.  Sean takes
      a seat, turns to look at Ray across the aisle.  Shakes his
      head in dismay.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. PLANE - EVENING 

      His father, MICKEY, sits staring out at the stars for a beat,
      then goes back to his book "one hundred ways to disappear
      and live free".

      A woman across the aisle from him adjusts her baby so that
      it can breast feed discreetly.

      Mickey looks up from his book and watches her.  She catches
      him.  He winks.  Disgusted, she covers herself and the baby
      with a blanket.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        40.

      INT. PT. DUME YOGA - EVENING

      After class, Ashley is talking earnestly to Abby, who seems
      impressed that this famous young singer is chatting her up,
      befriending her.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



      INT.  EZRA'S HOUSE - COLONY - EVENING

      Ray waits in a beautiful redwood foyer.  Deb appears, looking
      weary from the day.  She hugs Ray, then steps back, shakes
      her head --

                                    DEB
                    He's losing his fucking mind.  I've
                    never been so humiliated in my life. 
                    Two hours after that debacle?  He
                    calls me and tells me to come over --
                    he's lonely.
                          (beat)
                      Something's wrong.

      Ray nods, agreeing.

                                    DEB (CONT'D)
                    And what's with the Yiddish?

      Ray can't help it, he laughs.  This makes her laugh.  Which
      makes her cry.

      She goes into the hallway, gets a big, wrapped art piece,
      brown paper over bubble wrap.

                                    DEB (CONT'D)
                    I got this for you at auction.  I
                    haven't had a chance to hang it. 
                    It's been in my trunk for a month. 
                    As if Ruth would have noticed, right? 

      Ray nods, thanks.  Ezra appears, looking awful. Is he going
      to start in again with the "bad things" they've done? 

                                    EZRA (O.S.)
                          (to Deb)
                    Make yourself at home.  Just don't
                    move any furniture around.

      Deb shoots Ray a "what the fuck" look then disappears.                                                                                        41.

                                    EZRA (CONT'D)
                    Fucking Lee?  Said he'll come sit
                    shiva tomorrow.
                          (beat)
                    You know what he sent out for
                    Christmas last year?  Fake grenades
                    with a note that says "we go to war
                    for you".

      He shakes his head with disgust. Ray can't hold it in any
      longer --

                                    RAY
                    My father's coming.

                                    EZRA
                    He's coming here?

      Ray nods.

                                    EZRA (CONT'D)
                    Nisht gut.
                          (not good)
                    What does he want?

                                    RAY
                    I don't know.

                                    EZRA
                          (woe is me)
                    A klog iz mir! 
                          (beat, ominous)
                    It's time to pay the piper.

                                    RAY
                    I'll take care of it, Ezra.  I can
                    handle him.

                                    EZRA
                          (talmudic)
                    No lie lives forever, Raymond.

      Ezra shakes his head in despair.  He walks Ray to the door,
      lost in dark thoughts. 

                                    EZRA (CONT'D)
                    Why don't we kill him?

      Ray stares at him.  What the fuck is happening to him?

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        42.



      INT.  RAY'S HOUSE- CALABASAS - EVENING

      He walks into his kitchen.  His wife is sitting with Ashley
      Rucker.  He can't believe what he is looking at.  They are
      both drinking Vodka Cranberries, laughing.  Abby is topping
      off Ashley's drink with vodka when Ray walks in.

                                    RAY
                    She can't drink!  She has epilepsy!

      They turn to look at him.  Abby is stunned.

                                    ABBY
                    You know each other?

      Ray doesn't say anything --

                                      ASHLEY
                    This is your husband?
                          (to Abby)
                    He worked on a case for my ex, Stu
                    Feldman.

      Dead silence.

                                    ABBY
                    Huh. Small world.

      Bridget comes in, carrying the family tree poster.

                                      BRIDGET
                    Daddy, I gotta talk to Bunchy and
                    Terry, my paper's due on Monday.

      Ashley stands up suddenly -

                                      ASHLEY
                    I gotta go!  I just looked at the
                    time --

      Abby stands up too.

                                    ABBY
                    Let me get my keys.
                          (to Ray)
                    I gotta drive her back to yoga, she
                    left her car --

                                    RAY
                    You've been drinking, I'll do it.                                                                                        43.

      Abby shrugs, whatever.  She's pissed.

      INT.  RAY'S CAR - WINDING ROAD - MALIBU CANYON

      He is driving fast, taking the turns with fury.

                                    RAY
                    You're stalking me now? 
                          (beat)
                    That's my wife.  My family.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I'm sorry!  I'm so sorry!!  She's so
                    nice.  I love her accent.  She's so
                    real.

      Ray holds up a hand in warning, not another word.  Ashley
      takes his hand and begins to suck on two fingers.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    I want to taste you.  I want your
                    cock in my mouth.

      Ray almost crashes the car.  Pulls it to the side of the
      mountain road.  She is on him, lowers her head to his lap.

      EXT. MALL PT. DUME

      Ashley gets out of Ray's car. 

                                    RAY
                    Listen to me.  You crossed a line. 
                    You don't come near me or my family
                    again.

      He stares at her for a long beat.  She smiles and waves as
      she goes to get into her car.  Ray zooms off.

      Abby calls him on his cell.  He answers over the speaker.

                                    ABBY
                    You promised me, Ray. Don't come
                    home.

      She hangs up on him.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  RAY'S APT. SIERRA TOWERS - NIGHT

      This is his city pad, ostensibly for use when he is working
      a case and can't make it home to Calabasas.                                                                                          44.

      It's nice, elegant, masculine, obviously decorated by a
      professional.  Big sexy photos of old time movie stars --
      AVA GARDNER, JOHN WAYNE adorn the walls.  It's on a high
      floor with a stupendous view of the city. 

      Ray has a bottle of vodka in front of him and he's drinking
      heavily.  He has unwrapped the photo that Deb bought for
      him.  Marilyn.  The iconic Bert Stern of her holding up a
      scarf over her breasts, with an X across the image.  She
      holds Ray in her gaze.

      He picks up the phone and connects with Avi. 

                                    RAY
                    That girl at the morgue?  The one
                    from the Chateau? 
                          (beat)
                    Make sure someone claimed the body. 
                    I don't want her sitting there alone.

      A long beat. 

                                    AVI THE JEW
                    You okay, boss?

      Ray is not okay.  He hangs up, takes another huge slug of
      vodka.

      INT.  ASHLEY RUCKER'S HOUSE - MALIBU

      She is out on her porch, staring at the stars, the sound of
      the surf loud.  She's been calling and calling Ray.  A guitar
      rests near her, she picks it up, begins to play the old Hall
      and Oates song "Private Eyes".  Tries Ray again.

      INT.  SIERRA TOWERS APT.

      Intercut with him, really drunk now.  He's sitting looking
      at family photos.  Still trying to find clues about his
      father, Claudette, and his new half-brother, Daryll.  Annoyed
      by his constantly buzzing phone, he picks up.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Listen --

      She plays some of it for him. 

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                          (singing)
                    Private eyes.  They're watching you,
                    watching you, watching you.                                                                                        45.

      No reply from Ray.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                    I can't stop thinking about you.

      A beat. 

                                    RAY
                    Try.

      Ray hangs up on her.  Goes back to looking at the pictures. 
      The young Terry, after winning a fight, Ray and Bunchy holding
      up his hands.  Bunchy goofy and sweet, holding a spotted
      dog.  His mother and father, holding up Bridget, wearing
      lace, in a basket.  Bridget at her communion.  His father
      training Terry.  

      He looks over at the Marilyn portrait.  As Ray stares at it
      her lips begin to move and she implores him --

                                      MARILYN MONROE
                    Fuck me, Ray.

      He blinks, drunk.  She says nothing more.  He watches her. 
      After a beat, she does it again --

                                      MARILYN MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Save me, Ray.

      Ray flops onto his bed, buries his head in his pillow.

      A SHORT SERIES OF SHOTS:

      INT.  DONOVAN HOME - BOSTON - 1975

      A Catholic Priest is giving communion to Ray's mother, who
      is dying of cancer.  Terry, Bunchy and Ray run around outside
      the room, teasing their sister BRIDGET, who is 11. The film
      has an old fashioned grainy feel like a home movie from the
      70's on super-8 film.

                                      PRIEST
                    The body of Christ, the bread of
                    heaven.

      As he helps her lift her head to sip the wine --

                                      PRIEST (CONT'D)
                    The blood of Christ, the cup of
                      salvation.                                                                                        46.

      INT.  A MOVING CAR - BOSTON -1975

      One of the Donovan boys, we don't see him from the front,
      only the back, sits across from the same Priest, who is
      driving.  The boy is eating an ice-cream.  The Priest takes
      it, throws it out the window, and then encourages the boy to
      put his head in his lap. 

      EXT.  ROOFTOP - BOSTON - 1984

      A young woman, BRIDGET, 17 now, with a blonde shag and too
      much eye-makeup, wavers on the edge of a roof.  She is high,
      crying, deliberating on whether or not to jump.  Just as she
      jumps --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. SIERRA TOWERS - MORNING

      As Ray shouts himself awake.  He's got a splitting headache. 
      The phone is ringing off the hook.  He grabs it to answer
      and we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT.  BEL AIR GATE -MORNING

      Ray drives past the guardhouse, starts taking the green
      verdant streets up past huge estates, the Bel-air hotel. 

      EXT.  SEAN STEVENS HOUSE - BEL AIR

      The huge gates open up and Ray drives up into a courtyard,
      filled with cars.

      INT.  SEAN STEVENS HOUSE - BEL AIR - MORNING

      Ray waits in a beautiful living room.  He drinks a glass of
      fresh orange juice.  A book rests next to him on the table. 
      It is called "The Tao of Danger". Ray picks it up and looks
      at it.  

      SEAN STEVENS, who we saw earlier at the service for Ezra's
      wife, enters the room.

                                    SEAN
                    You sweep the room?

                                    RAY
                    You want me to sweep the room?
                          (beat)
                    Avi swept the house a week ago.                                                                                        47.

                                    SEAN
                    I'm paranoid, Ray.  I gotta say, I'm
                    feeling very paranoid.

      A beat.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    You know why I'm paranoid, Ray?

      Ray waits.  

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Your father called me.  He called my
                    office.  He wants to see me.  Get
                    together and talk about old times. 
                    What is that Ray?  Why would he do
                    that? 

      He starts to pace.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Fuck!!

                                    RAY
                    I told you.  I can handle him.
                          (beat)
                    Whatever it takes.

                                    SEAN
                    You know what I think, Ray?  I think
                    it's a shakedown.

      He presses a button on an elaborate intercom system.

                                    RAY
                    I won't let that happen.

                                    SEAN
                    No, Ray, you won't.  You can't.  You
                    know why?

      Ray is quiet, waits a beat.  Just at that moment, a nanny
      appears holding a baby, maybe a year old.  Fast asleep. 
      Sean takes the baby from the Nanny, who disappears.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Look at her, Ray.  She's so innocent. 
                    So pure.  An angel.
                          (beat)
                    Don't let anyone hurt my family,
                    Ray.                                                                                        48.

                                    RAY
                    I won't.

                                    SEAN
                    She needs me, Ray.
                          (beat)
                    Do you know how much money I gave
                    after Katrina?  Darfur?

      Ray is quiet.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm a good person, Ray.
                          (beat)
                      I struggle.  I hurt.  I make mistakes.
                    But in the end I do the right thing. 
                    I make the world a better place. 
                    Help me do that, Ray.  

      Another beat.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    I love you, man. 

      He comes and hugs Ray, still holding the baby.

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Smell her hair.

      Ray does.  Sean beams.  As Ray gets to the door --

                                    SEAN (CONT'D)
                    Make this go away, Ray.

      Ray nods he will.  Sean stands in the doorway with the baby,
      as Ray gets into his car and drives off.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  RAY'S HOUSE - CALABASAS

      He comes into the kitchen.  Abby is there by herself.

                                    ABBY
                    Did you fuck her?

                                    RAY
                    No.

      He comes over to her.                                                                                        49.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Abs. I didn't sleep with her.

      She shakes her head, leaves.  Ray opens a beer, takes a long
      pull on it.  He walks down the hallway, stops at Bridget's
      room.  She's working on the family tree board.

                                      BRIDGET
                    I really need to talk to them.

                                    RAY
                    Not right now, honey.

                                      BRIDGET
                    Why not?  When?

                                    RAY
                    Bunchy's a mess right now.

      A beat.  He debates how much to tell her --

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Remember I told you my father's dead?

      Bridget looks at him.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    He's not dead.  He was incarcerated.

      She looks at him, uncomprehending --

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    He's coming here.

                          (excited)
                    Oh my god, I'm so excited! Now I can
                    talk to him too!

                                    RAY
                    No.

                                      BRIDGET
                    Why not?!  He's my grandfather and
                    I've never even met him!

                                    RAY
                    Yeah, well there's a reason.  You
                    have to trust me.                                                                                        50.

                                      BRIDGET
                    Why do you hate him so much?

                                    RAY
                    He let the wolf in the gate.

                                      BRIDGET
                    What's that mean?

      Ray sits down across from her, really wants her to understand.

                    With Bunchy.

                    My father was off with his girlfriend
                    when our Mom was sick.  She had
                    cancer.  She was very religious. 
                    This priest would come to give her
                    communion and he started molesting
                    Bunchy.
                          (beat)
                    It ruined his life.

                    Yeah, but it's not like he knew the
                    priest was gonna molest him.

                    This is a bad guy, okay?  He's a bad
                    guy.

                                      BRIDGET
                    He's my grandfather!  Please!??

                                    RAY
                          (intransigent)
                    No.

                                      BRIDGET
                    I hate this family!!

      Ray turns and walks out.  Stops at Conor's door.  Knocks and
      goes in.  Conor is on his computer.  He is on his Facebook
      page.  Ray comes over and stands behind him.  Cups his chin
      in his hand.   Conor quickly closes the computer, swivels
      around to face him.

                                    RAY
                    You okay?

                                      CONOR
                    Yeah, I'm good.                                                                                        51.

      Ray kisses him, leaves the room.  Heads down the hallway to
      his own room.  Abby is on the bed, reading a magazine.  Ray
      comes up on the bed, tries to take her hand.  She won't let
      him.

                                    ABBY
                    Lee called.  He's having some people
                    over.
                          (beat, an offering)
                    Stu Feldman is gonna be there.  You
                    can talk to him about Marlborough.

                                    RAY
                    Alright.

      She turns to see if he means it.  He does.  He takes her
      hand.  Needs to come clean.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    My father's coming.  He made parole.

                                    ABBY
                    Jesus, Ray.
                          (beat)
                    Is that why you're acting like such
                    an asshole?

      Ray doesn't say anything.  Abby puts down the magazine and
      turns to face him.

                                    ABBY (CONT'D)
                          (re Ashley)
                    Is she hung up on you?  Did she try
                    to make friends with me because of
                    that?

      This breaks his heart, her insecurity --

                                    RAY
                    No, sweetheart. Of course not.  

      Abby nods, wants so very much to believe this.  A beat, then--

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    I have a black half brother.

                                    ABBY
                    You joking me?

                                    RAY
                    No.                                                                                        52.

                                    ABBY
                    Oh my god.  That's crazy.

                                    RAY
                    I know.  

      She comes close to him, he puts her arm around her as she
      leans her head on his shoulder.  And we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. PCH - DAY

      Ray and Abby and the kids drive along the Pacific Coast
      Highway with the top down.  It's a spectacular day.  The
      azure sea dotted with sailboats, surfers.  Bridget is still
      pissed at him.

      INT. LEE'S BEACH HOUSE - MALIBU COLONY -DAY

      The house is packed, the party mostly outside on the deck,
      spilling down the stairs to the beach.  Bridget and Conor
      are in the hot tub with a group of other teenage guests. 
      Bridget sports a tiny bikini.  Lee finds Ray and Abby.

                                    LEE
                    Guys, you want a Bellini?

      Abby is trying too hard with the other guests, smiling a
      little too broadly, her caftan a little too bright, her heels
      a little too high for the beach  --  

                                    ABBY
                    Bellini. That's fresh peach puree,
                    right?  Invented at Harry's Bar in
                    Venice.  I love Venice.

      Lee steers Ray over to a bar set up on one side of the patio.

                                    LEE
                          (furious)
                    You tell Stu Feldman's girl he's
                    spying on her!!  Are you out of your
                    fucking mind?

                                    RAY
                    She had a stalker.  I had a moral
                      responsibility to tell her.  

                                    LEE
                    You have a moral responsibilty to do
                    your fucking job!!                                                                                            53.

      Just then, Ezra appears, stumbling up the beach in a suit,
      his pants and shoes getting wet in the surf.

      Lee goes out to bring him up to the house.

      Ray looks at him, stunned.  Then he sees past him --

      Bridget and some other kids get out of the hot tub, leaving
      Conor alone with Tommy Jenkins, the actor Ray put into rehab
      a day ago.  What the fuck?

                                    RAY
                    I'll be right back. 

      As he crosses the patio, he can see Abby has gone inside,
      has stopped in front of Stu Feldman. 

      Ray stops in his tracks, watches them, keeps an eye on Conor,
      who is laughing, clearly star struck.

                                    ABBY
                    Hi, I'm Abby Donovan.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    Hi, Abby Donovan.

      RAY: watches as Tommy Jenkins puts his hand on Conor's knee. 
      He moves towards them.

                                    ABBY
                    Lee told me I could talk to you about
                      Marlborough.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    No problem.

      RAY: has reached the hot tub.

                                    RAY
                    What are you doing here, Tommy?

                                      TOMMY
                    I got a day pass.

                                    RAY
                          (to Conor)
                    Get out.

                                      CONOR
                    Dad, why?                                                                                        54.

                                    RAY
                    Don't argue with me.

      Conor gets out, pissed.  Ray hands him a towel.  Turns to
      see --

      ABBY: gestures at Bridget, sitting up on the patio wall with
      some kids.

                                    ABBY
                    My daughter, Bridget.  She's a great
                    kid.  Smart as a whip.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    Beautiful girl.  What a shame.

                                    ABBY
                    Excuse me?

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    I'm gonna make sure she's banned
                    from Marlborough.  Harvard-Westlake. 
                    Buckley.  All of them.

      Abby is so stricken she is speechless. 

      RAY: watches her face, begins to move towards her --

                                    STU FELDMAN (CONT'D)
                    You know why?  I'll tell you why,
                    Abby Donovan.
                          (beat)
                    Cause your husband fucked my
                      girlfriend.  That's why. 

      RAY: is almost on them.

      ABBY: mortified that this is transpiring in public.  About
      to cry, slink off.  Then, mustering all her Boston toughness,
      she steps close to him, needing to protect her family   --

                                    ABBY
                    Fuck you!

      She turns and walks off, Ray almost there.  Ray tries to
      grab her, she fights him off.

      STU FELDMAN: sees the fury on Ray's face and begins to move
      through the crowd to the bathroom, Ray coming after him.

      STU FELDMAN: reaches the bathroom, almost has the door shut
      when Ray pushes through, closes it.                                                                                         55.

                                    STU FELDMAN
                    Not the face!

      Ray grabs the hand of taking and breaks it.  Stu Feldman
      screams.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. RAY'S HOUSE - CALABASAS - NIGHT

      Ray is with Bridget in her room.  He's sitting on her bed as
      she works on her family tree.

                                      BRIDGET
                    You never told me how Bridget died.

                                    RAY
                    She was high on drugs.  She jumped
                    off a roof.

                                      BRIDGET
                    That's really sad.  I'm sorry, Daddy.

                                    RAY
                    It's okay, honey.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      CONOR: in his room, is on line.  He gets a message from Tommy
      Jenkins --

                                      MESSAGE
                    Lil' Dude, you're awesome!

      Conor begins to type back.

                                                                                BACK TO:

      RAY and BRIDGET:

                    Do you miss her?  Bridget?

                                    RAY
                    Yeah.  She had a great sense of humor. 
                    She could make Bunchy piss his pants.

                                      BRIDGET
                    She sounds funny.

      A long beat.  Bridget starts to cry.                                                                                        56.

                                    RAY
                    It's gonna be okay, honey.

                                      BRIDGET
                    It's sad!

                                    RAY
                    I know.

      ABBY: is sitting in front of a vanity, wrapped in a towel. 
      Her face looks swollen from crying.  She stands up, leaves
      the room.  Walks down the hall.  Enters the room where he is
      holding Bridget, who has calmed down a bit.

                                    ABBY
                    I'm hiring a realtor.

      She turns on her heel and exits.  Ray follows her into their
      room.

                                    RAY
                    Abs?  

      Abby looks at him, waits.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    I've been dishonest with you.  About
                    the girl.  I knew her years ago. 
                    She's always had a thing for me.

      Long beat.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    She's not important.  What I'm gonna
                    tell you now is the important thing. 
                    You gotta listen to me and you gotta
                    trust me. 

      Close on Abby.  Trust him?

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    My father coming here?

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    You let him near this family,
                      everything we worked for, everything
                    we built?  It'll be over.  Whatever
                    you think it was, it was ten times

                          (beat, an instinct)
                    Did he reach out to you?

      Abby is quiet for a beat.

                    Did he reach out to you?  I gotta

      A beat.  Then --

                                    ABBY
                    You're sick, Ray.  You have a hole

      paperback book.  Ray is nervous, pacing --

                                    RAY
                    How ya doin', Bunch? 

                                      BUNCHY
                    It's a battle royal every fucking
                    day.

      Ray notices the book.

                                    RAY
                    "If the man you love was abused?"
                          (beat)
                    You haven't been on a date in ten
                    years.

                                      BUNCHY
                          (shrugs)
                    There's some good shit in here.

      A beat.

                                      BUNCHY (CONT'D)
                    There's a name for it.                                                                                        58.

                                    RAY
                            (distracted)
                    What?

                                      BUNCHY
                    I'm a sexual anorexic.

                                    RAY
                    You're kidding me?

                                      BUNCHY
                    I swear, bro. How do you like them
                    apples?

      Ray and Bunchy smile.  Ray starts to pace again.

                                      BUNCHY (CONT'D)
                    Ray, be nice to him.  He wants to
                    make amends.

      Ray nods, but he knows better.

                                      BUNCHY (CONT'D)
                    He feels bad about everything.

      Just then, Terry, their dad Mickey, and Daryll come into the
      gym.  Terry and Mickey come into the office, Daryll can't
      handle it, moves towards the other side of the gym,
      intimidated by Ray.

      RAY: sees his father for the first time in twenty five years. 
      His enemy, his blood.

      MICKEY: stands frozen.  Moves towards his son and embraces
      him.

                                      MICKEY
                    You hear about this new law?  Egan's
                    law?
                          (beat)
                    They gotta notify you the Catholic
                    Church moves into the neighborhood.

      Bunchy laughs at this joke.  Ray doesn't even crack a smile.

                                      BUNCHY
                          (to Ray, nervous)
                    C'mon, Ray, it's funny.

                                      MICKEY
                    If we can't laugh, what are we gonna
                    do, cry all the time?                                                                                        59.

      He opens his jacket to show them his T-shirt.  It says
      "Where's Whitey?"  With a picture of Whitey Bulger on it. 
      The famous Boston criminal on the most wanted list for years.

                                    RAY
                    What are you doing here?

                                      MICKEY
                    What am I doing here?
                          (beat)
                    Last time I saw you, I was the one
                    going to Hollywood.  What the fuck
                    happened?

                                    RAY
                    You went to prison for twenty years.

                                      MICKEY
                    Cause you set me up, you motherfucker.
                          (beat, relective)
                    Twenty fucking years for something I
                    didn't do?

      Ray smiles at him.  Mickey tries to stare him down, a hard
      prison stare.  Ray continues smiling.

      Bunchy and Terry look very nervous.  Terry's tremors start.

      Mickey breaks the stare-down, goes lighter --

                                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
                    Now look at you, such a big shot.
                          (beat)
                    This is great! All my boys together,
                      everyone's great.  

                                    RAY
                          (barely contained
                            fury)
                      Everyone's great?  Bridget's dead,
                    Terry's shaking like a fucking leaf
                    and Bunchy can't stay sober more
                    than a month.  That's your legacy,
                    Mick?

                                      BUNCHY
                    C'mon, Ray.  Take it easy.                                                                                        60.

                                    RAY
                          (to Bunchy)
                    You finally get your settlement from
                    the church and he shows up?  You
                    think that's a coincidence?

                                      MICKEY
                      I wouldn't touch that fucking money. 
                    Blood money.  So many lawsuits my
                    parish closed.  Where am I gonna go?

      Ray turns to leave, he can't handle it --

                                    RAY
                          (to Bunchy)
                    Don't give him one fucking dime.

                                      MICKEY
                    You wanna fight?  Let's fight.  Take
                    your best shot.

      Ray goes to move towards him.  Terry puts an arm up, stopping
      him.

                                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Hollywood big shot?  I wanna
                    date Chita Rivera, Rita Moreno, or
                    Diahnne Carrol.  Claudette don't
                    take me back.  Can you hook me up?

                                    RAY
                          (ignores Mickey,to
                            Bunchy)
                    Not one fucking dime.

      He moves to the door.

                                      MICKEY
                    That priest?  I took care of him.

      Ray stops, frozen.

                                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
                    Some very powerful people gonna come
                    after me now.  Very powerful.  Da
                    Vinci Code type shit.

      Ray laughs --

                                    RAY
                    You deluded old fuck.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        61.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Only guys gonna come after you are
                    the guys you ripped off.  
                          (referring to his t-
                            shirt)
                    I don't know where Whitey is, Mick. 
                    But the others?  They been waitin'
                    for this day.  All they need is the
                    address I'm gonna give 'em.

      As Ray turns to leave -

                                      MICKEY
                    How're those grandkids of mine? 

      Ray is on him, grabs him by the throat, slams him against
      the wall, choking him ---

                                    RAY
                    You go near my family, I'll kill
                    you!

      Terry moves fast, prying Ray's hands off Mickey's neck.  He
      stands between them, won't let Ray close again.

                                      MICKEY
                    Terry and Bunchy --they're weak. 
                    Always have been.  You and me, we're
                    the same.  Same exactly.
                          (a beat, then)
                    We do what has to be done.

      He and Ray stare at each other for a moment, then Mickey
      laughs, goes back to the others.

      Ray pushes off the wall, pulls himself together and walks
      out.

      INT.  TERRY DONOVAN'S FITE CLUB - NIGHT

      Terry is in bed in his upstairs apartment, connected to the
      gym.  He's sitting on the side of his bed, taking a big
      handful of different pills for his Parkinson's.  He finishes,
      takes his heavy glasses off, slides his feet out of his
      slippers, gets into his bed, looking up at the ceiling.

      DOWNSTAIRS: we move through the dark gym, to the office,
      where Bunchy and Mickey lean over lines of coke and snort
      them up.  Bunchy goes first, then Mickey.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        62.

      INT. RAY'S HOUSE- CALABASAS

      Abby and Bridget are making dinner.  Conor is in a great
      mood, sits at the kitchen table, keeping them company.  They
      share a laugh over something, Abby does the hip-hop dance to
      amuse them.

      EXT/INT. RAY - MOVING - CAR

      As he drives home to his family, lost in thought.

      INT.  ASHLEY RUCKERS HOUSE - MALIBU

      She is doing yoga.  Inside.  She moves from downward dog to
      warrior one.  Fluid.  Graceful.  After a few moments,
      something catches her eye.

      A GREEN MAN: standing on her balcony, looking in at her.  He
      is wearing a cap to cover his balding head, but his face is
      deep kelly green.  Her stalker, Robert Lepecka.

      ASHLEY RUCKER: screams at the top of her lungs.

      CLOSE ON: ROBERT LEPECKA

      As he leaps from the porch onto the sand and sprints off
      down the beach.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT.  RAY'S HOUSE -CALABASAS - NIGHT

      A limo pulls up, Daryll driving and Mickey next to him in
      the front seat.

      Mickey exits, walks to the front door.

      Abby opens it, waits.  Mickey walks towards her, opens his
      arms to her and she falls into them.  He begins to talk to
      her in a low, soothing tone.  Like a cobra hypnotizing a
      mongoose.

                                      MICKEY
                    Pictures don't do you justice, Abby. 
                    You're beautiful.  When I wrote to
                    you?  All those letters?  From the
                    bottom of my heart, Abby.  I'm an
                    old man.  I need to make it right. 
                    He hates me, Abby.  Why, I don't
                    know.                                                                                        63.

      She opens the door to let him in.  Bridget is waiting behind
      her.  She runs to her grandfather and he kneels down to
      embrace her.  The wolf is in the gate. 

      As Daryll watches from the car, we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:



      INT. HOLLYWOOD ARMS - NIGHT

      As Ray beats Robert Lepecka with the bat.  All the fury he's
      been holding in is now released. He is now wearing the red
      string that he took off Stu Feldman.  We see a spray of blood
      fly across porn collage on the table and we hear Ray's voice,
      his Boston accent back  --

                                    RAY
                    I warned you.  You deluded fuck --
                    didn't I warn you?

                    

 

                          THE END
