      The City. Hometown to Maupin, Jerry Garcia and the Zodiac 
      Killer.  Fading light paints the usual landmarks: Golden 
      Gate, Coit Tower, the TransAmerica Building.  

        CONSTRUCTION CRANES dot the skyline. Even in tough times, 
      progress continues. People work. People love. People die.

        A HALF-COMPLETED SKYSCRAPER comes into view. We move onto its 
      top floor.


      The city sprawls behind the open space filled with rebar.  
      WORKERS pack tools. One grabs a beer from his cooler.  
      Everyone heads to the CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR. 

                                  WORKER #1
                    Sorley s, man.  

                                  WORKER #2
                    No, chicks are awful there.  
                      Houlihan s.

                                  WORKER #1
                    Lookit you.  If the choice is 
                    between women and cheap beer.  Take 
                    the beer..

      Older workers chuckle. One of them, WALKER, hangs back.

                                  WORKER #1 (CONT D)
                    You coming?

                                  WALKER
                      Transformer 2 s sucking juice.  I m 
                    gonna shut it down and take a look.

      WORKER #2 tosses Walker a beer. The steel cage closes. The 
      elevator heads down. Cracking the brew, Walker looks out over 
      the city until the whirring of the elevator stops.

      Walker SHUTS DOWN the main POWER SWITCH. Popping iPod 
      headphones in his ears, Walker heads off, sipping his beer.  
      MUSIC sounds out, loud and strong.

      TWO TRANSFORMER boxes sit dormant in a rats  nest of cords 
      and wires. Setting his beer on the top, Walker gets to work 
      checking each connection.

      It s tedious going. Thank God for the iPod.

      At the other end of the job site, a PORTA POTTIE opens.  
      FITCH, a younger worker, heads out. The site s barren.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)         TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 2

      At the TRANSFORMER, Walker s found the problem. Quick, he s 
      into the guts of a transformer lead. The music cranks.

      Fitch gets to the elevator, pushes the call button. Nothing.  
      He tries again. Checking around, he sees the MAIN POWER 
      switch thrown to  OFF. 

                                  FITCH
                    Hey!!!  Anyone up here? 

      Oblivious, music cranking, Walker repairs the lead.  His 
      pliers twist exposed cables. The voltage meter reads  0. 

      Light fading, Fitch throws the POWER SWITCH to  ON. 

      CLOSE UP: VOLTAGE METER

      The needle JUMPS past 30,000, frying the meter.

      WALKER takes 30,000 volts through his body. His hair melts, 
      the hand gripping the pliers chars. His body goes rigid. The 
      beer topples from the transformer, boiling at his feet.  

      Across the job site, lights flicker. The elevator goes dead.  
      Fitch sees sparks, hears horrible sounds in the distance.  

                                  FITCH (CONT D)
                    Oh no...

      Leaving the switch  ON,  he runs off in the direction of the 
        Transformer.  Walker twitches in a pool of beer. His breath 
      catches in rasps, then STOPS.

                                  FITCH (CONT D)
                    Oh God, Walker. Oh God...

      CLOSE UP: FITCH S HAND

      Pulling his phone, he dials  911. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      At the wheel, TYLER (30s) - slight build, nutty eyes - hits 
      the lights and nails it.  Next to him, CAMERON BOONE (30s) - 
      drinks all the information from a SCREEN in front of him. He 
      touches a headset at his ear.

      Rotor bolts out on the roof, sees a FIGURE standing on the 
      ledge.  REUBEN  RABBIT  PALCHUCK (36), somewhere between 
      genius and madness. Smiling serenely, toes 12 stories over 
      the street, Rabbit looks over the city, his city.

                                  ROTOR
                    We re working.  Dr. Joe says it s a

      Rabbit s smile kicks up a couple of watts.

                    My favorite kind.

      WALKER s turning grey. FITCH listens to a DEEP REASSURING 
      VOICE on the other end of the line.  

                                  BOONE
                          (phone filter)

                    until you know he s not in contact 
                    with power. Is there any liquid 
                    around him?

                                  FITCH
                    Yeah... Yeah... A spilled beer.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Blades spin, the pristine copter powers up. In the cockpit, 
      Rotor checks the gauges  In the back, Rabbit battens down 
      equipment, oxygen, crash carts.

      A one-bed aerial ER, the back has a video and data link to 
      San Fran General.  There s enough equipment to save anyone 
      from just about anything.  All that s needed is talent.

                    Good.

      Crazy fast, the COPTER lifts off the helipad, then DIVES into 
      the canyon of skyscrapers.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Phone on speaker next to him, Fitch works on Walker.  

                                  FITCH
                    Nothing. He s not breathing.  
                    Nothing s happening.

                                  BOONE
                          (on the phone)
                    It s okay.  We re here.  Just keep 
                    going.

      Fitch does. Four pumps of the chest. One breath. And again.  
      Boone and Tyler step out of the elevator.   

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Thanks. 

      Boone works and talks, checking Walker s eyes. Pupils fixed 
      and pinned. He shoots a grim look to Tyler:  Not good. 

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Epi, tubes and paddles.

      Tyler pulls gear. Boone opens a LARGE SYRINGE, shoots up 
      Walker.  Nothing. Not so gently, Boone tilts back Walker s 
      head, opens up his mouth for the tube.  Fitch hovers.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)         TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 7

                    I need you to take the elevator 
                    down for me. It ll save time when 
                    the others get here.  

                                  FITCH

                                  BOONE
                    We re working on that.

      Boone slides the long tube down Walker s throat into his 
      airway. Fitch heads away. As soon as he s on the elevator and 
      out of sight, Tyler pulls the DEFIBRILLATOR KIT.


      Rotor takes the copter in an obscene turn around a 
        construction crane. Rabbit s nodding his head in time to the 
      MUSIC churning through the sound system.

      CLOSE UP: RABBIT S HANDS

      Like a razor sharp coin, he twirls a SCALPEL through his 
      fingers.


      BOONE hits WALKER with the paddles. His already charred body, 
      arcs and twitches again. Then, nothing.

                                  TYLER
                    I don t think more electricity s 
                    what this guy needs.

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah.  I m gonna call it.  We don t 
                    need the copter.

      A voice cuts across the open space.

                                  NANCY
                    He s not dead until I say so.

      Terry backing her up, Nancy strides to Walker. Her eyes eat 
      up every detail.

                                  BOONE
                    Be my guest Nance. Starting  em and 
                    breaking  em is what you do best.

      Nancy begins loosening Walker s clothes, checking pupils, 
      feeling his chest, fingertips, earlobes.

      Suddenly, WIND washes over everyone. Lots and lots of wind. 

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey Nancy!!

      The helicopter hovers above. Like a tweaker Angel falling to 
      Earth, Rabbit sails down a zipline.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Can you get this guy somewhat

                    brain death. His I mean. Hey Terry.  

      Rabbit points to Nancy and flashes a thumbs up. 

                                  NANCY
                    I m working here, Rabbit. 

      She pumps Walker with another syringe. Nothing.

                    see if he s got a cell phone?

      Tyler does.  He tosses it to Rabbit.

                    No. No. No. He s fine. He s going 
                    to be just fine.  

      That raises a few eyebrows. Nancy just looks disgusted as 
      they strap WALKER S lifeless body to a board. Boone, Tyler 
      and Terry carry. Nancy works. Rabbit follows.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I just wanted to ask you a few

                      inhibitors? Oh Okay...

      He looks at Nancy.  Nope, no medication. 

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Just one more thing. Was he in the

      Rabbit just drinks it all in. 

                                  RABBIT
                          (to himself)
                    Poor bastard.
                          (to Nancy)
                    If it was me, I d go...

                                  RABBIT
                    Can t beat the classics.

      She s already got the mammoth NEEDLE ready. Rabbit vaults 
      into the copter s trauma bay as Nancy slams the needle 
      straight into WALKER S NECK.  She thumbs the plunger...

      Walker GASPS, heaves up, falls back down. Nancy checks his 
      carotid artery

                                  NANCY
                    I got a pulse!!!

      Rabbit golf claps and gestures to the bed in the copter.  
      They slide Walker on. Rabbit hooks Walker up. Vitals hit the 
      screen. The barest heartbeat.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Alright buddy, the door s open, 
                    let s walk you through.

      Nancy starts to step up into the copter.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Unh. Unh. You don t ride.

                    when he wakes up and bugs.  
                          (a look)
                    Not enough room for you and me.

      Terry shoots Nancy a look. She s pissed.

                                  NANCY
                    Great. Boys club.

      Helping batten down the body, Terry s got no time for this.

                                  TERRY
                    Nancy it s about the guy on the 
                    gurney. Not you and Rabbit s egos.

      Blowing a kiss, Rabbit bangs on the hull. Rotor lifts off.

                                  NANCY 
                    Bastard.


      Boone, Tyler and Nancy watch the helicopter pull away.


      Through the windshield, Rotor sees a NEWS HELICOPTER appear 
      from around a nearby building, heading straight toward them.

      The News Copter s coming too fast. Rotor pulls up, just as 
      the News Copter dives.  It s a slow motion symphony of 
      disaster.  The COPTERS COLLIDE.  Metal rips metal.


      Nancy and the others watch the copters crash into each other 
      a few hundred yards above them.

                                  NANCY
                    No...  Terry... No...

      The NEWS COPTER drops. Somehow, Rotor keeps some sort of 
      control. The EMT COPTER SPIRALS, spinning horribly right 
      toward the top floor.

      The EMT copter punches in right in front of Tyler, Boone and 
      Nancy. Rotors and skids shearing off, the hull of the copter 
      flames out, sliding across the roof.

      No one could survive that crash. Nancy watches. It sinks in.  
      She runs forward as flames engulf the copter.

      The NEWS COPTER burns on the ground. Firefighters put out the 
      blaze, tend to the injured, the terrified. Up on the roof, 
      RABBIT and ROTOR S EMT COPTER smolders.

      It s a scene from hell. Strangely, a VOICE sounds out.

                                  NEWSCASTER
                    ...  today is the one year 
                      anniversary of the worst rescue 
                    disaster in San Francisco history.  
                      A helicopter crash that took seven 
                    lives in the air and on the 
                    ground...

      PULLING BACK the disaster footage glimmers on a SMALL 
      TELEVISION SCREEN in a cozy North Beach apartment.


      Hipsters and workers jam the sidewalk. Marisa nods to the 
      news vendor as she heads out.

      Marisa jaywalks across the street, maneuvering between moving 
      cars. She scoots her ass away from an oncoming TAXI.

      Getting in the car, Nancy sees BAILEY staring after Dr. Joe.

      TWO COPTERS wait on the helipad. One s a little older, the 
      other s the gleaming replacement for the one that took Rotor.  
      All business, Marisa does a walk-around. Checking the landing 
      gear. Looking for any leaks on the ground.


      Evening traffic moves along at a pretty fast clip.

      INT: BMW

      One eye on the road, a SMUG DRIVER, works his phone, texting 
      someone named  FOXY. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 21

      Up ahead an 18 WHEEL TANKER tries a lane change. The Texting 
      Driver doesn t see it.

      Looking up from his text, the driver doesn t have time. He 
      SLAMS into the 18 WHEELER. A horrible chain reaction happens.

      The Big Rig jackknifes, fishtailing into other cars, causing 
      damage, blocking the road.  A car swerves, plows head on into 
      oncoming traffic. Both sides of the bridge pile up.

      At the back of the series of rear-end accidents, a CARPOOL 
      MOM has a minivan full of 10 YEAR OLD BOYS.

                                    CARPOOL MOM

      Fast, practiced, the older copter takes off. Sitting in the 
      back, bay doors open, RABBIT watches it go.

                    need to stop dicking around and get

                    over. He s got brain matter leaking 
                    out of his helmet. I wipe it away, 
                    tell him it s sweat mixed with a 
                    little blood.  Davey chats me up 
                    all the way back to Balad, like 
                    some drunk at a bar. I m landing,

      CUTS and NICKS mar the flesh on his right hand.

                    Marisa Benez. You know you re way 
                    messed up right?

      Marisa vaults into the cockpit, fires up the copter quickly.  
      Checking her surroundings, she gooses the throttles.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)

                    seen.

      The copter lifts off, rotors biting air.  In the back, Rabbit 
      closes his eyes. In his hand the SCALPEL twirls, three times 
      as fast as before. It nicks his knuckle. He doesn t notice.

      Rabbit reaches into the COCKPIT, punches a button, LOUD MUSIC 
      fills the air.

      Instantly, Marisa silences it.

      He doesn t answer. She turns on the music. He looks out the 
      window, eyes hungry, scanning for the freeway bridge. It 
      comes into view...


      Mayhem. A CAR burns. FIRE TRUCKS try to maneuver near the 
      snarl. The only way to get to the worst of it is on foot.

      Lugging his med kit, BOONE arrives at the impact site.  
      Behind him, Tyler brings a backboard. Boone checks cars.  
      People are dazed, scared. He gives one guy the once over.

                    away from the Tanker.  

      Boone checks a BMW. TEXT DRIVER S in bad shape. He s got a 
      nasty bump on his head. Gently and quick Boone moves him out.  
      He and Tyler get him on the carry board. Instantly, Text gets 
      aggressive.

                                  TEXT DRIVER
                    Don t touch me. I didn t do 
                    this....

                                  BOONE
                    Shhh. We re medics. We re here to 
                    help you.

                                  TEXT DRIVER
                    Medics? I need to be at a meeting.

                                  TYLER
                          (low to Boone)
                      Agressive, disoriented. Think we 
                    got a brain injury?

      They get him strapped to the board. Boone notices a SMALL 
      CROWD of ANGRY DRIVERS.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER #1
                    It s this joker s fault. He slammed 
                    into that Tanker.

      CLOSE UP: TEXT DRIVER S HAND

      His CRACKED BLACKBERRY s still in his grip.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER #2
                      Jackass...

      Boone checks the TANKER in the near distance. There s a 
      pretty big pool of GASOLINE.  He sees a WRECKED CAR. Its 
      BROKEN HEADLIGHT sparks.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 25

                                  BOONE
                    Move!!!!

      Tyler and Boone pick up the carry board and run like hell 
      away from the tanker.  So does everyone else.

      The tail light sparks again... The gasoline ignites.  So does 
      the tanker.  A FIREBALL erupts.  SHRAPNEL flies...


      Marisa and Rabbit see the explosion.  They share a look.  She 
      veers the copter toward a clear spot on the bridge.

                                  RABBIT
                    God, I love my job.


      FIRE AND SMOKE obscure everything. Boone and Tyler stumble, 
      get back to their feet. Visibility s impossible in all the 
      smoke. A VOICE rings in Boone s headset.

                                  NANCY
                          (over)
                    Cameron?  You alright?

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah.  
                          (looking around)
                    I think everyone got out before it 
                    blew.

                                  NANCY
                    Not much we can do for them if they 
                    didn t.

      Tyler checks out the TEXT DRIVER.

                                  BOONE
                    I got a head wound here. Possible 
                    brain trauma. You?

      INTERCUT: ANOTHER PART OF THE BRIDGE

      Away from the epicenter, NANCY and BAILEY walk through the 
      WOUNDED. Nancy kneels next to a woman with a severely twisted 
      ARM, filling out a TRIAGE TAG.

      First Nancy checks pulse, then she pinches the woman s thumb, 
      watching how quickly color comes back. 

                                  NANCY
                          (to the woman)
                    Hold up two fingers please.

      The woman does. Nancy clips a YELLOW TRIAGE TAG to the 
      woman s collar.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                          (on the headset)
                    I got a little bit of everything.

      A pale CORPSE gathers soot. Pulling a blanket over it, BAILEY 
      marks it with a BLACK TRIAGE TAG.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 27

                                  TEXT DRIVER
                    Don t tie me up. Don t tie me up.

      Text Driver thrashes around as Tyler bandages his head.

                                  BOONE
                    You need to calm down sir.  

      ANGRY DRIVERS start to come back.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER
                    Why are you helping this guy? Hell, 
                    he did this.

                                  BOONE
                    That s for the cops to figure out.  
                    We help anyone who needs it.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER
                    Then look around. There s worse off 
                    than him

      A San Francisco wind blows through, clearing the smoke. 
      Boone s eyes focus.  Away from the cars, Boone sees a LONE 
      MAN lying on the walkway. No motion. No blood. Nothing.

                                  BOONE
                    You got this?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah. Nothing I can do without an 
                    EEG.


      Boone trots over to the LONE MAN. He s barely breathing.  
      Boone checks for the pulse. Just the briefest flutter.

                                  BOONE
                    Nancy, I need you over here. Bring 
                    a crash kit.

                                  NANCY
                          (over)
                    Will do.

      PROPWASH clears the rest of the smoke. Up above, Marisa pulls 
      the copter in a wide arc over the scene. Door open, RABBIT 
      stands precariously, drinking in all the chaos

                                  BOONE
                    So Rabbit decided to grace us with 
                    his presence.  

                                  NANCY
                    You talk to him?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 28

                                  BOONE
                    I visited him once.  He threw a 
                    bottle of scotch at me and then 
                    cried for half an hour. That was 
                    one of his good days.

                                  NANCY
                    And how are you?

                                  BOONE
                    Fine. Hanging in.

                                  NANCY
                    Home okay?

                                  BOONE
                    Status quo.

      There s a moment. They ve said their lies.  Back to work.   
      Boone loosens the LONE MAN s clothes, checks his pockets.  
      Nothing. Carefully, Boone opens up his airway, starts CPR.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    This is a weird one.

                                  NANCY
                    Yeah. Flutter pulse. No trauma.

                                  BOONE
                    And no ID. No keys. I can t tell if 
                    any of the cars are his.  

                                  NANCY
                    Cardiac? Smoke Inhalation?

                                  BOONE
                          (shaking his head)
                    Dunno, Naughty. Just a John Doe on 
                    the ground. 

                                  NANCY
                          (a smile)
                    Don t call me that. There s no real 
                    reason he should be here.

      Nancy gently intubates JOHN DOE. She puts a heart monitor on.  
      The SCREEN reads the faintest pulse. Then, she injects 
        Epinephrine.  The heartbeat gets stronger, more regular.

      Behind Nancy and Boone, a FRANTIC MAN comes running up.

                                    FRANTIC MAN
                    Hey!!!  Sir!!!  There s a kid back 
                    here. He doesn t look too good.

                                  NANCY
                    I got this one. Take the kid.

      Boone heads off. Nancy stays with John Doe. She fills out a 
      YELLOW TRIAGE TAG, clips it to his shirt.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 29

      CLOSE UP: TRIAGE TAG

      In the  Name  section, Nancy scrawls  JOHN DOE. 


      Boone gently pulls out the SKATE KID. He s convulsing.  
      There s a horrible sound coming from his throat.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Please help him. Please help Sammy. 
                    He s my boy...

      Gently, Boone touches the hysterical woman s hand.

                                  BOONE
                    I m right here with him and I m 
                    going to stay right here with him 
                    until we can get somewhere better.  
                    We re going to do everything we 
                    can.
                          (he locks on to her eyes)
                    That s a promise.


      Nancy works on John Doe, checking everything, finding 
      nothing. Then she sees..

      A FIGURE moves through the smoke. Nancy can tell by the walk.  
      He s like a ghost risen from the dead. She tries to ignore 
      him. It almost works.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey!  Someone call for a brain box?
                          (a smile to Nancy)
                    Glad to see me?

      Nancy looks at him for a half a second, freezes him out.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Whatever.

                                  TYLER
                    I need the EEG.  Head wounds.  
                    Can t tell if there s brain trauma.  
                    He s been erratic and hostile.


      Tyler begins hooking up the electrodes.  Rabbit flashes a 
      light in the text driver s eyes.  

                                  TEXT DRIVER
                    I want a doctor. A hospital. Now!!

                    What was he driving?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 30

                    They re pissed. I guess he s the

                                  RABBIT
                    There s no brain damage. He s just 
                    a jerk with a concussion. He 
                    doesn t get a copter ride.

                    Shut up.

      Text driver pulls off the electrodes. Holding him down, Tyler 
      tries to put them back on.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey... Be cool.
                          (to the Text Driver)
                    You want a ride on the copter??  
                    Sure buddy. I m going to give you 
                    a... an antibiotic and then we ll 
                    get you to the hospital. That float 
                    your boat?

                                  TEXT DRIVER
                    Yes. Take me. Take me first.

      Rabbit whips out a syringe. Tyler s finally got the 
      electrodes on.

                                  TYLER
                    What are you...

      Rabbit slides the syringe in the guy s arm. The EEG comes to 
      life. For a moment it reads NORMAL, then goes FLAT as Text 
      Driver slips into unconsciousness.

      A ROUND of GOLF CLAPS rise up from the ANGRY DRIVERS.

                                  RABBIT
                    EEG s normal. Get him in line for

      Rabbit smiles beatifically, spreads his hands. Behind him 
      fires burn, victims bleed.

                                  BOONE
                    Rabbit.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    He s my son.

                                  RABBIT
                    Oh sorry.

      Rabbit moves to the backboard, strapping the boy in.  

                                  BOONE
                    Listen, I got two at home and I 
                    can t imagine what you re going 
                    through but know that we are going 
                    to do everything we can to save 
                    your son.
                          (re: Rabbit)
                    And he will too.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    I... I want to go with him.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 32

                                  RABBIT 
                    Oh hell yeah. Mom s always ride.

      Rabbit and Boone pick up the backboard and move the boy 
      quickly toward the copter. They pass NANCY and JOHN DOE.  
      Nancy injects another syringe.  

                                  NANCY
                    I need paddles.

                                  BOONE
                          (on the headset)
                    Tyler! I need a defib unit and help 
                    at the copter.  

      Nancy switches JOHN DOE S TRIAGE TAG from YELLOW TO RED.  


      Boone and Rabbit load the SKATER KID onto the copter. Boone 
      helps the mother on.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Your seat s there. Strap in.

      Marisa catches the mother s eyes. Gently, she reaches a hand 
      over and helps the woman with the seatbelt.

                                  MARISA
                          (mouthing re: Rabbit)
                    Don t worry.  

      As the rotors pull air, Rabbit hooks the Skater Kid to the 
      comlink and video feed.  Dr. Joe s face fills the monitor.

                                  DR. JOE 
                    BR s high but blood gas is low.  
                    How s the airway?  

                                  RABBIT
                    Not good.
                          (off Mom)
                    Sorry. 


      JOHN DOE S body arcs under the paddles. The heart monitor 
      comes back to life. Nancy grabs his hand, squeezes it tight.

                                  NANCY
                    That s it. Keep coming back.

      John Doe s eyes open. Suddenly, he s completely lucid.  

                                  JOHN DOE
                    Alison.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 33

      Everyone registers what just happened, then Doe slips back 
      into unconsciousness. The heart monitor plummets.  Boone 
      watches as Nancy dives back in, readying another Epi syringe.

                                  NANCY
                    No.. Come on.  Fight. Just hold on 
                     til we can get you on a copter.
                          (reaching for straws)
                    Fight for Alison...

                                  BOONE
                    How many is that? Nancy, we don t 
                    even know what stopped his heart.  
                    Take a moment.

                                  NANCY
                    He doesn t have a moment.  


      Marisa takes the copter to the city. In the back, Rabbit has 
      the Skater Kid s head strapped down. The SCALPEL hovers over 
      his throat. Nearby, a LARYNX-TRACHEAL TUBE waits.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    What are you going to do?

                                  RABBIT
                    Help him breathe. Um... This looks 
                    worse than it is. Okay that s a 
                    lie. Here, just give me your 
                    hand...

      Gently, Rabbit takes the CARPOOL MOM S hand. He puts it on 
      the boy s shoulder.  

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Just look away and I ll move your 
                    hand when I need it.

      The Mom looks away, Rabbit raises the scalpel. Suddenly, 
      shudders rips through the hull.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Not helping.  

                                  MARISA
                    Bad air is bad air.

      Violent and deft, Rabbit slices a slit into the Skater Kid s 
      throat. He reaches for Mom s hand.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hold this open. Yeah. Yeah. Like 
                    that.

      Carpool Mom spreads open the larynx with her fingers. She 
      makes the mistake of taking a look.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Oh God.

      Rabbit quickly slides the TRACHEAL TUBE into the incision and 
      down into the airway. Like siphoning gas, Rabbit quickly 
      blows and sucks into the tube, inflating the lungs.

      FLUID spits out of the tube. Then, WHEEZING BREATHS sound 
      out. Mom looks ready to puke. Rabbit smiles broadly at her.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey... Thanks Mom.       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 36




      Nancy slams another syringe of Epi into John Doe. The HEART 
      MONITOR spikes, holds steady for a second, then nosedives.  

                                  BOONE
                    That s six. He s just running on 
                    fumes. 

                                  NANCY
                    I want to try the Atropine.  

                                  BOONE
                    Nancy do you even know why he 
                    arrested?

                                  NANCY
                    No.

                                  BOONE
                    So why are you going overboard?

      Line crossed. Nancy shoots him a look. Suddenly, JOHN DOE 
      gasps, forms a single sound...

                                  JOHN DOE
                      Aaaaaaaa...

      And DIES. The heart monitor goes flat.  

                                  NANCY
                    No...

      Nancy pulls the big needle, injects Atroprine straight into 
      the heart. Nothing. She reaches for the paddles.

                                  BOONE
                    Nancy...

                                  NANCY
                    I know what I m doing.

      She gels the paddles, gets ready to use them. Boone s gentle 
      hand stops her.  

                                  BOONE
                    He s gone.

                                  NANCY
                    I can get him back.

      Nancy s voice takes a horrible edge. She almost cries.  
      Almost.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    I can get him back.

      Boone locks eyes with her. Neither knows exactly who they re 
      talking about. But the answer s still the same.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 37

                                  BOONE
                    No.  You can t.


      Marisa touches down pinpoint perfect. Interns rush to the 
      open door with a gurney. Lightning fast, Rabbit switches IV 
      lines, gets the kid and Mom up and out of the copter.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Take it easy kid. Don t do drugs.

                    You re a goddam monster.

      Rabbit has nothing to say to that.

                                    CARPOOL MOM (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      DR. JOE watches the Mom and the gurney pass, sees the 
      TRACHEAL TUBE sticking out of the kid s throat.

                                  DR. JOE
                    You had to do it, didn t you?

      Rabbit points to the blank video screen.

                                  RABBIT
                    Sorry. Having a little glitch.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Remember Reuben, I can clip your 
                    wings anytime.  

                                  RABBIT
                    But you re not going to.
                          (to Marisa)
                    Let s get out of here.

      Up front, Marisa s ready to turn and go.

                                  MARISA
                    Don t tell me what to do.

      Dr. Joe likes that one. He turns and goes back to the less 
      wounded. The copter heads back into the sky.


      Things have calmed down. All the fires are out. ONE LANE on 
      each side of the bridge is open. Tyler puts a BLACK TRIAGE 
      TAG on the blanket over JOHN DOE s CORPSE.  

      Not far away, Nancy stands at the railing, looking out over 
      the water. Marisa s HELICOPTER circles overhead.

                      immediates.


      Boone moves through the staging area.  The worst are gone.

                                  BOONE
                    No immediates left.

                    Thrill seekers. Adventurers of all 
                    ages...

      Boone cracks a smile.  Then he sees a LEGGY WOMAN against a 
      car. She s got a gash on her head and a BANDAGED WRIST.  

      Moving in, Boone notices her TRIAGE TAG is GREEN.

                                  BOONE
                    Hey, how are you doing?

                                  LEGGY
                    Better than most.  

                                  BOONE
                    I m not so sure about that. Mind if 
                    I take a look?

      Gently he takes her wrist, touches it sensually.

                                  LEGGY
                    They said it was just a sprain.

                                  BOONE
                    Actually I think it s broken.

      Almost playfully, he pulls her thumb back. She jerks.

                                  LEGGY
                    Owwww!

                                  BOONE
                    Yup. Broken.

      He whips out a YELLOW TRIAGE tag, replaces the green one.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    So, you ever been in a helicopter?


      Rabbit moves through the cars. He sees the BLANKETED JOHN 
      DOE, the BLACK TRIAGE TAG and NANCY standing at the railing.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 39

      Tyler and Bailey work bagging up John Doe.

                                  BAILEY
                    Not sure. Probably best to give her 
                    distance.

                                  RABBIT
                    Oh...  Okay.

      Rabbit heads over to Nancy.

                                  TYLER
                    Jesus, you re crazier than I 
                    thought.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s a matter of degrees. A matter 
                    of degrees.

      Bailey watches Rabbit and Nancy.

                                  BAILEY
                    We re never going to be part of the

                    Dude, you don t want to be.


      Skipping through traffic, Rabbit moves up next to Nancy, 
      looks over the railing at the water, the city.

      She tolerates him for a few seconds, then...

                                  NANCY
                    Rather be alone.

                    Whatever. So you re just having a 
                    moment. A little meditation thing. 
                          (a beat, direct, trying)
                    John Doe get to you? It s usually 
                    kids for you...

                                  NANCY
                    Yeah...  
                          (looking him in the eye)
                    Guy aces out on a bridge, alone and 
                    nameless. No trauma. Nobody there 
                    for him.  None of the cars are his.  
                    Wherever he was coming from or 
                    going to, no one was waiting.

                                  RABBIT
                    There s someone out there.

                                  NANCY
                    What if there s not?  Maybe some 
                    people never connect.  They re just 
                    on a bridge. Until they die... 
                    Alone.

      Rabbit eyes her.  

                                  RABBIT
                    You getting high again?

                                  NANCY
                    Terry used to walk this bridge.  
                    When we d fight...

      Rabbit stays quiet.  He knows better.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    He was pissed at me when he got in 
                    the copter.  He died in a split 
                    second.  I wonder what he was 
                    thinking.  That I was a bitch.  
                    That he loved me.  I ll never know.

                                  RABBIT
                    No one could.  Tell yourself it was 
                    something nice.  

                                  NANCY
                    I have.  It doesn t work.  
                          (a beat, shaking her head)
                    So this is what we say to each 
                    other after a year.  Typical.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Just trying to help.

                                  NANCY
                    Aren t we all?  You should go.

      Rabbit trots off. In the middle of traffic, he stops and 
      turns around. Cars honk. Motorists yell.

                                  RABBIT 
                    Hey Naughty. I m sorry about Terry.  

                                  NANCY
                    You are such an asshole.

      Rabbit heads off toward the copter. Gathering herself, Nancy 
      heads over to Tyler who has JOHN DOE s body on a gurney.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    I ll take him in.


      Rabbit arrives at the COPTER where BOONE is helping the LEGGY 
      WOMAN on. Rabbit checks the Triage Tag.

                                  RABBIT
                    What do we got?

                                  BOONE
                    Broken wrist. I think there s some 
                    marrow floating so I m worried 
                    about the head wound you know?  
                    Don t want a Transient Ischemic 
                    Attack.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah. TIA. We sure don t want that.  

      Leggy takes the window seat in the back. Rabbit s seat.

                                  LEGGY
                    Thanks.

                                  BOONE
                    Take care of yourself. Maybe I ll 
                    check on you later.

      Sliding the door shut, Boone takes off. Rabbit settles in 
      next to Marisa. Leggy looks out the window.

                                  MARISA
                          (soft, to Rabbit)
                    Never knew I was driving date bait.


      Bailey helps Nancy load John Doe in the back of the PARAMEDIC 
      VAN. She gets in after him. 

      Nearby, Boone piles a MAN with a broken leg into the back.  
      Climbing in, he checks his phone. MANY MISSED CALLS, all of 
      them from  HOME.  He ignores them.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 42

      CONTINUED:5555

      The Vans pulls away, weaving out into slow moving traffic.  
      There s no sirens, no lights.


      Marisa makes a wildly banking turn, smiles when she sees 
      Leggy flail for a handhold.  Rabbit moves to push the  Play  
      button the stereo. Marisa slaps his hand away.

      Then she pushes the  Play  button.


      A snarl of PARAMEDIC VANS. BOONE and TYLER send the MAN with 
      the broken leg inside. RABBIT s there waiting.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey Boone, you got a minute?

      Rabbit guides Boone off to a relatively quiet corner.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                       Transient Ischemic Attack?   You 
                    kidding me?  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  BOONE
                    Don t start with me. 

                                  RABBIT
                    Then don t use my copter to troll 
                    for strange. What you need is what 
                    you need. What you do is what you 
                    do. But don t get me involved.

                                  BOONE
                    Yes sir.

                                  RABBIT
                          (gently)

                    I thought you were trying to work 
                    things out at home. I know Sarah, 
                    forgiving is a miracle. Don t push 
                    for two.

      Boone takes a second.  

                                  BOONE
                    You remember that day? The wreck?

                                  RABBIT
                    I was pretty busy being in a coma.

                                  BOONE
                    After we got everybody here. We 
                    weren t sure about you. We knew 
                    Terry was gone. There was nothing 
                    more to do. Shift was over. 13 
                    years, the end of every shift, I 
                    went home. Not that night.

      Rabbit stares at him, apparently engrossed.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    I just walked around. All over the 
                    place. Not even paying attention.   
                      I couldn t take it home, Rabbit.  
                    Not to Sarah. Not to the kids.  I 
                    still can t. You know what I mean?  
                    How it feels, how it weighs. I 
                    don t know where to go with this or 
                    who to take it to.  

      Boone notices RABBIT S NOT LISTENING. The faint sound of the 
      ERS comes through Rabbit s headset.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Hold on...  I can hit another call 
                    before the shift ends.  

      Rabbit trots off, looking for Marisa. Boone watches him go.

                                  BOONE
                    Good talking to you Rabbit.

      Tyler passes by, clapping Boone on the back.  

                                  TYLER
                    Widows and Orphans meeting in the 
                    park. You in?

                                  BOONE
                    I don t know, man. I don t know.


      Nancy passes JOHN DOE S CORPSE over to the MORGUE ATTENDANT.

                    Sure thing.  

      He heads off. Nancy watches the body go. Then, she notices 
      MARISA nearby.

                    Look, we got a call. Water 
                      evacuation in the bay. Some 
                    sailor s stuck. Hurt. It s a good 
                    one.

      Marisa looks at him. Taps her own headset.

                                  MARISA
                    Not it s not. Coast Guard s got it.  
                    Shifts over. We re fuel cautioned 
                    and the wind s up. We re not taking 
                    it.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah we are.

                                  MARISA
                    Coast guard s got it. I m not 
                    flying.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Look, it s a solid call. We got 
                    time.  People are hurt. We need to 
                    take the call. 

                                  MARISA
                    You need to take a call right now.  
                    Nobody else does. I m off the 
                    clock.  

      With a flick of her ass, she leaves him. The RADIO in his 
      headset rings out.

                                  RADIO
                    This is Coast Guard 14, be advised 
                    we have medevac in the Bay...

      It settles over Rabbit. Shift over.


      Lights from the city reflect on the water. Heading to the 
      park, HEADLIGHTS form a circle.  

      VANS form a loose camp. It s literally a TAILGATE PARTY of 
      Paramedics. Welcome to a Widows and Orphans meeting.

      Bailey and Tyler drink. Suddenly, TWO EMTs run past with 
      DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES. They re trying to shock each other.

                                  BAILEY
                    Now that s idiotic.

                                  TYLER

                    I had a Frequent Flyer go nuts on 
                    me once. Whipped those out on him.  
                    Zap! Now that put the put down on 
                    him.

      Bailey just stares at him. Notices that Tyler s rolling 
      TRIAGE TAGS in his hand, like a rosary.

      CLOSE UP: TYLER S HAND.

      The TAGS have different shapes and labels, from different 
      cities.  SFFD, NYFD, NOFD.

                                  BAILEY
                    You collect those?

                                  TYLER
                    I move around a lot. Well, uh I 
                    used to. New York. New Orleans.  
                    Chicago. Here. This is the longest.  
                    Almost two years.  
                          (a shrug)
                    Don t know why.

      Bailey looks across the park. RABBIT and MARISA sit on the 
      tailgate of a van. Rabbit pours cocktails from an IV bag.

                                  BAILEY
                          (nodding to Rabbit)
                    So was he actually normal once?

                                  TYLER
                    Not even close.  

      Again, Bailey shakes his head, takes a pull of his beer.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    You know, you don t know us well 
                    enough to judge.

      Something glitters in Bailey s eyes. Call it mental health.

                                  BAILEY
                    You re an overtime whore. You ve 
                    probably got 50 grand saved up but 
                    you don t know what to do with it 
                    cause you re just thinking about 
                    your next shift trade.

      Tyler registers the truth of that.

                    Rabbit s just insane. In that way 
                    most truly beautiful men are.

                                  TYLER

                    You want a beer?

      Tyler grins, grabs another brew.


      Lights strobing, a POLICE CRUISER moves through the Vans.  
      The COP S VOICE peals through the PA.

                                  COP S VOICE
                    Alright you idiots get out of here 
                    or we ll start writing tickets. Oh 
                    yeah, welcome back Rabbit.

      Tossing away his beer, Rabbit smiles at Marisa.

                                  RABBIT
                    You need a ride?

                    Sure.


      Rabbit s mildly battered CHEVELLE motors up one of the city s 
      steep hills. 

                                  MARISA
                    Hey take it easy.

                                  RABBIT
                    Why start now? Look whatever you ve 
                    heard. I m cool.

      The speedometer peaks as Rabbit crests the hill. The car 
      catches air. Lands hard.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I m cool.  

                                  MARISA
                    Rabbit, I d like to keep some 
                    fillings.

                                  RABBIT
                    You ever see Bullitt?

      Rabbit guides the car fast down a steep hill. There s an 
        intersection at the bottom.  The light reads GREEN.

                                  MARISA
                    Knock it off, okay? Not how I want 
                    to go.

                                  RABBIT
                    There s something you should know 
                    about me...

      The light at the intersection turns yellow. Instead of 
      watching the road, Rabbit fixes his eyes on her and blazes 
      straight through the RED LIGHT.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I can t die.

                                  MARISA
                    Oh, Jesu Christo...

      They re gathering speed, continuing downhill. Another 
      intersection, another green light turning YELLOW. Rabbit 
      keeps looking at her instead of the road.

                                  RABBIT
                      I survived hell and fire...

      FLASHBACK: THE SKYSCRAPER HELICOPTER WRECK

      The moment of IMPACT. Rotor screams as the helicopter shears 
      into the roof. The fireball builds. And miraculously, RABBIT 
      IS THROWN OUT OF THE BAY DOORS. Like a rag doll, he skitters 
      across the roof,crumples into a bloody heap. His eyes, 
      flutter. He SMILES.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Every single odd should have me 
                    dead and crispy. But I m here.  
                    When it s your time, it s your 
                    time. And when it s not, it s not.  
                    And it is not my time.

      The intersection approaches. The light s RED.

                                  MARISA
                    Listen to me Rabbit, every corpse I 
                    know figured it wasn t his time.  
                    And you need to...  

      A HORN interrupts her. There s a CAR pulling into the 
      intersection. Rabbit swerves. He fishtails through the 
      intersection. Incredibly, Rabbit gets the car under control.

      Then... At the curb, an AUDI S DOOR OPENS right in front of 
      Rabbit.

      RABBIT S CAR slams into the Audi s door, shearing it off.  
      Rabbit s Chevelle spins out, finally comes to a stop.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)
                    You dumb sonofabitch...

      A terrible sound comes sounds out from the Audi. A scared 
      man s voice.

                    Help...  Can someone help me??

      Rabbit s Chevelle lies pointed the wrong way on the street.  
      Behind him, the AUDI s missing its door.

                                  AUDI DRIVER
                    Owwww... Help me...

      Leaving Marisa behind, Rabbit bolts out to the Audi. Pale, 
      confused, the Driver cradles a BLOODY HAND.

                                  AUDI DRIVER (CONT D)

                    It s okay.  I m a Paramedic.

                                  AUDI DRIVER
                    I m sorry.  I shouldn t have been

                    Cocktail hour huh?  Don t worry, 
                    I m not a cop.  Let s see...

      Rabbit takes a good look at the man s hand.  The Audi 
      driver s MISSING A FINGER.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                      Marisa!!!!  See if you can find his 
                    finger. It s probably by the door.

                                  AUDI DRIVER
                    Oh my God. Oh my God.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s okay. Put pressure here.  

      Marisa searches the ground as Rabbit runs into a WINE BAR.


      Audi Driver moaning quietly in the car, Marisa brings a 
      grisly prize to Rabbit - the FINGER.

                                  MARISA
                    I found it.

      Rabbit puts the finger deep in the pitcher of ice.

                    It s a clean tear at the knuckle.  
                    They can probably save it. Guy s 
                    drunk, thinks it s his fault.

      EMTs load the AUDI DRIVER onto a Paramedic Van. The ICED 
      FINGER gets put in a cooler. Rabbit finishes blowing into a 
      BREATHALYZER. The SYMPATHETIC COP reads the numbers.

      Rabbit turns, straight into a HARD RIGHT from Marisa.  She 
      clocks him hard, moves in for more.  Rabbit steps back, 
      clearing his head.

                                  RABBIT

                                  RABBIT
                    Accidents happen.

                                  MARISA
                    I was in the car. I know. You re 
                    real good with the medicine. Best 
                    I ve seen.

                                  RABBIT
                    Never say that to me... Really.

                                  MARISA
                    But you re an irresponsible idiot.  
                    And I don t want that to splash on 
                    me. You want me to fly you?  
                          (an edge)
                    You want me to be your Rotor?

                                  RABBIT
                    Not cool.

                                  MARISA
                    No. What you just did isn t cool.  
                    Maybe you can t die but I can.  You 
                    want me to fly you?  You pull back 
                    on the craziness.  If you can.  If 
                    you can t.  Section 8 yourself out 
                    of the gig.

                                  RABBIT
                    Look...

                                  MARISA
                    And don t bust my balls on which 
                    calls we take. And don t go 
                     Bullitt  on me in the car. 
                          (off him)
                    Yeah, I saw the movie. Great stuff.  
                    Love Steve McQueen. Newsflash, you 
                    ain t him. We clear?

                          (rubbing)
                    Okay. Sheesh.

      The EMTs and cops watch this, loving it all.

                                  MARISA
                    Sorry for hitting you.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s alright. Not the first time 
                    I ve been hit by a girl. Second 
                    time, I didn t pay for it though.
                          (a beat, sheepish)
                    You need a lift?

                                  MARISA
                    Hell no.

      Marisa walks off. It settles over Rabbit. Night over.

      More bodies move inside on more gurneys. Lights and noise 
      swirl. For Nancy, it s total silence as she moves out, away.
