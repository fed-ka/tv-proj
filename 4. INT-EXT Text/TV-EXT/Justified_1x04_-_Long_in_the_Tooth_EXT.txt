      A four story Medical Complex.  A sign reads Offices For 
      Lease.   The parking lot is half full of cheap, filthy cars 
      pocked with dings and scrapes.  Bumper stickers shout out to 
      Jesus, blurb local radio stations, and remember the troops.  

      Super: VISTA HEIGHTS, CALIFORNIA.


      Ferguson stands by his not-filthy BMW, talking on his 
      Bluetooth.

                                  FERGUSON
                    Remember, Brian, you are the alpha 
                    dog.  You don t have to take that 
                    shit from anyone...  

      He doesn t see Dr. Oldham walking toward him, opens his car 
      door.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT'D)
                    I don t care if he s a paraplegic.  
                    I don t care if he s a

                    if he s just a torso on a 
                      skateboard--

      He hears footsteps and turns.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    Hey! 

      Dr. Oldham, one hand behind his back, shoves Ferguson into 
      the driver s seat.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    What the hell?!

      Dr. Oldham reveals what he held behind his back -- a syringe.  
      He jabs it into Ferguson s neck, thumb poised on the plunger.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    5.

                    If you don t do exactly as I say, I 
                    will depress the plunger and inject 
                    drain cleaner into you and you will 
                    die.

                                  FERGUSON
                    You gotta be--

      Oldham pushes the needle in a bit.

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    OW!  Okay, okay!

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Put the seat back.

      Ferguson hits the control, the seat starts angling back, 
      slowly.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Faster!

                                  FERGUSON
                    That s as fast as it goes!

      The seat goes back, stops.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Open your mouth.

      Ferguson does.  Oldham fishes around in his pocket.  

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    You think I m a jerk?  Think I got 
                    a dumpy little office so I m a 
                    loser?  I m a man.  I help people.  
                    Them I do for tamales and hot 
                    sauce.  To pay for that, assholes

                    bonding, the laser whitening, the 
                      gold-not-porcelain crowns.  And now 
                    you don t want to pay?  You know 
                    what?  Fine.  But I ll take back 
                    what s mine.

      Dr. Oldham shoves dental pliers in Fergusen s mouth.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Consider me a repo man.  

      Dr. Oldham pulls a GOLD CROWNED MOLAR from Fergusen s mouth.  
      Ferguson squeals.  The molar goes in Dr. Oldham s pocket.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    6.

      He yanks a second tooth, pockets that as well.  He turns and 
      walks away from the car.  

      Ferguson holds his jaw, yells incoherently.

      Dr. Oldham sucks in big breaths of exhilaration and, then, 
      panic as he walks away with blood on his white smock, teeth 
      in his pocket, pliers in his left hand, and syringe in his 
      right.  Ferguson honks his horn.  Dr. Oldham drops the 
      syringe like Michael drops the gun in The Godfather.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      The parking lot is full of altogether different vehicles now: 
      LAPD squad cars, news vans, and federal-issue Fords and Crown 
      Vics.  People mill around.  Law enforcement, camera guys, 
      civilians behind tape.

      Raylan and Rachel arrive in a rental Crown Vic.  They get 
      out, head for the building.

      LONG SHOT POV

      Of Raylan and Rachel, keying on Raylan.  Someone is watching 
      from down the block.  That someone is...

      ROLLIE

      Formerly Dr. Oldham, in a battered tomato-red CAMARO.  He is 
      surprised, almost amused.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Raylan Givens...


      Raylan and Rachel stand at the open door of an apartment, 
      finishing up with a middle-aged MAN.

                                  RACHEL
                    You see or hear anything, just call 
                    the number on that card.  

      The man nods, closes the door as we track Raylan and Rachel 
      to the next apartment.  The door is already open, an 
      attractive thirty-something, SHAWNI BURNETT, standing there.   

                                  RACHEL (CONT D)

                    Oh, yeah, he was over all the time.  
                    Is Mindy okay?

                                  RACHEL
                    Far as we know.  She a friend of

                    Yeah, sure.  Why? 


      Rollie walks down a row of cars, looking for keys in an 
      ignition.  No... No... No... No... Yes!  Keys in the 
      ignition!  He reaches for the door handle.  

                                  JONES (O.S.)
                    You re just going to steal that car 
                    in broad daylight?

      Rollie turns to see JONES, a black veteran, 70, with a 
      prosthetic leg and a U.S.S. New Jersey cap, getting out of a 
      Chevy Lumina.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    What?  Noooo!  This is my car.  I 
                    was just--

      Jones comes around.  Rollie sees the prosthetic leg.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Really, I promise you--

                                  JONES
                    What s the license plate number?  
                    Without looking.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    20.

                    you drive up in that Camaro over 
                    there.

                                  JONES
                    Just a bored old man waiting for 
                    the movies to open.

                    Sweet ride. 

      Jones gives Rollie a look.


      Jones sits in the driver's seat of Mindy s Camaro.  The 
      engine thunders. 

                                  JONES
                    Detroit in its day.  Mmm.

                    Enjoy.  And thank you for your

                                  JONES
                    Lost the leg to diabetes.  But 
                    you're welcome.

      Jones peels out.


      Mindy s waiting on a bus bench.  Rollie pulls up in Jones  
      Lumina.  Mindy gets in.  

                                  MINDY
                    This the best car you could get?

                                  ROLLIE
                    In our situation, the crappier the

                    Yeah, but after the conversion fee, 
                    the service charge, state and city 
                    tax, and the onetime convenience 
                    charge, it came to forty-seven 
                    hundred.

                    Oh, I m sorry, Rollie, but see, I m 
                    new to being a criminal.

      Rollie gets out of the Lumina, paces the sidewalk.  Mindy 
      sits in the car, angry.  Her cell phone starts to ring inside 
      her purse.  Mindy grabs her purse, digs for the phone.  

                                  ROLLIE

      Mindy hands the phone to Rollie.  

                                  MINDY
                    It s for you.  

      Rollie glares at Mindy, takes the phone.

                    Hello?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, it s Raylan Givens.  Don t 
                    know if you remember me.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    Raylan!  My favorite U.S. Marshal!  
                    I saw you this morning!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Outside my office building.  I 
                    never forget a hat.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You should ve said hi.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I was running a little late, you 
                      understand.  But you looked good.  
                    Hey, I guess you re still pretty 
                    mad at me, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, if anything, I m angry at 
                    myself.  I really thought I had you 
                    measured.  You gave me your word 
                    and I took it.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Raylan, I d love to explain to you 
                    why I ran, but right now, I have 
                    enough respect for you to know 
                    you re probably running a trace on 
                    this, so I m going to have to bid 
                    you adieu.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, one more thing.  I ll be 
                    quick.  I saw you on CNN this 
                    morning.  Security video of you 
                    pulling that fella s teeth.  Now, 
                    if the marshals and the FBI saw it, 
                    it s a fair bet your friends in 
                    Miami did too.  You know what ll 
                    happen to you and Ms. Springer if 
                    the bad guys find you before I do?

                    No one s finding me, Raylan.  

      Rollie ends the call.  He looks around, spots a truck loaded 
      with yard trimmings.  He tosses the phone in the back, gets 
      in the Lumina with Mindy and drives off.   


      Rachel, still on the phone, turns to Raylan.

                                  RACHEL
                    We ll have his location in two

      Raylan heads for the street.

      Lots of cars -- LAPD, USMS, FBI.  And, way down the street, 
      there s a black Mercedes.

      IN THE MERCEDES

      There are two men.  We ll call them FRANK and JOE.  As we 
      will pick up, Frank is a local hire and Joe was flown in from 
      Miami.

                                  FRANK
                    It don t bother you, working for 
                    spics?  See, the spics we got out 
                    here re mostly wetbacks with no 
                    papers, pick lettuce all day, live 
                    like thirty deep in some ratpiss 
                    apartment or else, like, in 
                    homemade tents out by the highway. 
                    Point is, they ain t runnin  shit.

                                  JOE
                    No.

                                  FRANK
                          (having forgotten his own 
                            question)
                     No  what?

                                  JOE
                    No, it doesn t bother me.

                                  FRANK
                    Yeah, well, it would me. 

      Joe gazes out the window, trying to ignore his companion. 
      When he sees Raylan, he almost stops breathing.  He stares 
      for a long moment, making sure.  Then he takes out his cell 
      phone, starts dialing.  Frank is oblivious, just goes right 
      on talking. 

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Reason I got kicked outta the Corps 
                    -- aside from all that shit with 
                    the missing tires -- was I didn t 
                    even like takin  orders from a 
                    white man.  But a honey dripper? 
                    Forget it.  Can t tell those people 
                    a goddamn thing. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    26.

      He finally notices that his companion has a phone up to his 
      ear.

                    He there?...  Yeah, get him for me.

                                  FRANK

                    callin , or is it, like, hush-hush 
                      need-to-know?

                                  JOE
                    I m calling Miami.

                          (nervous)
                    You gonna tell  em all that 
                    spicaroo stuff I said?  I was just 
                    kidding with that. 

                                  JOE
                          (re: Raylan)
                    You see the guy in the hat?

                                  FRANK
                    The tall one?

                                  JOE
                    The one in the hat.  He s the 
                    Marshal who popped one of Gio s 
                    captains a few months back by the 
                    pool at the Delano.  It was on CNN.

                                  FRANK
                    Yeah, I m not too big on, like, 
                    what you call  current events. 

      An unintelligible voice SQUAWKS from Joe s phone.

                                  JOE
                          (into the phone)

      PRE-LAP the sound of a siren whoop.


      Jones steers Mindy s Camaro to the curb, followed by an LAPD 
        black-and-white.  Two young cops, LANE, black, and PETERS, 
      white, come up on either side of the car, Peters on the 
      driver s side, approaching very cautiously, guns drawn.  But 
      then they see Jones, share a look, shake their heads -- not 
      him.  Peters addresses Jones.

                                  PETERS
                    Sir, I m gonna need you to keep 
                    both your hands on top of the 
                    steering wheel for me, please.

                                  JONES
                    And I m gonna need you to kiss my 
                    taint, you ofay piece a shit.

                                  LANE
                    Sir, there s no need for that type 
                    of language.

      Jones looks over at Lane as though noticing him for the first 
      time.

                                  JONES
                    Listen to you, talkin  like a real 
                    house neee-gro.  Why you pull me 
                    over, House Negro?  

                                  PETERS
                    Sir, I m gonna have to ask you to 
                    step out of the vehicle.

                                  JONES
                    How  bout I ask you to go fight 
                    some actual crime,  stead of 
                    breaking the balls of a disabled 
                    veteran?

                                  LANE
                    Sir, we stopped you because this 
                    vehicle has been flagged as part of 
                      a hot-pursuit Federal manhunt.

      Peters opens the driver s side door and helps Jones pull 
      himself out of the car.  Lane reaches in through the 
      passengers  side window, opens the glove box, takes out the 
      car s registration card. 

                                  JONES
                          (groaning with the effort)
                    You need to learn to respect your

                                  JONES
                    Found it.

      There are MANY COPS on the scene now, along with FBI and 
      USMS.  A FORENSIC TEAM examines Mindy s Camaro.  Jones is 
      sitting in the back of a squad car.  Lane guards him.  Peters 
      brings Raylan and Rachel over.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You want it...?

                                  RACHEL
                    No, by all means, you take the 
                    angry black man.

      Raylan shrugs -- okay -- and goes up to Jones.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Mr. Jones?  Officer Peters tells me

                                  JONES
                    Yeah?  Or are you just saying that, 
                     cause the Gold Dust twins...
                          (meaning Peters and Lane)
                    ...told you I was a  radical 
                    militant  and you thought I might 
                    have a soft spot for Marshals since 
                    they were the ones walked James 
                    Meredith to school?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well, I can t say I d joined up yet 
                    at that point, but if you want to 
                    give me credit for it, I won t stop 
                    you.

                                  JONES
                    I m supposed to be impressed you

                                  JONES
                    You re a white man in America -- 
                    with a badge and gun, no less -- I 
                    figure you can do just about 
                    anything you want.

      Rachel steps in.

                                  RACHEL
                    Mr. Jones, we think you swapped 
                    cars with a funny little guy looked 
                    like he was running from something.  
                    That sound about right?

                                  JONES
                    Did I hear you drop your  R s?  You 
                    trying to  get down  with me, soul 
                    sista ?

                                  RACHEL
                    Sir, why don t you save everyone 
                    some time and tell us what he s 
                    driving now?  Otherwise we have to 
                    run through the DMV database to get 
                    your make, model and license.  
                    We ll find it, but I hear in this 
                    state it sometimes takes the DMV a 
                    half-hour just to answer their 
                    phone.

                                  JONES
                    Well, then, I guess you d best get 
                    started.

      Again, if we re paying attention, way down the street, 
      there s a black Mercedes parked at the curb.

      Rows of homes, little boxes.  The Lumina is parked in front 
      of one.  

      Rollie and Mindy are at the door.  Rollie rings the doorbell.  
      Finally the door opens, reveals Mrs. Pena, the one who gave 
      the tamales.  She looks out through the security screen, a 
      little leery.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    Hey, Mrs. Pena.  It s me, Dr.

      Mrs. Pena hesitates, then unlocks the door.

                    I m saying, why s he still have his 
                    gun out in the first place?  When s 
                    the last time you rode around in a 
                    car holding your gun?

                                  JOE
                     Cause it s a movie.

                                  FRANK
                    I know, but he s supposed to be a 
                    pro, right?  I mean, you turn 
                    around in a moving car with your 
                    gun in your hand, you re not even 
                    wearing a seatbelt, every time you 
                    go over a pothole you run the risk 
                    of accidently popping the guy in 
                    the backseat, which is what 
                    happens. 

                                  JOE
                    And if that don t happen, there s 
                    no more movie.  No messy car, no 
                    cleaner.  What happens, they just 
                    drive home, jerk-off, take a nap?

                                  FRANK
                    Yeah, well, it still bothers me.
                          (beat)
                    You know what movie I d wanna make? 
                    I wanna make one about a guy only 
                    uses knives.  Like, maybe he has a 
                    problem with guns on account of 
                    some experience he had as a kid. 

                                  JOE
                    Maybe he accidently shot a guy in 
                    the backseat.

                                  FRANK
                    Whatever.  So now he only uses a 
                    blade.

                                  JOE
                    You ever kill anybody with a knife, 
                    Chief?
                          (gets no response)
                    It feels... real personal.  Plus, 
                    talk about messy... 

      Frank and Joe jump visibly as the back-door of the car opens 
      quickly and Raylan slides into the backseat.

                    Well, you probably have me on your 
                    to-do list now, too, huh?
                          (no answer)
                    That s a yes.  Okay.  Three 
                    options.  Number one -- and it s in 
                    that position for a reason -- I get 
                    out of your car, you get this moron 
                    to drive you to the airport, when 
                    you get back to Miami you tell Gio 
                    he d better hire one of those 
                      consultants that teach guys how to 
                    survive in prison,  cause Rollie s 
                      testimony s gonna put him in for 
                    all day.

                    What s option two?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Option two is, next time I see you, 
                    I kill you.

                                  JOE
                    Isn t that the same line you used 
                    on Tommy Bucks?

                                  RAYLAN
                    How d that work out for him?

                                  JOE
                    There s two of us, cowboy.

                          (re: Frank)
                    You really wanna count on him to 
                    back you up?   Cause if it happens, 
                    you go first.  That s not an 
                    insult.  You always go for the good 
                    one first.   

                                  JOE
                      Flattering.  Thanks.  Option three?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not much of an improvement on 
                    option two.  We do it right now and 
                    you die in this car.
                          (beat)
                    No takers?  Okay, then.

      Raylan opens the door, gets out.

      No other cars run along this road.  Sagebrush and agave cover 
      the narrow brown canyons that offset the sapphire sky.  A 
      sign with arrows in opposition reads:

      The Chevy Lumina passes and pulls into the next turnout.                   EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    44.



      Rollie and Mindy get out of the car.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    This is it.  We are officially in 
                    the middle of friggin  nowhere.

                                  MINDY
                    You don t think he ll drive us 
                    across in his trunk?  I would not 
                    like that. 

                                  COYOTE (O.S.)
                    Hey, white people.

      Rollie and Mindy turn.  A gaunt Mexican man, 50, the COYOTE, 
      stands a dozen yards behind them.  Like he appeared out of 
      thin air.  Rollie and Mindy look spooked.  He walks over. 

                                  COYOTE (CONT D)
                    Take these.

      He hands them two backpacks he had slung over his shoulder.   

                                  COYOTE (CONT D)
                    Blankets.  Oranges.  Water.  We go 
                    halfway and stop.  We wait for 
                    dark, then we cross at night.

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/MOVING - DESERT ROAD - DAY4848

      Raylan drives along the empty road.  He sees something up 
      ahead.  The Lumina, parked in a turn-out.


      Raylan pulls up next to the Lumina, gets out, already on his 
      cell.  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into cell)
                    I found the car. 


      Raylan hears an engine, turns.  He sees the black Mercedes 
      barrel into view on the road.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into cell)
                    And an ambulance.

      He ends the call and puts the phone away and then steps out 
      toward the road and stands with empty hands at his sides.  
      The Mercedes stops some distance away from Raylan.  Frank and 
      Joe get out either side and start moving toward Raylan, 
      circling him, so that one is moving to his right and the 
      other to his left.  They both have handguns out, not pointing 
      at anything but not hidden, just held down beside their legs.  
      They get to within about thirty yards of Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Right there s good.

      Frank and Joe ignore him, keep moving.  Raylan points with 
      his left hand at Frank.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I changed my mind -- I ll take you 
                    first.

      This stops Frank cold.  He stands staring at Raylan, not sure 
      what his next move should be.  

      Joe keeps moving, doesn t even hesitate.

                                  JOE
                    We just wanna talk, Marshal, see if 
                    we can t work something out.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    46.

        CONTINUED:B50B50

                                  RAYLAN
                    Can t see s we got anything to talk 
                    about, but if there s something you 
                    want to say, you can say it from 
                    there.

                                  JOE
                    I just wanna come a little closer, 
                    so we re not shouting at each other 
                    like a coupla drunk hobos.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You take one more step, I m gonna 
                    shoot you.

                                  JOE
                          (taking another step)
                    Come on now, Marshal--

      Joe starts to take another step.  Raylan draws fast and 
      shoots him.  Joe looks surprised.  He drops his gun and puts 
      both hands over the bloody wound in his stomach, but he 
      doesn t go down yet.

      Raylan has already turned to face Frank, who s standing in 
      the same place he was when he stopped. 

      Neither of them is pointing a gun, but both still have guns 
      in their hands.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: Frank s gun)
                    Use it or throw it away.

      Frank sags, defeated, starts to toss his gun.  But then, very 
      suddenly, he makes a quick move to raise his arm toward 
      Raylan with the gun still in his hand.  Raylan shoots him in 
      the chest.  Pink mist explodes from his back and he goes down 
      to stay. 

      Raylan turns back to Joe, now sitting on the ground, leaning 
      against a garbage can, his hands over his stomach, trying to 
      hold himself in.  Raylan walks over to him.  Joe s gun is on 
      the ground next to him, but he appears to have forgotten 
      about it.  Raylan kicks it away and squats in front of Joe.  
      Joe looks at Raylan with glazed eyes.  When he talks, his 
      mouth is full of blood.

                                  JOE
                          (sounding almost drunk)
                    Just need to sit here for a sec... 
                    catch my breath.

                                  JOE
                    Yeah, you d definitely have to say 
                    I dealt this play... Guess I m one 
                    of those guys doesn t believe you

                            winces)
                    Man, you did rough me up a little here, 
                      Marshal... I still think the judges 
                    might have to give me the decision, 
                    though...  cause Rollie s never gonna 
                    make it across the border...

      Raylan s eyes narrow.

                    All the way, we were talking to our

                    figure that at least makes this a 
                    draw... 

      Joe laughs, which turns almost immediately into gurgling.  He 
      stays sitting up, but his head lolls forward and he dies 
      choking on his own blood. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      The Coyote leads.  Rollie and Mindy look miserable.  
        Hot/tired/frayed.  The Coyote stops.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Oh, thank God.  It s Satan s anvil 
                    out here.

      Rollie and Mindy get out their water bottles, drink.

                    I changed my mind.  People run out.

                          (eyeing Mindy)
                    Second thought, forget the watch.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Don t you even think about it.  

                                  COYOTE
                    I really wasn t asking permission. 

      The Coyote reaches out to Mindy.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I m warning you, don t touch her.

                                  COYOTE
                    Okay.  First I give her a sniff.  

      Rollie throws his backpack at the Coyote and follows it.  He 
      dives into him and takes him down.  The Coyote throttles 
      Rollie.  Rollie punches and gouges.  It s ugly, desperate.

      The Coyote pulls a squat KNIFE from his belt buckle.  He jams 
      it into Rollie s gut.  It comes back red.  Rollie clamps the 
      Coyote s throat.  He squeezes the veins.  Pure rage.

      He bashes the Coyote's head on the hardpan.  Over and over 
      and over.  

                                  ROLLIE

                    Rollie, stop.  Stop it.  Stop it!

      Rollie stops.  Snaps out of it.  He looks at Mindy, sees fear 
      in her eyes.  Then he looks down, sees the dead Coyote.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Oh, my God...

      He gets to his feet.  He looks at Mindy.

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)
                    You gotta go back.  You gotta get 
                    away from me.

                                  MINDY
                    He was gonna rape me!

                                  ROLLIE
                    I was always afraid of this.

      Mindy grabs Rollie, looks him in the eye.

                                  MINDY
                    For five years I watched you put in

      Raylan sees something in the distance.  Buzzing flies bode 
      ill.  He comes upon the Coyote's corpse.  He sees a blood 
      trail leading off into the desert.  


      Mindy and Rollie arrive at a rusted, sun-bleached bus.  
      There s a hole through the roof, from the fire that obviously 
      scorched the entire inside.  

      Rollie and Mindy drop their packs.  Mindy gets out her water. 

                                  MINDY
                          (re: water)
                    I m empty.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Take mine.

                                  MINDY
                    How s your stomach?

                                  ROLLIE
                    It s fine.  I gotta pee.

      Rollie walks to some rocks.  Mindy sips from his canteen.

                                  MINDY
                    You re almost done.

      AT THE ROCKS

      He pulls down his belt and pulls up his shirt - not peeing, 
      checking his wound.

      AT THE BUS

      Mindy sits, leaning against the bus.  A silent shadow washes 
      up on her.  She looks up.  It s Raylan.  

                                  MINDY (CONT D)
                    Thank god.

                                  MINDY
                    Over there.  He s hurt. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll get him help.  Rollie!

                                  ROLLIE
                    Mindy?  Who is it?  You okay?  

      Rollie peers around the mound of rocks. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hey, Rollie.

                                  ROLLIE
                          (relieved)
                    Ha.  Raylan.  Do you believe this?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s one for the books.  You armed?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Well, I do have my dick in my hand. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ms. Springer says you re hurt.  Come 
                    here, let me take a look.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    Merely a scratch.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, it s over.

      Rollie hesitates, sighs, starts out of the rocks.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    53.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I never did thank you for letting 
                    me slip in Brownsville.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I didn t let you slip.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Okay, Raylan.

      As Rollie steps into the clearing a SHOT RINGS OUT.  

      Rollie bolts back to the rocks.  

      Raylan covers Mindy, falls back behind the bus.  ANOTHER 
      shot.  ANOTHER.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Stay there!  Don t move!   

                                  ROLLIE
                    Who is that?  Is that your guys?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, Rollie, that s the bad guys.  
                    Looks like they got a sniper 
                    waiting on the Mexican side.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    That s not going to help tourism.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Air support will run him off.  Just 
                    sit tight.  A few more minutes.

                                  ROLLIE
                    A few more minutes.  That sounds 
                    about right.  We know how this is 
                    going to go.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Help s on the way.

                                  ROLLIE
                    They gonna help me to Belize?  
                    That s where I was going, Ray, 
                    that s where I was taking Mindy.  
                    We were going to open a little 
                    clinic, fix poor kids  teeth.  But 
                    first?  Two weeks vacation.  White 
                    beach and a palm tree, sun going 
                    down on the water.  Mindy there in 
                    the hammock.  An ice cold beer.

                    we're done here.

                      Absolutely.

                                  ROLLIE
                    You think they ll let me be a

                                  ROLLIE
                    Come on, Ray, you know.  They never 
                    let anyone do what they did in 
                    their old life.  I ll be lucky if 
                    I m a greeter at Walmart.

      Rock shatters near Rollie.  Raylan returns fire.  The sniper 
      fires back.  More splintering dirt and rock.  

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)

                    You got good cover, just wait him 
                    out.  You can make it.

      Rollie feels his gut.  His hand comes away dark. 

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Explain something to me, Rollie.
                    You say you want to fix poor kids  
                    teeth.  That sounds like the stand-
                    up man I talked to in Brownsville, 
                    the one gave me his word.  Doesn t 
                    sound like the fella who skipped 
                    out on me.

                                  ROLLIE
                    For what it s worth, Raylan, when I 
                    gave you my word I fully intended 
                    on keeping it.

                                  ROLLIE
                    At any rate, and I don t know why, 
                    but when I was a kid, Hermey really 
                    got to me.  I got picture books on 
                      dentistry, little kid dentist 
                    tools...  Eventually I forgot about 
                    it, grew out of it.  Then, when I 
                    walked into that bar in Brownsville 
                    and saw it on the TV, it was like a 
                    message from heaven telling me what 
                    I had to do.  
                          (beat)
                    Go ahead.  You can laugh now.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Why would I laugh?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Because it s so stupid.  Basing a 
                    decision like that on some TV show 
                    you saw as a kid.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t know.  I can t imagine all 
                    the hours I spent watching Gunsmoke 
                    didn t have something to do with me 
                    becoming a marshal.
                          (beat)
                    What happened to the money you 
                    took?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Even dental school in Panama isn t 
                    cheap.  Plus, setting up a 
                    practice.  I also spent thirty-
                    thousand dollars making you think I 
                    went to Nicaragua.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Money well spent.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I saw how you killed that gun thug 
                    who went after me.  Thanks for 
                    that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Don t mention it.

      Then they notice it s been quiet for some time.

                                  ROLLIE
                    You hear that?  All that nothing?  
                    You know what that means, don t 
                    you?  He s moving.  He s gonna get 
                    us from the other side. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    He s waiting.  And so are we.   

                                  ROLLIE
                    All he wants is me, Ray.  You know 
                    the pros, they get their target, 
                    they re done.  Unless he has to 
                    come around and someone sees him.  
                    In that case, after he kills me 
                    he s going to kill you and Mindy.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, he s not.

                                  ROLLIE
                          (more to himself)
                    And what kind of man would I be if 
                    I let that happen.

      Rollie looks at his bloody wound.

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)
                    You know what?  I ve been running 
                    long enough.  I had my fun.  I m 
                    ready to surrender now.  Nothing 
                    wrong with being a greeter at 
                    WalMart. 

                                  MINDY
                    Baby, what re you doing--?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Get those handcuffs ready, Ray.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, you stay the hell there!

                                  ROLLIE
                    I love you, Mindy.  

      Rollie crouches like he's going to run.  

      Raylan has no choice but to give him cover.  He starts firing 
      in the direction of the sniper.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    58.

      But Rollie doesn t run, he just stands up.  He smiles and 
      shuts his eyes.  His chest blooms with blood a split-second 
      before the sound of the rifle-shot reaches them.  Rollie 
      drops.  

      Raylan sees...

      The SNIPER -- a figure in the distance -- running back toward 
      Mexico.  

      Raylan fires his gun until it is empty.  

      The sniper disappears.  No more shots from the hills.  

      Raylan pulls Rollie s body to cover.  He pulls a blanket from 
      one of the packs.  He covers the body.  

      Mindy weeps.

      A chopper is heard in the distance.

      I/E. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHTA53A53

      Rachel drives; Raylan sits with his head back and his hat low 
      over his face, maybe asleep.  Rachel looks at Raylan for a 
      moment, then takes his hat and tries it on.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It fit?

                                  RACHEL
                    Nope.

      Rachel hands the hat back.  Raylan puts it on.  Rachel goes 
      back to driving and Raylan goes back to sleep.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
