      Tim is running with the bag of chicken.


      Boyd Crowder, free at last, walks out through the main gate. 
      Bo stands just outside the wall beside an idling car, waits 
      for his son.  Boyd reaches his father, who claps a bear hug 
      on him.  They have an exchange that we don t hear because 
      we re watching from some distance away. 

      PULL BACK to REVEAL we ve been seeing the scene from Raylan s 
      P.O.V..  He stands on the far side of the prison parking lot, 
      chews a toothpick, watches Boyd and Bo. 

      Boyd spots Raylan, says something to his father, heads over. 
      Bo watches as Boyd crosses the parking lot.

                                  BOYD
                    You come to welcome me back into 
                    free society?  That s awful white 
                    of you, Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: the  white  comment)
                    I thought you left all that master-
                    race bullshit behind.

                                  BOYD
                    It s just an expression, Raylan. 
                    Nothing to do with skin.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Since we re on the subject, though, 
                    of your... ah...  conversion,  
                    there s a question that s been 
                    eating at me.

                                  BOYD
                    Glad to hear it --  The seeking is 
                    the goal and the search is the 
                    answer. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    My question is why the born-again 
                    Boyd Crowder would allow himself to 
                    be released unjustly from having to 
                    do penance for his crimes. 

                                  BOYD
                    I myself struggled with this very 
                    question until I realized this turn 
                    of events is nothing short of a 
                    miracle.  It s God s will that I 
                    walk free and who am I -- who are 
                    any of us -- to fight God s will?  
                    My ministry has gone as far as it 
                    can inside those prison walls -- 
                    much as it pains me to say, there 
                    are men in there whose souls are 
                    simply beyond my power to save.  My 
                    mission now is to cast off the 
                    shackles of my incarceration, go 
                    forth into the land and spread His 
                    word, just as Jesus instructed His 
                    Apostles.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd, you know it s not a miracle 
                    that s gotten you out.  I m the one 
                    who s allowed you to be unleashed 
                    upon on the world.  And I m the one 
                    who s gonna find a way to put you 
                    back in a cage.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    51.

                                  BOYD
                          (terrifyingly calm)
                    Raylan, I hope you know I can t 
                    allow anything to stand in the way 
                    of my divine calling.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Good luck with that.

                                  BOYD
                    Why, thank you, Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    But I have to wonder, what s it 
                    going to be like, the first bank 
                    you see with questionable security 
                    and a good getaway route.  You 
                    gonna be able to resist the 
                      temptation?  Not a lot of 
                      temptation on the inside.

                                  BOYD
                    You haven t believed a word I ve 
                    said.  You think all my talk of God 
                    is just me working some angle.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd, the only thing I know for 
                    sure, you robbed banks and blew 
                    shit up and murdered at least one 
                    man.  You remember Jared, don t 
                    you?  The one you shot in the back 
                    of the head on Tates Creek Bridge?

      Boyd glances back at his father, who is still watching them 
      from beside the idling car.  He s been joined now by the 
      car s driver, who stands in the open driver s side door, also 
      watching -- we recognize the driver as Bo s lawyer, the man 
      we saw in the Teaser.

                                  BOYD
                    I must leave you now, Raylan, to be 
                    restored to the bosom of my family. 
                          (beat)
                    I ll continue to pray that one day 
                    I m able to bring you peace.

      Raylan watches as Boyd walks back to his father, shakes hands 
      with the lawyer, slides into the backseat of the car.  Before 
      Bo ducks into the car, he and Raylan LOCK EYES for a long 
      moment -- there s a storm coming.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    52.

      As the car pulls away, carrying Boyd back to  the bosom of 
      his family,  Raylan is left standing alone in the empty 
      prison parking lot. 

      Raylan s cell phone VIBRATES.  He pulls it out of his pocket, 
      looks at the display screen.  The CALL IS FROM AVA. 

      Instead of answering, Raylan just puts the phone back in his 
      pocket as we-- 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
