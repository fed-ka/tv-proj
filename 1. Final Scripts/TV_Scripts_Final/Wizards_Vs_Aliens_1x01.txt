  EXT. BURNT HILL CIRCLE - NIGHT A11

  A stone circle, ancient and huge.

  FX SHOT: The circle against a fabulous star-filled sky.

  Two figures in robes, ROBERT FRANCE (40s) and 13 year old son 
  MARK, new to this, eyes big with wonder, assisting.

                                ROBERT
                By the Fire of the Sun, the Rage of 
                  the Sea, the Fury of the Wind...

                                MARK
                  Now, dad?

                                ROBERT
                  Yes, now, Mark. Now.

  Mark, nervous, casts powder into a burner carved into the 
  rock on the circle s altar stone. There s a burst of red PRAC 
    SMOKE. Robert raises an elaborately decorated RING above his 
  head.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                I call upon the Eye of Questoroth 
                to look upon this Ring of Healing 
                  and give it the power to cure.

  FX SHOT: The stones start to GLOW. Energy building. Magical 
    script appears on them as they glow.

                                MARK
                  The stones! They - they re glowing! 

    Robert enjoys his son s wonder for a moment.

                                ROBERT
                  You never forget the first time you 
                  see the Power of Magic.

  FX SHOT: Energy leaps stone to stone like magical lightning.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Now be quiet, wizardry is ten per 
                  cent invocation and ninety per  
                  cent concentration.

  As PRAC WIND blows around them Robert raises his arms.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Questoroth come to me! Questoroth, 
                I summon thee!

  As Mark searches the sky - and suddenly sees something -



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                MARK
                  There!

                                ROBERT
                  It s coming! The Eye of Questoroth!

  FX SHOT: A shooting star - heading for the circle.

                                MARK
                  Dad, are you sure that s the Eye of 
                  Questoroth?

                                ROBERT
                Of course. What else could it be?

    Robert bows his head.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Oh, Questoroth!

  FX SHOT: The light gets bigger. And it s REVOLVING!

                                MARK
                It - it looks like a spaceship!

                                ROBERT
                  What do you mean, a spaceship?

                                MARK
                An alien spaceship.

                                ROBERT
                  Don t be ridiculous. There are no 
                  such things as aliens!

                                MARK
                  Try telling them that!

                                ROBERT
                  For the last time, there are no -

  And he looks up, sees -

  FX SHOT: A SPACECRAFT! Flying saucer-style. Awesome!

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  ... It s impossible...

  FX SHOT: The spacecraft hovers over the circle. Huge.

  FX SHOT: Blinding LIGHT bursts out from beneath it.

    Robert drops the ring, as they are bathed in PRAC LIGHT.

                                MARK
                  Dad!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

    ROBERT and MARK open their eyes - come face to face with -

  An alien creature - a NEKROSS. VARG - In its hand is a gun - 
    hard-core yet strange tech. It s very alien and deadly. 

                                VARG
                  Earthlings. Welcome to the starship

                                ROBERT
                  What - what do you want?

    Varg s head trunks twitch and react to the wizards.

                                VARG
                  Magic!

  Varg closes. Robert and Mark scream!

                                                                          CUT TO:

  EXT. KING S PARK SCHOOL. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY 133

  A school football match. King s Park against Darwin High. 
  KIDS screaming support from the sidelines. 

  TOM CLARKE (16) good-looking, athletic. Near the penalty box.

                                TOM
                  Quinn! To me!

  QUINN CHRISTOPHER passes the ball - 

  KATIE LORD (16) screams support with the other spectators -

                                KATIE
                  Go, Tom!

  Close to Katie, BENNY SHERWOOD (16) bit of a geek -

                                BENNY
                  Come on, King s Park

  - A DEFENDER tackles Tom  - the ball is kicked out. Narrowly 
    misses Benny.

  A teacher on the sidelines, MISS WEBSTER, yells.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                  King s Park! We need a winner! *

  Quinn gets ready to take the throw-in.

  Benny checks his watch - it s a mass of dials and things.

                                BENNY
                  Time s almost up! Come on! 

  Quinn throws to Tom - who takes the ball up the wing -

                                SPECTATORS
                Go on, Tom!... Get in there, 
                  Tom!... Come on, Tom!

    MICHAEL CLARKE (42), a good looking and capable man, shouts 
    encouragement. 

                                MICHAEL
                  Make it count, Tom!

  Tom shoots - kicks high. As the keeper prepares to save, 
    everyone s eyes are on the ball sailing through the air -

                                TOM
                        (whispers)
                  Maah-gann dah!

  FX SHOT: MAGICAL ENERGY around Tom s fingers as he CLICKS

  FX SHOT: It SWERVES mid-air from the keeper into the net!

  The whistle! King s Park go wild. The TEAM swamps Tom.

  As the keeper looks at the ball - bemused - what happened?!

                                QUINN
                  Mate, that was magic!

                                TOM
                        (grins)
                  Well, that s me, isn t it?!

  As the team surrounds Tom in celebration.

                                TEAM
                  Tom! Tom! Tom!

  But Tom feels Michael s eyes on him - his dad isn t happy. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

  EXT. CLARKE HOUSE - DAY 144

  APRIL AVENUE. A nice place to live. As Michael s 4x4 parks at 
  No. 23. MICHAEL and TOM jump out, Tom bouncing a football. 
    Michael with a bag marked  VET  from the back seat, not 
    happy.

                                MICHAEL
                  You know the rule - no spells 
                  outside home.

                                TOM
                  Dad, we got through to the final.

                                MICHAEL
                By using Magic - it wasn t fair.

                                TOM
                I just gave it a nudge. 

                                MICHAEL
                  Was there a wizard on the other 
                  team? 

                                TOM
                  No. Course not.

                                MICHAEL
                So it was unfair. You cheated. 

  As Michael leads Tom into the house.

                                                                          CUT TO:


  INT. CLARKE HOUSE. KITCHEN/LOBBY - DAY 155

    MICHAEL dumps his medical bag and pulls a bottle of cola from 
  the fridge, still lecturing TOM.

                                MICHAEL
                  You have to be more careful, son. 
                  Magic isn t for cheating at 
                  football or for doing your chores 
                  around the house.

  As URSULA (a 64 year old firework with reading glasses 
    perched on her head) walks in. Gives Tom a friendly wink.

                                URSULA
                  Well that s fine coming from an 
                  Unenchanted with no Magic. What 
                  have you been up to, Tom.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)

    CONTINUED:55

                                TOM
                I used a spell. To help score a 
                  goal. It got us through to the cup 
                  final, Gran.

  As Michael hunts without success for the bottle opener.

                                MICHAEL
                  The point is, what happens if 
                  someone sees, Tom? If they find out  
                  what you are?

                                TOM
                So what s the point of magic if you 
                  can t have a laugh with it?

                                URSULA
                  That s a very good question. The 
                  trick is to be careful where you 
                  have the fun.

    Michael is still hunting for the bottle opener.

                                MICHAEL
                  ...And what s happened to the 
                  bottle opener?

                                URSULA
                  Unenchanteds, you re so helpless!

  She raps her cane -

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Mass-fan-wann dah!

    PRAC EFFECT: The bottle top pops off the cola.

    PRAC EFFECT: More bottle tops around the kitchen pop off,  
    spraying contents everywhere. 

    Ursula, Michael and Tom take in the devastation.

    PRAC EFFECT: One more bottle top pops off. 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Oops. I think I have things I 
                  should be doing in the Chamber.

  She heads for the lobby, smiling Tom follows as she opens the 
    downstairs toilet door - just checking.

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Nobody in there?

                                TOM
                  No. We re all here, Gran.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                URSULA
                  It s only polite to check, Thomas. 

  And she closes the door and raps on it twice with the cane. 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Chamber of Crowe open to me, reveal 
                  yourself on the knock of three.

  She raps on the door once more. And it opens by itself - on 
  to a dark, stone passageway lit by lanterns. There s a 
    distant cry from along the passageway - a bird crossed with a 
    lizard.

  Tom gazes, fascinated, though he s seen this so often before -

                                TOM
                  Maybe I could come and help... with 
                  whatever you ve got to do down 
                  there.

  But Michael is in the kitchen doorway now.

                                MICHAEL
                  You re a long way off ready for the 
                  Chamber of Mysteries, Tom.

                                TOM
                  But that s where the big magic is.

                                MICHAEL
                  Maybe when you stop using magic to 
                  score goals you ll be responsible 
                  enough for what s in there.

    Michael holds Tom s stare. Part of Tom knows he is right.

                                URSULA
                  One day, Tom. Besides, it s your 
                  mum s birthday, and I think there s 
                  something important you have to do.

    Ursula gives him a sad smile- 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Give her my love.

  She enters the passageway and closes the door after her.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                  Happy birthday, honey. 

  But Tom is gazing at the headstone, deep in thought.

                  You say Magic s this great big 
                  thing. A gift. And I shouldn t mess 
                  around with it. But what s the 
                  point? Mum had Magic, but she still 
                  had to die.

    Michael has asked himself the same question. 

                                MICHAEL
                  There are some things Magic isn t 
                  supposed to fix. That s what your 
                  Gran told me back then. There are 
                  lines that wizards just can t 
                  cross. Even for someone they love.

  Tom looks back at the gravestone.

                                TOM
                  But you would ve done, wouldn t 
                  you? No matter what the rules said. 
                If you d been a wizard.

    Michael regards his son, this isn t easy...

                                MICHAEL
                I loved your mum. She had a magic 
                  that had nothing to do with 
                  wizards. I d have done anything to 
                  save her. But I don t have Magic. 
                  And I can t teach you everything 
                  you need to know. Things your mum 
                  could have taught you. About how to 
                be what you are. What she was. 

                                TOM
                        (smiles)
                  There s Gran.

                                MICHAEL
                        (smiles)
                Do you really want to turn yourself 
                  into a frog when you re trying to 
                  cast a protection spell?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

  They laugh together. But it doesn t last long. Michael takes 
  Tom s shoulder.

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  Listen, Tom, there are more things 
                to life than Magic. I m an 
                  Unenchanted. I can t teach you how 
                to be a wizard, but maybe I can 
                  teach you the one thing that s more 
                  important. How to be a good man.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                  Maintaining geostationary orbit 
                  behind Earth s Moon. It is a 
                  pitiful rock, but will hide our 
                  presence from the humans. 

  As a female Nekross, LEXI watches a video screen - on it 
    ROBERT, alone in a wire cell, scared and angry.

                                ROBERT
                  What have you done with my son?!

  VARG joins his sister LEXI.

                  The human cries for its offspring 
                  like a Loogovian sea-cow.

                  Wizards are seldom physically 
                  impressive. But they have Magic.

  As NEKROSS GUARDS bring in struggling MARK. 

                                LEXI
                  Put the wizard into the Extractor.

  Mark is dragged towards a capsule connected to a network of 
    transparent piping, the EXTRACTOR.

                                VARG
                  Extract the Magic!

    Mark is immobilized as a light shines on him.  Lexi pulls on 
  a lever. The Extractor comes to life. The machine HUMS.

  FX SHOT: The pipes fill with swirling MAGICAL ESSENCE.

  And from behind large closed doors, the NEKROSS KING -

                                NEKROSS KING (O.S.)
                  Feed me the Magic.

    Varg and Lexi bow towards the closed doors.

                                VARG
                As the King commands, so it is 
                  done.

    Varg turns a handle -

  FX SHOT: The MAGIC is piped behind the closed doors.

  The Extractor shuts down. Mark, aged into OLD MARK, exhausted 
  and very old. 

                                LEXI

                  What have you monsters done to me?

  And from behind the closed doors - GLUG! GLUG! GLUG! - The  
    horrible sound of the unseen King feeding.

    Typical 16 year old boy s room - PC, dumped books, band

  FX SHOT: Tom s fingers click - MAGICAL ENERGY.

  PRAC EFFECT: The clock flies at the wall. 

  Tom shrugs off his sheets - sees unfinished homework on his

  CLOSE ON: Tom clicks his fingers.

  TOM heads to the bathroom - the history books are open, the 
  pages turning by themselves.

  FX SHOT: His exercise book is magically filling with writing.

                  Remember, the Burnt Hill Stone

                  Still better than being stuck in 
                  class.

                                BENNY
                  Actually, the stone circle is a 
                  neolithic observatory. 

  He has his phone pointing to the sky - using a stargazing app 
  to check out the night-time sky. 

                                BENNY (CONT D)
                  Look at the star-scape you get from 
                up here. It s brilliant.

  Quinn grabs Benny s phone.

                                QUINN
                  You don t need the stars to see 
                  your future, Benzoid. I can tell 
                  you. You re going to be spending a 
                  long time hunting for your phone in 
                  those bushes. 

  Quinn makes as if to throw the phone away -

                                BENNY
                  Hey!

                                KATIE

  And Tom grabs the phone from Quinn - tosses it back to Benny.

                                TOM
                  Now geek off, Benny. 

  Benny tries for indignant, not victimized.

                                BENNY
                  Actually this is astronomy. That s 
                  science. Not astrology - which is 
                  just plain sad.

  Benny carries on, just ahead of Tom, Quinn and Katie. But 
    making it clear he s not running after the teacher.


                                KATIE
                  Any way, I thought standing stones 
                  were put up by Druids. People like 
                  that. For magical ceremonies. I 
                  mean, an observatory? How boring is 
                  that? But magic, now that s cool.

  Tom grins - he really likes Katie.

                                TOM
                  You think so?

    Katie s smile twinkles.

                  Yeah. Course it is.

                  Magic s a load of old Hogwarts.

  TOM reels. Still not sure what he s seeing, but freaked.

                                MISS WEBSTER
                I want measurements and sketches. 
                  Teams of two. Get on with it!

  Tom looks around him; sees Katie is paired up with Quinn - 
  it s just him and Benny. Great (not)!

                                BENNY
                  Looks like we re a team. So no 
                  messing about. Just because you 
                  don t care about your grades 
                  doesn t mean I have to miss out.

                                TOM
                  Being stuck with you is so totally  *
                  lame.*

  And the kids get to work. Grudgingly, Tom is with Benny -

                                BENNY
                  Don t worry about it. Like I want 
                  anyone to think we re mates. No 
                  way.

  Tom bites his tongue - and unseen by Benny, Tom - finds the 
    RING OF HEALING in the grass. As he picks it up it GLOWS with 
  a PRAC light.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                  Wow! Look at that!

  Tom knows what it is - and Benny seeing it is bad news.

                                LEXI
                  And we have come for Magic!

  Tom is ready for a fight -

                                TOM
                  Well, have this on me! Ava-shen 
                  dah!

  He clicks his fingers - and nothing happens.

    Clicks again.

                                BENNY
                  ... And?

                                TOM
                  No! No way! I ve used up my spells.

  On Tom.

    FLASHBACK MONTAGE: Rapid-fire - Tom clicks to stop the alarm; 
    clicks to finish his homework; clicks to save Benny.

                                TOM (CONT D)
                We only get three spells, sunrise 
                to sunrise. I ve used them. Wasted 
                  them.

                                BENNY
                  What kind of cut-price wizard are 
                  you?

  Lexi leers.

                                LEXI
                A tasty one - and quite 
                  defenceless.

  Tom grabs one of a bunch of footballs on the floor - ready to 
  throw it at Lexi, as -

  The doors behind Tom burst open - URSULA! Pulling herself up 
  to her full height. Doing her best to look threatening. 
    Dramatic.

                                URSULA
                  No-one threatens my grandson!

                                TOM
                  Gran! No! It s an alien! 

                                URSULA
                  Don t be ridiculous. There are no 
                  such things as aliens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                BENNY
                  Errr - maybe you should take a 
                  closer look.

  Lexi takes Ursula in and grins.

                                LEXI
                  You are the aliens to us, and you 
                  disgust me.

  But Ursula, determined to protect Tom, steps between him and 
  Lexi.  Summoning all her courage, all her steel.

                                URSULA
                  Whatever you are, I may look like a 
                  foolish old crone, but I have the 
                  blood of warrior wizards in my 
                  veins.

                                BENNY
                      (to Tom)
                So she s like Gandalfina, or 
                  someone?

                                TOM
                  ... Not exactly.

    Ursula strikes the floor with her cane - 

                                URSULA
                I am Ursula...

  The amber stone on the head of the cane glows -

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  ... seventh daughter of a seventh 
                  daughter of the Magical Line of 
                  Crowe. My family have slain demons 
                  and destroyed armies of the 
                  Neverside. Whatever world you come 
                  from, beware.

  But Lexi just smiles.

                                LEXI
                  More Magic. I shall take you both! 

                                TOM
                  What?!

  Lexi presses a button on her wrist device -

  FX SHOT: Ursula, Tom and Lexi glow - and are gone!

    Benny s eyes bulge with shock -



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                  She beamed them up!

  INT. NEKROSS SHIP. ARRIVAL CHAMBER. - DAY 24646

  FX SHOT: TOM and URSULA burst out of a PRAC column of light. 
    (NOTE: Tom still has the football.)

                                URSULA
                  What - what happened? Where are we?

  FX SHOT: At the window - the MOON, and beyond it - not quite 
  fully in view - the distant EARTH.

                                TOM
                  ... I think we re in space. 

    Despite everything - a moment of wonder for both of them.

                                URSULA
                  It s so beautiful.

  LEXI interrupts their wonder. Covering them with her blaster. 
    Behind her - NEKROSS GUARDS.

                                LEXI
                  Earth looks so small. So far away. 
                  Say goodbye to it, wizards. 

  And Lexi throws a lever on a control panel - 

  The transporter PRAC light beam goes off.

                                LEXI (CONT D)
                  Welcome to the Zarantulus. It s 
                  time to meet my father.

                                                                          CUT TO:


  INT. NEKROSS SHIP. FLIGHT DECK. - DAY 24747

  Led by NEKROSS GUARDS and LEXI, TOM and URSULA enter. VARG is 
    waiting. The King s Chamber is flanked by TWO NEKROSS GUARDS.

                                VARG
                  Bow wizards, before the Nekross 
                  King!

                                TOM
                  I m not bowing! Let us go!

  From behind the closed King s Chamber doors -


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

    CONTINUED:4747

                                NEKROSS KING (O.S.)
                  You defy me, wizard? I who have 
                  bestrode the stars?

                                URSULA
                  Maybe you shouldn t upset him, Tom.

                                TOM
                If you re such a big deal, how come 
                  you don t show your face?

                                NEKROSS KING
                  You would look on the face of the 
                  King?

                                LEXI
                  Behold the King!

  And with a strange fanfare and a huge burst of gas the doors 
  of the King s Chamber part.

                                VARG/ LEXI
                  Hail the might of Nekron!

  Big Reveal! The KING for the first time, as TOM and URSULA 
  lay astonished eyes on him - gigantic, bloated, slimy mass of 
  alien blubber. He is the size of a wall. There s bubbling 
    liquid and belching gas. Pipes and tubes run into him, it s 
  like he s plumbed into the ship. It s gross. 

  The King looks at them -

                                NEKROSS KING
                I shall devour you and all your 
                  kind, wizardblood. The Nekross 
                  shall feast!

                                                                          CUT TO:
