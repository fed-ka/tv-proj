      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT11

      Scott drags plastic bags full of groceries into a dimly lit 
      parking garage. But after a moment of walking the rows, he 
      pauses. With several confused glances it becomes obvious: he 
      can t remember where he parked.

                                  SCOTT
                    Crap.

      Hurrying forward, he looks from car to car. Then comes to a 
      halt, still lost. He starts back the other way when--

      He stops again. Putting the bags down, he pulls out his 
      mother s car keys. He holds them up, clicking the alarm 
      button. 

      While listening for the BEEP, a plastic bottle of MILK rolls 
      out of one of the bags. Scott moves to grab it but it slips 
      under a car. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Dammit.

      He kneels down to reach under, feeling blindly beneath the 
      car. Then something odd happens...

      The bottle rolls back.

      Milk SPURTS onto the pavement from PUNCTURED HOLES in its 
      side. Scott stares at the bottle as it drifts to a stop.

      Visibly trembling now, he slowly rises to a standing 
      position, turns and--

      RUNS FOR IT. 

      Pounding the pavement, he shoots a terrified glance back to 
      see A DARK SHAPE HURTLE OUT from behind a parked car. Loping 
      on all fours, it s coming right for him.

      Scott tears around the next corner. Diving into the shadows 
      between columns, he holds still.             TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/112.

      When he peers out, he sees nothing but parked cars. The 
      garage lies silent except for his own POUNDING HEART. He 
      gazes down at his chest all too aware of the THUMPING. 

      Closing his eyes, he tries to calm his breathing. But his 
      heart just won t settle. Then he hears something else...

      A low animal GROWL. An ominous rumble that stops him 
      breathing. The source coming closer, moving between cars, 
      hurtling forward as--

      Scott darts of out of the shadows just ahead. Taking another 
      corner, he glances about, an idea forming.

      He leaps onto the hood of a car, bouncing up and off it. The 
      ALARM starts blaring. He bumps another car, ricocheting off 
      it and into--

      AN SUV, its alarm howling now as well. Scott keeps hitting 
      cars, a CACOPHONY of BEEPS and WAILING ALARMS filling the lot 
      and masking his pounding heart.

      He pulls in between two vehicles, listening. He can t hear 
      anything now but HORNS AND SIRENS. It s working.

      Until he hears a RINGING in his jacket. Scott pulls out his 
      phone just as--

      SOMETHING YANKS HIM UP right into the air, twisting him up 
      and SLAMMING HIM ONTO THE PAVEMENT.

      It s Derek. Scowling down at him with disappointment.

                                  DEREK
                    You re dead.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT22

      An angry Scott follows Derek through the garage.

                                  SCOTT
                    What the hell was that?

                                  DEREK
                    I said I was going to teach you. I 
                    didn t say when.

                                  SCOTT
                    You scared the crap out of me.

      Derek turns to him and takes a whiff of the air.

                                  DEREK
                    Not yet.

                                  SCOTT
                    Well... I was fast, right?

                                  DEREK
                    Not fast enough.

                                  SCOTT
                    But the car alarms. That was smart, 
                    right?

                                  DEREK
                    Until your phone rang.

                                  SCOTT
                    But that was... I mean... Would you 
                    just stop? Please?

      Derek pauses.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What happened the other night... 
                    Stiles s dad getting hurt. It was 
                    my fault. I should have been there 
                    to do something. I need you to 
                    teach me how to control this.

                                  DEREK
                    I m what I am because of birth. You 
                    were bitten. Teaching someone who 
                    was bitten takes time. I m not even 
                    sure I can teach you.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do I have to do?            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/114.

                                  DEREK
                    Get rid of distractions.

      Derek grabs him, pulling his PHONE out of his coat pocket. He 
      turns it around to show the display: MISSED CALL: ALLISON.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    This is why I caught you. You want 
                    me to teach you? Get rid of her.

                                  SCOTT
                    What? Just because of her family?

      Derek lifts the phone up to throw it--

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Woah, wait, wait--

      Too late. Derek hurls the phone. Scott flinches, eyes 
      squeezing shut as he HEARS the smash and crunch of plastic 
      hitting cement. He turns to Derek with a furious glare.

                                  DEREK
                    Getting angry? That s your first 
                    lesson. You want to learn how to 
                    control this? How to shift? You do 
                    it through anger. By tapping into a 
                    primal, animal rage. You can t do 
                    that with her around.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can get angry.

                                  DEREK
                    Not angry enough. This is the only 
                    way I can teach you. Can you stay 
                    away from her at least until after 
                    the full moon?

                                  SCOTT
                    If that s what it takes--

                                  DEREK
                    You want to live? You want to 
                    protect your friends? Yes or no?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yes. If you can teach me, I can 
                    stay away from her.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/114A.


      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT33

      Scott and Allison fall onto her bed, kissing and touching 
      each other with every imaginable ounce of teenage desire. As 
      she puts her lips to his neck, his hand reaches up the back 
      of her shirt, fingers finding their way underneath her black 
      bra strap.            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/115.

                    Take it off.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re okay with that?

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay with it?

                                  SCOTT
                    You re asking me if I m okay with 
                    taking your clothes off?

                                    ALLISON
                    Stupid question?

                                  SCOTT
                    Like world record stupid.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay, then you first.

      She stops him, pulling his shirt up. Almost hyperventilating 
      in anticipation Scott helps her lift the shirt over his head. 
      Her fingers draw lightly down his chest making him tremble. 
      Tracing the lines of his stomach she grasps his belt, pulling 
      him back down to her and into a kiss. 

      Then slipping on top of him, she draws his hands up her lower 
      back and underneath her shirt to her bra clasp.

      But he fumbles with it, trying to unhook the clasp under her 
      shirt as she goes at his ear. And then HIS CLAWS slip right 
      through the soft fabric. Scott stares at them in horror.

      He yanks his hand out and Allison s bra with it. But his 
      fingers are back to normal now.

      Then, bringing his lips to hers, he slides his now human 
      fingers over her skin and up her shirt when--

      SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

      Panicked, Allison darts up and off the bed.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Just a second.

      Moving quickly, she pulls Scott up, tossing his shirt right 
      into his face. She motions for him to get in the closet. As 
      she shuts the door on him--            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/116.

                    Nothing. Just doing homework, 
                    sending emails.

      Allison sits back at her computer, typing away.

                    innocent mountain lion in the 
                    school parking lot.

                                  KATE
                    An old French legend that, believe 
                    it or not, involves your family. 
                    Yes, even your boring and lame 
                    family has some cool history.

      Peering through the slats, Scott catches an IMAGE on the 
      screen. A large, four-legged creature with a long snout and 
      absurdly sharp teeth. 

      Kate leans over Allison s shoulder, both of their eyes pinned 
      to the screen.            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/118.

                    Is this for real?

                                  KATE
                    Very real. Mysterious animal 
                    attacks. Just like a certain town 
                    called Beacon Hills.

                                    ALLISON
                    What was it? The animal.

                                  KATE
                    No one knows. But it definitely 
                    wasn t a mountain lion. What s it 
                    look like to you?

      INSIDE THE CLOSET - Scott keeps very still, waiting for the 
      answer. Knowing and dreading what it will be...

                                    ALLISON
                    It looks like a wolf.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT44

      Scott quietly slips down the side of the balcony to the 
      ground. From above, Allison gives a quick wave. He responds 
      with a smile, but it s half-hearted at best. 

      On the sidewalk, he pulls his mother s car keys from his 
      jacket. But then pauses, ears twitching up. He turns back.

      SOMETHING MOVES in the shadows under the trees.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek?

      He hears it again. A quick movement. Leaves rustling.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Okay, I know I said I would stay 
                    away, but you broke my phone and I 
                    had to at least tell her I wasn t

      He trails off as no response comes. Scott holds very still.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      In the blackness, Scott s eyes focus on a vague shape. A 
      vague but very large shape. It blinks with GLOWING RED EYES.

      Scott steps back. Then turns. Then runs for his life.

      Behind him come the SOUNDS of something huge and powerful 
      right on his heels. He runs, breath gasping out of him as he 
      races for his mother s car. 

      INT./EXT. MELISSA S CAR - NIGHT55

      Scott jumps into the car and slams the door shut. He pounds 
      his palm down on the lock and jams the keys into the 
      ignition. But before turning it, he stops to look up.

      IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR - Those glowing EYES approach.

      The dark shape of the Alpha moves slowly and deliberately 
      around the car while Scott sits there, hand still on the 
      ignition.

                                  SCOTT
                          (barely a whisper)
                    What do you want?

      The creature comes toward the driver s side window, its 
      breath STEAMING the glass before Scott can get a look at it.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What do you want from me?

      Something presses against the steamed window causing Scott to 
      flinch back. It s a clawed fingertip. It begins to move, 
      drawing something in the moisture.

      Scott watches, staring through the window as the hand pulls 
      back into the darkness. A moment later the Alpha is gone, 
      having left a simple yet mysterious sign in the condensation.

      Drawn into the steamed glass is a perfect SPIRAL...

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT66

      Scott hurries into his room, slams the door shut and locks 
      it. Then goes to each window, locking them as well. He pulls 
      the shades. Breathing hard, he turns around and--

      SCREAMS. Derek stands right in front of him.

                                  SCOTT
                    You seriously need to stop doing 
                    that.

                    Yeah, we had a nice conversation 
                    about the weather.

      Derek stares at him, unmoving, unblinking.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No. He didn t talk.

                    It s nothing.

      Derek goes for the door, opening it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Whoa, wait a second. You can t do

                                  DEREK
                    It doesn t mean anything.

                    You buried your sister under a

                    You don t want to know.

      Now he leaves. This time Scott lets him go. Alone again, he 
      sits down on his bed, slowly falling back onto the sheets. 
      Exhausted, he closes his eyes--

      He starts to turn a corner when he spots Allison coming right

      Scott slips inside a classroom with a relieved breath. 
      Glancing around, he sees Stiles. But as soon as Stiles sees 
      him, he looks away.

                    trying to figure this out? And that 
                    I went to Derek for help.

      The room settles for the beginning of class. Stiles opens his 
      notebook, pen poised for note taking. Then, unable to stand

                    Your ancestors killed a big wolf. 
                    So what?

                                    ALLISON
                    Not just a big wolf. Look at this 
                    picture. What s it look like to 
                    you?

      Allison flips the page in the book, turning it to reveal a 
      drawing to Lydia. The Beast stands enshrouded in mist, a 
      powerful monster peering out of the darkness with red eyes 
      and sharp claws. Bodies of women and children lie at its 
      feet, looks of pure terror frozen onto their dead faces.

      Lydia stares at the macabre drawing. Gazing at it, as if 
      hypnotized.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Lydia?

      The girl blinks and then looks up at Allison with her usual 
      expression of disdain.

                                  LYDIA
                    It looks. Like a big. Wolf. See you 
                    in History.

      She gets up, leaving Allison alone and passing another table 
      where--

      Stiles sits, eating lunch. A large book stands open on the 
      table in front of him. He peers behind it at Scott trying to 
      eat his lunch.

                                  STILES
                    I think the book is making it more 
                    obvious. Besides she s reading.

      Scott peers up over the edge of his book.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you have a plan yet?

      The BELL RINGS signalling the end of lunch. Scott gets up 
      with Stiles, trying not to be seen. But Allison spots him.

                                    ALLISON
                          (calling out)
                    Scott?

      Pretending not to hear, Scott darts through the doors of the 
      cafeteria, moving quickly for an escape.

      Putting her hand on the door, Allison glances around as if to 
      push through despite it being the Boys Room. But then decides 
      against it.

      Taking a step back she heads off down the hall for class.

      His ear to the door, Scott takes a heavy breath when he 
      realizes Allison is gone.

                    This is not going to be easy.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/FIELD - DAY1313

      Stiles and Scott walk out to the field with their lacrosse 
      equipment. At the benches, Stiles pulls out a black strap 
      with a digital display at its center.

                    This is not exactly how I planned

      Stiles picks up a lacrosse stick and glances down at his 
      phone to look at the heart monitor.

                    Son of a bitch.

      Scott staggers, nearly falling. As he attempts to right 
      himself--

      SOMEONE APPROACHES the field from a distance... Jackson. He 
      steps underneath the bleachers, remaining hidden while 
      watching them with a suspicious but interested eye.

      Stiles twirls the lacrosse stick in his hands.

      Another ball flies, whacking Scott right in the stomach. He 
      gasps for breath, doubling over. Then another shot nails him 
      in the thigh.

                    All right, hold on. Just stop.

      Stiles moves to pick up another ball with the lacrosse stick, 
      but he pauses at the SOUND of gravelly RUMBLING coming 
      towards him. A GROWL.

      THEN A BEEPING SOUND catches his attention. It s the HEART 
      RATE MONITOR on his phone. Stiles picks it up to see the 
      numbers climbing at an alarming speed.

      He looks from his phone to see Scott kneeling on the grass. 
      Both of his hands digging into the dirt, strands of torn duct 
      tape around his wrists. He ripped the duct tape apart.

      he s seeing.

                    I mean it smells like something s 
                    rotting. Or dying...

      As Scott follows Stiles out, a pale Jackson steps from 
      between the lockers, watching them go. Circles under his 
      eyes, lips dry and cracked, the usually handsome young man 
      looks frighteningly sick.

      Alone, he approaches the mirrors and twists around to try to 
      view the back of his neck.

      Pulling his shirt off to get a better look, he brings a hand 
      up to the bandage. He feels at it with his fingertips. The 
      gauze has turned a SICKENING YELLOW.

      The bandage peels off and he lets it slip to the sink.

      He touches the marks, fingers coming back with a strange pus 
      on the tips. Overcome by nausea, Jackson gags, eyes squeezing 
      shut.

      Then, gripping the sink with both hands, he begins to retch, 
      mouth opening as if to vomit. And then...

      SOMETHING STARTS TO COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

      A clawed finger. Then two and three. Like the claws of a 
      crab, grasping at the air, trying to find something to hold 
      onto while seeking their way out of Jackson s mouth as-- 

      He whips his head up to his reflection and suddenly 
      everything is normal again. Breathing hard and harsh gasps, 
      Jackson looks at himself.

      He feels at the nape of his neck, wiping away the excess 
      peroxide. All he sees in the mirror now is his own face. 

      The frightened eyes of a teenage boy.

      Books piled beside her, Allison sits under her locker in the 
      corridor while reading. A few remaining students amble their 
      way down the hall in between periods.

      Allison remains transfixed by her book when one person slowly

                    What are you reading?

      Allison glances up, startled.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh, hey. Just stuff for a history 
                    project.

      He drops his bag and sits next to her under the lockers. 
      Uncomfortably close to her.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    You have a free period?

                                    JACKSON
                    No. I just don t feel like sitting 
                    through Chem.

                                    ALLISON
                      Understandable. Um... Did you want 
                      something?

                                    JACKSON
                    Actually, I wanted to talk. I feel 
                    like I ve been a jerk. To you. And 
                      especially to Scott. And I want to 
                    say sorry. I m serious.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay. I believe you re being 
                    serious. But I m not so sure you re 
                    being sincere.

      Allison turns back to her book. Jackson takes the seat beside 
      her, not letting it go.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ECONOMICS CLASSROOM - DAY1616

      A pile of books drops down on the teacher s desk as students 
      hurry in for the start of class. COACH FINSTOCK glares up at 
      them. He looks hung over as he drops a handful of antacids 
      into his mouth and starts crushing them up with his teeth.

                    So remember the first lacrosse

                    That s what brought you back so you 
                    could score. And then in the locker 
                    room, you didn t kill her. At least 
                    not like you were trying to kill 
                    me. She brings you back.

                    literally every time I m kissing 
                    her or touching her--

                                  STILES
                    That s not the same. When you re 
                    doing that you re just another 
                    hormonal teenager thinking about

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY1818

      Scott follows Stiles around the school to the edge of the 
      parking lot where several large dumpsters sit concealing a  
      FEW SENIORS. They hang out there laughing and talking while 
      smoking.

      One SENIOR climbs out of a smoke filled truck to join the 
      others.

                                  STILES
                          (to Scott)
                    Over here.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are we doing?

                                  STILES
                    You ll see. Stand right here. Do 
                    you have your keys?

      Scott takes out his house keys.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Hold them up. Like this. Now, 
                    whatever happens I want you to 
                    think about Allison. Find her voice 
                    like you did at the game? Got it?

      Scott nods.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Good. Keep holding the keys.

      Stiles walks over to the Senior s truck and takes out his own 
      car keys. Then in a quick few seconds, Stiles drags his key 
      across the side of the Senior s truck, digging a HIDEOUS 
      SCRATCH into the paint.

      As Scott watches in horror, Stiles pockets his keys and turns 
      to him.

                          (to Scott)
                    Dude. What do you think you re 
                    doing to that truck?

                    What the hell?

      Scott steps back as Stiles gives him a devilish smile. The 
      Seniors are on him in a nanosecond. Scott puts up his arms 
      trying to protect himself. But they literally start beating 
      the ever-loving crap out of him.

      Stiles eyes his phone to note the rising heart rate while 
      Scott crumbles to the pavement under the merciless pummeling. 

      But then OUR POV begins moving fast--

        Backtracking from the parking lot, tearing into the halls of 
      the school, whipping through classrooms. We hear VOICES, bits 
      of conversations, laughter, people talking on phones. And 
      then...

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Hey Mom, it s me. Just calling to 
                    let you know I ll be home late 
                    tonight. Studying with a friend. 
                    Yes, that friend. We re lab 
                      partners...

      Until another voice interrupts--

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Stop! Stop right now! What do you 
                    idiots think you re doing?

      BACK AT THE DUMPSTERS - Mr. Harris breaks up the fight. Scott 
      lies on the ground, blood dripping from his nose. He slowly 
      turns to Stiles who holds his phone up. 

      THE SCREEN shows a steady and normal heartbeat. 

      It worked...

      INT. HOSPITAL/PATIENT ROOM - DAY1919

      Peter Hale sits in his wheelchair, pointed to the window. 
      Bright sunlight warms one side of his face while his burns 
      lie in shadow.

      A hand reaches out and slowly turns the chair around. Derek 
      sits down on the bed, pulling his uncle toward him. He tilts 
      his head trying to match Peter s listless gaze.

                                  DEREK
                    Peter?          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1132.

      Derek waves a hand in front of the man s eyes. He doesn t 
      even blink.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    I need your help.

      Derek lifts his uncle s hands and places them on the arms of 
      the wheelchair.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    If you can hear me, I need you to 
                    give me a sign. Anything. Blink or 
                    raise a finger. Just something to 
                    point me in the right direction.

      Peter stares forward, seeming almost to look through Derek.

                    Someone killed Laura. Your niece, 
                    Laura.

      Derek comes closer.

                    Whoever he is, he s an Alpha now. 
                    But one without a pack. Which means 
                    he s not as strong. I can take him. 
                    But I have to find him first. Give 
                    me a sign if you know anything. Is 
                    it one of us? Did someone else 
                    survive the fire?

      Still no response. No movement of any kind.

                    If you know anything, just blink. 
                    Raise a finger. Anything...

      He waits. But his uncle simply stares.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Say something!

      The words thunder out of Derek as he grips his uncles hands 
      practically trying to shake a response out of him.

                                  JENNIFER (O.S.)
                    Let him go.

      Jennifer, standing in the door.        TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1132A.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - DAY2020

      Derek quickly heads to his Camaro in the parking lot of the 
      hospital. Unlocking it, he reaches for the door when he 
      notices A PIECE OF PAPER slipped under the windshield wiper.

      He pulls it out, slowly unfolding it, then reading with 
      interest. He looks up, turning back to the hospital as if 
      trying to find someone watching him. 

      Then crumpling the paper in his hand, he moves quickly, 
      faster than ever.

      A second later, his car ROARS out of the lot and into the 
      street.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY2121

      Scott and Stiles sit in the otherwise empty classroom while 
      Mr. Harris reads the paper. Pulling a wad of tissues away 
      from his nose, Scott turns to Harris.

                    Excuse me, sir, I know it s

                    to be at work. And I don t want to 
                    get fired.

      Harris ignores him. Scott sits quietly with Stiles. Then 
      turns to whisper to him.

                    You have something, Scott. Whether 
                    you want it or not. You can do 
                    things other people can t. That 
                    means you don t have a choice 
                    anymore. It means you have to do

                    I know. And I will.

      Harris eyes them over his newspaper. Then puts it down.

                    All right. Both of you. Out of

      Looking over paperwork, Deaton hears the CHIMES on his door 
      ringing.

      into its side.

      Deaton blinks his eyes open. There is a bruise and cut now 
      under his eye. He glances around to find himself bound to a 
      rolling chair.

                    Then I guess I m going to have to 
                    make myself very, very clear.

      Derek brings the man closer as--The door CLANGS open. Scott 
      looks in, shocked by the display in front of him.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1137.

      Derek drops Deaton back to the floor.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing?

                                  DEATON
                    Scott, get out of here--

      Derek swings his fist down on Deaton s cheek. A vicious blow, 
      knocking the man out cold.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stop!

                                  DEREK
                    He can keep himself from healing 
                    when conscious. But unconscious...

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you out of your mind?

                                  DEREK
                    You want to know what the spiral 
                    means? It s our sign for a 
                    vendetta. For revenge. It means he 
                    won t stop killing until he s 
                      satisfied.

                                  SCOTT
                    You think he s the Alpha?

                                  DEREK
                    We re about to find out.

      Derek holds up his hand, claws out. But as he swipes down, a 
      CLAWED HAND grabs him by the wrist. Whipping his head around, 
      Derek looks at Scott-- 

      FULLY TRANSFORMED.

      With a vise-like grip on Derek s wrist, Scott opens his mouth 
      wide, baring his fangs and letting LOOSE a VICIOUS SNARL.

      Derek actually blinks in surprise. Scott lets him go. Then, 
      with an extraordinary display of control, he transforms 
      back... 

      The claws retract into his fingers. His teeth withdraw, 
      changing shape and returning to normal. The yellow GLOW in 
      his eyes dissolve to his normal brown. 

      It takes seconds, but it happens with a stunning fluidity and 
      grace. As if it was as natural a movement as breathing.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1138.

      Scott stares defiantly at a speechless Derek. For once, he s 
      both calm and fearless.

                    Hit him again. And then you ll see

      Scott looks over his still unconscious boss, blotting his 
      bloody cheek with a towel.

                                  DEREK
                    You have a plan?

      Scott tosses the bloody towel into the trash as--

      Stiles s Jeep ROARS into the lot. He and Scott get out.

                                  STILES
                    This is a terrible idea.

                      Personally, I m a big fan of 
                    ignoring a problem and hoping it 
                    goes away.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just make sure we can get inside.

      Stiles yanks out a set of BOLT CUTTERS.

      A pair of headlights approach as Derek s Camaro parks in a 
      nearby space. Derek kills the engine and steps out from 
      behind the wheel. Scott and Stiles approach him.         TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1139A.

                    He looks comfortable.

      Scott and Stiles start for the school building.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/VICE PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - NIGHT2727

      Moonlight bleeds though the horizontal blinds, lighting the 
      room. The door SMASHES INWARD, Scott and Stiles stumbling in. 

                                  STILES
                    One question: What are you going to

                    its position to the rest of the

      Scott pulls the PA MICROPHONE over to his mouth. As he 
      PRESSES THE BUTTON on the base of the mic, Stiles gives him 
      an encouraging nod.

      Scott takes a deep breath, clears his throat, leans into the 
      microphone...  

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT2828

      Derek stands in front of his car, eyes still on Deaton 
      through the windshield. He doesn t move a muscle, poised like 
      a cobra ready to strike. That is until he hears--

      A PATHETIC HOWL ringing over the PA SYSTEM. Derek slowly 
      turns around in shock.

                    You got to be kidding me...

      Scott releases the button and gazes up to Stiles. His best 
      friend holds his head in his hands.

                                  SCOTT
                    Was that okay? That was a howl.

                    Like a cat being choked to death.

                    Well, what do I do? How am I 
                    supposed to do this?

      Crossing behind the desk, Stiles takes Scott s shoulders in 
      his hands and leans in close, eye-to-eye, full trainer mode.

      Scott nods, grabbing the microphone. He takes a deep breath 
      once again and--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT3030

      A POWERFUL HOWL BLASTS THROUGH THE PA SPEAKERS. 

      Lockers rattle, desks shake. Almost as if an earthquake is 
      rocking the entire school.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT3131

      The howl echoes across the buildings, bellowing out from the 
      speakers, over the trees and into the night sky.

      Derek turns back, now actually impressed. But clearly not 
      happy. 

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT3232

      Waiting outside her house, Allison clicks on her phone to 
      check the time: 8:35. 

      The faint cry of Scott s howl soars to her in the wind. She 
      glances up at the odd sound.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT3333

      Scott and Stiles bang through the doors of the school and out 
      into the parking lot.

                    I m going to kill the two of you 
                    myself. Are you trying to attract

                    I didn t know it would be that 
                    loud.

                    It was loud. And it was awesome.

      But Scott is no longer paying attention to either of them. 
      Instead he s looking at Derek s Camaro. The door is open. 
      Ripped bindings lying on the pavement.

      Derek steps forward, surprised.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1143.

      Derek jerks forward. Blood SPURTS from his mouth as he rises 
      up into the air, held aloft by something dark and large 
      behind him.

      SCREAMING, Stiles and Scott stagger back.

      Derek s body goes flying, SLAMMING into the brick wall of the 
      school and dropping down.

      Tripping over their own feet, Scott and Stiles run for it, 
      racing for the school.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT3434

      Scott and Stiles yank the double doors of the school shut. 
      Holding them closed, they look up at each other in breathless 
      terror.

      And approaching from the shadows is a huge and terrifying 
      black shape with glowing red eyes.
