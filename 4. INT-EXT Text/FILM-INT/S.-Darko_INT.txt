COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined
driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
passenger side and slams the door shut.
Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
COREY
What time is it?
SAM
Early...
Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
then spits out the window. She starts the car...
2.
I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY
Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
makes a face at Sam as they pass by...
Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.
COREY
Shit...
Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside
motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's
GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL
SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.
PHIL
What can I do for you?
COREY
We need a room.
He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey
finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A
NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW
VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.
6.
SAM
How much is it?
PHIL
$39 a night. How many you stayin'?
COREY
Just a couple, we hope.
He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.
PHIL
Well... welcome to El Reno.
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes.
COREY
How much money do we have left?
15.
SAM
Not a whole lot.
COREY
I can't believe your fucking
parents wouldn't give you anything.
SAM
They totally flipped out that I was
even going. They weren't about to
give me money for the big trip.
COREY
We should've waited till the end of
the month when my mom gets her
check.
SAM
She wouldn't have given you
anything.
COREY
I know where she keeps her cash.
What's she gonna do, send her
boyfriend after me?
Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
COREY (CONT'D)
Doesn't matter. As soon as we get
to Vegas, we'll be set. My cousin
said sometimes she makes two grand
in a week.
SAM
Jesus.
Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction
exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with
plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.
AGATHA
Here you go. Where'd you two say
you were from again?
SAM
Virginia.
AGATHA
You hear that, Ted?
She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
16.
TED
What?
AGATHA
These girls are from Virginia.
TED
I'll be damned. I'm from Reedville,
if you know where abouts that is...
Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.
TED (CONT'D)
Well, have yourself some ice cream
when you're done, on the house.
COREY
SAM
Okay.
Thank you.
AGATHA
Anything else you need, give a
holler.
Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
food...
Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
JEREMY
Just a coffee, please.
Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.
COREY
Can we help you?
JEREMY
No, no... it's just that I
recognize you. I saw you by the
motel. Pretty amazing, huh?
COREY
I guess.
JEREMY
I just made a deal with Frank Haley
to buy it for seven-hundred fifty
dollars.
17.
COREY
Whoop-dee-doo. What the hell are
you gonna do with a friggin'
meteor?
JEREMY
Meteorite, actually...
Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and
munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
student at Redlands... we've
actually got a pretty cool geology
lab there.
Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I've gotta do some tests, but if I
had to guess, I'd say it's a
siderite. They're composed
primarily of iron and nickel.
COREY
Have fun.
JEREMY
My name's Jeremy.
COREY
That's nice.
Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or
embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at
her, and she can't help but smile back.
The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
can been seen...
In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
dance performance... BACK TO:
Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
where two walls and the ceiling meet...
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
26.
Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
FLAME...
Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
OVER WHITE...
The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
beds.
She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
PHIL
You plannin' on checkin' out today?
SAM
(GROGGY)
Uh... I, I don't know yet.
PHIL
Well, it's already way past
checkout time, so you'd better
figure it out quick.
SAM
I've just gotta find Corey... and
check on the car.
27.
PHIL
You do whatever you have to, but if
you're stayin' another night I
wanna see some money up front.
Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-
WORKERS are consoling her.
TRUDY
I don't believe it... I still just
don't believe it.
FEMALE CO-WORKER
It's gonna be alright. You'll see.
Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.
TRUDY
(dabbing at her eyes with
a tissue)
Can I help you?
SAM
Is everything okay?
TRUDY
No, it's not... Mount Calvary
burned to the ground last night.
SAM
Mount Calvary?
TRUDY
Father Homeijer's church.
SAM
Oh... How did it happen?
28.
TRUDY
The police are looking into it,
but... I know it was arson.
Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.
TRUDY (CONT'D)
It's no secret to me how people in
this town feel about Father
Homeijer. The horrible accusations
that have been made against him...
But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
Reno's changed so much since I was
a kid growing up here. The young
people nowadays...
(BEAT)
No offense.
She places her hand on top of Sam's.
TRUDY (CONT'D)
But with all the drugs and the
crime... I just don't know what
this world's coming to anymore.
Sam tries to redirect her focus.
SAM
Are you able to get money wired
here from my bank back home?
TRUDY
We don't usually work with other
banks like that.
SAM
I need to check my balance and get
my money out. How do I do that?
TRUDY
You'll have to call and arrange it.
You could always use Western Union.
Where's your bank?
SAM
Virginia.
TRUDY
Oh... `cause they're gonna need to
have a signature.
Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
29.
ANGLE: NEAR EXIT
As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with
another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's
dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &
white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and
despair.
MIKE
How many cheeseburgers did we get?
RUTH
Like eight.
Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit,
chases it with some beer...
JEFF
Wait, did we get smokes?
Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when
they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.
MIKE
RANDY
Whoa!
Jesus Christ...
31.
POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS
POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer
O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing
amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount
Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
store...
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
break.
Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
car is stopped at a red light.
SAM
We just gotta figure out what we're
gonna do. I don't think-
COREY
(ABRUPT)
Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
SAM
What?
COREY
You wanna run back to mommy and
daddy and say sorry so they can put
you through college. Well that's
real big of you, Sam, but I don't
have that option.
SAM
(taken aback)
What are you talking about?
COREY
I'll go home and get the shit
kicked out of me, and get my ass
grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
the backseat, smelling the drama.
COREY (CONT'D)
I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
but not this quick.
SAM
I'm not bailing on you. Would you
JUST-
34.
COREY
You can fucking sleepwalk back to
Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
driving you... you're a fucking
drag.
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
intersection, making a left...
SAM
Fuck you, Corey.
Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
the intersection.]
Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
forward progress impossible.
RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
infinite space.
She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
KA-BOOM!
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
-- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
35.
The world goes SILENT.
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
USED TO BE...
SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY
STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the
expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits
facing her.
OFFICER O'DELL
You're sure you didn't see a
driver?
COREY
No...
He takes the statement from her.
OFFICER O'DELL
Well, you're one lucky girl to have
gotten outta the car when you did.
Front passenger side was wiped
right out. Coulda' been two dead
girls today instead of one.
Corey nods, taking this in.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
I talked to Randy and sent him home
a little while ago. He's pretty
shook up.
Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
confidence.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Both of us know he'd been doin'
some drinkin' today. But we also
know he's not at fault here. That
old beater cut right in front him.
COREY
Can't you just look up the license
plates?
36.
OFFICER O'DELL
No plates on the vehicle. We're
investigating the VIN, but that
could take a little more time,
depending on the history of
ownership. We'll find him.
Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:
COREY
What about the missing boy?
O'Dell shifts in his chair.
OFFICER O'DELL
You really think it was him, huh?
COREY
He was on the side of the road
right before the accident.
OFFICER O'DELL
I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
sometimes shock does funny
things...
COREY
You think I was hallucinating?
OFFICER O'DELL
We were on the scene five minutes
after the accident. I think
somebody woulda noticed a little
boy wandering around.
He sees how troubled Corey is.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
Peters on your way out... right
down the hall there. She'll give
you somethin' to make you feel
better.
Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
O'Dell's voice stops her.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Oh, uh... is there anything you
wanted to say to Samantha's
parents?
Corey's expression is blank.
37.
COREY
Like what?
Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
Sam's belongings are spread out.
She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:
CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
COREY
Fragmentary Universe...
She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
several days... FADE TO BLACK.
39.
Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
from outside...
Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store,
looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking
some shelves near the back of the store.
CHRIS
Hey... how ya feelin'?
COREY
Not so good.
CHRIS
Is there anything I can do?
COREY
I need some cigarettes... and maybe
some food. But I don't really have
any money right now.
CHRIS
I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind
the store.
Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth
near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM
ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
CHRIS
That was Sam's brother?
COREY
Yeah.
On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted
away by a CRANE.
43.
CHRIS
Her parents must be going through
hell.
COREY
Sam said once she wished it landed
on her room instead of Donnie's.
Chris thinks on this.
CHRIS
I saw something on Sam's wrist the
other night... it looked like a
scar.
COREY
She told me it was from some
accident. Put her hand through a
window or something.
CHRIS
Did you believe her?
Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
known origin...
A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
air...
CHRIS (CONT'D)
God...
Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
Munchkinland.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I don't understand why we're
lookin' at this stuff.
COREY
They still never found a driver to
that car that hit Randy... I was
standing right there. I didn't see
anyone.
44.
CHRIS
I was pretty close too, but
everything was all crazy. Whoever
it was must've jumped out and took
off.
COREY
I found this book in Sam's backpack
last night. There's a chapter where
it talks about stuff like this
happening. Like a guy being killed
by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
swordsmith getting killed by a
sword he hadn't made yet.
Unexplainable things, but it says
there's a reason why they happen.
CHRIS
A book...? I don't get what your
talkin' about. What was the reason?
COREY
It didn't say.
Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
something...
COREY (CONT'D)
Last night, and right before the
accident, I saw...
CHRIS
What?
COREY
Nothing.
Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
COREY (CONT'D)
You already think I'm a freak show.
As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy
Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.
In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto
the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,
and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...
45.
I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'
truck.
They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
barking in a frenzy --
RUTH (O.S.)
Darielle!
The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
over a cut on her forehead.
RUTH (CONT'D)
Come to check on your car?
COREY
Yeah...
Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
RUTH
Randy's been a wreck since the
accident.
CHRIS
He should be. He was driving around
shit-faced and somebody got killed.
RUTH
You can just fuck off...
She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
retreats a step or two.
RUTH (CONT'D)
Prima donna motherfucker think your
shit don't stink?
Corey steps in:
COREY
She's right...
Chris gives her a look.
COREY (CONT'D)
I mean, there's nothing Randy
could've done.
46.
Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.
RUTH
I'll get my dad.
The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at
each other...
Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
hand.
DUSTY
Got some bad news for you...
He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.
DUSTY (CONT'D)
Your engine seized up when your
water pump blew.
COREY
I need a new engine now?
DUSTY
I can get one in there for you.
Cost you about fifteen hundred.
Corey's face drops.
COREY
I don't have anywhere near that
much money.
CHRIS
That's probably as much as the
car's worth.
DUSTY
I understand. But, I already
ordered the water pump, and I'll
have to get paid for my time. That
comes to about three-hundred total.
COREY
I don't have that much either.
Dusty is perturbed.
DUSTY
You think I do this for charity?
47.
CHRIS
You didn't do anything. What's she
want a water pump for if she
doesn't have an engine?
DUSTY
I see how it is... couple a' punks.
You don't plan to pay what you owe,
you can get the hell off my
property right now.
Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm.
COREY
(under her breath)
Asshole.
CHRIS
Let's go...
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON
Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the
same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT
OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.
As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the
window.
FATHER HOMEIJER
Good afternoon.
TRUDY
We're taking collections to help
rebuild Mount Calvary after the
tragic fire.
FATHER HOMEIJER
Any small amount you could manage
would really help.
CHRIS
Sorry.
Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger
seat but she just stares back at them.
FATHER HOMEIJER
God bless you.
They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
48.
CHRIS
Everybody wants somethin'...
COREY
What about you?
CHRIS
What do you mean?
COREY
You wouldn't give me stuff and
drive me around if you didn't want
something in return.
CHRIS
Why not?
COREY
`Cause that's just not how it
works.
CHRIS
Maybe you're wrong about that.
Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.
COREY
See ya.
She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
INFOMERCIAL...
Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
runs over the TV screen.
Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.
RANDY
Do you hate me?
COREY
Huh?
49.
RANDY
You think it's my fault she's dead.
COREY
No...
RANDY
You mean it?
COREY
Yeah... it wasn't your fault.
Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.
RANDY
What's that?
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
COREY
Oh, it's just... something of
Sam's.
Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.
RANDY
You wanna get outta here for a
while? I got my dad's car.
I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
other cars but still with a nice view.
RANDY
I've been comin' up here since I
was a kid. Good place when you
wanna just get away from
everything.
Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.
COREY
Is Ruth your girlfriend?
50.
Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.
RANDY
Naw, we're just friends. She's
pretty weird sometimes. Too like...
intense, or something.
COREY
Seems like you guys are pretty
close.
RANDY
Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.
Randy takes another hit and holds it in.
COREY
Do you ever have a hard time
telling what's real and what's not
real?
Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.
RANDY
Sometimes... sometimes something
can feel really real, but it's just
your mind playing tricks on you.
COREY
I've got so much shit in my head
right now... I've never felt so
outta control. I think I'm really
goin' psycho.
He passes her the joint.
RANDY
I got some acid from my buddy one
time... this like flying eagle
pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
man... next thing I knew I was on
the floor, curled up in ball, and
Mike and Jeff were just standing
there lookin' down at me. I could
see this like glowing grid cutting
through my brain, and I knew when
it got all the way through I'd be
this sketched out vegetable. I
could picture my dad staring down
at me in the hospital in my
straightjacket, crying and shit...
Corey blows out a hit, captivated...
51.
RANDY (CONT'D)
The whole time my esophagus was
like twisting and turning in my
throat and cutting off my air
supply... it was terrible.
COREY
Jesus.
RANDY
I can still slip back into it
sometimes, but I know now that my
brain is what's making it real...
and that's like a blessing and a
curse, man, `cause that means you
have to decide what's real and
what's not.
COREY
The things that feel the most real
right now are... impossible. More
like a dream.
Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
car's ashtray.
RANDY
I know what you mean. The scariest
part is thinking you're not the
same person anymore. Something's
changed... like your identity.
COREY
What if the change is for the
better?
Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.
RANDY
That's fucked up.
COREY
I don't think I even care if I'm
crazy.
Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
They're about to kiss, when --
COREY (CONT'D)
What the fuck?
A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
and a RIFLE...
52.
It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW
SQUATTING GROUND.
COREY (CONT'D)
That fucking guy again...
Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's
proximity has spoiled the mood.
RANDY
Let's get outta here.
Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.
As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
with her eyes...
Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE
UP of COBAIN'S
FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET
HOLE drawn in
RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.
The words `I'M
NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the
bottom of the
poster in the same BRIGHT RED.
COREY
This is cool.
RANDY
Thanks.
Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.
Corey turns to face him...
They kiss...
...and fall back onto the bed...
53.
A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
the bed and grabs her shirt...
...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
BILLY MOORCROFT
Only one day left.
Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
COREY
What am I supposed to do?
As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
she treads out the door...
In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
the floor.
Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
corner...
BILLY MOORCROFT
You can do it.
COREY
How?
BILLY MOORCROFT
It's easy.
Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
from the sink drain, also in the shower...
Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
morose expression transforms into a smile.
The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --
POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE
We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we
hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE
CRASHING --
She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the
stairs...
Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles
through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.
Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with
MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...
Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and
flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling
SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...
But the bowl doesn't refill.
RUTH
Shit!
56.
She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...
Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He
looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.
Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds
Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.
CUSTOMER
I just checked aisle three.
CHRIS
They're there. At the front, by the
Trapper Keepers.
The Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing
beside him.
COREY
I'm outta cigarettes.
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of
Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING
RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the
Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary
Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be
chosen...
She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE
MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful
than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent
Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver
through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...
Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's
image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the
foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.
COREY
I already saved you.
BILLY MOORCROFT
It's not over.
He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own
reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.
HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE
MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.
The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in
particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of
life.
58.
COREY
(CONFUSED)
Why?
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a
small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over
a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that
reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway
connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,
is an older female version of Billy himself.
As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into
BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD
PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she
looks as though she's barely keeping it together.
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
(between bites of cake)
The place for Billy to be right now
is at home with his family...
Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.
BILLY'S MOTHER
Excuse me.
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
Oh, thank you.
The Psychologist accepts a cup.
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D)
It'll take years for him to work
through what happened, but the best
way to open those doors is to
surround him with things that are
familiar...
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a
long, painful moment of eye contact.
DAY
Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears
the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
59.
He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are
marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet
of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.
His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder
at the DRAWING that he's working on.
BILLY'S MOTHER
Are you sure you don't want some
more cake?
Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him
color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and
tries to get his attention.
BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
Billy... I-
Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL.
Billy never looks up.
I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.
BILLY'S FATHER
Only family and close friends are
welcome here today.
Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and
wary of the stranger.
COREY
I understand... I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry about everything
that happened to Billy. And I know
it doesn't seem like it, but
everything happens for a reason...
and it'll all work out in the end.
Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave
uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:
...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.
Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly
executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one
from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.
60.
Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took
place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and
oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
61.
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and
comes into view, descending on the intersection.
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of
an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the
earth...
As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection,
Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...
CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY
The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...
The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an
eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey...
mouth widening to swallow...
Corey is riveted.
As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER
hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:
KEY SCENES IN REVERSE
PILLS COME OUT OF BILLY'S MOUTH AND INTO HIS HAND --
HIS DRAWING OF THE SWING SET STARTS TO DECONSTRUCT --
RUTH'S COCAINE FLIES OUT OF THE SWIRLING TOILET WATER --
DUSTY STEPS BACKWARDS OUT OF THE POLICE CRUISER --
RUTH'S EYE CLOSES BEFORE COREY'S FOOT STEPS OFF OF HERS --
62.
COREY STEPS AWAY FROM THE KURT COBAIN POSTER WITH `I'M NOT
AFRAID OF DYING' SCRAWLED ON IT --
MICROFILM PAGES FLIP BACKWARDS --
PICTURES OF THE DARKO FAMILY ARE PUT BACK INTO THE PHILOSOPHY
OF TIME TRAVEL BOOK -- TRANSITION TO:
Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
store...
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
break.
64.
Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
backseat.
She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
herself to any more of their mockery...
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
from stepping into the street...
She quickens her pace, almost there when --
KA-BOOM!
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
The world goes SILENT.
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
USED TO BE...
THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...
SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR
WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS
TO HER KNEES.
Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes
red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.
OFFICER O'DELL
I just gotta ask you one more
time... you're sure you didn't see
a driver?
65.
Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Well, we'll find him, one way or
another.
Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has
traumatized her.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
Peters on your way out... right
down the hall there. She'll give
you somethin' to make you feel
better.
Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and
cries. Major emotional release.
Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have
the words.
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
Chris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE
OF PILLS in her hand.
66.
CHRIS
I'm really sorry, Sam.
She doesn't respond.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It's horrible... but sometimes
these things can happen for a
reason. Sometimes good can come of
it... growth, ya know?
SAM
What the fuck are you talking
about?
Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
caustic.
CHRIS
All I meant was, sometimes-
SAM
I know what you meant, and it's
bullshit. When someone dies for no
reason you can't just make one up
to fill the void and make yourself
feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
everything up, but it doesn't mean
shit beyond that.
CHRIS
I'm sorry, I-
SAM
You've obviously never lost anybody
like I have, `cause if you did
you'd already know that.
Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.
SAM (CONT'D)
Thanks for the ride.
She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
67.
The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
in both of the panes.
The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
family together...
Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
part of her right wrist...
She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:
CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
SAM
Remnants...
A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the
Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or
Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred
from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all
corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...
Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy
drives.
JEREMY
You do that a lot?
SAM
I think it's genetic or something.
JEREMY
That's interesting... I've never
heard of a specific genetic marker
for sleepwalking.
SAM
It's just that my brother used to
do it too.
JEREMY
He doesn't anymore?
SAM
No.
JEREMY
I think it's more common in
children. When did your brother
stop?
SAM
When he died.
Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial
DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and
sits back in a chair in front of the machine.
As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus
and she goes into a daze... TRANSITION TO:
ARIEL, the STUFFED TOY UNICORN spins on a ROTATING CHAIR...
YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
Donnie!
DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
(MOCKING)
The Last Unicorn, by Samantha
Darko!
YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
Give it back!
DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
There was once a unicorn named
Ariel...
The SOUND of CRINKLING PAPER.
YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
Donnie! You wrinkled it.
DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
It's not wrinkled Sam. Just, ya
know, flatten it in a book or
something...
The chair is re-spun by an O.S. hand... and the UNICORN
topples off onto the floor. BACK TO:
Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father
Homeijer going around, asking for change.
FATHER HOMEIJER
Any small amount you could manage
would really help.
They hover over a FAT MAN, holding out the COLLECTIONS JAR.
73.
FAT MAN
Piss off...
FATHER HOMEIJER
God bless you.
As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up.
Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her.
TRUDY
Oh... hello.
She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward. It
doesn't work.
Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer
the hint to move on. He follows her lead.
FATHER HOMEIJER
(to Sam)
God bless you.
Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly
filled with sadness...
Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab.
There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION
ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.
As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
an extremely SMALL CAGE...
JEREMY
Here's my station.
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
SAM
That's it?
JEREMY
The rest is locked away somewhere
else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
gonna want a piece of this thing
pretty soon.
He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.
77.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
You ever seen one of these?
SAM
No.
JEREMY
It's a scanning electron
microscope. It uses electrons
instead of light to scan the image.
A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
At first I thought it was a
siderite, but then I saw it was
more than that. Much more. It does
have a percentage of nickel and
iron in it as I first suspected.
But it also has something else.
He waits for Sam to take the bait.
SAM
And what's that?
He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
them.
JEREMY
An unrecognizable element. I've
done all the tests. It doesn't
exist on the periodic table.
Jeremy is practically beaming.
SAM
So this is pretty major.
JEREMY
This is history. I'm thinking of
calling it framium.
SAM
Framium?
JEREMY
For my last name... Frame.
78.
SAM
What if it's like... proof of some
alien life-form from another galaxy
or something.
Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
his left forearm as he talks.
JEREMY
It's very important you promise me
you won't tell anyone else what
I've showed you. I have to wait
till just the right moment. NASA,
or some secret government
organization could come in here and
take it away from me...
As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...
JEREMY (CONT'D)
And then later on, years from now,
take credit for the discovery
themselves.
SAM
I won't say anything.
JEREMY
Good.
Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
SAM
There's this book I think you'd
like... I got it from my physics
teacher in high school.
JEREMY
The study of physics has unraveled
some of the most profound mysteries
of the universe.
SAM
It's called The Philosophy of Time
Travel.
JEREMY
Time travel?
SAM
Yeah, but it's not really that.
It's more like one scenario, or one
type of scenario. I don't
completely understand it...
79.
Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.
SAM (CONT'D)
Another mystery.
JEREMY
What do you mean?
SAM
My life seems to be full of them.
JEREMY
Mysteries are what make life
interesting...
Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because
Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
You're a mystery to me, Samantha.
He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
Ow...
Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and
sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger
RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
his forearm.
SAM
That doesn't look good.
JEREMY
I should get some Hydrocortisone.
He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
SAM
(regarding the attempted
KISS)
Sorry about that.
JEREMY
I'm sorry. I should've know better.
You barely know me, right?
SAM
And nobody really calls my
Samantha. Just my mom and dad.
Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
80.
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
store...
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
break.
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the
crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but
deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the
GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...
No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly
ajar.
FATHER HOMEIJER
Dusty?
He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
Are you home, son?
He lets himself inside...
Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is
full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO
that sits on the kitchen counter.
FATHER HOMEIJER
(calling out)
Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for
a small donation...
The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out.
With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound
-- soft, distant CRYING.
He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The
CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey
out of the motel room.]
82.
Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare
overhead BULB...
He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old
WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING,
which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a
foul smell...
FATHER HOMEIJER
Who's there?
He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's
nearly frozen in shock --
The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits
on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a
pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL
and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is
soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.
Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.
O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her
CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS
litter the walls.
Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell
starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --
He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until
he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...
ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell
covertly.
Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN
comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:
TELEVISION ANCHOR
We have an update this morning on
our breaking news of Billy
Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who
was kidnapped over 15 months ago,
and rescued yesterday afternoon by
Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary
Church. Billy's condition at this
time is considered stable...
Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to
the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being
INTERVIEWED:
FIELD REPORTER
Father, what led you to this
particular house on this particular
day?
84.
FATHER HOMEIJER
I was out collecting donations in
order to help rebuild my church,
Mount Calvary, which recently
burned down. Clearly the Lord works
in mysterious ways. This is nothing
less than divine intervention...
Sam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and
Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE.
AGATHA
Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in
here for coffee ever since I can
remember... gives me the shivers.
Ted pipes up from behind the counter:
TED
They should hang guys like that.
Only thing bothers me is how many
of `em are still out there...
Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.
TED (CONT'D)
Hang `em all.
AGATHA
(to Sam)
I'll be right back with your
breakfast.
As Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table.
CHRIS
May I?
SAM
Sure.
85.
CHRIS
I guess you heard.
SAM
Yeah.
CHRIS
It's so messed up... I feel bad
that I recommended him now.
Agatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam.
AGATHA
What can I get you, honey?
CHRIS
Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee,
please.
AGATHA
White or wheat?
CHRIS
Wheat toast, please...
He refocuses his attention back on Sam.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
If I had kids, I'd be worried sick
about `em in a world like this. I'm
sure your parents must be.
SAM
Hey, you could've been some crazy
rapist serial killer.
Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this
last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before
setting the coffee down and leaving.
SAM (CONT'D)
You turned out okay.
CHRIS
Yeah, but everybody doesn't.
SAM
I can take care of myself.
CHRIS
I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't
feel right if I didn't tell you
about Jeremy.
86.
SAM
What about him?
CHRIS
I don't know what you have goin'
with him... but you shouldn't be
hangin' around him. Let's just
leave it at that.
SAM
What makes you think you can tell
me who I can and can't hang around
with?
CHRIS
It's just that I know him better
than you do. He lived in my
neighborhood when we were kids.
SAM
So?
CHRIS
So he used to do weird stuff... to
animals.
Sam waits for him to go on.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
My sister lost her pet rabbit once,
and we went all over the
neighborhood lookin' for it. We
were just about to call it quits
when we heard something comin' from
Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a
trash can and put the lid on.
Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It was half starved by the time we
got it home. Died just a few days
later.
SAM
How old was he?
CHRIS
I don't know, just a couple years.
Cute little black and white-
SAM
No. Jeremy.
87.
CHRIS
He was like nine, probably.
SAM
He was just a kid, he didn't know
what he was doing.
CHRIS
When you were nine years old did
you know it was wrong to put a
living creature in the trash can
and leave it there?
Sam's had enough.
SAM
Chris... you're a nice guy, but you
don't have to be looking out for
me. You're not my dad, you're not
my big brother...
Chris hangs his head, frustrated.
O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on
his cot and stares up at the ceiling.
OFFICER O'DELL
You know what they do to faggot-ass
perverts like you in maximum
security, dontcha?
O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely.
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit
like you...
Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION,
picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down
the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly...
He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE
PRODUCTS.
JEREMY
Sam...
When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much
more embarrassed than she does.
SAM
Oh, hi Jeremy.
JEREMY
Hi... sorry.
SAM
That's okay, what's up?
92.
JEREMY
Nothing... just that I haven't see
you around for the past few days. I
was worried. I thought you might've
taken off.
SAM
No... I've been around. Going for
lots of walks.
JEREMY
I stopped by the motel.
Sam finds his manner a bit odd.
SAM
Like I said, I've been in and out.
JEREMY
Well, there's something I wanted to
ask you. You know that book you
mentioned?
SAM
Yeah...
JEREMY
I'd really love to check it out.
SAM
Oh...
Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
JEREMY
You said you'd show it to me
sometime, and I've got a hunch it
could really help me in some of my
studies related to-
SAM
I don't have it anymore.
JEREMY
What?
SAM
I kind of... gave it to someone.
JEREMY
To who? Why?
93.
SAM
I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I
said you could borrow it, and this
GUY-
JEREMY
What guy?
SAM
Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.
Jeremy is furious.
JEREMY
Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the
book to Vietnam Tom!?
Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of
control.
JEREMY (CONT'D)
I don't fucking believe what you're
telling me!
SAM
It's just a book...
JEREMY
He's a fucking bum! And you chose
him over me!?
SAM
No... I just-
Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns
and finds Chris standing behind him.
CHRIS
That's enough.
Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.
JEREMY
This is none of your business.
CHRIS
It is, actually. You're disturbing
my customers. Get out.
Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are
left alone. There's a definite "I told you so" aura.
94.
SAM
(MUTTERING)
You didn't have to do that.
CHRIS
Just doin' my job.
Sam starts to walk away, at first forgetting the products she
needed. She comes back to get them, slightly flustered. Chris
turns and leaves her in peace.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(as he's walking away)
You're welcome.
Father Homeijer and Trudy are sitting on the couch in the
living room of his quaint house, sharing a BOTTLE OF
CHAMPAGNE.
TRUDY
I never had any doubts in you, or
in the Lord.
FATHER HOMEIJER
I know that. And we both truly
appreciate all your faith and hard
work...
They sip their champagne. Trudy glows.
FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
We needed a miracle, but we got two
instead.
Trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass, but the
priest puts his hand over it.
FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
I think I've had enough.
TRUDY
One more glass won't hurt you. You
deserve it, Father...
I/E. O'DELL'S CAR/ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
O'DELL'S CAR pulls up to an old warehouse and parks.
OFFICER HINES
Where the hell are they?
95.
Hines is nervous. He lights a cigarette.
OFFICER O'DELL
They'll be here. Just take it easy.
Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne. Trudy is
already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it
on the coffee table. She moves closer to him on the couch...
FATHER HOMEIJER
Trudy...
She puts her hand on his leg.
96.
TRUDY
I see the way you look at me,
Father...
She moves in closer... He looks uncomfortable.
TRUDY (CONT'D)
I want you too.
She's about to kiss him, but Father Homeijer stops her.
TRUDY (CONT'D)
I can't do this. I'm a man of the
cloth... and you'd regret it.
He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND
on her finger.
Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls.
TRUDY
I feel like such an idiot...
Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say.
Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand
roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his
prints -- JUMP CUT TO:
POLICEMAN (V.O.)
Name?
Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO:
POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
(getting angry)
What's your name?
The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a
chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
YOUNG OFFICER
We found this on him...
He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The
name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW.
Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the
floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...
Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...
Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
He comes face to face with Sam.
106.
She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.
She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints
off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the
parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears
stream down his cheeks...
He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a
vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's
CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by
the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
CHRIS
Where the hell is Sam?
JEREMY
(FRANTIC)
I don't know... I don't know...
Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand
him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down
the hill...
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The
CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.
The METEORITE sits in a dark corner of the barn, collecting
dust...
Sam leans her head against the window of Chris' truck as they
cruise along the highway...
She gazes up at the bright, open sky.
