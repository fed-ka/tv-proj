We fly high above heavenly clouds.
Beneath a brilliant blue
sky.
A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us...
TED NELSON (V.O.)
On any given day, your life can
change in the blink of an eye.
It's a clich, I know...
Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in
a dreamy gauze.
We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a
small town.
Descending lower.
And lower.
To Xenia, Ohio.
TED (V.O.)
...But a lot of clichs get to be
clichs because they're true. Your
life CAN change in the blink of an
eye.
What I mean is, one day
you're a regular chump, a wannabe
something.
You're not even totally
sure WHAT you wannabe...
We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle
America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son
Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market."
You
can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.
TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...The next day the doorbell rings
and some stranger's holding your
ticket to being SOMEBODY.
Still flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a
Schwinn.
We follow as he pedals his way to...
TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL
A three story building.
Older, brick, sturdy.
Meticulously
maintained.
TED (V.O.)
It happens every day.
Dreams come
true.
And not just for those dim
witted chain-smoking hillbillies
you see on TV.
You know, the ones
who win the Super Lotto and spend
their fortune on a truck full of
Goobers and a new set of front
teeth.
It could happen to any guy,
any time...even ME.
A JANITOR raises the American flag.
It flaps proudly as the
teenager chains his bike to a bike rack.
He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip
sunglasses.
When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to
sparkle.
TED (V.O.)
Uh, that's not me.
I'm over here.
We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.
Meet our
much less glamorous hero:
TED NELSON, 17.
A decent looking
kid.
Not hip enough to be cool.
Not square enough to be
tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.
TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You're disappointed, I know. I
admit, I was hopeless back then.
The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I
always had good taste in women.
Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a
short, rotund man in his mid-50s.
TED
Whoa! Sorry, mister.
Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground.
Ted helps to retrieve them.
ZUKERMAN
In a hurry, are we?
TED
I was in the middle of a
melodramatic exit. It wouldn't
really make a statement if I
tiptoed out the door...What are you
selling?
ZUKERMAN
Bad news.
TED
People pay good money for that?
ZUKERMAN
I'm just a messenger.
Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news
must be for him.
TED
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad
news I can take for one day.
ZUKERMAN
It's about your parents.
Ted stops. Puzzled.
TED
My parents? What do you mean?
ZUKERMAN
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm
a blurter. Your parents...They
...well...they exist no further.
(off Ted's confusion)
Skinny-dipping. The Amazon.
Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
TED
You've got the wrong guy. The
closest my parents have been to the
Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at
Epcot.
ZUKERMAN
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your
biological parents.
A 747 lands screaming on the runway.
Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He
takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard.
People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He
waves back, very timidly.
Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in
their hair.
CHARLIE
This is how the other half lives,
bro. Enjoy it while you can.
The limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be
a sprawling mansion. It comes to a sudden halt. The door
swings open to reveal a group of BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN. Clad
in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis.
Sad
expressions on their faces.
The MOURNERS embrace Ted.
BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #1
Welcome, Mr. Nelson. You are so
very very welcome here.
BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #2
We feel your pain, so deeply.
CHARLIE
(to Ted)
Something tells me we're not in
Xenia anymore, Toto.
The beautiful young women guide Ted towards the mansion.
Charlie follows. A particularly VOLUPTUOUS BEAUTY eyes him
curiously.
CHARLIE
I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted
best friend. We're so close, we
feel each other's pain.
The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He
winks...
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
See what you do to me, baby.
Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the
mansion.
She approaches Ted and hugs him.
HELEN
Oh my, he would have been so proud.
You're the spitting image of him.
CHARLIE
He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He
can't even get a good hocker going.
I've tried to teach him. It comes
from the diaphragm.
TED
(sharply; to Charlie)
You're on the next plane home.
HELEN
(emotional embrace)
I'm Helen McDole.
Your father's
executive secretary.
...coming out by another spectacular waterfall. Which
separates the indoor and outdoor pools. Numerous BEAUTIFUL
WOMEN swim, chat, play water polo. Some topless, some might
as well be.
The boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion
on another woman's back.
UNCLE BILLY
Hello, girls! Have you met Ted?
The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans
towards Ted, confiding...
CHARLIE
This is like my every wet dream
come true.
I don't even care that
you're here, too, bro.
TED
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
UNCLE BILLY
Good advice, Ted. You have your
father's instincts.
"His father." The words sound so strange. He never even met
the guy.
UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
Just remember, you're not the man
you were a day ago. And these
girls, let's just say they'd be
eager to please you.
Ted gulps. It's hard to believe this is real.
CHARLIE
I wonder how many of them will be
at the orgy tonight?
TED
This isn't some 80's porno film,
you dip shit. There are no wild sex
orgies.
CHARLIE
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
TED
Not ever. Never.
UNCLE BILLY
Never say never.
CHARLIE
Oh, god.
Look. Look.
Ted looks.
A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion
over her OWN breasts.
The boys stare, riveted.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I really love your peaches, wanna
shake your tree.
Uncle Billy grins.
UNCLE BILLY
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You
should be a gentleman.
TED
(voice cracking)
I...uh...I think she's doing fine
on her own.
CHARLIE
(having a moment)
Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me
like you mean it.
Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy.
TED
You kiss your mother with that
mouth?
CHARLIE
I'd kiss your mother with this
mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you
know...
He means dead.
TED
So far away? In Xenia?
CHARLIE
Yeah, whatever.
The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted
runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello.
He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat.
GINGER (O.S.)
Wanna take me for a ride?
Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool,
making her way towards him.
He gulps.
TED
I-I don't have the keys.
GINGER
They're in the ignition, silly.
Ted glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him.
He doesn't know what to do.
GINGER (CONT'D)
You do know how to drive?
TED
I don't have much experience with
a...uh...stick.
GINGER
Want a lesson?
Ted blushes. He needs a lot of lessons.
GINGER (CONT'D)
Press your left foot on the clutch.
And turn the key.
The Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over
Ted's.
GINGER (CONT'D)
Now release the brake. And slide
the stick into first gear.
TED
Got it.
Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him
how it's done.
GINGER
Now very carefully apply some
pressure to the gas pedal with your
right foot as you release the
clutch with your left.
She squeezes his thigh and winks.
The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls.
Ginger giggles.
Could Ted be MORE embarrassed?
GINGER
The first time can be awkward. You
just have to get on and try again.
TED
I don't even know if I should be
doing this. It's a very expensive
car.
GINGER
It's your car. These are all your
cars.
TED
Some of them have to be automatics.
GINGER
Your father liked shifting. He said
it brought him closer to the
engine. "Like a woman, purring with
ecstasy."
Ted feels his temperature rising. He changes the subject.
TED
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I
forgot to say that.
GINGER
I know.
I'm Ginger. Miss April.
TED
The one with the horses.
GINGER
That's me.
TED
I almost didn't recognize you
without...you know...that stallion
between...your...uh...legs.
Ginger blushes.
TED (CONT'D)
That sounded so much better in my
head.
Ginger GIGGLES. Ted tries to hide behind his less than cool
shades. Ginger notices.
GINGER
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
TED
Shopping, really? I should tell my
friend.
GINGER
Don't worry.
He found the
chocolate room.
TED
(big grin)
Hi ho, Silver.
He puts the car in gear.
The tires scream as they take off.
Gears grind as he shifts. Not exactly purring with ecstasy.
Yet.
The Ferrari negotiates its way along Rodeo Drive. Ted seems
to have gotten the hang of it.
Tourists stare.
One snaps a photo.
Ted pulls up to...and then over...the curb. Well, he almost
has the hang of it.
The party's over.
Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping
champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted.
Uncle Billy sits
across from him.
Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders.
But as the scene continues the women take an even greater
interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there.
Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY
I told you you could do it.
TED
I was like a different person
tonight.
UNCLE BILLY
You were the new and improved you.
TED
I would have been laughed right out
of Xenia.
UNCLE BILLY
No one will be laughing at you now,
Ted. You can take that to the bank.
TED
It's really going to be strange
going home in a couple of days.
UNCLE BILLY
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish
school, do what you feel you need
to do. In the meantime, I'll be
your point person here on the
magazine.
TED
Really? You'd do that for me?
UNCLE BILLY
I've been very lazy for a long,
long time.
TED
You seem like you're anything but
lazy, Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY
(confiding)
I never finished school myself.
Never had to. My brother built this
empire from nothing but his wife's
perky tits and a whole lot of
gumption. He gave me a cushy job on
a silver platter. I never struggled
for a second.
TED
My parents always say hard work
builds character.
UNCLE BILLY
It's not like I didn't have ideas,
I had plenty of ideas. But I never
even shared them with your father.
Never had the guts.
TED
What kind of ideas?
UNCLE BILLY
Well...for one thing...I think it's
despicable that we exclude so many
women that only fit our western
notion of "classic beauty."
TED
You think we should be more open
minded?
UNCLE BILLY
The world is a big, beautiful
place.
We can open new markets in
Africa and Asia.
Imagine the Dali
Lhama reading our magazine.
TED
In other words, our scope is too
narrow.
UNCLE BILLY
At our press conference tomorrow, I
think we should announce our plans
to explore the world. Not just a
few leggy 36D's, with blond hair
upstairs and down.
TED
That's perfect.
The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say
their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them,
Ginger stands at the edge of the tub.
GINGER
Want some company?
Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets
it fall to her feet.
The silhouette of her nude body is
startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she
descends, step by step, into the frothy water.
Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper.
A wash of foam caresses her breasts.
She continues.
Until
she's completely submerged.
Ted looks startled.
The "Jaws" theme echoes through his
ears.
He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels
something.
Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.
He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's
sucked under.
He thrashes.
His hand grabs the edge of the
Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.
And he slides under. Only
to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.
Kissing him passionately.
DISSOLVE TO:
Jimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears
in the doorway.
MOM
My goodness, who sent this?
DELIVERY MAN
It's from "Heaven," ma'am.
DAD
Ted. Of course.
JIMMY
(riding around)
I love you, Ted!
MOM
We can't accept it.
It's much too
expensive. Right, dear?
DAD
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice
of Ted but...
At that moment, ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN and his HELPER unload a
large crate from another truck. They approach Dad and Mom.
DELIVERY MAN #2
Delivery for Robert Nelson.
DAD
For me? What is it?
DELIVERY MAN #2
Appears to be tools, sir.
MOM
Oh, no. Ted's gone completely
overboard.
Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to
reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools.
Dad opens one
of the drawers.
Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments.
Tears in his eyes.
MOM (CONT'D)
Sweetheart, what is it?
DAD
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He
even got me the limited edition
Buckeye colors.
MOM
Oh, honey. We can't accept this
extravagance.
Another delivery truck arrives.
Then the local news vans.
Neighbors rush out of their houses. The phone RINGS.
Mom
dashes inside.
A beautiful spring morning.
Cars pull into the school
parking lot.
Students mingle in small groups. Making their
way into the building.
A group of GUYS look up.
Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the
school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a
grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a
pattern of white billowy clouds.
The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking
seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his
stylish Persol shades.
Until he takes a second step and
stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first
into the grass.
Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely
Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful
blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see.
Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin
bursts through the front doors, shouting...
PRINCIPAL MERKIN
You cannot land a helicopter in my
school yard! Get that blasted thing
out of here!
Ted raises his hand.
The chopper rises as if on cue.
Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal
Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround
Ted.
Congratulating him.
Everyone wanting to be Ted's new
best friend.
Julie walks up to Charlie.
JULIE
What gives, Don Corleone?
CHARLIE
(smug)
We reinvented ourselves.
JULIE
New Hushpuppies don't make a new
man.
CHARLIE
You've obviously never had your
dogs nestled in thousand dollar
Italian loafers.
JULIE
That explains the emptiness that
haunts me.
CHARLIE
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Ted makes eye contact with Julie. Winking like he's Don Juan.
She just stares at him, blankly.
JULIE
Second only to unfettered arrogance
and the inability to see the irony
therein.
Charlie's baffled by that one.
CHARLIE
Wanna see my hickey from Miss
December?
Julie groans.
A heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through
the sky.
A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes
around the block and into a doorway.
The women are dressed
to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his
convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads
for the door.
Mom drives up to the house.
She stares, aghast.
There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.
One cuts the
grass.
Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning
gutters.
Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water
hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and
giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.
Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his
wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his
arm.
Drunken teenagers pour out of the building.
Dashing for
their cars and limos.
Ted's among them.
Suddenly he's cut
off by a Harley that stops right in front of him.
It's
Julie.
Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a
black motorcycle jacket over it.
JULIE
Need a lift?
Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes
off.
Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off
down a country road.
TED (V.O.)
Where are we going?
JULIE (V.O.)
To the best hiding place in the
world.
Now we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The
yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the
best hiding place in the world.
Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten CHILDREN,
cleaning up the roadside litter. Julie and Ted watch from...
A BRIDGE ABOVE THE HIGHWAY
JULIE
See what I mean. He's squeaky
clean. He makes Gandhi look like a
war monger.
Ted steels himself. Somehow, they'll get him.
In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning "Xenia
Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water
tower that overlooks the city.
Her loose spring dress
billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in
quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra.
An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a
reflector.
Charlie shoots with his Nikon.
Motor drive
whirling.
TED
I have a great idea.
Let's lose
the last button.
Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of "oohs" from
below.
Ted glances down, where...
Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on
the scene.
Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,
focusing their long lenses.
Women are conspicuously absent.
Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their
placards, denouncing "Heaven."
One Feminist approaches the Mayor.
FEMINIST
The city tower belongs to the city,
not to some pornographer.
MAYOR
The library also belongs to the
city.
And guess what?
It's going
to have a new Ted Nelson wing with
three thousand children's books.
The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops
overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the
level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.
And
just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core
fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin
frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN
You should be ashamed, young lady!
Your body is a sacred temple!
Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.
Missing
the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the
chopper's prop wash.
The spectators below APPLAUD.
They
watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
Young lady, I will pray for god's
mercy upon your soul.
MOLLY
Don't bother, Merk! I'm already
going to "Heaven!"
TED
(to Charlie)
Get them together.
CHARLIE
(eyes lighting up)
Brilliant!
Molly, give me all
you've got.
For Merk.
Molly gets the idea.
She poses provocatively towards
Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a
compromising position.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN
Stop that, stop that this instant!
But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.
Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling,
totally euphoric. They stop to catch their breath. Their
clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time
they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing
and laughing.
TED
We just found the ULTIMATE
centerfold for "The Girls of
Xenia!"
Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away.
JULIE
I have to be honest with you, Ted.
I really despise "The Girls of
Xenia."
TED
I know, their small town mentality
can be maddening.
JULIE
I mean your pictorial. It bothers
me, profoundly.
TED
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like
being a doctor.
Julie eyes him skeptically.
JULIE
You're telling me you don't get
aroused by a roomful of naked
breasts.
TED
You've seen one naked breast,
you've seem them all.
JULIE
Which explains the continued
success of "Heaven" for how many
decades?
TED
You're quick. I like that.
JULIE
You think you're working with
chimps here?
TED
The thing is, I made a commitment.
I said I'd do it and I have to keep
my word.
JULIE
Keeping your word is something I
can actually respect, Ted.
CUT TO:
TREMBLING HANDS, STRUGGLING TO LOAD A ROLL OF FILM INTO A
NIKON.
Julie opens her front door. Charlie grins. He hands her a
copy of "Heaven."
CHARLIE
Page three.
Intrigued, she turns to the page.
CLOSE ON MAGAZINE
We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime,
With All the Love in the World." Julie's eyes fill with
tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial,
only to find--
Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra
Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati
nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in
the foreground, as if they posed together.
JULIE
Not bad for a hack. He has a future
in yellow journalism.
CHARLIE
He kicked major ass and you know
it.
Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by
the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking
lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students
CHEER. Chanting:
"BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!"
Principal
Merkin turns crimson.
Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing,
overjoyed. Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in
sight.
A big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the
corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew
it. Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds.
JIMMY
Why so melancholy?
CHARLIE
You were born naked, wet, and
hungry. Now you're hip, handsome,
and rich. You are the coxswain on
the ship of life.
JIMMY
Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary!
CHARLIE
(proudly)
I taught him that.
TED
Great.
JIMMY
From my wise, albeit youthful,
vantage point, the world is your
oyster. You scored big.
CHARLIE
You got everything you ever wanted.
TED
Except the girl. The only one that
really mattered.
JULIE (O.S.)
And who might that be?
Miss July?
Miss August?
Ted turns to find Julie. His faces brightens with hope.
TED
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left.
I was afraid I'd never see you
again.
JULIE
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're
the one with the champagne wishes
and caviar dreams.
TED
I decided to let Helen run the
magazine. I need to go to college,
learn a few things, you know.
Julie seems pleased.
TED (CONT'D)
And I thought maybe I'd take up
boating. I've always wanted to be a
"coxswain."
JULIE
Very ambitious. I like that.
TED
The thing is, I'll need a first
mate.
JULIE
I know where you can find any
number of naked girls who'd love to
hop on board.
All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart...
TED
Julie, you were right. All the
naked girls in the world mean
nothing.
It's the one you want to cover up
with your coat that you really
love.
Julie smiles...
JULIE
Planet Ted. Five years from now.
What's happening?
TED
I graduated from college. Did
great, summa cum laude and all. And
I'm about to launch a brand new
magazine called "EXPOSED!"
An
homage to Miss Julie Conroy of
Xenia, Ohio.
Julie grins.
JULIE
I know where you can find an
excellent editor-in-chief.
TED
Yellow pages?
JULIE
Let your fingers do the walking.
Suddenly the music changes. "People." Ted grins.
TED
They're playing our song.
(extending his hand)
Dare I ask for this dance?
JULIE
(taking his hand)
You better.
Ted and Julie begin dancing and kissing in the b.g.
Charlie and Jimmy feign tears.
CHARLIE
I'm a sucker for a happy ending.
(hugging Jimmy)
Hold me.
And we start to RISE AGAIN, above the NELSON HOUSE, into the
clouds above Xenia...
TED (V.O.)
So, as you can guess, everybody
pretty much lived happily ever
after. My parents didn't give up
the grocery store...
We descend through clouds and quickly find we're...
Mom and Dad take pictures and smooch in front of the palace.
TED (V.O.)
...but they did manage to sneak
away for a second honeymoon.
ON A NEARBY NEWSSTAND
We ZOOM CLOSE on "Heaven Magazine," where pages flip open in
the wind, revealing...
PRINCIPAL MERKIN "EXPOSED" IN THE PAGES OF "HEAVEN."
TED (V.O.)
Merk's appearance in "Heaven"
turned out to be a good thing. He
was spotted by a talent scout...
Charlie wrestling in a haystack with the IDENTICAL TAYLOR
TRIPLETS.
TED (V.O.)
...where he married all three of
the identical Taylor Triplets.
Let's just say, they've been very
busy...
Peeking out of the haystack, we spot at least a dozen CHARLIE
JR's.
TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And even Uncle Billy landed on his
feet.
Ted and Julie sail off into, what else but a GLORIOUS SUNSET.
