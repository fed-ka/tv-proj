A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."
Like modern demons.
Grotesque.
Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
their twisted anatomies:
headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
broken glass teeth.
Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
sand and heat.
END CREDITS.
CUT WIDE TO;
A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
make out a large, ominous building:
the HOUSE of William
Nix.
Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI.
The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
SCREEN, the words:
'"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"
We're at the front door now, which stands open.
Leaning
against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
sixteen.
His name is BUTTERFIELD.
He's got a brooding,
almost sultry look on his face.
One of his eyes is black,
the other milky blue.
He's whittling something with a
scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.
Butterfield
narrows his eyes.
BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.
The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
house.
BUTTERFIELD
(softly)
Swann...?
He turns from the door.
In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
whittling.
He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.
The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.
From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.
He's not
conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking.
From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
studious and intense.
From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
steely gaze.
SWANN
(to all three)
Are we ready?
JENNIFER
(cool)
Say the word.
PIMM
(very nervous)
Look, maybe we should think this over.
On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
of METALWORK.
We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
he slips them into his pocket.
SWANN
No.
He's gone too far.
PIMM
So he took a child.
JENNIFER
He'll kill her.
PIMM
No he won't.
SWANN
(determined)
He's not going to get the chance.
Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.
QUAID
If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.
SWANN
So stay out here.
Swann starts towards the House.
Jennifer is the first to
follow, with the other two on her heels.
The wind has died away.
It's eerily calm.
Butterfield
dashes towards camera, then halts.
HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
into the back of Murray Pimm's bus.
ON Butterfield.
He watches, with a feral look on his face.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
some fantastical metropolis.
This, for all its smog and
congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.
ON SCREEN, the words:
"LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"
The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
it has a certain charm.
Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
sun.
Squints.
Puts on sunglasses.
HARRY
Hello, L.A.
BELLBOY
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
HARRY
You bet.
Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
classy restaurant.
It's RAINING.
ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window.
Tapert makes a joke (unheard).
The woman laughs.
ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
recorder.
HARRY
Nine-eighteen p.m.
Tapert's either
got a great sense of humour or he's
paying her to laugh.
(looks at hamburger in
disgust)
Jesus.
On Tapert, as he rises from the table.
HARRY
(into tape recorder)
He's finished.
Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.
Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
up and gets in.
In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.
It
reads:
TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL
ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
door beside the store window.
WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
side of the street.
Harry gets out of the car.
Stares at the sign in the window,
puzzled.
HARRY
Superstitious?
He starts across the street.
Suddenly:
TAPERT (V.O.)
Oh my God!
Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.
He stumbles to
his car, and he's away.
Harry freezes, caught between the
need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
latter, and steps inside.
The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene.
DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.
He's midway
through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
OFFICERS examining the drapes.
We can't yet see the body.
EDDISON
(to Harry)
What were you doing up there?
HARRY
I'm a private detective.
I was
hired to follow somebody for a few
days.
A guy called Tapert.
Insurance fraud.
EDDISON
(writing)
Tapert.
So, now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield.
HARRY
Tapert's got nothing to do with
this.
He came here to get his palm
read.
EDDISON
What makes you so sure?
HARRY
(shrugs)
I got a file on him two inches
thick.
He's a petty fraudster.
This is something else.
Ever heard
of someone called the Puritan?
EDDISON
New one on me.
(to Officer)
Okay.
Let's see him.
OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.
EDDISON
Where the fuck is he?
HARRY
He got up and walked.
EDDISON
(looking up at window)
After that fall?. He must have
broken half his bones.
WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.
HARRY
I don't think he'd have given a
shit.
CUT TO:
On screen:
Philadelphia
A suburban street.
Early morning light.
On screen:
San Antonio.
A ZOO-KEEPER wanders into the darkened interior of the
Reptile House.
The Snake-Handler Cultist drives at speed.
It's early morning in Bel-Air.
The sun shines down on a
millionaire's paradise:
a huge house surrounded by a jungle
of trees and blossoms.
The blue water glitters in the noon-day sun.
And a WOMAN --
her body perfectly proportioned -- glides under the surface,
emerging at the shallow end, where the housekeeper CLEMENZIA
is setting a tray on a table.
CLEMENZIA
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
Mrs. Swann's name is DOROTHEA.
She is a beautiful and
sensual woman.
DOROTHEA
Thank you.
She dries off.
DOROTHEA
Where's Mr. Swann?
CLEMENZIA
In his study.
(a beat)
He got something on his mind?
DOROTHEA
Why?
CLEMENZIA
Bad mood today.
A white SEDAN glides along the boulevard.
At the wheel,
Valentin.
Beside him, Harry.
The sedan turns into a driveway.
The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
marble tombs.
Harry and Valentin walk towards a large
mausoleum.
HARRY
Any movie stars buried here?
VALENTIN
Probably.
HARRY
It's not a bad place.
Warm.
Great view.
VALENTIN
I don't think the dead much care.
HARRY
Are you sure?
VALENTIN
Are you a believer, then?
Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.
HARRY
I've signed on for them all in my
time.
Hindu.
Catholic. You can't
have too many saviours.
Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
in white standing in its cool shadows:
Dorothea Swann.
She
wears a wide-brimmed hat.
HARRY
Who is she?
VALENTIN
Swann's wife.
CUT TO:
VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.
He
glances up.
Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
conversation.
DOROTHEA
I want you to help me help my
husband.
I know he's in some kind
of trouble.
And it's something to
do with the man you saw murdered.
HARRY
Did your husband know Quaid?
DOROTHEA
Yes.
They weren't close, but they
saw each other once in a while.
I
think Philip believes all that
stuff with the tarot cards.
HARRY
You don't?
DOROTHEA
I think we make our own futures.
Harry makes an approving MURMUR.
HARRY
What's the connection?
DOROTHEA
(covering now, but well)
I don't exactly know.
Philip doesn't like to talk about
the past.
HARRY
Why not?
Dorothea stops talking.
Takes off her sunglasses.
Her gaze
is troubled, but direct.
There is an attraction between the
two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.
DOROTHEA
He's a secretive man.
HARRY
And you don't ask questions?
DOROTHEA
We don't share our lives the way a
lot of people do.
HARRY
Does that mean...?
DOROTHEA
We haven't slept in the same bed
for years.
HARRY
But obviously you still care what
happens to him.
DOROTHEA
We wouldn't be having this
conversation if I didn't. Swann's
one of the most remarkable men
alive.
Harry, frowns.
DOROTHEA
You don't believe me.
HARRY
He's an illusionist.
It's not
exactly brain surgery.
Dorothea stares at him.
HARRY
Sorry.
You asked.
DOROTHEA
No.
You're right.
He could have
been something more. Maybe a lot
more.
But people get lost.
Even
good people. Too much fame.
Too
much money,
HARRY
Where do I sign?
Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.
DOROTHEA
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY
Harry.
DOROTHEA
Harry.
HARRY
I'm no bodyguard.
DOROTHEA
That's not what I'm asking for. I
want somebody who can find out what
Philip saw in those damn cards.
And stop it from happening.
HARRY
When do you want me to start?
DOROTHEA
Come to the show with me. Tonight I
want you to see him with an
audience.
They love him.
HARRY
Do you?
The question catches Dorothea off guard.
DOROTHEA
I didn't marry him for love, Mr.
D'Amour.
Tonight?
HARRY
Sure.
Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.
Harry watches
her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her
departing figure.
CUT TO:
CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
theatre marquee.
SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS.
This is a flashy, prestigious event.
LIMOS
are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
file in.
The atmosphere is noisy and excited.
Amid the throng, Harry.
He makes his way inside.
Noon.
Bright sun.
Busy street.
Harry, now wearing a
bandage on his cut face, enters.
The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm.
Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.
Harry is
knotting a newly-bought tie.
HARRY
I only wear ties for funerals.
WILDER
You don't get in without one. It's
like a gentlemen's club for
illusionists.
Except most of us
aren't gentlemen.
Harry heads to the car.
BILLY (V.O.)
Harry!
Harry turns.
Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
that he's not being watched.
BILLY
I gotta be careful.
If Vinovich
sees me talking to you.
He's an
asshole, but he's a powerful
asshole.
HARRY
They go together.
BILLY
(lowered voice)
I've heard a name.
Someone they
talk about in whispers.
HARRY
Who?
BILLY
Nix.
HARRY
Nix?
BILLY
Like in nothing.
Nobody.
Nix.
HARRY
Who is he?
BILLY
I think maybe he taught Swann.
(hands Harry a card)
This is me.
See ya around.
Billy hurries away.
CUT TO:
The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
Quaid's Waiting Room.
It has been locked and taped by the police.
Harry has come
prepared.
He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
locks.
ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.
Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".
Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
steadily gets louder as they walk.
JENNIFER
Have we met before?
HARRY
No.
JENNIFER
Only I forget.
They give me pills,
you know, to keep me... even...
and... I forget things,
HARRY
Well, you didn't forget me.
I just
came because I wanted to know if
you knew a man called Butterfield.
JENNIFER
Maybe... I... don't...
HARRY
What about Philip Swann?
JENNIFER
I knew Swann.
(sudden vehemence)
He's a fucking liar.
A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.
HARRY
Why's that?
JENNIFER
He said he knew how to protect us.
But he didn't know anything.
He
made us think it was over and done
with.
HARRY
What is?
JENNIFER
(tears nearing)
I don't want to think about it. If
I think about it he'll hear me.
He'll find me.
HARRY
Swann?
Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
laying pipes.
The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
we're aware of it.
JENNIFER
I told you.
I don't --
She stops.
Looks ahead of her.
Her face is suddenly ashen
and clammy.
Harry follows her gaze to:
The hole.
Somebody is in it, digging.
Earth emerges in
shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
(screaming)
God no!
Oh God no!
She backs away from the hole.
The Nurse grabs hold of her.
NURSE
Calm down!
She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.
The Nurse is flung
back.
JENNIFER
He's not going to get me!
She races down towards the street.
Harry goes after her.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
He's not!
He's not!
HARRY
Who's not?
He catches up with her.
JENNIFER
Nix! Nix!
HARRY
Is he the Puritan?
JENNIFER
Yes! Yes!
HARRY
And he's dead?
JENNIFER
No.
He's coming back.
He's
digging his way out!
The Nurse appears behind Harry.
NURSE
I'll take care of her now.
Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.
NURSE
Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!
The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
instantly, racing towards the street.
HARRY
Jennifer!
She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
top.
There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
metalwork and glass.
Harry gets to the wall before the
Nurse.
Hoists himself up onto it.
Looks down.
HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET
Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
wheels of a car.
The DRIVER is out, and yelling
incoherently.
HARRY
Jesus.
He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.
He looks towards the hole.
The Workman has stopped digging.
His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
a grave.
Harry closes his eyes.
HARRY
(very quietly)
Jesus.
The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.
Billy and Harry are parting.
HARRY
Thanks, Billy.
BILLY
Hey, anytime.
(a beat)
Actually, no.
This was enough.
They shake, and part.
Harry waits on the doorstep.
Valentin opens the door.
VALENTIN
(quietly)
I can't let you in.
HARRY
(stepping in)
Yeah, I know.
VALENTIN
You want more money, is that it?
Harry pushes him aside.
Valentin opens the front door.
There's a wind blowing. The
palms churn against the night sky...
INTERCUT
Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
of Harry and Dorothea.
WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
MOURNERS.
The graveside service has just ended, and the
Mourners are beginning to disperse.
Dorothea is there
amongst them, of course.
So are several faces we recognize:
Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
Dancers, his Technicians.
There are also several members of
the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists.
Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
from the doorway of a mausoleum.
His eyes are on Dorothea as
she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
condolesence.
The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.
THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
down into the street.
1ST WORKER
Watch out!
On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet.
We don't see who.
Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
cemetery.
Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit.
Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.
The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car.
On Harry, as he gets into his.
A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets.
Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
barbed wire.
He peers through the bars.
Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
into the building.
He glances back towards the street.
We
get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat.
Harry slides out of sight.
Waits until the Stranger has gone
inside.
Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
wire.
A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
are already gathered.
The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out.
SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.
A small, garishly-lit liquor store.
Harry's car pulls into
the lot.
Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
the store.
Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.
The house could not look more reassuringly calm.
A SWAN
struts beside the pool.
A long, HUSHED MOMENT...
SHOCK CUT TO:
DOROTHEA'S DREAM
A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame.
CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
crazed.
Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
shadowy figure.
Is it Nix?
We can't quite see.
Black BLOOD
runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.
NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
falling gouts of dark fluid --
-- she struggles, SOBBING --
CUT TO:
PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
door.
Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
stars.
Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.
There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.
It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity.
We DRIFT towards the front door.
Wide.
A few rocks, and emptiness.
The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
illuminating the dig.
Valentin is in the grave, digging.
ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
watching the work.
Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.
BUTTERFIELD
Anything?
VALENTIN (V.0.)
Not yet.
Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.
BUTTERFIELD
If you've lied to me to me --
VALENTIN
I swear... this is the place Swann
told me about.
The rocks...
On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
steps back towards the open car door.
Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
Valentin.
BUTTERFIELD
Five more minutes.
Hear me? And
you'd better not --
A SOUND behind him.
Butterfield wheels round.
On the ground
beside the open car door, the instruments.
BUTTERFIELD
What the fuck are you playing at?
He goes to pick them up.
Dorothea steps from behind the
door, with the sharpest in her hand.
She slashes at him.
Opens a WOUND across his arm.
BUTTERFIELD
Aah!
He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
hand, and slamming her against the car.
He hits her.
Once.
Twice.
Then --
VALENTIN (V.O.)
Butterfield!
Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.
VALENTIN
(blinded)
In the corner...
The beam goes to the corner of the grave.
A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.
BUTTERFIELD
(to Valentin)
Keep away from it.
Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand.
The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath.
He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...
Closer...
Closer...
He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
ROAR!
He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
mask rolls into view.
VALENTIN
Oh Christ!
Oh Christ!
BUTTERFIELD
(reverentially)
It's him... it's him.
On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.
CUT TO:
Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.
HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE
Harry reaches the grave's-edge.
It's totally dark.
He peers
in.
On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight.
Harry slides into the grave.
HARRY
Shit!
He's in darkness now.
He gets to his feet, and starts to try
and scramble out.
HARRY
Swann?
Swann!
Silence.
Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!
Harry swings
round.
It's Valentin.
He has been badly cut up.
VALENTIN
D'Amour --
HARRY
Shit...
VALENTIN
Help me.
He collapses into Harry's arms.
HARRY
Swann!
Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.
HARRY
Give me a hand.
I got Valentin.
Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.
VALENTIM
He's got Dorothea.
SWANN
And Nix?
VALENTIN
Him too.
HARRY
We've got to get you to a hospital.
VALENTIN
Don't bother.
HARRY
Shut up.
We've lost enough lives
already.
VALENTIN
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
HARRY
What about?
VALENTIN
... Looks like you're going...
to lose... one more.
Valentin dies.
HARRY
(despairing)
... no...
SWANN
He's better off this way.
HARRY
(furious)
Nobody's better off this wav!
SWANN
You don't get it, do you? We're
shit. D'Amour.
He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.
It rolls back into
Nix's grave.
SWANN
That's where we're all going.
HARRY
In my time, and nobody else's.
ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
getting into the car.
The doors SLAM.
The CAR LIGHTS
retreat.
The grave is left to DARKNESS.
The house is silent now.
Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
getting out.
Swann stays put.
The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.
HARRY
(spooked)
Jesus... what the hell's going on
in there?
SWANN
At a guess... they just resurrected
him.
HARRY
Fuck.
Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
of the car and follows.
Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --
Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.
They look back at the
house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down.
ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.
Harry and Dorothea get into the car.
Harry glances back at
the house.
Nothing.
HARRY
(quietly)
It's finished.
ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.
WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:
Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as
