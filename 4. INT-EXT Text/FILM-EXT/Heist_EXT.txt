BERGMAN TAKES OUT A SMALL KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CLEAN HIS NAILS.
BERGMAN

ON MOORE, HOLDING THE KNIFE.
BERGMAN
What is it, with your pal...?
AS BERGMAN NEARS MOORE, MOORE TURNS, BREAKING THE HOLD OF THE TWO
MEN. HE HITS ONE IN THE THROAT, KICKS AT THE OTHER, AND STARTS
TO RUN. ONE OF THE THUGS PULLS A PISTOL, AND SHOOTS AT MOORE, AND
MOORE FALLS TO THE PIER, GRASPING HIS SHOULDER, HE GETS SLOWLY UP,
AND FACES BERGMAN, AND THE THUGS, WHO STAND ON THE PIER ALONGSIDE
THE SAILBOAT. MOORE LOOKS AROUND.
BERGMAN (cont'd)
And then

(HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A
HENCHMAN PUTS A PISTOL INTO IT.)
AS HE SPEAKS, MOORE KEEPS TURNING, SO THAT THE SUN IS BEHIND
MOORE, AND SHINING INTO THE EYES OF BERGMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES,

Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the
world must you, why in the hell, a guy like
you, would you put me in a position... Aahh,
the Hell with it, life is too short, you

HE RAISES HIS ARM TO FIRE. BEHIND HIM WE SEE BLANE EMERGE FROM THE
SAILLOCKER ON THE BOAT'S DECK, BLANE HOLDS A SHOTGUN. HE SHOOTS
BERGMAN AND THE TWO THUGS, ONE OF THE THUGS TURNS AND FIRES AT
BLANE, WHO IS WOUNDED. BLANE FIRES AGAIN AT THE THUG, AND STUMBLES
ON TO THE PIER, AND FALLS BACKWARD INTO THE WATER BETWEEN THE BOAT
AND THE PIER.
ANGLE
ON MOORE, WHO MOVES JERKILY,
TO THE SIDE OF THE PIER. HE TRIES
TO PUSH THE BOAT AWAY, TO GET
TO BLANE IN THE WATER. HE UNTIES
THE LINE WHICH HOLDS THE BOAT
TO THE PIER, AND PUSHES THE BOAT
AWAY. HE THROWS THE LINE TO
BLANE, WHO USES IT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP
ONTO THE PIER.
THE TWO MEN SIT FOR A MOMENT, CATCHING THEIR BREATH.
MOORE
How you doing?
BLANE
I'm leaking?
(PAUSE)
You hurt?
MOORE NODS. HE STANDS, AND HELPS BLANE TO HIS FEET. MOORE PICKS
UP THE SHOTGUN. THEY LOOK AROUND, BEHIND THEM, THE SAILBOAT IS

THUGS. THE SECOND THUG LOOKS UP.

OPPOSITE HIM.
BLANE (cont'd)

chance of stomach distress.
MOORE

MOORE

BLANE
Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce?
(PAUSE)
MOORE
Because he asked them to.
BLANE NODS.
BLANE

Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke

TO LOOK AT MOORE ONE LAST TIME, THEN SHRUGS AND TURNS FORWARD.
ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS ACROSS THE STREET, TURNS A CORNER AND
STANDS BEFORE A GARAGE DOOR.
