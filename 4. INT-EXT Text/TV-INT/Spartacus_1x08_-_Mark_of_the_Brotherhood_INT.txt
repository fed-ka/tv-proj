  OVERHEAD SHOT of CRIXUS making love to Lucretia. Slow and 
  methodical, a stark contrast to their usually explosive 
  sessions. We DRIFT DOWN to REVEAL Lucretia, her face barely 
  concealing her disappointment as Crixus climaxes. He rolls 
  off of her, regards an impassive Lucretia.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Have I not pleased you, Domina?

                                        LUCRETIA
                                (masking best she 
                                  can)
                        Does your cock stand dry?

                                        CRIXUS
                        I fear you did not quake. 
                        Apologies. My wounds have yet to 
                        fully heal.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You will recover. And all will be 
                      as it was.

  Naevia enters.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Forgive me. Dominus returns from 
                        the market.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                to Crixus)(
                        Out. Quickly.

  Crixus stands, revealing the large unhealed scar that covers 
  his stomach. He quickly pulls on his subligaria and follows 
  Naevia out of the room. OFF Lucretia, unfulfilled, watching 
  him go with a worried frown...                                                                                    7.



  Naevia escorts Crixus through the villa. A tense silence 
  hangs between them. Crixus eyes her, uncomfortable.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  hushed)(
                        What would you have me do? Domina 
                        will grow curious if I refuse her.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I know.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I perform as weakly as I can, with 
                        hopes she will lose interest.

  Naevia pauses at the door leading down to the ludus.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I am not angry with you. It is 
                        only... I find it difficult that 
                        you and Domina share what we have 
                        not. For some time.

  Crixus pulls her into a stolen kiss.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You alone occupy my thoughts.

  Guards approaching break the moment. Crixus moves through 
  the gate, sneaks a final glance at a saddened Naevia before 
    disappearing. OFF Naevia, heavy-hearted...



  TIGHT ON A CUP being filled with wine. WIDEN TO REVEAL 
  Ilithyia reclining on a sofa as Naevia attends to her cup. 
  Lucretia lies opposite her on another sofa, sipping her own 
  cup. SLAVES fan them.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                (brimming with 
                                  excitement)
                        A gladiator of my own, mined from 
                        the same lands as Crixus!
                                  a knowing smile)(
                      Do all Gauls possess such... 
                        impressive qualities?

  Lucretia smiles politely, avoiding the insinuation.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I have heard it is one of their 
                        bolder assets.

  Ilithyia giggles, sips at her wine.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The envy of my friends shall spread 
                        like locusts, their hearts 
                        devoured.

  Lucretia picks up on that possible avenue to exploit.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Who would you torture so? No one of 
                      my acquaintance, I hope.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Doubtful. Caecilia, Aemilia...
                                  stressing)(
                        Licinia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Licinia? Cousin to Marcus Crassus?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The wealthiest man in Rome -- 
                        according to him, at least. Licinia 
                      in particular enjoys the games. 
                        More so the beasts who do battle in 
                        them.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Well, then... you must extend 
                        invitation for private introduction 
                                        (MORE)

                      to your man Segovax. Here, at the 
                        villa.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        These are proper Roman women. They 
                        only mingle with families of equal 
                        standing.

  Lucretia smiles through the slight.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps it is for the best. Seeing 
                        your man in the flesh would only 
                        inflame their envy.

  Ilithyia can t resist the thought, laughs in acquiescence.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I will arrange it.  I shall even 
                        help you with your hair.  We must 
                        make you suitable for such elevated 
                        company.

  OFF Lucretia, her smile her armor as her plans advance...



  Spartacus and Varro sit at a table with bowls of food. 
  Crixus and the other Gladiators fill up the remaining 
  tables. Varro regards the Recruits as they finish sparring 
  in the training square under Doctore s tutelage.

                                        VARRO
                        Shit baking in the sun. Seems only 
                        yesterday we were of a similar 
                        position.

  Spartacus glances at the Recruits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Much has changed.

  Varro s thoughts fall to his wife and her surprising 
  pregnancy.

                                        VARRO
                        Much. You became the fucking 
                        Champion of Capua. Your myth to 
                        echo for a thousand years. And I --

                      -- became a good friend.

  An uncomfortable beat, broken by RHASKOS calling from the 
  far corner. He shakes a pair of dice in his hand.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Varro! The dice call your name!

                                        VARRO
                        And Varro answers.

  Varro stands to leave. Spartacus shoots him a look.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You continue to gamble.

                                        VARRO
                        A few coins to pass the time. 
                        Nothing to concern yourself with. 
                        Friend.

  Spartacus watches Varro move off, not caring for the 
  response. WHAM! His attention is drawn to RECRUIT #4 as he 
  CRASHES across a table. Crixus has just shoved him back as 
  the Recruits enter to eat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You fucking wait until gladiators 
                        have filled their bellies. If there 
                      is any left...

  The Gladiators laugh as Crixus ladles huge amounts of stew 
  from the pot into his bowl.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus.

  Crixus darkens as Spartacus approaches.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Let them eat.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  hissing)(
                        They must embrace pain and 
                        suffering to become gladiators. 
                        This is how it is done.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Not by you. Let them eat.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

  A tense beat. Crixus tosses his bowl into the pot in 
  disgust.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Spartacus the Kind and Gentle, 
                        offering hugs and warm kisses.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Do not mistake me, Crixus. I give 
                      no shit about these men. But you 
                        are no longer the Champion of 
                        Capua. You do not take lead here. 
                        You follow.

  The mess hall has gone quiet. Ashur chews on a piece of 
  bread, clocking the confrontation with interest. A tense 
  beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The man who follows is forever at 
                        your back. Something to consider, 
                        Champion.

  Crixus moves off, his hatred of Spartacus all consuming.

                                        AGRON

                        Fucking Gauls.

  Agron tosses Segovax a withering look.  Segovax ignores him, 
  retrieves the bowl from the pot.

                                          SEGOVAX
                                to Spartacus)(

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Men should not die with empty 
                        stomachs.

  Spartacus truly doesn t care about Segovax or the other men. 
  He moves off, WIPING US TO --



  Ashur moves down the corridor with half naked SLAVE GIRLS, 
  escorted by GUARDS. He pauses at Rhaskos  cell.

                        Rhaskos.

  Rhaskos appears with a grin.

                        According to the calendar you 
                        cannot read.

  Ashur consults a sheaf of parchment with names and figures.

                        Your winnings amount to three and a 
                        half denarii. Preserve coin, or 
                        indulge yourself?

                        When do I ever favor coin over 
                        gash?

  Ashur nods to a Slave Girl, who enters the cell and 
  disrobes.

                                        ASHUR
                        I expect her ass to be returned 
                        free from blood.

                                          RHASKOS
                      My cock considers both holes equal. 
                        Find yourself lucky it does not 
                        favor yours.

  Rhaskos removes his subligaria as he ushers the girl into 
  his cell. Ashur continues down the corridor, Guards and 
  Slave Girls in tow. Crixus appears, having been passed by.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Ashur. You pass my cell by mistake.

                                        ASHUR
                        The mistake is yours. You do not 
                        fight, you are entitled to neither 
                        coin nor cunt.

  Crixus glares, his eyes filling with violence. One of the 
  Guard s hands drops to his sword, a gesture that does not go 
  unnoticed.

                                        CRIXUS

                        His very hand set the names. 
                        Perhaps next month you shall find 
                        yourself again among them, should 
                        your wounds ever heal.

  Ashur spots Varro further down the corridor.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Varro! A moment.

  He hobbles after him, leaving Crixus seething in his wake.

                        Your victories amass much coin. 
                        Shall I see it transferred to your 
                        wife as usual?

                      Or would you prefer a small portion 
                        applied to more pressing concerns?

    A VOLUPTUOUS SLAVE GIRL smiles at Varro, liking what she 
  sees. OFF the temptation...



  Spartacus, returning from a bath, moves down the corridor. 
  SOUNDS OF FUCKING echo off the walls as various Gladiators 
  copulate with SLAVE GIRLS. Spartacus slows as he comes upon

  VARRO,

  in his cell fucking the Voluptuous Slave Girl. Varro catches 
  the look... then guiltily turns away, thrusting even harder. 
  Spartacus continues on in disgust, passing the

  BARRACKS

  The Recruits are sprawled across the floor, exhausted from 
  the day s training. Agron and Duro eye Spartacus as he 
  passes.

  A beat as the brothers stare at him -- then laugh.

                        Spartacus is a man to be held as 
                        example. A slave that ignites the 
                        arena. And one day the flames shall 
                        set him free.

                        I have witnessed such a thing. The 
                        roar of the crowd, demanding a 
                        gladiator be granted freedom for 
                        his showing in the arena.

  Recruit #4 hardens his resolve.

                        Segovax is right. Spartacus shows 
                      us the way. I will train as he 
                        trains, every thrust and counter 
                        committed to memory. And one day... 
                        I too shall become legend in the

  OFF the bold statement, SMASH CUT TO --



  CLOSE ON the bloodied, dead face of Recruit #4 as his body 
  is tossed onto a table by Guards. No glory in the arena for 
  him. WIDEN TO REVEAL MEDICUS inspecting Crixus  wounds. 
  Crixus stands stoic, masking the pain. Batiatus tensely 
  awaits the news.

                                          MEDICUS
                        His wounds need yet more time.

                                        BATIATUS
                        How much more?

                                          MEDICUS
                        A fortnight or two. Possibly three.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Jupiter s cock!

                                          MEDICUS
                        Recovery may be aided by certain 
                        herbs absent the apothecary.

  Medicus hands Batiatus a list scrawled on a scrap of 
  parchment.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus, I have been without sword 
                        for too long. Let me resume 
                        training.

  Batiatus considers Crixus, his wounds.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Medicus)(
                        I will see all on the list 
                        procured.
                                to Crixus)(
                        Heed Medicus  warning. Your sword 
                        will return to your hand soon 
                        enough.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Crixus  crushing disappointment...



  Batiatus walks with Ashur in tow. Ashur reviews the lengthy 
  list provided by the Medicus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                                        ASHUR
                                  rattles off)(
                          Mandragora... henbane... lye... 
                        thorn apple... hemlock... 
                          belladonna... Half a dozen more. A 
                        substantial list, requiring 
                        substantial coin.

  Batiatus frowns, fishes a purse of coins out of his robes 
  and tosses it to Ashur.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Procure the highest quality.

                                        ASHUR
                        A justified expense, should remedy 
                        result.

                                        BATIATUS
                        May the gods see it fucking so. 
                        Many days pass without progress.

                                        ASHUR
                        When Doctore suffered wounds from 
                        Theokoles... did they require equal 
                        time in the healing?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Considerably less.

  Ashur, always angling towards his benefit, presses.

                                        ASHUR
                        There may be a blessing hidden 
                        among such a curse. Talk of Crixus  
                        true condition surely has not 
                        escaped beyond these walls. Yet.

  Batiatus pauses.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your meaning?

                                        ASHUR
                        Inquiries for his purchase could be 
                        made in a delicate fashion. My 
                        visit to the market could serve 
                        dual purposes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Remove the thought. There will be 
                      no talk of selling Crixus.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

  Batiatus continues moving through the villa. Ashur limps 
  after him.

                                        ASHUR
                        I only fear for the future, 
                        Dominus. One that does not see 
                        Spartacus erased from it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  angers)(
                        Straighten your fucking tongue and 
                        speak plainly.

                                        ASHUR
                        Yesterday I witnessed the hatred 
                        Crixus cultivates towards Spartacus 
                        grow beyond measure. If in his mad 
                        passions Crixus were to make 
                        attempt on his life...

  Ashur lets the implication hang heavy in the air. Batiatus 
  chews on it, frowns at the taste.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  reluctantly)(
                        Solicit numbers from Sextus Vibius 
                        alone. Word of Crixus  stunted 
                        recovery is not to spread. I wish 
                        only to discover his current value.

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        You would sell Crixus?

  Batiatus turns to find Lucretia approaching with Naevia by 
  her side.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would explore all avenues of 
                        reason.

  Batiatus waves Ashur away. Ashur nods compliance and moves 
  off, a slight bend growing on his lips as he exits.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Which has flown if you consider 
                        such a thing. Crixus will fight 
                        again.

  Batiatus tries to be gentle with his concerns.

                                        BATIATUS
                        But will he ever be the man he was?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.
  CONTINUED:

  That hits Lucretia hard, especially since she has had the 
  same concern since her last disappointing lovemaking session 
  with the man. Batiatus heads for his office. Lucretia 
  follows, refusing to give up.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Give him time to heal, Quintus. He 
                        bleeds when pierced, as does any 
                        man.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The crowds do not see a man. They 
                        see him a god, and we present him 
                      as such. Should that myth 
                        evaporate, so goes his worth.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then we will find worth in another 
                        role. Surely his knowledge would 
                        aid instruction to the lower men?

                                        BATIATUS
                      We already have a Doctore. The 
                        finest in any ludus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  searching)(
                      He could work beside you, then.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus has no head for numbers. The 
                        sword is his only purpose.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is part of this family, Quintus!

  Batiatus whirls, not caring for that.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is a fucking slave!

  That stops her in her tracks. Batiatus composes himself, 
  continues in a more measured tone.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        This house, this family, is a 
                        business, Lucretia. As much regret 
                        results from selling a gladiator 
                        like Crixus, when the time arrives, 
                        and it fucking will for them all, 
                      it is a necessity that must be 
                        swallowed.

                        The decision has yet to be made. 
                        The man may still prove himself 
                        fit.

  He kisses her softly.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Turn your mind towards Ilithyia and 
                        her friends. Win their favor, and 
                        see our family name rise ever 
                        higher.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Lucretia, feeling the crushing weight of 
  possibly losing Crixus... and Naevia sharing the burden 
  silently by her side...



  Gladiators and Recruits train under Doctore s ever watchful 
  eye. Wooden swords CLASH, nearly missing CAMERA as it SLOWLY 
  PUSHES through the action: Agron spars with Varro. Rhaskos 
  against Duro. Hamilcar and a ND RECRUIT. Segovax spars with 
  Spartacus (two swords, no shield). CAMERA finally escapes 
  unscathed to find

  CRIXUS,

  fuming on a table in the mess hall, glaring at Spartacus. 
  Aching to return to training, sword hand absently clenching 
  and unclenching into a fist.

                        Crixus.

  He turns, spots Naevia standing in the shadows on the other 
  side of the gate.

                                        CRIXUS

                        A risk made necessary by 
                        unfortunate events.

  Crixus eyes her with concern.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I am ever safe. But Dominus... he 
                        considers selling you to another 
                        master.

  The words are as difficult to give as to receive.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You are mistaken.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Would that it were so. Ashur has 
                        been sent to market for herbs... 
                        and to question Vibius on his 
                        interest towards you.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Vibius?! Lanista of shits and 
                        mongrels! The glory I have earned 
                        this ludus, and here is my fucking 
                        reward!

  Naevia reaches through the bars and squeezes Crixus  arm.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You must prove to Dominus that your 
                        time has not passed. And prove it 
                        quickly.

  Naevia retreats, disappearing up the stairs to the villa. 
  OFF Crixus, smoldering...



  Crixus sits alone on the table, his reopened wounds dressed 
  with salve and herb. The fire has dimmed noticeably in his 
  eyes.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You overreach.

  Crixus glances over. Spartacus has appeared in the doorway.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        And here is the result.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Do not address me as you would a 
                        recruit.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then do not act like one.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Words of import from the mighty 
                        Spartacus! Bringer of Rain! Slayer 
                      of Theokoles! As if you stood alone 
                        against him. Without my aid, you 
                        would have nothing. Not even your 
                        miserable life.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        True. Yet here I stand. And there 
                        you sit.

  A long beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You know shit of being champion, of 
                        being a true brother. You are only 
                        playing at your part. And one day 
                        the game shall end.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Death comes to us all. Press me 
                        again, and you shall find yours.

  Spartacus exits, leaving Crixus to nurse wounds to body and 
  ego...                                                                                    31.



  Lucretia leads Ilithyia, CAECILIA (20s, beautiful), AEMILIA 
  (20s, beautiful), and LICINIA (20s, blonde, tall and 
  striking, she could be Ilithyia s sister) through the villa. 
  The women are a force of nature. Think The Hills, circa 74 
  B.C.E. Licinia is obviously a step above in station -- and 
    intelligence.  Naevia and attending Slaves walk an 
  appropriate distance behind.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude for joining us this 
                        evening. Ilithyia has spoken so 
                        very highly of you all, I feel as 
                      if we are old friends.

                                          AEMILIA
                        You have us at disadvantage. 
                        Ilithyia neglected to mention she 
                        was acquainted with the wife of 
                        good Batiatus.

  Ilithyia intercepts with a laugh.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I am sure I must have.

                                to Lucretia)(
                        She is quite the bitch, if you have 
                        not noticed.

                                        CAECILIA
                        Which is why we love her so.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I grow rather fond of her myself.

  Lucretia forces a smile as she leads the women into --

  THE TRICLINIUM

  A spread of delicacies and wine await. An attempt to 
  impress.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Come, let us sip and feast.

                        I could use a cup of wine to wet 
                        the tongue.

                        Some instinct remains. So they may

                        mountain. Would you not prefer the

                        alone? Nothing but slaves and 
                        beasts, not even children to occupy 
                      --

  She freezes, shooting a glance at Ilithyia as she realizes 
  she spoke out of turn. Lucretia remains calm, tries her best 
  to ignore the remark. Ilithyia jumps in, steering the 
    conversation in a more productive manner.

                        brings with it opportunity. 
                        Yesterday, in fact, six new 
                        recruits began their training. One 
                      of whom fights under Ilithyia s 
                        patronage.

  An uproar of giggles and shocked, titillated laughter.

  More shrieking and laughter. Ilithyia basks in the 
  attention.

                                          LICINIA
                        A gladiator of your own! May we see 
                        him?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Of course, but he is not yet a 
                        gladiator. He must pass the final 
                        test before earning the mark of 
                        Batiatus.

                                        CAECILIA
                        Oh. He is only a slave, then?

  That dampens the mood. Ilithyia glowers. Lucretia realizes 
  her mistake, tries to cover.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        For the moment, but --

                                          AEMILIA
                        I would lay eyes upon a real 
                        gladiator.

                                          LICINIA
                        Yes! A champion! Bring Spartacus 
                        up!

                                        CAECILIA
                        Spartacus! Yes! You must!

  Lucretia turns to Ilithyia, not sure what to do. Ilithyia s 
  turn to force a smile.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Bring the Champion. Let us all 
                        revel in his presence.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.
  CONTINUED:

  Ilithyia sips her wine. OFF Lucretia, smiling politely as 
  her evening slowly crumbles...



  CLOSE ON Spartacus as he s scraped by a Slave. PULL BACK to 
  REVEAL other Gladiators receiving the same treatment. Lower 
  men and the Recruits scrape themselves. Spartacus glances 
  across the room at Varro, being scraped, eyes downcast.

                                          SEGOVAX (O.S.)
                        Gratitude.

  Spartacus glances over to find Segovax has appeared.

                                          SEGOVAX
                        For your aid in my training today.

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes falling instead on Crixus as 
  he enters. He sits with a slight wince of pain, takes up a 
  scraper to attend his own skin. No special treatment for the 
  fallen.

                                          SEGOVAX(cont'd)
                        I would be eager to hear any 
                        advice, to further my cause.

  Spartacus replies, never taking his eyes off of Crixus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your cause?

                                          SEGOVAX
                        Victories in the arena, and 
                        freedom.

  The men chuckle. Spartacus does not.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Forsake thoughts of freedom, and 
                        the life you once had beyond these 
                        walls. Accept your fate... or be 
                        destroyed by spectres of a past 
                        never to return.

  Crixus locks eyes with him. A Guard appears.

                                        GUARD
                        Spartacus. You are summoned.

  Crixus watches as Spartacus exits. He passes the glowering 
  Gaul, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    36.



  TIGHT ON a well manicured HAND as it slowly caresses a 
  broad, familiar chest.

                                          LICINIA (O.S.)
                      He stands as Mars, ready for war.

  WIDEN to REVEAL Spartacus, shackled, standing proud before 
  the awe-struck women. Licinia touches his chest with near 
  orgasmic wonder. Aemilia and Caecilia sip wine, loving their 
   display.  Lucretia eyes the women, pleased that they fawn 
  over Spartacus. Ilithyia stands off to the side, seething. 
  Several GUARDS are in the background.

                                          LICINIA
                      Is there truth to the legends? That 
                        gladiators share the blood of the 
                        gods?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The mighty Crixus, most certainly.

  Ilithyia sips her wine, knowing she s brought up a delicate 
  subject in mixed company.

                                        CAECILIA
                        Now there was a man! Truly blessed 
                      by the gods!

                                          AEMILIA
                        When will we see him in the arena 
                        again?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Soon.

  Lucretia tries to hide the pain of the lie.

                                          LICINIA
                        What of you, Spartacus? Are you a 
                        blessing to us?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To some. To others, a curse.

  Spartacus shifts his eyes to Ilithyia. Lucretia tenses.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The duality of his kind. Admired as 
                        a gladiator. Yet despised as a 
                        slave.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

  Licinia stands entranced.

                                          LICINIA
                      He is much more than a common 
                        slave. You can feel it radiating 
                        from his flesh...
                                to Lucretia)(
                        I have heard tale of a champion s 
                        blood possessing many restorative 
                        powers.

                                          AEMILIA
                        A few drops in a glass of wine is 
                        said to make a man hard for days!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Such are the legends.

                                          LICINIA
                        I would test them for myself, if I 
                        could?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Of course. We will send messenger 
                        with a vial --

                                          LICINIA
                        I would have it now.

  Aemilia and Caecilia titter excitedly. Lucretia hesitates, 
  but knows to refuse the request would be unwise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Guard. Your knife.

  A Guard comes forward and hands Lucretia his knife.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        May I have the honor?

  Lucretia hesitates, reluctantly hands Ilithyia the knife.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Take care not to cut too deep.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The legend does call for the blood 
                      of a dead gladiator, does it not?

  She traces the knife over his chest, almost erotically.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        But such details should not concern 
                        us. Spartacus will die soon 
                        enough...

  She moves the blade up to his neck. Lucretia tenses. 
  Spartacus doesn t even flinch. He won t give her the 
    satisfaction.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                      To the roar of the crowd.

  She moves the knife down in a quick motion, opening a cut on 
  his chest. She presses her wine cup to his flesh, capturing 
  the trickling blood.

                                          LICINIA
                        I do not believe he will ever fall 
                      in the arena. He is a god among 
                        men.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      He is nothing but a Thracian dog. 
                        His treachery dishonored Rome.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It is your husband who bears the 
                        dishonor.

                      He abandoned defenseless women and 
                        children. Left to be raped and 
                        murdered.

                        Guards!

  She motions for the Guards to remove him.  The girls titter 
  as Spartacus is roughly escorted out.

                                          AEMILIA
                        What a bold tongue!

                        One that begs a repeat soon.

  She kisses Lucretia on the cheek and exits with Aemilia and 
  Caecilia, both barely able to contain their laughter over 
  Ilithyia s embarrassment. Ilithyia watches them go, 
  seething.

                        None required. You will soon learn 
                        that women of note have a rabid

  DICE blast against a stone wall, followed by CHEERS. PULL

  The men laugh. Varro indicates for Spartacus to sit.

                                        VARRO
                        The rules, then.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Should I need instruction, I will 
                        ask.

  Varro shrugs -- this will be easy. He hands Spartacus the 
  dice.

                                        VARRO
                        Roll, Champion.

  Spartacus does... and wins! The men explode into laughter.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                        Taking coin from Varro! Easy as 
                        dropping shit!

  More LAUGHTER. Varro throws down another wager. OFF 
  Spartacus as he gathers the bones for another roll, intent 
  on taking all of Varro s money...



  Segovax, in shackles, is led in by Guards. Ilithyia awaits.

  Ilithyia circles him, her eyes appreciating.

                        I am your Domina. My coin pays for

                        substantial. Wine... women... even 
                        freedom, perhaps.

  Segovax reacts. Ilithyia picks up on it.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        You desire such a thing? Freedom?

                        Yes, Domina.

  Ilithyia considers that, wheels turning.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

  A dark smile bends Ilithyia s lips. OFF the moment...



  Batiatus rages through the atrium with Lucretia. Naevia 
  follows.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus should never have been

                        Ilithyia and the man must be kept 
                        separate. Throwing them together 
                        invites calamity.

                        The risk bore proper fruit. Licinia 
                        intimates another visit.

  That gets Batiatus  attention.

                                        BATIATUS

  Naevia averts her eyes, for fear her grief will expose her.

                        His glory fades. I would not see it 
                        extinguished beneath our roof.

  OFF Naevia in the background, the news a knife in her 
  heart...



  Crixus stares in shock through the iron bars of the gate.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Damascus?

  ADJUST to find Naevia on the other side, fighting to hold 
  back the tears.

                        Dominus meets with Vibius tomorrow.

  Crixus tries to keep his composure. But the reality of his 
  last night in the ludus finally sets in, his last night with 
  Naevia. He forces a smile.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have never seen Damascus. Do you 
                        think I shall like it?

  Crixus realizes what she s asking.

  Naevia touches his face through the bars, tears finally 
  cresting her cheeks. OFF the sacrifice...



  Varro sits alone, sullenly stabbing at his gruel. A POUCH 
  filled with coins lands on the table next to him. He looks 
  up to find Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The coin you lost to me.

                        Which makes it yours.

  Varro slides the pouch back to Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are a fool.

                                        VARRO

                        I turned from such things years 
                        ago. For my wife.

  Varro knows the mention of Sura is not easily made. He turns 
  his eyes away, rising.

                                        VARRO
                        Then you are a better man than I.

  Spartacus grabs his arm.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  Varro wrenches his arm free. Gladiators at the other tables 
  turn at the outburst. A beat. The fire drains from Varro s 
  eyes.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)

                        claims he forced his way onto her.

  Spartacus hardens.

                        She lives, Varro. You may yet hold 
                        her in your arms. A thought a 
                        decent man would cherish.

  Spartacus walks away, leaving the money. OFF Varro, 
    conflicted...                                                                                    46.



  Lucretia waits in her robe, her face troubled by what s to 
  come. Naevia escorts Crixus into the room, behind her. 
  Naevia shares a worried, charged look with him before 
  exiting.

                                        LUCRETIA

                                        CRIXUS

                        I pray he is mistaken.

  She turns to face him, eyes filled with regret -- and doubt. 
  He moves towards her, his strength growing with each step.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And the gods? Do they answer your 
                        prayers?

                        Then let us crack the heavens... 
                        and gain their attention...

  He pulls her into a kiss, rough and hard. Lucretia gasps. He 
  spins her around, forcing her against the wall, his breath 
  hot against her neck.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Remove any doubt... that my day has 
                        passed...

  He RIPS OFF HER GOWN, pulling her hair back as he enters her 
  hard. She gasps in pain and ecstasy, her face twisting in 
  pleasure. MOVE OFF the animalistic display to find

  NAEVIA

  watching from the shadows at the entrance. She turns away, 
  tears staining her cheeks, knowing she s done the right 
  thing. Yet still feeling the sting of it. OFF her pain...

  Crixus, uneasy from being with Lucretia, averts his eyes as 
  Naevia leads him back to the ludus. A long beat.

                        asked you to.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus is already at market. 
                        Speaking with Vibius.

                                        NAEVIA
                        There is nothing that cannot be 
                        undone.
                                (biting back the 
                                  tears)
                        You are a good man. The gods will 
                        not see you treated so.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  bitterly)(
                        They favor Spartacus now. They give 
                      no shit for me.

  He continues on. She watches for a moment, praying he s 
  wrong. She follows, WIPING US TO --



  A few GLADIATORS exit, naked, leaving Spartacus alone. He 
  sits in his subligaria, gently scraping the wound he 
  received from Ilithyia. SLOW PUSH IN as he dips the scraper 
  in water for rinsing, puts it to his chest again. COME TO 
  REST close on Spartacus  face, concentrating on the task.

  A TOWEL

  suddenly drops around his neck and tightens, cutting off his 
  air.  REVEAL SEGOVAX behind him, muscles straining as he 
  pulls the towel taut.  Spartacus drops the scraper, 
  struggles,  manages to slam an elbow back.  The jolt stuns 
  Segovax, loosening his grip.  Spartacus stumbles to the 
  floor, gasping.  He spots


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  THE SCRAPER

  and lunges for it, but Segovax gets the towel around his 
  neck again before he can retrieve it. Spartacus struggles, 
  veins bulging, sputtering for breath.

                                          SEGOVAX
                                  soft, sincere)(
                        Forgive me, champion...

  Segovax tightens his grip even more. The rope digs into 
  Spartacus  neck, drawing blood. His eyes lose focus as he 
  weakens and -- WHAM! Segovax is slammed off him by

  CRIXUS

  who has just entered. Spartacus collapses to the floor, 
  choking, gulping air in ragged breaths.

  SEGOVAX

  recovers, snatching up Spartacus  fallen scraper and 
  attacking. Crixus attempts to avoid the makeshift blade, is 
  only partially successful. Segovax swings. Crixus blocks the 
  blow, catching Segovax s wrist. A test of strength ensues as 
  Crixus tries to force the scraper out of Segovax s grasp.

  SEGOVAX PUNCHES CRIXUS

  in his stomach wound, reopening it once again. Crixus grunts 
  in pain, but refuses to give in. The scraper finally 
  clatters from Segovax s grasp. Crixus  fists rain down on 
  Segovax. One last blow sends BLOODY TEETH flying. Segovax 
  crumbles to the floor.

  CRIXUS FIGHTS FOR BREATH,

  favoring his reopened wound. Spartacus, regaining his 
  senses, tries to speak.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You kill... a fellow Gaul... to 
                        save a man you hate?

                                        CRIXUS
                        I do not save Spartacus. I save a 
                        brother... from an unworthy end.

  Crixus draws himself up proudly.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                        earned a glorious death... at the 
                        hands of a gladiator.

  OFF Spartacus, owing his enemy his life...



  A boiling Batiatus sweeps through the villa with Lucretia. 
  Ashur and Naevia are in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I leave these walls for a moment 
                        and a fucking recruit tries to kill 
                        Spartacus?! Ilithyia s own fucking 
                        man?!

                                    opportunity)
                        And he would have succeeded, were 
                      it not for Crixus. His day has not 
                        passed.

  Batiatus considers that with a frown, growls at Ashur.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Send notice to Vibius. Crixus is no 
                        longer for sale.

  Ashur struggles to mask his disappointment. Naevia, her joy.

                                        ASHUR
                        I fear terms were already agreed 
                        upon --

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck the terms! Crixus has proven 
                        his worth today. Should Vibius have 
                        issue, he may give reason to my 
                        cock.

                                        ASHUR
                        Dominus.

  Ashur slinks away, passing Ilithyia being led in by Guards. 
  Batiatus hisses to Lucretia.

                        attacked unawares in the baths.

  Ilithyia feigns concern.

                        How unfortunate.

  A SHRIEK OF AGONY sounds from the training square outside.

                                        BATIATUS
                        For your man, yes.

                      He had to be punished, of course.

  Ilithyia s eyes betray actual concern as Batiatus and 
  Lucretia lead her out onto the balcony.
