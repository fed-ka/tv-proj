He's in a cold sweat.

He starts to wash his face but then stops cold. 

A cap is floating in the sink. M3 

Jack shuts his eyes. After taking some deep breaths, he slowly opens his eyes. 

The cap is gone.

With an expression of relief, he goes back to washing his face. 

In that instant, the hand of a young boy shoots out of the water and grabs hold of Jack's face. 

 


Jack heads to his office.

                          Mister Miller. Mister Harrison wants you right away. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I ll be right there. 

Jack heads to his room.. 



HARRISON, the branch manager, is waiting for Jack. 

Jack comes.  

Harrison hands Jack a file. 


                                      HARRISON 

                          Got a little fire for you to put out. Eiji Saito is about 

                          to get sued for contract default by several corporations. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          God, damn it Eiji.  Do they have a case? 

 

Jack peruses the materials.

                                          10   


                          I don t want it to get that far.  If this gets dragged into court, 

                          we'll be the ones on the wrong side of the law. 

                          Go see the guy and figure something out. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          Okay. I will do. 

 


Jack looks troubled. 


                                      HARRISON 

                          Something wrong? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No, everything's copacetic. 

 

                                      HARRISON 

                          Jack, handle this with complete discretion. Saito is 

                          a valuable client. And you're the only one who could 

                          wrangle him up. I don t wanna see you in a straight jacket  

                          like your overpaid Harvard University predecessor. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You don't have to worry about me big guy. 

                          I will do whatever it takes, okay? 

 

                                      HARRISON 

                                        (smiles) 

                          That s what I would like to hear.

                                        JACK 

                          Okay. 


Jacks goes out the room.. 



Jack is on the phone. 


                                        JACK 

                          I've  tried  calling  his  cell  several  times  but  I  keep  getting  voice 

                  mail. 

                          Okay, If you hear from Mr. Saito,  please tell him to give me a call.

Jack hangs up the land line phone. 

Jack stands and stares out the window. 

He looks a photo by the window.  M5

It's a picture from a party given at Saito's home. EIJI SAITO has his arm around Jack's shoulder. (293

YURI SAITO, his wife, stands next to them. 

The signed photo reads: To Jack, my best partner, from Eiji Saito. 

The VOICE of Jack's assistant breaks the silence. 


                                      ASSISTANT 

                          Jack. Mr. Saito is on line three for you.

                                (picking up the phone) 

                          Eiji, where are you? 

                          I ve been trying to track you down all morning.

                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I know all about the situation. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Let s get together in my office. We can talk about it. 

 

                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I can't. I'm taking my boat out this afternoon. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I hardly think this the time for a pleasure cruise. 

 

                                      EIJI (O.C.) 

                          I'm at the Yumehama Marina. Come on over, we can talk here. 

 

                                        JACK

Jack uses his cell phone to call Eiji. 

He put the cell to his ear. 


                                        JACK

 Cabbie hands the change to Jack. 



Jack enters looking around for Eiji.. 

YURI SAITO (30) sits in a daze alone at a table. 

She notices Jack.. 


                                        YURI 

                                                Jack?

                           What're you doing here? 


                                        JACK 

                          I just got a call from Eiji.  He asked me to meet him here. 

 



                                          16   


                                        YURI 

                          He called you here? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yeah. What? Did something happen? 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (whispering) 

                          That worries me. 

 


                                        JACK 

                                  (it worries him, too) 

                          Why Yuri? What s the matter? 


                                        YURI 

                          Why didn't you come the other night?

                          I told you I had to work late--.

                          That isn t true, is it? 

 

Jack looks away and falls silent. 



EIJI  SAITO  (50)  watches  the  two  with  an  expressionless  but  scary  face  like  that  off  a  Noh 

theatre mask.  He watches them, but they don t see him.

                      (stammering a bit, in a low, confessional voice) 

                          Truthfully, I ve been worried this little situation we got here. 

                          At first, I don t know, I thought we were seeing each other  M6 

                          because I was lonely guy in a lonely city and a and now 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Now, you re serious.

                          Yeah. 


                                        YURI 

                          But Jack it s probably too late to worry now. 

                          He might be on to us. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (a touch upset and shocked)

                                        YURI 

                          You know the kind of man he is, right? 

                          If he really knew about us, he'd do just... 


Eiji approaches with a totally different expression than from earlier: hale and friendly. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (shaking his hand) 

                          Hey! Thanks for coming, Jack.

                          Eiji, listen. We don't have a lot of time. 

                          We got to get on the situation right away. 

 

                                        YURI  

                                                Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

                          Don't rush yourself, Jack. 

                          There's plenty of time for talking on the ocean. 

                          Have a seat!

Yuri shifts her line of sight away from the men. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Of course.  Where better to talk business but on the sea? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You want me to go out on the boat? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          You don't mind, do you? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sorry, I don t do water. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          I thought you needed to talk. 

 



                                          19   


                                        JACK 

                          Yeah& The sea and I do not get along. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Oh, c mon Jack, don t be a child. I won't let you say no. 

                          Or have you got some reason you won't ride on my boat? 

                          Perhaps a more important client waiting? 

                                                Jack, have a seat! Take off your jacket! 

 

Jack steals a glance of Yuri. She's got a worried expression on her face. 
                                                                                              M7 
There s no way Jack can back out. 
                                                                                            (473) 



Jack enters, looking at the interior of the cabin. 

Yuri stands by the kitchen, placing the groceries and kitchen supplies from the bag. 

 



                                          21   


                                        JACK 

                                (Coming closer to Yuri) 

                          Here, let me give you a hand with this. 


                                        YURI 

                          Oh, no. No thank you. 

                          I m fine. 

                                        JACK 

        It s okay. 


Jack hears Yuri, but helps her anyway. 

Yuri takes out the kitchen knife and places in the kitchen. 

Jack looks at the knife in daze. 


                                        YURI 

                          Look I m sorry I got you into all this. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, we got us into all this, okay? 

 

                                        YURI 

  Yeah& 


Jack s hand, trying to put on the jar, is touched by Yuri s hand. 

Yuri looks at Jack. 

Jack looks Yuri in the eye. 

The two stare at each other. 


                                      EIJI(O.C.) 

                                    (in japanease) 

                          Yuri, we are clearing the port. 



                                          22   


 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in japanease) 

                          Coming! 

 

Jack and Yuri look away each other. An awkward moment. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I ve got to go. 

 

Yuri walks out the cabin. 

Jack is left alone in the cabin. 


                                                                                            M10 
Jack  is  sitting  with  a  depressed  look  of  gloom  on  his  face.  He  grips  a  coffee  cup  tight  in  his 
                                                                                            (12203) 

white-knuckled hand. 

                                                                        FLASHBACK TO: 


Jack sits quietly, his mind on the long-ago death of his brother. 

Jack puts a glance on a coffee cup, and finds refection of SEAN s face. 



                                          24   


Jack senses he's being watched and turns around. 

But there's no one to be found. 

Yuri enters from the rear deck. 


                                        YURI M10 

                          Hey are you all right?  You don't look so good. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I m fine. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'll get you some seasick pills, ok? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          It s ok. I don t need any seasick pills. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What s the matter, Jack?  How come you re so afraid of the ocean? 

 

He looks at her for a beat, decides to confide in her. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                  (can't find the words) 

                          When I was a kid, my little brother drowned in the ocean. 

                          I was right there with him at the time. I was holding his hand. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Oh I m sorry.  


She  put  her  hand  his  shoulder,  and  that  connection takes  him  out  of  his  reverie.    He  takes  her 

hand. 



                                          25   


 

                                        JACK 

                          Why did you marry Eiji? 

 

She is shocked about his throws. 


                                        YURI 

                          What?---- because --- 

But that throws her off guard. 


                                        YURI 

                                    (sitting down) 

                          Because he gave me what I thought I wanted... 

                          and I guess I gave him the same. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What was that you thought you wanted? 


                                        YURI 

                          Things: a nice house, the best car, unlimited access to 

                          a large bank account.  Just whatever I wanted. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Right, and he gets a beautiful wife to wear on his arm. 

                          Like an ornament or an accessory or something. 

                          It s very nice trade. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          But things have changed, and I have changed. 

                          I know that now, because I met you. 

 



                                          26   


Jack wonders what she s on about. 
                                                                                          M11 

                                                                                            (393) 
                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          I'm going to leave him, Jack. 

 M11 

He looks up at her. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You re too afraid to ask him, aren t you? 

 


                                        YURI 

                          If you were me, what would you do? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I might be too afraid to ask him too. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Yeah... 


They look at one another, trapped within an impossible situation. 

 


Eiji, who is wearing reading glasses, peruses some documents. 



                                          27   


 

                                          EIJI 

                              (looking up from the papers) 

                          So, what do you suggest I do? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Do you trust me to handle this? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Trust you? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Exactly. You know I m not gonna let anything bad happen to you. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                      (grinning) 

                          Fine. I'll leave it you. But don't you ever betray me, Jack. 

 

What does he know? 

                                        JACK 

                          C mon Eiji! You know I know better than that. 

 

Yuri comes up the stairs entering the cabin. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Are you men finished talking business, yet? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Yeah. Hungry too. Are we ready to eat? 

                                        YURI 

                          Yeah, almost. 



                                          28   


 

                                        JACK 

                          Oh, I m sorry Eiji. I ve got a whole lot a work  

                          I ve got to do back at the office. 

                          Could you drop me at the next harbor? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Come on, Jack. At least stays. Eat with us. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No, I can t. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Yes, Jack. Please. 

 

                                          Eiji 

                                                You must be hungry? 

 

Reaction shot of Jack. 




REEL.3 


Yuri is laying out the meal on the table.  The three are having a late lunch. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          So, how's your Japanese coming? After two years here, 

                          you've probably improved, huh? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          No. My Japanese is terrible. I think I might have 



                                          29   


                           beginning to get worse. 

                          I don t think I m gonna ever get the hang of your language. 

 


                                          EIJI 

                          Pillow talk, son. The best way to master a foreign language 

                          is to get a local woman. 


                                        JACK 

                          Never heard that before. It s too bad no one will have me. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Don't be so modest, Jack. Just being an American in Tokyo 

                          means there are plenty of girls whose eyes would light up 

                          over you. Surely you've found that out once or twice. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (trying not to look at Yuri) 

                          I wish. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          "Thou shalt not commit adultery". Right, Jack? 

                          You know what happens to people who do it? 

 

The dinner conversation comes to a standstill. 

Yuri covers up the silence by serving the men more food. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          "God Only Knows", I guess. 

 

                                          EIJI 



                                          30   


                          They go to hell, Jack. In the old days in Japan, 

                          people who committed infidelity were sliced into four parts. 

                          The proper punishment for sinners. 


                                        YURI 

                          Can we change the subject? 

                          Let's talk about something more fun. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                      (grabbing her) 

                          I ll change the subject. So just wait. 

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack, what do you think is my treasured thing 

                          in the whole world? 

 

Nothing from Jack. 

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D)

                                                                                                ) 
                          MY Yuri. Four years since we got married and she (513

                          still fascinates me. There are plenty of men who'd love to 

                          make a play for her, even knowing she's a married woman. 

                          Don't you think so? 

 

Jack doesn't know how to answer.  Is Eiji toying with him? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Stop it. You're embarrassing him. 

 

Yuri moves away from Eiji. 



                                          31   


                                          EIJI 

                          Answer the question, Jack. 

 


                                        YURI M12 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Eiji, will you stop. 


                                          EIJI 

                          What's wrong, Jack? She's beautiful, isn t she? Am I right? 

 

Jack can't answer. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Will you lay off. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Say something, Jack. She's beautiful, right? 

 

Jack can t answer. 

                                          EIJI 

                          C mon ! Tell me! 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yes,  Eiji.  Yes.  No  one  could  argue  that  Yuri  is  a  very  beautiful 

                          woman. Are you happy now? 

 

Eiji lets out a BIG LAUGH. 






                                          32   


                                          EIJI 

                          Yes, Jack. Very happy. 

 

Eiji LAUGHS even louder than before. 


                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Have you lost your mind? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                (laughing and in Japanese) 

                          What's with you? He complimented you. Be happy, babe.

Jack doesn t know how to say. 

  


Yuri sits on the sofa. 

Jack stands her side. 


                                        JACK 

                          So, he knows about us. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I wonder if we'll make it home alright. 

 



                                          33   


                                        JACK 

                          What do you mean? 

 


                                        YURI M13 

                          When I met him, he was already married. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Right I knew you were his second wife. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He told me she was emotionally unstable. 

                          But we got married because she disappeared. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                    (shivering a bit) 

                          Yuri, what are you saying? 

 

                                        YURI 

                                  (looking up at him) 

                          I'm scared, Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri, stop it! Just stop it! 

                          Okay, you were Eiji s "most treasured thing" 

                          in the world. You remember that? 

                          He's not the kind of guy who'd do anything... dangerous, right? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'm his treasure. And you know what he s capable of doing& 

 M14 
                                                                                            (583) 


                                          34   


Her s an uneasy expression. 






Yuri suddenly looks outside the window. A sense of discomfort comes over her. 

She goes beside the window. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          That's strange. 

Jack stares out the window too. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What is it? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          If we were heading back, we should see the shore by now. 

 

Yuri  studies  the  GPS.  The  GPS  reveals  that  they  are  headed  in  the  opposite  direction  of  the 

shore. 



Jack is studying out the window. 

Eiji enters and puts on light. 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, what s happened? 

                          Eiji, talk to me.  

 

Eiji doesn't answer and heads into the engine room. 

Yuri tries to run after Eiji. 

 Jack stops Yuri and he goes after Eiji. 

                                        YURI 

                                      (to Jack) 

                                                Be careful. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                Okay. 

  

Jack heads into the engine room. 



Eiji examines the engine. 

                                        JACK 

                                      (entering) 

                          Is it broken? 


                                          EIJI 

                          No, the engine is fine. The prop probably got hung 

                          up on some seaweed. Lend me you hand. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Me? 


                                          37   


 

Eiji heads outside with Jack following. 



Yuri awaits the men in the cabin. 

Eiji and Jack go out the engine room. 

Eiji opens a storage compartment under the sofa and takes out some rope. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, I d love to help, but I don't know my way 

                          around a boat. 

 

Eiji heads for the rear deck, ignoring him. 



Jack is frantically searching in the storage space underneath the sofa. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (entering) 

                          What are you doing? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Emergency flashlight. There's got to be one around some place. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          And what are you going to do with it? You going diving? 

 

Jack makes no answer. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Well, I won't. Jack, please& Let s just stop this! 

                          It was an accident, it s over. An accident! 

                                                Jack! 

With the flashlight in his hand, he turns and heads back out onto the deck. 



                                          44   


 


Jack sits on the sofa. 

Jack sees smoke start to come from a crack in a panel leading to the engine room. 

Jack opens the panel to the engine room. Smoke billows out. 

Shortly the engine stops suddenly with a thud. 

Eiji climbs down from the flying deck. 

                                        JACK 



                                          47   


                          What happened? What did you do? 

 

Eiji makes no reply, but simply heads towards the master bedroom. 
                                                                                              M20 
As he passes by, Jack notices some blood on the floor. 
                                                                                              (503) 

 

 

                                        JACK M20 

                          Eiji, are you really OK? 

 

Eiji stops walking to answer. But does not turn around. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          What? 

 

Yuri comes from the rear deck. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What's going on? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          It s Eiji. He s really hurt. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What do you mean? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look at the blood on the floor. 


But when they look down at the place where the blood was, somehow it has vanished. 

 

                                        YURI 



                                          48   


                          Where? 

 

                                        JACK 

        There was blood on the floor& 


Jack looks back at her blankly. 

                                        YURI M20 

                          Jack? 

 



A calm looking Eiji is sitting on the bed. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, don't you want to use the radio& call for help? 

 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Why? Nothing to worry about. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          We can't move. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          I said there's nothing to worry about. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          But... 



                                          49   


 

Suddenly  they  hear  a  mechanical  yet  human  THUMPING sound.  The  EERIE  sound  and 

REVERB gives you the creeps. 

Jack and Yuri turns around toward the cabin. 

  

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What's that? 

                                        YURI 

                          I'm not sure. Something s hitting the boat. 

 


Jack and Yuri look around, but there doesn't seem to be anything around or any danger. 

But as Jack looks around he notices at the bow of the boat what seems to be a YOUNG BOY. 

Jack fearfully heads towards the rear decks of the boat. 

Yuri follows after him. 



Yuri holds the microphone of the radio in her hand. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          This is leisure craft Yuri, is anyone receiving, over. 

                          This is leisure craft Yuri, if anyone is receiving  

                          please respond, over. 

 

Jack takes out his cell phone and tries to call help. 

The message NO SIGNAL appears on his cell phone screen. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Nothing. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No response here either. But it's not possible that 

                          we're out of radio range. 

  

                                        JACK 



                                          51   


                          Okay, try a different frequency. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                                 Okay ! 

 

Yuri adjusts the channel settings on the radio. 

Noise and static splutters from the radio, mixed in with the static can be heard a BOY'S VOICE. 

 

                                    BOY'S VOICE 

                          Jack... Jack...

                              (his face is white as a sheet.) 

                          Turn it off! 

 

                                        YURI 

                                                Ha? 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                Turn it off! 

 

                                    BOY S VOICE 

                                                Jack--- 

                                        JUCK 

                                                 Turn it off! 

 

A shaken Yuri turns the radio off. 



                                          52   


 

                                        JACK 

                          What in God's name is happening? 


Jack, confused, sits down on the nearby desk. Tired. 

 

                                        YURI M22 

                          Jack? What was that? It sounded like that voice was calling 

                          your name. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (haunted) 

                          It was Sean.  

 

                                        YURI 

                                                 What? 

                                        JACK 

                                      (haunted) 

                                                 It was Sean's voice. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (frightened) 

                          You mean... your little brother? The one who drowned? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You remember the cap? That was Sean's cap. 

Yuri shivers. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          You see... I killed him. He didn't just drown. I could have 

                          saved him. Instead, I stood by and watched him die& 



                                          53   


                          and he knows it s my fault... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Stop it, Jack! 

 

At this point, the grating SOUND of something metal and heavy being pulled along the floor can 

be heard. Yuri turns around to face the noise. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          Eiji. 

 

Yuri also turns around to look. Eiji is walking up the corridor pulling an anchor behind him. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Eiji & 

Eiji is silent. He looks at Yuri with what look like the eyes of a dead man.    M23 

                                                                                              ) 
Yuri can t move. (513

Eiji looks at Yuri. 

Jack anxiously sees Eiji. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          I was killed... it was your fault, I was killed because of you. 

                          If only you hadn't been here, I would not have died. 

 

At some point in this dialogue, Eiji's voice transforms into the VOICE OF A WOMAN. 

Jack looks in shock. 

Yuri begins to back away. 

 

                          EIJI (WOMAN'S VOICE) (CONT'D) 



                                          54   


                                    (in Japanese) 

                          I will never forgive you.  


Yuri starts back. 

Eiji lifts up the anchor. 

Yuri screams. M23 

                                        JACK 

                          Eiji, stop!. 

 

Jack hurls himself at Eiji. But Eiji brushes him off with superhuman strength. 

Jack bangs his head as he lands and is concussed. 

Eiji swings the anchor down. 

We here Yuri s scream.  

                                                                      FADE TO BLACK 


Darkness. 

NOISES. 

Jack opens his eyes regaining consciousness. 

The noises are coming from above, on the flying deck. 

 




                                        JACK 

                                      (Whispering) 

                                        Yuri& 

 

Yuri has been gone. 

Jack opens the storage area under the sofa and pulls out a wrench.. 

 


Jack looks around the cabin but cannot find Yuri. 

Jack heads down to the corridor. M24 



The door to the head won't open. Jack tries to open the door but stops as he hear nosies coming 

from the flying deck. 

Jack walks down the corridor opening each door in search of Yuri. 

 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (Whispering) 

                          Yuri.... 

 


Jack enters the bedroom. 

Jack opens each door. 

But she's not there. 



Jack comes back to the cabin. He opens the hatch to the engine room, and enters. 

 


Jack comes down to the engine room. 

She's not there. 



Jack heads for the cabin. 



                                          56   


But he sees Eiji on the rear deck with the anchor. 



Jack and Eiji enters the cabin. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Where is she? C mon, answer me. 

                          Eiji&stay back! Stay back!  

 

Eiji swings the anchor at Jack. 

Jack desperately tries to defend himself with the wrench, but his timing is out. 

Jack dodges a swing of the anchor as it smashes a support for the back. 

There is a clash of metal as the anchor and wrench meet, the wrench is flicked out of Jack's hand 

and goes flying. 

The now unarmed Jack tries to avoid the strikes of Eiji's anchor. But the anchor scrapes his inner 

thigh taking off a scoop of flesh 



                                          57   


Jack falls down. 

Jack tries to stem the flow of blood from the wound. 

Eiji  looks  at  Jack  with  a  creepy,  seemingly  possessed  expression  on  his  face.  With  this  same 

expression on his face, Eiji advances on Jack. 

Limping, Jack backs away toward a desk. 

Eiji attacks, swinging the anchor in hand. M25 

Jack dodges a swing of the anchor as it smashes a light on the desk. 

Jack dodges the anchor as it smashes into and penetrates halfway through a sofa. 

Jack escapes to the kitchen. 

Eiji tries to pull the anchor back out from the sofa, but it won't come. 

Jack desperately searches for a weapon. He picks up a kitchen knife. 

Jack, armed with the knife, faces Eiji. 


                                        JACK 

                          We end this now. 

                                                Back off& you back off, Eiji! Back off! 

 

Jack goes back the cabin. 

Eiji looks at the tip of the knife, but isn t upset. 

And Eiji continues to walk towards Jack. 

Eiji grips Jack by the throat and falls in the sofa with Jack, with the knife in his hand. 

The knife pierces Eiji's stomach.  

Jack is stunned. 

Eiji sits up silently. 

Jack sits up, too. 

Eiji looks down at the knife sticking out of his stomach with a strange expression on his face. 

Eiji pulls the knife out of his guts. But no blood follows it. 

Jack can t move. 

 Instead, blood spurts out from above Eiji's shoulder. One of Eiji's arms then detaches and drops 

to the ground. 

Jack is amazed. 



                                          58   


Half of Eiji's face also seems to have been wrenched off. 

A shocked Jack GULPS. 

Eiji draws away from Jack. 





Jack looks down in pain at his own leg, from which blood is running. 

Jack falls. 



Yuri  is  collapsed  in  the  bathroom,  unconscious.  There  is  an  injury  on  her  forehead  where  it 

appears she has been struck. There is a faint sound of WATER DRIPPING from the faucet. 

Yuri groggily regains consciousness and holds the wound on her forehead. 

                          Yuri stands up and tries to open the head door. 

 


Eiji's severed arm lies on the floor. 

Jack is attending to his own injury, tying a handkerchief around it. 

 


Yuri bangs on the door. 

 


Jack notices sound from the head. 


                                    YURI S VOICE 

                                  (banging on the door) 

                                      Jack! Jack! 



                                          59   


 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! 

 

Jack, limping, runs to find Yuri. 

Jack stumbles, and looks down at his leg 



Yuri bangs on the door.

                                                                                        M26 
Jack sees that Eiji's arm has grabbed hold of Jack's injured leg around the ankle. 
                                                                                        (12383) 
 


 

                                        YURI 

                                  (banging frantically) 

                          Help! 

 


The arm is holding Jack s leg back. He cannot move. 

 


Suddenly water cascades from the faucet in the head. 

Yuri tries to turn off the taps, but they won't go off. The water won't stop. 

Then, a deep GURGLING sound begins to come from the toilet bowl. Suddenly, water begins to 

gush out from under the toilet lid. 


                                        YURI  

                           Help! 

 



                                          60   



Jack's got his own problems, struggling to pry Eiji's severed arm off his ankle. 

 





                                        YURI 

                                  (banging frantically) 

                                               Help! 

 


Jack's got his own problems, struggling to pry Eiji's severed arm off his ankle. 

 


The water has risen up Yuri's knees. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Do something! 

 


The arm lets go, but then moves up the leg to Jack's bleeding wound. The arm latches onto Jack's 

leg around the wound. 

Jack SCREAMS in pain. 



The water has risen up Yuri's knees. 



Jack is desperately trying to pry Eiji's arm off his leg, finger by finger. 

 




                                          61   


The water has already risen to Yuri's stomach. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack! 

 


Jack s hand grabs the arm. 





                                        YURI 

                                               Jack! 

 


Finally Jack pries the arm off, but then it leaps upwards and grabs Jack around his neck. 

In shock, Jack falls to the ground. 



The water has already risen to Yuri s throat. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I need a hand in here! 

 


Jack looks desperate as he is throttled by Eiji's hand around his neck. 

Jack is using both his hands to try and desperately pull off Eiji's arm. 

 


 

                                        YURI 

                                               Help me! 



                                          62   


 


Jack finally musters up enough strength to pull off Eiji's arm. 

Jack smashes the arm onto the edge of the table several times, then throws it out of the cabin. 

 


Jack rushes towards the head, favoring the wounded leg. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                               Yuri! 

 


The water is now up to Yuri's mouth. 

                                        YURI  

                          It s flooded in here. Get me out! 

 


Jack bashes on the door. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! 

 

Jack tries to open the door, but the knob won't move. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! Okay, listen to me. I m gonna get you out of them. 

                                                You understand me? 

 



                                          63   


Jack desperately looks around for some kind of tool to use to open the door. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                Just hold on! 

Jack goes the cabin. 



Yuri is just managing to breath in a small space of air still left between the top of the water and 

the ceiling. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Help! 



Jack tries to pull the anchor that is sticked from in the sofa. 

But he cannot. 

  


Yuri is in water. 



Jack opens the storage compartment under the sofa. But he cannot find anything that could pry 

open the head door. 


                                        JACK 

                          Hold on Yuri! 

 

Jack runs out looking for the tool. 




REEL.5 



                                          64   



The room is filled with water. 

Yuri is in water. 

She bangs on the ceiling. 

She bangs on the head door. 


 M27 

Eiji is slapped across the face. (32
                                                                                            003) 



Yuri is astonished to touch Eiji s face. 

                                      NAOMI(O.C) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          This bitch's name is Yuri? 

Yuri watches the past.

                          I love her. 

 

A long haired woman, NAOMI (age 40) stares grimly at Eiji, who stands before her holding a 

glass. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          What did you say? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                        (making himself a drink and in Japanese)

                          What I was attracted to was the inheritance 

                          from your parents.  


(FLASH--present) 

Yuri stares at the scene. 

                                                                                          M27

                          I never felt the slightest love for you. 

 

Naomi responds with a high pitched laugh. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Do you think you can get away with this? 

                          Your  company, the house, even this cruiser.   

                          You wouldn't have any of these without me. 

 

Eiji appears to be paying no attention to what Naomi is saying. 

 

                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          I'll take it all. Every red cent of your assets will be mine. 

 

(FLASH present) 

Yuri stares at the scene. 


Quite calmly, Eiji picks up a blunt instrument lying close by and strikes to Naomi's head. 

 


A thud sounds in the bathroom. 



                                          66   


Yuri's head is thrown back underwater. 



Naomi falls down. 

 


Naomi comes stumbling out into the corridor. 

Eiji follows her. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          You betrayed me. Somebody help! 

 

Eiji calmly strikes Naomi again from behind. 



CUT AWAY to Yuri underwater being thrown forward as if struck from behind. 

 


Naomi falls to the floor. 

Eiji grabs a handful of Naomi's long, black hair. Eiji pulls up Naomi by her hair. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Stop it, please! 

 

Eiji bashes Naomi's head again. 



CUT  AWAY  to  Yuri  underwater,  her  head  again  being  thrown  around  as  if  by  the  strike  on 

Naomi. 



                                          67   


 


Blood flows from Naomi's head which Eiji has let drop on the kitchen s  counter. 

 

 

                                          EIJI M27 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                           You're getting your blood all over my 

                          beautiful cruiser! 

                          Can you imagine how much it costs replacing the floor? 

 

Eiji opens the head door and pushes Naomi's upper body into the bathroom. 

Eiji then strikes her again. 



CUT  AWAY  to  Yuri  underwater,  her  head  again  being  thrown  around  as  if  by  the  blow 

delivered to Naomi. 



Naomi summons her last strength to turn around and face Eiji. She glares at him in hatred. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Who do you think you're looking at like that, huh? 

 

Naomi, panting, slowly fixes Eiji with a grim smile. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          You... and that woman... I'll never forgive you. 




                                          68   


Eiji scoffs at this with a short nasal laugh, then strikes at Naomi with all his strength in one final 

blow. 

CUT AWAY to Eiji's face as it is splattered with blood. 

 



Yuri, underwater, loses consciousness. 



Bubbles of air escape from Yuri's mouth as she drifts unconscious in the water. 

 


Yuri drifts unconscious in the water. 



Jack returns to the head door with a fire axe. 

Jack goes to work on the door with the axe. 

But the door doesn t break. 



                                          69   


 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Yuri! Yuri! 

 

There is no sound from the other side of the door. 

Jack strikes into the gap between the door and the door frame with the axe. 

The door suddenly busts open, and masses of water come gushing out. 

Yuri's limp body also comes lolling out of the head together with the water. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Yuri! Common Yuri! 

 

Jack slaps her cheek.  

But Yuri doesn t wake up. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! Yuri! Can you hear& 

                          Common!  

 

Jack shakes her body, but she doesn t wake up. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! Don t you die on me!  

                          Don t you die on me! Don t you die on me!  

                          You hang in there! Right, okay? 

 

She still won t wake up. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                  (screaming in anguish) 

                          C mon! 



                                          70   


 

Jack clenches his fists and pounds on her chest. 

Still no response from Yuri. 

But she s still out. 

Jack recalls some faint memory. He grabs Yuri s nose, raises her jaw, forces open her mouth and 

begins mouth to mouth resuscitation. Yuri still won t respond. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                  (in a crying voice) 

                          C mon ,Yuri! You breath! Breath! 

 

Jacks pounds on her chest again. 

Yuri spits up some water and coughs. 

Jack gently hugs her. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Oh, my God! Thank God. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (coming to) 

 

                          Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Thank God. It s okay. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Eiji... he...Eiji&Eiji& 


                                        JACK 

                          It s okay. It s okay. He is gone. He is gone& 



                                          71   


                          I don t know what the hell is happening to us. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I saw& I saw everything. I saw& I saw what happened. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What? Yuri, what are you talking about? Sweetheart. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He killed Naomi. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Who s Naomi? Who s Naomi? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          His first wife... He killed her. 

                          Eiji murdered her so he could marry me. 

 

Yuri begins to cry. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          This is where Eiji dumped her body. 

                          He dumped her body in this part of the sea. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Okay. Okay. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          That's why this area is cursed. That s why this sea 

                          is cursed!(in Japanese) It s cursed! It s cursed!  




                                          72   


Yuri cannot control herself any longer, in a combination of fear and shock she begins to weep 

uncontrollably. 

Jack embraces Yuri and steadies down.  

 

                                        JACK 

                          Hey, hey, it s okay. We have to get it together. 

                          We have to get it together, sweetheart, okay? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack, Jack, listen. If we stay here, we're dead. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          That s why we get the fuck out of here, okay? 

                          Hang on to me& Let s go. 

 

Jack takes Yuri by the hand and helps her up. 



 

                                        JACK 



                                          74   


                          Hurry! 

 

Jack, leading Yuri by the hand, moves into the cabin. But Yuri catches her foot on something and 

falls over. Jack loses hold of Yuri's hand. 

Jack helps Yuri up out of the floor. M28 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Are you okay? 

                          C mon! C mon! 

 

Jack hurriedly takes Yuri in his arms and picks her up. 

As Yuri is being picked up, CLOSE UP on her face as she lifts it up. 

The face is not Yuri, somehow it has transformed to Naomi's. 

Jack s reaction, shocked. 

Naomi speaks in a VOICE NOT OF THIS WORLD. 

 

                                        NAOMI 

                          Jack. 

 

Jack looks at Naomi, shocked. He hears the voice but her lips are not moving. He begins to back 

away. 

 

                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack. 

 

Naomi, covered in blood, slowly stands up. 

 


Jack backs away down the corridor, limping. Naomi follows. 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          75   


                          Stay back! 

 

Naomi, bathed in that same strange pallid light, continues to advance towards Jack. 

Jack, continuing to back away, picks up the fire axe. 

 
                                                                                              M28 
                                        NAOMI 

                          Jack. 

 

Naomi continues to advance on Jack. 

Jack stands facing Naomi, brandishing his axe. 


                                  NAOMI (CONT'D) 

                          Jack. 


Naomi continues to advance on Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Stay  stay stay back... 

 

Jack raises the axe. 

Suddenly a SMALL BOY appears from behind Jack and embraces him. 

Jack turns round, looks down, and sees SEAN. 


                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Sean. 

 

As Jack looks at Sean, Naomi places her hand on Jack's neck from behind. 

Jack swings around and again raises the axe, seemingly about to strike. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack! No! 



                                          76   


 

Jack looks in shock. Now standing before him is not Naomi, but Yuri. 

Jack turns round and looks round. 

Sean disappears. 


                                        YURI 

                          Jack! Jack! Get a hold of yourself. 


Jack finds his head. 

From the cabin comes the muffled sound of a woman laughing. 

The lighting onboard the cruiser suddenly goes off. 

Jack  and  Yuri  are  standing  at  the  end  of  the  corridor  in  darkness.  They  look  around  them 

uneasily. 

The pallid glow appears around the area of the cabin. 

Jack and Yuri back away. 


                                        JACK 

                                               C mon! 

 

 They enter the master bedroom at the end of the corridor. 

 


Jack locks the door and limps back away from it. 

The sound of Naomi's LAUGHTER can be heard approaching the door on the other side. 

Jack and Yuri look toward the door, terrified. 

The sound of Naomi's CACKLING suddenly stops. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What happened? 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          77   


                          I... don't... know. 

 

Suddenly, in the mirror behind Jack, the image of a SMALL BOY appears. 

Jack swings around. 

But there is no one there. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          We're outta here! 

 

                                        YURI 

                                               Okay. 

 

Jack looks around. He sees the moonlight coming in from a skylight. 

Jack reaches for the skylight. 

Jack s face, intense.  

Yuri watches Jack what he is up to. 

Fearfully, he opens it. 

As  his  hand  goes  through  the  opening  in  the  skylight  it  is  grabbed  from  the  other  side  by  the 

hand of a woman. 

A shocked Yuri GULPS. 

Jack quickly pulls his hand back inside and slams the skylight shut. 

Jack winces at the pain caused by the injury in his leg. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Oh my god! Are you Okay? 

 

                                        JACK 

                                    (holding his leg) 

                          Yeah ..I think so. 

 

A loud BANGING against the door. M29 

                                                                                          (12483) 


                                          78   


Yuri and Jack stand frozen, looking at the door in terror. 

The door SQUEAKS. It seems like it is being pushed forcefully from the other side. 

Yuri hides behind Jack, holding onto him. 

The door continues to squeak, and begins to crack. Is it breaking? 

The door continues to squeak and groan. M29 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What is she doing? 


The door continues to squeak and groan. 

Yuri's expression suddenly changes. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I'll go. 

 

Jack turns round. 

                                        YURI 

                                (stepping away from Jack) 

                          I am the one she wants. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What are you saying. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          I am the one she wants. If I go, you'll survive. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What the hell are you talking about?. 


Yuri throws off Jack s inhibitions. 




                                          79   


                                        YURI 

                          Let me go. Let me go. 

 

Yuri pushes Jack aside, and heads towards the door.
