JAKE

some reason.  Sorry. 
(kisses her cheek)
See you on the astral plane, baber.

ANNIE
Wait!  I mean...hang back, buddy.  
Um, before the trip is officially 
over, are you sure there isn t like 
anything else you wanna ask me or 
whatever?  I ll pop some champagne,

intestine over the last fortnight?

ANNIE

JAKE
Man, that Daniel Day Lewis 
absolutely transformed into the 
lead of a terrible movie that 
 everyone says is great.  I m
exhausted, babe.  But have at that 
champagne.  Have at, girl.

He SLAPS her ass and heads for the bedroom.  DISAPPOINTED, 
Annie turns to the kitchen to make a drink.  Behind her, JAKE 
GRINS AS HE GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND PULLS OUT A RING.  But 
before she can see him, Annie Monroe finally just SNAPS:

ANNIE
Fuck you fuck you fuck you!   

JAKE
...Sorry, what?

ANNIE
 believe you I mean, I just - I can t
 propose to me on this trip, didn t
Jake.  It woulda been so perfect.  
There, I said it.  I said what

JAKE
Annie, turn around.

ANNIE
No, I will not turn around.  You

goddamn apartment without turning 
around.  I played JV basketball, I

She gets in a DEFENSIVE POSITION and proceeds to SLIDE around 
the apartment while KEEPING HER BACK TO JAKE.  He laughs.

She gives him DOUBLE FINGERS over her shoulder, then returns 
to angrily making a margarita (WHICH OCCUPIES HER THROUGHOUT).

ANNIE (CONT D)
Did your garbage friend Gil get in 
your head again about how terrible 
marriage is?  Hey, note to self: no 
 anymore, so  to self one says  note
 take advice you probably shouldn t
from someone who starts every one of 
 that way.  And FYI, Gil his  jokes

 he got divorced cause he let blows ,
himself go to a Rob Kardashian degree 
 maintain an and now probably can t
erection for as long as sex takes.  
Your friends are garbage people!  

JAKE
Hey, your best friend always says 
 rather get divorced than she d
 never totally married - which I ve
understood by the way - and you 
 call don ther a garbage person!

ANNIE
 mean I wanna end up That doesn t
like her.  Dennah might think she s 
super cool now with her high-
 waisted jumpers, and her  marriage
 attitude and all that shmarriage 
Yaz - her low estrogen birth 
 a storm a-control - but there s
 called her late coming, and it s
s.  She might  slash early 40 30 s
as well switch to an AOL email 
 gonna account tonight cause she s
be the short-haired Aunt who brings 
a friend to everything!

JAKE
Jesus, that was...hard to follow. 
Okay, this is so crazy.  Babe, just 
calm down and--

JAKE
(throws up his hands)
Whoa!  Just - WHOA!  Below the belt!

ANNIE
m funny, I do  a catch, okay?  I I m
 freak hot yoga a lot, and I didn t
out when I caught you masturbating 
to an US Weekly of that surfer girl 
who got her arm bitten off by a 
shark! 

JAKE
I will never apologize for that!  
Bethany deserves to be treated just 
like everybody else!  

ANNIE
 you just go marry Then why don t
her and have a hundred little one-
armed babies together?!

JAKE
 even make sense!That doesn t

ANNIE
The gist was clear!

JAKE
Goddamnit just turn the fuck around!

ANNIE
WHAT!?

She SPINS around and is STUNNED to see Jake on one knee.

ANNIE (CONT D)
Oh.  
(beat, unsure what to say)
...Yes?

JAKE
(exasperated)
Yeah, I guess, will you marry me?6.


ANNIE
 like that very much, thank you.I d

She sorta tip-toes over and looks at the RING.

ANNIE (CONT D)
Ooh, cushion cut...

She HESITANTLY KISSES him on the cheek.  Jake SIGHS, then:

JAKE
Okay everybody, come on out.

ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME OUT FROM HIDING PLACES 
s two  Mom, Gil, Dennah, Annie AROUND THE APARTMENT (Jake s
gay Dads, etc.).  They were all there to surprise Annie after 
the proposal, but now just stare at her, MOUTHS AGAPE.  

Annie is ABSOLUTELY FLOORED.  Beat. 

ANNIE
 everyone.  Great...  Hey...it s
 MOM, weakly)(to JAKE S
Hi Mrs. Schuffman - Myrna? - too 
 soon to call you Mom I m
assuming...?

MYRNA
You mean, too soon after you called 
me bitch?

ANNIE
(has no response, beat)
Should we move on to the toasts?

Awkward silence.  GIL (31, out of shape, divorced) pipes in.

GIL
Note to self: awkward.

Annie just drops her head, MORTIFIED.  Jake is AT A LOSS.

GOOD MUSIC KICKS IN AS WE CUT TO A MONTAGE OF HAPPY PHOTOS AND 
VIDEOS OF JAKE AND ANNIE THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP: them 
dressed as PEANUT BUTTER and JELLY for Halloween; a bunch of 
SELFIES of them kissing; a VIDEO Jake shot of him catching 
 clearly Annie singing WAY TOO LOUDLY in the shower (Annie s
the much bigger personality in all of these); etc.  The 
LAUGHTER and LOVE is a funny contrast to the epic fight we 
just witnessed, but proof nonetheless that these two idiots 
are perfect for each other.

TITLE CARD: MARRY ME7.


ACT ONE


INT. ANNIE S APARTMENT - LATER

Annie stands at her open front door, calling after all the 
Guests (who have just hurried out):

ANNIE
Any chance we can just chalk all 
that up to constructive criticism, 
gang?  Fearless feedback?
(desperate, sincere)
I love you all!

DEFEATED, she closes the door, then VERY SLOWLY TURNS AROUND 
to face Jake, SCARED.  He s INCREDULOUS.  Tense beat.  Then--

ANNIE (CONT D)
Welp, you sir have earned yourself 
what can only be described as a love-
 a  talkin making marathon.  We re
Choose Your  choice,  real dealer s
Own Adventure  kinda thing.  Should 
we stretch? 

JAKE
What.  The fuck.  Just happened.

ANNIE
(feels really bad)
 know.  I just - all I had I don t
 so today was a Kind Bar and - I m
sorry, Jake.  I love you more than 
myself.  Truly.  I will fix this.

JAKE
How?

ANNIE
(stumped)
Hmm...how indeed.  Smart.

JAKE
(laughs, amazed)
I mean, that was just spectacular.  
Even for you, Annie.  But I guess 
you did tell me you wanted a huge, 
memorable proposal, so...congrats - 
 bout this  be talkin people gon 
one for awhile!

ANNIE
...No such thing as bad press?8.


JAKE
(stands)
Listen babe, I think I m just gonna 
sleep at my place tonight if that s 
cool.  I love you.  I do.  I just 
 wanna be in this moment for don t
one more second.

ANNIE
(nods, choking up a bit)
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.  Fair enough.

He AWKWARDLY KISSES her cheek, then heads for the door--

ANNIE (CONT D)
Wait, Jake!  Just to clarify 
though...we are engaged, or we re 
not?d love to make a few   Cause I 
calls, fire off some emails, maybe 
 profile.update m LinkedIn
(off his look)
Cannot joke my way out of this.  
Good note.

JAKE
You know what?  No, we re not 
 wanna tell engaged yet.  I don t
this story for the next 60 years.  
Just - gimme a few days to regroup, 
then I ll propose again, okay?  But 
I m doing it my way this time.  Low 
key, like a normal human.  I know 
you always wanted this to be like 
 romcom, the end of some bad 90 s
 not a Jennifer Aniston but you re
 a character.  If anything, you re
lot closer to her in real life.  

ANNIE
She does seem awfully crazed about 
getting married.  

JAKE
So, do you think you can wait just 
like a little bit longer?  Or am I 
gonna end up in one of those People 
Magazine human interest stories 
where a girl snaps and pushes her 
boyfriend off a cruise ship or 
something?    

ANNIE
Pfff, me?  Are you kidding?  I can 
 chill.  Hella totally wait.  I m
 do it, whatever.  chill.  Do it, don t
(beat)
But I mean, definitely do it though, 
right?  9.


He ROLLS HIS EYES, EXASPERATED (but with love), and walks 
out.  Annie instantly COLLAPSES to the floor, SO DESTROYED.  


 PRIUS - LATERINT. DENNAH S

 best friend, DENNAH (32, hot, high-waisted jumper), Annie s
 best friend, Gil, is in shotgun.  They both drives.  Jake s
stare ahead silently, absolutely BLOWN AWAY.  

DENNAH
Wow.  Just...wow.  I feel so bad 
for them.

GIL
I know.  Me too.  
(beat, then)
Question though: when Annie said 
that thing about me not maintaining 
legit erections, do you think she 
heard that from someone or was just 
sorta guessing based on my recent 
weight gain and general malaise?

DENNAH
Unclear.  But as long as we are 
chatting: Are people not feeling my 
jumpers?  You guys can tell me if 
you don t think this is a good look.

GIL
Oh sorry, I thought you were doing 
that sorta Brooklyn-y thing where 
girls purposefully pick out the 
most unflattering clothes for their 
body type and then wear them in the 
hot sun.    

DENNAH
I am doing that.  Is it not enough 
to carry the day?

GIL
Okay so maybe there was one time.  
When I took my NyQuil too early.  
But even the greats strike out once 
in awhile.  Francis Ford Coppola 
Dr.  Robert Altman made  made  Jack ,
 Roman Polanski T and the Women ,
made a child have sex with him.   

DENNAH
I still don t get how he came outta 
that whole thing as like a Nelson 
Mandela type figure.10.


GIL
One of life s many mysteries.  Like 
black guys with English accents...
(beat, looks off)
 not wrong, though.  I did Annie s
 why I lost let myself go.  That s
Kassie, god rest her soul. 

DENNAH
s living. not dead.  She Your ex-wife s

GIL
Living with Barry from Barry s Boot 
Camp.  

DENNAH
Really?  Good for her.

GIL
Well, not the Barry.  A guy named 
Barry who works there.  But he s in 
incredible shape, which you know is 
very painful for me.

Annie just BURIES her face in her pillow, DESTROYED.  

END OF ACT ONE14.


ACT TWO


INT. HOT YOGA - DAY

Annie SWEATS LIKE SHAQ as she and Dennah transition from 
DOWNWARD DOG to STANDING BOW in their (very) hot yoga class. 

ANNIE
Ugghhh...

Dennah easily holds the TOUGH POSE (balancing on one leg/one 
arm forward/the other behind her holding up her other foot).  
Annie WOBBLES and SHAKES and keeps PUTTING HER FOOT DOWN for 
balance (the only movement in the still class of EXPERTS).

ANNIE (CONT D)
 love just like one sip of God, I d
Diet Coke right now.

The shirtless teacher, WES (40, lean, tan), walks by them:

WES

excited to get a hamster I

And now all our friends and family 
probably hate me too.  God, I 
waited for this moment for 32 
years.  And had I just waited like 
32 more seconds... 15.


They TRANSITION to another TOUGH POSE (both hands on the mat/ 
 crooked leg one leg in the air).  Dennah NAILS IT.  Annie s
SHIVERS above her as SWEAT DRIPS down her face to the mat.

ANNIE (CONT D)

the last ten hours and then 
immediately lost his wallet and 
phone - I m pretty sure his account 
got hacked.  
(sits up)
 just sit around and wait for I can t
him to propose again.  I gotta do 
something to make everyone forget 
re  you this ever happened.  C mon,
smart.  How do I fix this?  Go!   

DENNAH
Ooh, I d love to help, but I m super 
busy right now.  I m switching over

GIL
I wanna get some new clothes first.  
What Annie said really hit me, man.  
 a 31 year-old divorced hair I m
plug salesman with sleep apnea and 
a body like one of those shapeless 
army duffel bags.  I gotta make 
some changes.  Quick.  That reminds 
me, you wanna go on a hike later?  

JAKE
A hike?  What am I, an explorer?  
Besides, I decided a long time ago 
to just be one of those people who 
s cool  exercise, if that doesn t
with everyone.  

Gil stops at an UGLY SHIRT (epaulets, pockets all over, etc.).

GIL
Ooh, now see this is a shirt.  This 
is the kinda shirt that says,  Hey, 
pay attention to me. 

JAKE
 my in you date-rape I ll  Or
s there a tiny pocket   Why Scion. 
 between the shoulder blades?  It s

tell you last night - on account of 
the most ridiculous event I ve ever 
witnessed in person - but congrats 
on your engagement question mark?

JAKE
Hey, was it exactly how I drew it 
up?  No.  But did it actually turn 
out to be even better than I coulda 
ever dreamed?  Also, no.17.


GIL
Well, you dodged a bullet.  Marriage 
blows.  And the best part is now 
 both single!  We can go out we re

He puts up a HI-FIVE...Jake leaves him HANGING.  

JAKE

 probably totally few days.  She s
freaking out right now.  Is it bad 
that I kinda love that?

GIL

their core, are basically just a 
two person Hunger Games.

JAKE

 talking about a girl I mean, we re
who once moved out of a really great 
apartment cause she found out the 
 like Oprah - but I landlord didn t
just really love her, man.  I do.  
And besides, the last thing I wanna 
do is go tangin  with you.  I hated 
casual sex.  The second it was over,

and let me handle this my way...

 CHANGING ROOMS - LATERINT. MACY S,

Gil exits a dressing room in a SUPER DOUCHEY OUTFIT.  

GIL
Okay, what do you think?  Be 
honest.  First blurt.  But keep in 
mind that I feel good about it.

actor kills themself in.

I wouldn t turn my nose up at that--

JAKE

worst.  She cheated on you!

GIL
We were separated!  At Burning Man 
for half a day.  It was her first 
time doing mushrooms and she 
briefly forgot she was married.

JAKE
Wait, but what about how you just 
told me marriage blows, literally 
minutes ago?

GIL
That s when I thought we were gonna 
be single together, cruising chicks, 
 like a couple of Vince Vaughns.  I m

I ate cereal out of a bike helmet.

Jake rolls his eyes at the abbreviation, but then pats his

ACT THREE


 APARTMENT - NIGHTEXT. KASSIE S

Gil (clean shaven now, douchey new outfit) knocks on the 
  KASSIE door, then LEANS against the wall to look  cool .
(32, average) opens the door.

KASSIE
Gil?  Hey.  Whatsup?

GIL

Ooh, ouch, put on make-up much?  You 
look like you just got outta bed.

KASSIE
I did.  I worked a double shift.  
 expecting visitors.And I wasn t

GIL
Oh.  Well...good luck with that.

KASSIE
With what?

GIL
With...not expecting visitors.  
 a loser.  Ha-Cause you reha!

KASSIE
Right.  Did you just come here to 
 clothes are insult me?  And who s
those?  You look like you robbed a 
Serbian DJ.  Or a guy named DJ.

GIL
(hurt)
What?  No, these are - cool.  Kay 
told me Jake Gyllenhaal put this 
exact outfit in his will as what he 
wants to be buried in. 

KASSIE
Alright Gil, so great catching up 
with you.

She starts to CLOSE THE DOOR-- Gil STOPS it with his hand and 
immediately turns SUPER SINCERE:

GIL
I miss you!  Please Kassie, take me 
ll see.  I  changed, you back.  I ve
even went to the gym today.  
(MORE)25.

GIL (CONT'D)
Did not realize you needed a credit 
card to join though, so I had to go 
back to my car, which had been 
towed in the interim, which forced 
me to walk all the way home, which 
actually turned out to be quite a 
workout--  But whatever, how bout 
just one date?  Come with me to 
 engagement party Jake and Annie s
tonight.  Please.  I need this.

KASSIE
(long beat, then)
Okay.  Sure.  I...I missed you too, 
Gilly. 

He s SURPRISED.  She SMILES at him.  He KISSES her!  Then--  

GIL
So, not to bring up the make-up 
thing for real now, but are you 
gonna change at all?  Cause the 
Evite did say cocktail attire...

She ROLLS HER EYES and SMILES as she heads inside to change.  
Gil PUMPS HIS FIST dramatically like an athlete!


EXT. PINCHE MARICONES - LATER

Jake (blazer, tie) eats nachos sadly at the same outdoor 
table where he and Annie first met.  A WAITRESS approaches.  

WAITRESS
You okay?

JAKE
 supposed to be at Not really.  I m
my engagement party right now, but 
 we keep getting in huge fights - I m
 technically not even sure if we re
 get why engaged.  I just...don t
 this has been so hard.  Like if it s
some kinda sign or something...?

WAITRESS
 as in  okay? Oh, no I meant  You
 get can I else anything there  Is

a waitress, not Iyanla Fix My Life.

JAKE
(embarrassed)
 good, thanks.Right.  I m

The Waitress just walks off.  Jake looks FORLORNLY at the 
BENCH WHERE HE FIRST SAW ANNIE.  It triggers a MEMORY...26.


 APARTMENT - INT. JAKE SFLASHBACK

5 years earlier.  Annie and Jake (a year into dating) host a 
karaoke party for FRIENDS (younger Dennah/Gil/Kassie/etc.).  
My Heart Will Go On .  Gil and Kassie duet Celine Dion s

GIL
Near...

KASSIE
Far...

GIL/KASSIE
Wherever you are, I believe that 
the heart does go on...

KASSIE

 very flat, Gil...You re

GIL

 been flat your whole life...You ve

KASSIE
Screw you, Gil!

GIL
I WISH YOU EVER WOULD YOU FROZEN 
BITCH!

She THROWS the mic at him and storms off!  He follows!  The 
Guests are BLOWN AWAY (odd to see a couple bicker through a 
song about eternal love).  Kay BURSTS into tearful applause!  

KAY
What?  I liked it.

ANNIE
(jumps up, grabs the mic)
Thank you!  That was horrifying.  
(types in a song)
Okay, this next song goes out to 
Jake.  I will always love you.  
(stops herself)
Wait, just to clarify, the song is 
 not I m  You . Love Always Will  I
saying I love you.  Cause neither 
of us has said it yet.  Even though  
m  been a year.  Not that I it s
 totally cool upset by that.  I m
 the chill with like whatever.  I m
girlfriend, bra.  
(the backing track begins)
To be clear though, I don t not 
 love you, Jake.  I just wasn t
gonna say it til you did.  
(MORE)27.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Technically, I didn t say it.  
Unless you want me to so that you 
can say it back almost immediately?  
Your call here, buddy.  
(awkward beat)
In hindsight, I probably shoulda 
picked a different song.

JAKE
(laughs, then smiles wide)
I will always love you too, Annie.

ANNIE
(so touched)
Awww...
(then immediately sings)
And III-EEE-III will always love 
YOUUUUUUUUU!


EXT. PINCHE MARICONES - AS WE LEFT HIM

Jake THINKS about that memory, then-- THROWS DOWN his nacho!

JAKE
Check please!  Can I get the check!?

He grabs his stuff FRANTICALLY, when-- his phone RINGS!  It s 
Annie!  He answers it!  INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM AS NECESSARY:

JAKE (CONT D)

ANNIE
Jake, before you say anything, I just 
 so so sorry.  For everything.  ...I m
For getting you fired, for ruining 
the proposal...s plural.  It s just 
sorta what I do.  My dumb emotions 
 and then I explode my life.  get goin 
I m a spazz.  But I m working on all 
that.  With a team of therapists, and 
gurus, three different astrologists, 
a chiropractor, two unlicensed life-
coaches, and a self-described warrior 
poet.  I wish I was just born super 
mellow and logical like you - I love 
that you never explode - but, I mean, 
have you met my dads?  They named me 
 why I after a musical.  But that s
need you.  Desperately.  Without you, 
 just...spin off into space.  I d
(tears up)
Jake, I...could not love another 
human more.28.


JAKE
No Annie, I need you.  The truth 
is, I love your explosions.  My 
life would be so boring without 
 them.  You challenge me.  You re
like my little exploding challenger 
- heard it right when I said it.

ANNIE
Not great.

JAKE
I thought about everything, and this 
is all my fault.  I waited way too 
long to propose.  Just like I waited 
too long to say I love you, even 
though I loved you from the moment I 
saw you.  I always wait too long on 
 even the emotional stuff.  I don t
  like saying the word  emotional .
 just - uch.  I guess cause my It s
folks fought so much when I was a 
kid, I just always tried to be so 
 like I quiet and easy...and now it s
 express a single emotion ever.  can t
(to himself)
Wow, I think I just, like, figured my 
entire self out in this moment.  
(refocuses on Annie)
 care But whatever - Annie, I don t
about the proposals, or my crappy job 
- which I probably woulda ridden all 
the way to retirement had you not 
exploded me outta there - I only care 
about being with you.  Forever. 

ANNIE
 Me too!  Side note though, you don t
think any of these botched proposals 
 not supposed are like a sign we re
to be together or anything, do you?

JAKE
(concerned, then fronts)
 What?  No, of course not.  I don t
believe in signs.  Especially not 
negative ones.  I mean, if there 
was like, say, a positive sign that 
we were supposed to be together, I 
 discount one of those.wouldn t

ANNIE
Of course not.  But in this 
 think we particular case, I don t
should read too much into this 
negative sign, right?29.


JAKE
Fuck this sign, okay?  I said it.   

ANNIE
 Totally!  Now just stay there, I m
coming to you!

JAKE
Wait, how do you know where I am?

ANNIE
 at our engagement party, You re
right?

JAKE
 not there either?No.  Wait, you re

ANNIE
I couldn t face you.  Or all them.  
Or all them without you.  I freaked.

JAKE
Well, then where are you?

 PHONE, JAKE HEARS:THROUGH ANNIE S

WAITRESS (THROUGH PHONE)
You okay?

JAKE
Wait a second.

Jake stands up and looks THROUGH THE WINDOW: ANNIE S INSIDE!  
 both at Pinche Maricones!  She runs out to him!  They re

JAKE (CONT D)
Oh my god!  Annie!

ANNIE
This is so crazy!  
(they hug big, then)
Wait, this is it!  This is the sign 
 supposed to be together!   that we re

JAKE
Oh yeah, this is as good a sign as 
s like we  ever seen.  It I ve
 get away from each literally can t
 like Rachel McAdams other.  We re
and romantic time travel movies.

ANNIE
(laughs)
And thank god, cause that first 
sign - the one that clearly stated 
we should not be together - was 
giving me some serious pause.30.


JAKE
Oh sure, that was a devil of a sign.  
As obvious as they get.  But this 
sign trumps that one for sure.  This 
 higher up on is like the sign that s
 the pole, that says, like,  Vehicles
With Permit Number 170 Exempt .

ANNIE
(laughs)
Totally.  
(tears up)
Jake, I...just really love you.

JAKE

though recent studies show that 
most calamari is actually pig anus?

Ew.  But, yes.  YES!

He puts the calamari ring on her finger.  They KISS BIG!  The 
restaurant CHEERS (even the bitchy Waitress)!

GIL
Guess who s back?  Gil and Kassie.  
We re Gassie again!  Or Kil.  
Neither is great.  But, we are back!

Gil grabs a MINI BURGER and bites it, proud of himself.  31.


KASSIE

Ooh Gilly, don t ya think you

KASSIE
Okay, sure.

 shrug) remember don t

Kevin 2 MOVES to attack her-- Kevin 1 HOLDS him back.  Gil is 
ASHAMED.  Kay weirdly gives Gil a congratulatory THUMBS UP!


 CAR - LATERINT. ANNIE S

Jake and Annie SPEED toward the party!  They SWERVE in and 
out of traffic like the end of a 90 s romcom!

ANNIE
Everyone s really gonna hate us now!

JAKE

EXT. ANNIE S APARTMENT - LATER

All the Guests walk out of the building to go home, GROUSING.  
Just then, Jake and Annie SPRINT UP SO OUT OF BREATH!  32.


JAKE
 here and--Wait!  We - We re

has to take a knee)
Jesus Christ.

ANNIE
Wow, babe, we gotta get you in a 
 sorry gym.  Guys, listen, we re
 late, we just...had to stop we re
to get you all a present...to say 
thanks for coming.

Annie pulls CHIPS and SALSA out of her purse (from Pinches).

JAKE
The salsa symbolizes...the spice of 
life.  And...um...

ANNIE
The corn - or maize - of the chips 
is meant to evoke the sustenance of 
friendship.
(off their BLANK STARES)
Okay, the truth is, neither of us 
were gonna come tonight cause we 
blew another proposal and got in 
another big fight--

Everyone GROANS--

JAKE
But, then we actually sorta stumbled 
into an even better proposal.  So, 
we re engaged for real now.  And it 
was perfect this time.  

ANNIE
Well, except that it took place at 
a restaurant that doesn t recognize 
the most basic civil rights of the 
LGBT community-- sorry Dad and Dad.

Jake and Annie start inside (no one else moves), when--

MYRNA
Yeah...you guys are a very strong oh-
for-two on this thing, okay?  We re 
 happy for you.  But I think it s
time we call it a week on trying to 
 celebrate your engagement.  Let s
 save up for the wedding, which I m
 sure will be a huge disaster.  Can t
wait to get my eyes on that.  
(pointedly to Annie)
If you even invite me.33.


 still MAD.  She starts to WALK AWAY, when-- Annie Myrna s
 odd.  She holds stops her with a WEIRD FORCED HUG.  It s
Myrna AWKWARDLY for a beat.  Then they separate STRANGELY.

ANNIE
 Listen, Myrna - Mrs. Schuffman - I m
 sorry.  I never had a mom, okay?  I m
the product of an egg from a lesbian 
my dads no longer speak to, and a 
sorta soft serve swirl of their

could pick.  Truly.  I only insulted 
you cause the easiest way to hurt a 
guy is to go after his mother.  And 
 how I always fight: below the that s

wanted to hurt Jake.  But I never

Hey, I respect that strategy.  
 how I used to fight with That s

divorced, but I regret nothing.

throat (he wants an apology too).  Annie turns to him. 

ANNIE

Okay, buddy.  Now, who would like 
to come in and have a drink - not

Everyone LAUGHS.  Then they all start to walk inside HAPPY!

Jake and Annie roll off each other.  They just had sex.  

JAKE
Nice job, Annie.  Some really 
creative stuff there in the middle.

ANNIE

Thanks, you too.  You know, on the 
plus side of all this, I think we 
just invented botched proposal sex.

getting married, right?

ANNIE
  I know.  It s...terrifying.

JAKE
Could not be more scared right now.

ANNIE
Also, real talk: did not think it 
was gonna be that tough to get 
engaged.

JAKE
Yeah, that was a real dooze.

They LAUGH.  Gil enters-- Jake and Annie SCREAM!  He grabs a 
glass of water off their nightstand, and sits on the bed.  

GIL
You guys were so right about 
 ever wanna get Kassie.  I don t
back with her.  I guess sometimes 
 see a situation clearly you can t
until afterwards, and then you feel 
like it shoulda always been that 
obvious the whole time.  Like when 
any guy you know marries an Asian 
 always immediately girl, you re
s a  course!  That guy like,  Of
total Asian girl kinda guy!  How 
  did I not realize that before!? 

Jake and Annie think a beat, then BOTH NOD (it makes sense).35.

Hey, never.  You and me are in this 
thing forever, Annie.  Or at least 
until one of us murders the other 
one.  Which is probable.

ANNIE

JAKE
Promise.

They KISS, turn off the lights, then go to sleep, SO IN LOVE.
