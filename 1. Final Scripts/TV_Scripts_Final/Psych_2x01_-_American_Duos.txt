      INT. BACKSTAGE AT THE AFTERSCHOOLTALENT SHOW - 1987

      Behind curtain, YOUNG SHAWN runs vocal scales.  His hair is 
      sprayed with perfect 80 sflair.  He looks in the mirror and 
      holds up the LPcover of Tears For Fears  Songs From the Big 
      Chair--lovingly comparing his look to singer Roland Orzabal.

      YOUNG GUS rushes in, wearing a matching Michael Jackson fake 
      leather pants and jacket and one glued-on sparkle glove.  
      Shawn is horrified.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    What are you doing?  The Michael 
                    Jackson outfit?!?!  That s like, 
                    two years old!

                                  YOUNG GUS
                          (now also panicked)
                    I got scared.

      Shawn grabs another PICTURE and shoves it in Gus  face.  It s 
      Billy Ocean in an all-white suit.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    You were supposed to be Billy 
                    Ocean!  Where s your white suit?

                                  YOUNG GUS
                    I looked like the 7-Upguy!

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    He s bald and like, over a hundred! 
                    Why would Michael Jackson sing with 
                    Roland Orzabal?

                                  YOUNG GUS
                    Why would Billy Ocean sing with 
                    Roland Orzo-- orzo--

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                      Orzabal!Now we have to add a 
                    moonwalkinto Shoutand hope the 
                    judges don t slam us for it...

                                  YOUNG GUS
                    I don t know how to moonwalk.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    Learn.  Quick.

    He heads through the curtain...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:            PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   2.


      INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY - 2007

    --a PAIR of SINGERS stand breathlessly, waiting.  Seated at a 
      table across from them is NIGEL ST. NIGEL, smug and 
      articulate, looks at them squarely and speaks without pause.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    ...you're stiff.  Inarticulate. 
                    Slightly jaundiced.  Asymmetrical.  
                    You smell.  The one on the right, 
                    there s something in your teeth.  
                    All in all, I d say there's 
                    absolutely nothing worthwhile about 
                    either one of you...

    The singers stand, shell-shocked.  Finally, one of them is 
      able to muster a response.

                                  SINGER #1
                    But we haven t even sang yet.

      Nigel considers this.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Apples and Oranges.

    He looks to the other judges, henpecked ROCKWELL and slightly 
      loopy and self-medicated former pop star EMILINA SAFFRON.

                                  ST. NIGEL (CONT D)
                    I ve seen enough.  Anybody else?

                                  EMILINA
                    I like them.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Of course you like them, you ve 
                    been asleep for the last 45 
                    minutes.  Rockwell?

      Rockwell starts to speak.  But before he can utter a sound--

                                  ST. NIGEL (CONT D)
                    Good.  Moving on.

      INT. PSYCH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

    As GUS and SHAWN watch this exchange on television, Gus with 
      baited breath, Shawn is disgusted...

                                  SHAWN
                    You see?  This is why--

                                  GUS
                    Shusssiizziitt!




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   3.

      CONTINUED:

                                  SHAWN
                    You re shushing me?  For reality 
                      television?  Are you serious--

                                  GUS
                    Shuuuuuussssss!

                                  SHAWN
                    Dude --

                                  GUS
                    Shzzt!!

      Shawn recoils, slightly disturbed.  The show goes to 
      commercial.  As the American Duos logo pops up, Gus finally 
      takes his eyes off the screen.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    Rule one, Shawn, no talking during 
                    Duos.

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus, use the pause button once, 
                    please, for the love of Lori 
                    Loughlin.Why did we get TiVoif 
                    we don t fast forward and I m never 
                    allowed to stop for commentary?

                                  GUS
                    The show is intended to be watched 
                    straight through, there s a rhythm--

                                  SHAWN
                    Like when they do the personal 
                    segments about how they were born 
                    in a giant corn silo and named all 
                    their pigs after characters from 
                    Big Valley -- you re right, it s 
                    like really, reallygood jazz.

      Suddenly, the phone rings.  Shawn jumps up.

                                  GUS 
                    Whoa, no calls either.

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus this show is nothing more than 
                    a knock off of the other knock off 
                    of the other knock off show.  
                    They ve got the standard cranky 
                    Brit, the crazy former pop star.  
                    How many of these processed shows 
                    are you going to get suckered into?

                                  GUS
                    The contestants in this one are 
                    DUOS, which makes it way more 
                    compelling because they have to 
                    mesh, become one soul, like V-ger
                    and Stephen Collins in Star Trek I, 
                    and... they re shooting in Santa 
                    Barbara this year so it more than 
                    compensates.
                          (itrings again)
                    Don t you dare answer that.

                                  SHAWN
                          (looking at caller i.d.)
                    It s Juliet.
                          (Gus won t budge)
                    She might be bleeding and in a 
                    ditch. 

                                  GUS
                    She s not in a ditch.

                                  SHAWN
                    Then maybe she s lonely and in the 
                    shower.  Either way it s a win, 
                    except for the ditch one...

                                  GUS
                          (still mulling the 
                            imagery)
                    She has a shower phone?

                                  SHAWN
                      I certainly hope so.

    He answers.  Listens for one second.

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    We ll be there.

      INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

      Shawn and Gus enter, JULIET meets them outside the Chief s 
      office.  The guys are still bickering.

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus, seriously, I m cancelling the 
                    TiVo.No more frame by frame, no 
                    more  Ghost Cat. 

                                  GUS
                    I recorded that by accident!

                                  SHAWN
                    Then why didn t you erase it for 
                    three months?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   5.

                                  GUS
                    Fine.  But I m putting the official 
                    Gus  spoiler alert  up.  Until we 
                    watch the recording when we get 
                    back, nobody utters a word about 
                    American Duos.

                                  JULIET
                    That s going to be difficult.

                                  GUS
                    Why?

    She leads them into CHIEF VICK S OFFICE where they find NIGEL 
    ST. NIGEL in the flesh.  Gus reels back on his heels.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    Oh, man.  Wow.  Nigel St. Nigel.

      Nigel sits next to INTERIM CHIEF VICK.  Gus is tongue-tied 
    for a moment, then completely changes his tone--

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    You were TOTALLY unfair to 
                    Catherine Clement in season two.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I don t remember who you are 
                    referring to, but she was hideous.

      Nigel, disappointed, looks to INTERIM CHIEF VICK.

                                  ST. NIGEL (CONT D)
                    This is them?

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Yes, Shawn Spencer and Burton 
                    Guster.  Our resident psychic team.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    The answer is no.

    He stands.

                                  SHAWN
                    No?  No what?  Was the question, 
                     Have I seen better hair?   If so, 
                    I thank you, sir.  

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactly what 
                    you asked for.  Hear them out.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    There s no reason.

    She gives him a firm look.  Surprised, he obeys.

                                  JULIET
                    Nigel needs protection.

                                  SHAWN
                    You realize you re in a police 
                    station?

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I don t trust the police.  They re 
                    useless.
                          (looksto the Chief)
                    No offense.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Oh, none taken.

                                  JULIET
                    Mr. St. Nigel has been the victim 
                    of a series of threats and attempts 
                    on his life by a crazed stalker.  
                    He believes even the police could 
                    somehow be in on the conspiracy.  
                    Even though we have assured him--

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I can speak for myself.
                          (looksat Juliet)
                    And stop slouching.

      Juliet stands up straight.

                                  ST. NIGEL (CONT D)
                    Every time I bring in some sort of 
                       professional  protection, my 
                    attacker gets closer.  My car has

      INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY

      Shawn and Gus are singing a capella.It s slightly 
      reminiscent of an A-ha hit from 1986, only because it is, 
      without the cartoon video accompaniment.

    The judges are dumbfounded.  This was not good.  Not even 
      close.  Shawn and Gus wait for a reaction.

                                  ST. NIGEL

                    Something awesome.

    St. Nigel is speechless, momentarily.  Emilina dramatically 
      puts back on her shoe.

      Shawn and Gus look at each other, neither is wearing purple. 
      Nigel starts to get nervous, realizing his  protectors  are 
      about to get bounced from the auditorium.

      Another duo bursts out from offstage. THE CADE BROTHERS 
      (Rance and Chance) from North Dakota (think Buscemiand

                    Yeah.  Nigel called him a  curious 
                    cocktail of obesity and stupid  but 
                    then they sent us through, anyway!

      Rance doesn t speak.  He s just big and stone cold pissed.

                    That s hitting below the belt.

      INT. CATWALK - DAY

      High above the action, Shawn and Gus look down into the 
      audition room below. 

                                  GUS
                    A sniper could get off a shot here.

      Below, two DANCERS are tearing it up, they re pretty good.  

                                  SHAWN
                    Uh-oh, those two could beat us.

                    The janitor and his cat could beat 
                    us.

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus, don t be ridiculous... cats 
                    aren t allowed in the competition.  
                    It wouldn t be fair.  They d win on 
                      cuddlinessalone.

      Juliet, watching from her post.  SHAWN VISION: as the two 
      dancers tear it up, Juliet s feet subtly move along with 
      their routine, mimicking in perfect step.  Shawn smiles.

    The show s host LESTER BEACON, followed by a LARGE SECURITY 
      GUARD grabs them by the collar.

                                  BEACON
                    Are you supposed to be up here?

      INT. NIGEL S TRAILER - DAY

      Shawn and Gus quickly SNEAK inside.  Nigel has both of his 
      hands in cooling jello molds.

                                  SHAWN
                    There he is.  Here s what we ve

                    What I ve got, is tinnitus.  Thanks 
                    for the gift.  How do you expect me 
                    to carry you two injured howler

                    I think I preferred the stalker.

      EXT. NIGEL S TRAILER - DAY

      They follow Nigel outside as he lights up a cigarette.  Shawn 
      looks around, nervous.  Something is out of place, 
      different...

                                  SHAWN
                    Don t--

                          (stalling)
                    Um, smoke?  Those can kill you.

                                  ST. NIGEL 
                    Well add them to the list.

      Bingo.  SHAWN VISION:  a fresh puddle, WATER streaming into 
      from behind one of the trailers.

      Nigel pulls out a lighter to spark up his cigarette.

      SHAWN VISION: a THICK ELECTRICAL CABLE smolders off in the 
      horizon where the cable emanates from.  Shawn s eyes go wide.

                                  SHAWN
                    STOP!!!

    He RUNS over, bear-hugging the confused judge.  St. Nigel 
      immediately TWISTS AWAY from him, horrified.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I do not have physical contact with 
                    people with arm hair!

    He gets out of Shawn s grasp and starts to step forward.  
      Nigel pulls away but Shawn GRABS Nigel's platinum engraved 
      cigarette case and fakes a psychic episode...

                                  SHAWN
                    That case...

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Was a gift.  A very expensive--

      Shawn THROWS it in the fresh water.  The metal EXPLODES as it 
      hits what we now realize is super-conducted water.  Nigel's 
      ashen face stares at the sight until he realizes his 
      cigarette case is destroyed.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   17.

                    I... did.

      Shawn steps back.  Nigel dusts himself off and tries to 
      collect himself, he looks at the smoldering water, shakes his 
      head, then PASSES OUT.

      INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      A line full of people fills the police station.  They are 
      CONTESTANTS, TECHS, all being interviewed as witnesses or 
      suspects.  Lassiter walks through.

                                  LASSITER
                    How many more?

                                  MCNAB
                    A lot.  You wanted everybody who 
                    was in the building.

                                  LASSITER
                    That s right.  Inside.  And 
                    outside.  Anyone inside the gates.  
                    This is attempted murder.

                                  MCNAB

                    You heard what I said.  Who s next?

    He walks inside--

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY

      Waiting there, in the suspect chairs, are Shawn and Gus.  
      Kind of enjoying the fact that they are there.

                    It s a long story.  Suffice to say

                    you slap them a little bit on the

      Shawn and Gus look at each other, worried.

                                  SHAWN
                    Juliet, my heart tells me that you 
                    can dance, and we need to step it 
                    up.  Literally.  And stomp the 
                    yard.  Figuratively.  We reached 
                    the second round, an elite class of

                                  LASSITER
                    And what exactly do you do on the 
                    show?

                                  ROCKWELL
                          (is he serious?)
                    I m a judge.

                                  LASSITER
                    What kind of judge?

                                  ROCKWELL
                    Talent judge.  On camera.  I sit on 
                    the far left.

                    Really?

                                  ROCKWELL
                    Have you SEEN the show?

                                  LASSITER
                    A hundred times.  I m sure I would 
                    have remembered you.

                                  ROCKWELL
                    I can t believe this.  I was the 
                    FIRST person hired for this show.

                                  LASSITER
                    You re spinning yourself in 
                    circles, whoever you are.  Maybe 
                    you should go outside and rethink 
                    your story.

                                  ROCKWELL
                    What story?

                                  LASSITER
                    Exactly.

      McNab comes to the door, walks out a dumbfounded Rockwell.

                                  LASSITER (CONT D)
                    Keep an eye on that one.  Who s 
                    next?

      Enter Emilina Saffron, wearing one shoe.

                                  LASSITER (CONT D)
                    Great.  The Bride of Frankenstein.  
                    Have a seat.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - LATER

      Emilina sits down.

                                  EMILINA
                    Why am I here?

                                  LASSITER
                    Because you re the most obvious 
                    suspect.  You have the trailer next 
                    to Nigel s.  You hate him.  And you 
                    can t seem to account for your 
                      whereabouts for most of the last 
                    sixty days.

                                  EMILINA
                    Everybody hates Nigel.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   22.

                    And everybody lovesRaymond.  But 
                    everybody doesn t have a vacant 
                    sense of morality and an assault 
                    with a deadly weapon charge on 
                    their record.

                                  EMILINA
                    Please, that was just a publicity 
                    stunt.  It was a fork lift and I 
                    was drunk on a spray bottle of 
                    Charlie.

                                  LASSITER
                    I m gonna need some answers, some 
                    real answers, or you and I are 
                    gonna turn on the hot lights and 
                    see who cracks first.

                                  EMILINA
                    So now you re trying to seduce me?

                                  LASSITER
                    You know, I never thought I d make 
                    this sound in my lifetime, but--   
                    Eww.

      INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

    Gus and Shawn walk with Nigel down the hallway.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    You left me alone for half a day.

                                  SHAWN
                    We were at the police station. 

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    You ll never make it as bodyguards.

                                  GUS
                    We re not bodyguards.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    You ll never make it as anything.

    As they walk, Shawn quickly SHAWN VISIONS the hotel hallway: 
    the elevator door, a maid cart, the half-eaten food on the 
      service trays with little plastic swords in them.

      INT. NIGEL S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

      They enter.  The door opens.  A FOOD CART is waiting in the 
      room.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Oh, thank goodness, I m starving.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   23.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    My standing order.

    He lifts the silver food cover off, revealing a tuna 
      sandwich.  Shawn looks at it closely.

                                  SHAWN
                    Don t eat that.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Why not?

                                  SHAWN
                    I m sensing something about this 
                    sandwich.  It s--

                                  GUS
                          (smelling)
                    --delicious?

    He looks closer at the food.

                                  SHAWN
                    I was thinking  poisoned. 
                    It s not from the hotel kitchen.

      Nigel steps behind Gus nervously.

      INT. POLICE STATION - INTERIM CHIEF S OFFICE - NIGHT  

      Nigel, Shawn, and Gus wait in the Chief s office.  Lassiter 
      enters with a tox report.  Slaps it on the desk.

                                  LASSITER
                    Looks like Spencer was right.  
                    There were enough drugs to kill a 
                    Clydesdale in that tuna salad 
                    nicoise sandwich.

                                  ST. NIGEL 
                    See?  Your hotel detail couldn t 
                    handle one room.  

                                  LASSITER
                    Pardon me, I m not the target who s 
                    off ordering room service.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    It s a standing order!

                    Good plan.  Gus and I have more 
                    pressing issues.
                          (purposefully)
                    We need to rehearse.

      INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      They walk.

                                  GUS
                    How did you know that sandwich 
                    didn t come from the hotel kitchen? 

                                  SHAWN
                    Easy.  I saw the other sandwiches 
                    in the hall.  Each of them had 87 
                    sesame seeds.  Nigel s only had 83.

                                  GUS
                    Are you serious?

                                  SHAWN
                    No.  The other ones had plastic 
                    swords in them.  Please, Gus, I m 
                    not Rain Man.

                                  GUS
                    You sing like Rain Man.

      Lassiter comes out after them.

                                  LASSITER
                    Spencer.  You missed something.  We 
                    found prints.

                                  SHAWN
                    You re talking about fingers.

                    They belong to Emilina Saffron.  So 
                    did the drugs in the food.  I m 
                    getting a warrant.

      Shawn is actually a little surprised.

      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM B - LATER

      Emilina sits facing the glass.  She is half drunk.

                                  EMILINA
                    Hello?  Where am I?  Hello!  I need 
                    my bag!

      Lassiter enters calmly chewing on a toothpick.  From her POV, 
    he is out of focus.

                    Oh, Mr. Bean!  Thank God it s you.

                    And I need a confession. 

                                  EMILINA
                    All right.  I have a kid in

                    Now dial me up with that bag, Flat

      Emilina stares at Lassiter with the craziest eyes this side

    He comes into focus.  She smiles up at him.

                    Right now, you re disgusting me in

      Emilina s eyes widen like soup bowls.

                                  EMILINA
                    I need my saddle bag.

      Lassiter exits.  Emilina immediately begins to sweat and rubs 
    one of her eyebrows off.

      INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      Lassiter walks out.  Interim Chief Vick is waiting.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I don t know Detective...

                    Please tell me you re not buying 
                    this dog and pony show.  It s all

                    We ve made an arrest, but just to 
                    be safe, keep your eyes open.

                    Are you serious?  That s supposed 
                    to make me feel BETTER?

                    You ll be fine.

    He hangs up.  Now more paranoid than ever.  He tears open a 
    pop tart and opens a diet coke.  He dramatically breaks off a 
      corner and tries to take a bite but cannot... equally 
      dramatically tries to take a sip but cannot.  He throws the 
      snack against the wall.

      Distraught, he thinks some television might help calm his 
      nerves.  He can t turn it on -- it might explode after all. 
    He removes the batteries from the remote, takes the phone off 
    the hook and locks himself in the bathroom.

    C+C Music Factory (or something cheaper) blares from inside. 

      INT. PSYCH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Shawn and Gus -- sweaty and adorned in dance attire -- 
      attempt to keep up with an unusual routine of steps that date 
      back to the early 90 s.

      REVERSE to REVEAL that Juliet is leading the charge, counting 
    out beats and dressed like she s just been cast in a revival 
    of FAME.

      Shawn stops.  Gus stops a few beats later.  Together they 
      stand and stare with great uncertainty as Juliet finishes the 
      routine, lost in her own performance fantasy.  The song ends.  
      Shawn and Gus immediately snap into the final tableau before 
      Juliet turns around, drenched in sweat -- mascara running.

                                  SHAWN
                    Come on, Juliet, let it spill, we

      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM B - SAMEISH

      Emilina is shivering, drenched in cold medicinal sweat.  She 
    is banging on the two way glass, bordering on hysterics:

                                  EMILINA
                    I remember something!  I remember!  
                    Hurry up!  I m lucid!  Get in here, 
                    Errol Flynn!  And bring me my bag!

      Lassiter sits calmly on the other side of the glass, casually 
      eating a turkey sandwich with cheese and lettuce.

                                  EMILINA (CONT'D)
                    You hear me, Count Chocula?  Don t

      Lassiter jumps up and re-enters the room with his sandwich.

                    Took you long enough.  I m dying!

                    No!  That s the thing!  First of 
                    all, I can remember somebody 
                    getting into my bag yesterday.

                    Well, who was it?

                    Can t be sure.  Might have been a 
                    werewolf.  I thought I was 
                    dreaming.

                    Yeah.  And this morning I wasn t at 
                    the hotel!  I slept in the guard 
                    shack!  That makes me innocent!

                    We hook up sometimes.  I went to 
                    see if he was lonely -- it was a 
                    moment of weakness.

      Lassiter is not happy.  He begrudgingly leaves the room.

      INT. HENRY SPENCER S EAT-IN KITCHEN - LATER

      Nigel and the guys sit at the table.  Nigel s hair is freshly 
      styled and he sports an even plusher, thicker robe now.

                    Bold move.  Wearing another grown  
                    man s robe. 

      Henry enters from the patio with steaks.  Gus salivates.

                                  HENRY
                    All right gentlemen -- prepare to 
                    taste the most succulent, evenly 
                    marinated beef you have ever... is 
                    that my robe?

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    It is indeed, Horace.  And it s 
                    comforting me at an elite spa 
                    level.  I should also note that I 
                    am absolutely famished and that 
                    those filets smell promising.

      Henry grimaces at another man wearing his robe, but has other 
      issues at hand.

                                  HENRY

    Gus digs in and eats with vigor.  Henry puts Nigel s steak in

                                  GUS  
                    Is that... damn! 

    He gets up and crosses out.

                    sure I d start by using wood that 
                    had never drifted. 

                                  HENRY
                    All right that s it. 

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Already?  I m just getting started. 
                    I ve got a sonnet for each piece of 
                    fish paraphernalia and a soliloquy 
                    for the linoleum. 

                                  HENRY 
                    Well I ve got an ice cold can of 
                    whip ass in the fridge.

                                  SHAWN
                    It s actually diet whip ass.

    Gus crosses back with THREE BUTTERED COBS OF CORN.  Shawn 
      reaches for a cob.  Gus defends.

                                  GUS 
                    You must be out of your damn mind.

                                  SHAWN 
                    Dude, you have THREE full cobs.

      Shawn tries again.  Gus raises his hand high.

                                  GUS
                    I will slap you, Shawn.

    And then he fangs into a juicy cob of buttery corn.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Are you absolutely certain that 
                    this cow shoulder on my plate is 
                    dead?  That s all I m asking.

                                  HENRY
                    Off with the robe!  Wearing that 
                    robe is a privilege and you, pal, 
                    have lost it.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                      I steadfastly refuse.  It s the 
                    plushiest, most opulent robe I ve 
                    ever even been near.

                                  HENRY
                    Well that s one thing we can agree 
                    on.  Now give it up.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   34.

                    Dad, I m not sure you re thinking 
                    this through.

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn, for the last time...

                                  SHAWN
                    I m pretty sure he s going commando 
                    under there! 

      Shawn tries to sneak a cob -- Gus slaps his hand hard.

                                  GUS
                    Keep playin , Shawn.  Go ahead.

      Henry considers this.  Back to Nigel:

                                  HENRY
                    You wouldn t dare.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I m like an angel baby swaddled in 
                    a spool of cloud candy.

                                  HENRY
                    What kind of a sick bastard goes 
                    commando in another man s robe?

      Shawn stands, grabs Henry, pulls him aside.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    He s not staying here.  He violated 
                    basic robe code-- 

                                  SHAWN
                    Robe code violation.  Check.

                                  HENRY
                    Look, Shawn, there s a reason this 
                    guy is on the run.  He s been here 
                    ten minutes and even I want to kill 
                    him.

                                  SHAWN
                    That s the problem, Dad.  How do I 
                    protect him from EVERYBODY?

                                  HENRY
                    You already have a suspect in jail.

                                  SHAWN
                    There s no way it was her.  I 
                    wouldn t be surprised if she s 
                    already out, which leaves us with a 
                    hundred more good suspects and no 
                    way to narrow it down.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   35.

                    It s easy.  Tighten your focus.  
                    Who does he victimize the most?

      Shawn thinks this through.  Gus pops his head in, coming from 
    the kitchen.

                                  GUS
                    Is that cobbler in the fridge for 
                    everybody?

      INT. FOUR SEASONS - EMILINA S SUITE - SAME TIME

      Emilina enters her suite mumbling -- she has her bag back and 
      she s clearly less lucid now...

                                  EMILINA
                    Try to accuse me of attempted 
                    murder... uh-uh... not today.  No, 
                    sir. 

    She enters the bathroom and grabs a stick of deodorant.  As 
    she applies the antiperspirant OVER her clothing, she hears a 
      creak coming from the shower.

                                  EMILINA (CONT'D)
                    Nigel?  Is that you?  Boy, you 
                    better have some food in there.

      Emilina yanks open the curtain and as a blurred figure in all 
      black explodes from the tub and grabs her!  She kicks and 
      screams, thrashing about until a something from behind her 
      puts a cloth over her nose and her already impaired vision 
      FADES TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - NEXT MORNING

      Shawn and Gus approach with Nigel in tow.  There s a police 
      barricade waiting for them and Interim Chief Vick, dressed in 
      red, cuts them off at the pass.  She is joined by third judge 
      Rockwell and American Duos host Lester Beacon. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Chief!  You re a vision in 
                    cranberry. 

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. Spencer.  Mr. Burton.  I m 
                    afraid I ve got some unfortunate 
                    news.

      Nigel catches up.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK (CONT D)
                    Ah, Mr. St. Nigel.  There you are.  
                    You ll want to hear this as well. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus left his Airwolf windbreaker in 
                    the dressing room and it was 
                    accidentally set on fire?

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I wish.  Emilina Saffron was found 
                    in the bathroom of her hotel suite 
                    this morning.  She was clinging to 
                    life and has been rushed to St. 
                    Thomas of the Apostles.  Thus far 
                    all signs point to an overdose of 
                    some sort, but we are fully 
                      investigating the matter.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    How did she escape?  You must 
                    transport her to some prison 
                    hospital immediately.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. St. Nigel, Miss Saffron was 
                    released from custody last night 
                    when her alibi checked out.  She s 
                    the last person you should be 
                    worried about now.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    We have to cancel the show!

      Before Rockwell can speak, Lester chimes in.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   37.

                    Are you kidding?

    All heads turn to Lester s lack of sensitivity.

                                  BEACON (CONT D)
                    I don t want to seem insensitive, 
                    but this is the third time this 
                    season she s been in the ICU.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Not like this.  I won t go.  I m a 
                    sitting duck out there.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I personally will oversee the 
                    security detail, Mr. St. Nigel.

                                  BEACON
                    We ll all be out there together. 
                    You ll be fine.  Suck it up.
                          (checks his watch)
                    I m way late for my pilates. 

      Lester leaves.  Rockwell pats Nigel on the back and leaves. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Well, I suppose we should rehearse.

                    Not before I get a danish in my 
                    stomach.

      Shawn makes eye contact with Nigel -- his face is white as a 
      ghost.  He points to the Chief.

                                  SHAWN
                    She s the best of the best.  You 
                    want her on that wall.  You need 
                    her on that wall. 

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. Spencer --

      Shawn and Gus leave Nigel alone with Interim Chief Vick.  As 
      they walk off in the B.G., wesee them look back and then 
      veer out of frame in another direction.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK (CONT D)
                    Can I get you anything? 

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Are you really the chief of police?

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I really am.  Amazing, isn t it?

                    I m sorry.  It s just that you have 
                    such a calming presence.  You exude 
                    the callous exoskeleton of an 
                      authoritarian while simultaneously 
                    oozing a gentle kindness and a 
                    delicate yet complicated 
                      femininity. 

    She momentarily is at a loss for words -- bordering on 
      blushing.  Then she playfully smacks Nigel on the shoulder.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    You know I m married.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I m willing to share.

    The chief blushes in full.  Then shakes her head.  Nigel 
      knows he s rejected.

      INT. FOUR SEASONS - HALLWAY OUTSIDE EMILINA S SUITE - LATER

      Shawn and Gus creep along the wall towards the suite.

                    Lester Beacon sure didn t seem too

                    He sure didn t.  Plus, his hair...

                    Staying close to the wall doesn t

      Shawn stops.  Considers.

                    in that room because I m just about 
                    positive that Emilina didn t 
                    overdose and that foul play was 
                    involved.  I need to feel the lay 
                    of the land, channel what really 
                    happened in there.  We don t have a 
                    lot of time because we have to make 
                    it back to the convention center in 
                    time to win the competition and, to 
                    be completely honest, Gus is 
                    prepared to challenge you to an old 
                    fashioned donnybrook if you don t 
                    cooperate.

      Buzz reaches into his pocket and pulls out two pairs of latex 
      gloves -- hands them to the guys.

                                  BUZZ 
                    I used to have the biggest crush on 
                    Emilina -- you know, back in high 
                    school -- before she started eating 
                    glue and what not -- I d love to 
                    think that she didn t try to, you 
                    know -- do that to herself.

                    That makes three of us, buddy.          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   40.


      INT. FOUR SEASONS - EMILINA S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Shawn continues his investigation into the bathroom and turns 
    on the light.

                                  GUS
                    What are we looking for?

                                  SHAWN
                    Beats me.

      Shawn carefully analyzes every inch of the bathroom -- it 
      couldn t be more pristine except for a rug scrunched up where 
      Emilina was found.  Nothing. 

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    Damn.  The whole place is clean.  
                    Let s go.

    He turns the light off and catches a tiny sparkle out of the 
      corner of his eye as he turns to go. 

      SHAWN VISION: The beam of sunlight coming in through the 
      window is reflecting off something in the toilet creating a 
      tiny prism on the ceiling. 

      Shawn turns the light back on.  Not visible. 

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    Huh.

    He gets on his knees and looks into the bowl. 

      SHAWN VISION: Sure enough, there at the bottom, about a 
      centimeter from being flushed away forever, is a single 
      translucent bead.  Like a fake diamond -- possibly crystal. 

      FLASHBACK! Shawn talking Bevin Rennie Llywellen at the 
      convention center -- noticing the very unusual string of 
      beads around his neck.  Cha-ching.

    Gus re-enters the bathroom, Shawn still over the bowl.

                                  GUS
                    That s what you get for drinking 
                    whole milk, Shawn.

                    I have bones like granite.  And 
                    look at this.  We got ourselves a 
                    clue.

      INT. FOUR SEASONS - HALLWAY OUTSIDE EMILINA S SUITE - LATER

      Juliet rushes to the scene.  Shawn and Gus are waiting 
      outside the room.

                                  JULIET

      Shawn waits, McNab is relieved of his position outside 
      Emilina s door.

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    That McNabis a real bulldog.  He

      INT. BATHROOM - LATER

      Shawn is having a psychic moment.  Eyes closed.  He leads 
      Juliet to the toilet.

                                  SHAWN
                    And I feel it... right.... there.

    He opens his eyes.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    That came from your attacker.

    Her eyes go wide.  Impressed.

                                  JULIET
                    Attackers.  Plural.  Emilina s 
                    bruises suggest she was assaulted 
                    by two people. 

      Shawn and Gus steal a look.

                                  SHAWN
                    I need to speak with Emilina right 
                    away.

                                  JULIET
                    She s mostly comatose, Shawn.

                                  SHAWN
                    We probably won t know the 
                      difference.

      Juliet bags the bead and heads out.  The guys wait for her to 
      exit and do some excited jumping.

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    Dude, that bead was on --

      INT. ST. THOMAS OF THE APOSTLES - EMILINA S ROOM - LATER

      Lassiter is bedside, holding Emilina s hand.  She appears to 
    be comatose, her mouth hangs open and she s missing an 
      eyebrow.

                    Why is Spencer here?

      Shawn puts a pineapple with a bow on Emilina s window sill.

                    She was my favorite judge.  We all

                    Not yet.  But I ll be right here 
                    when she does, I can tell you that.

      Lassie gently strokes Emilina s hair. 

                                  SHAWN
                    That s... very gentle.

                      I misjudged her -- she was 
                    innocent, crying out for help in 
                    her own sad and potentially disease-
                    ridden way.  I cut her off at the 
                    arms.  Judged the book by it s 
                    filthy, loathsome cover.

                                  SHAWN
                    Well, if it makes you feel any 
                    better I don t think she did this 
                    to herself.

                                  LASSITER
                    Neither do I.  What makes you --

      With this, Emilina s eyes shoot open.  She slaps Lassiter.

                                  EMILINA
                    Somebody s watching me!

      Lassiter shakes off the blow --

                                  LASSITER
                    It s okay, baby.  I m right here.

      Shawn and Juliet look at each other.  Baby?

                      Somebody s... watching... me....

    And with that she slips back into her coma-like state.  Shawn 
      closes his eyes and grabs Emilina s hand.

                                  SHAWN

      INT. PSYCH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

    Gus is firmly planted in front of his computer.  On screen is 
      footage of Bevin Rennie Llywellen (wearing his crystal beads) 
    -- on stage -- singing BADLY.  The phone rings.  Gus pauses 
    the image.  SPLIT SCREEN w/ Shawn on his cell at the

                    found him.  I knew there was 
                    something familiar about him.  He s 
                    been at every stage of the

                    He was singing badly on purpose

    The light bulb goes off for Gus.  He starts looking for

      INT. CONVENTION CENTER - 37 MINUTES, TWO DONUTS LATER

      Rehearsal is coming to a close.  The final duo (except for 
      Shawn and Gus), Chance and Rance Cade, are singing something 
      country-ish.  They wear 12.5 gallon cowboy hats.

      Nigel sits feverishly, flanked by Rockwell and Interim Chief 
      Vick.  He s watching everything but the rehearsal -- the 
      rafters, the doors, anything electrical, Lester Beacon. 

      BANG!  Shawn and Gus explode onto the stage, Gus stumbling 
    and knocking over a bass drum.  Nigel hits the deck, cowering 
      behind Chief Vick.

                                  CHANCE CADE

                    NIGEL!

      Nigel slowly rises from beneath the table.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I, er... dropped some items.

                                  SHAWN
                    Chief -- so glad you re here.  I 
                    know who s been trying to kill 
                    Nigel...

                                  GUS
                    And who tried to take out Emilina!

      Beat.  Everyone looks at Gus.  Beat.  Oops.

                                  SHAWN
                    AND WHO TRIED TO TAKE OUT EMILINA!

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. Spencer, last I checked Emilina 
                    overdosed on her own prescription 
                      medication...

                                  SHAWN
                    That s what Bevin Rennie Llywellen 
                    wanted you to think.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK 
                    That s really his name?

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    He s the wankerthat auditioned in 
                    every city.

      FLASHBACK!

      Bevin, dressed as a hotel employee, poisoning the sandwich 
      before it made its way up to Nigel s room.

      Then, dressed in all black, attacking Emilina in her bathroom 
    and putting her to sleep -- but NOT before a slight struggle 
      where Emilia was able to rip off his string of crystal beads, 
      sending one into the depths of the commode.

                                  SHAWN (V.O.)
                    Just another slice of deception.  
                    He can actually sing like a bird -- 
                    but if you heard THAT he wouldn t 
                    have to re-audition in every city 
                    on the tour -- every city that you 
                    nearly died in Nigel.  When her 
                    head started to clear he tried to 
                    silence her for good...

                    all together.

    END FLASHBACK

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Put what together?

      FLASHBACK!  EMILINA S POV!

      Bevin rifling through Emilina s bag o   goodies  while she 
      lays in the parking lot booth.  One eye opens as she looks up 
    at him, smiling wanly.  He s wearing a concert tee shirt -- 
    the image is blurry -- Emilina s in a haze. 

    END FLASHBACK!

      Almost on cue, Lassiter and Juliet enter the back of the 
      auditorium with Bevin in custody.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    And who might this be, detectives?

                                  JULIET
                    Meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

                                  LASSITER 
                    Emmy s gonnabe okay.  She s out of 
                    her coma and she remembered this 
                    guy as the man who attacked her...

      Juliet offers up a very important piece of evidence -- the 
      single crystal bead in an evidence bag.

                                  JULIET
                    This bead puts him at the scene of 
                    the crime. 

      Shawn smiles.  The Chief is still skeptical.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    So he made an attempt on Emilina s 
                    life -- allegedly poisoned a tuna 
                    sandwich--

                                  LASSITER
                    Tuna Nicoise, Chief.
                          (looks to Juliet)
                    There s a difference.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    -- what about all the other near 
                    misses with Nigel?

                    He couldn t have done it -- it s 
                      impossible.  He was just a 
                    contestant -- 

                                  GUS
                    Sounds like he had somebody on the 
                    inside...

      Shawn approaches the judge s table.

                                  SHAWN
                    But he had somebody on the inside.

      FLASHBACK!  That same shot of Bevin rifling through Emilina s 
    bag -- the IMAGE ON HIS TEE SHIRTslowly comes into focus as 
      Emilina squints and smiles a goofy smile:

      It s Rockwell s spooked face... and the words  Somebody s 
      Watching Me! 

    END FLASHBACK!

                    Didn t he, Rockwell?

      Nigel bursts into laughter.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Oh don t be ridiculous.  Rockwell 
                    adores me -- plus he can t even 
                    think.  It must be someone else -- 
                    what about Lester?  I d love to see 
                    him go to prison.

                                  SHAWN
                    Bevin is Rockwell s biggest fan.   
                    He runs the only fan site 
                    Rockwell s ever had on the 
                    internet.

      FLASHBACK - to what Gus saw on his computer in the office.  
      Rockwell s fan club.  The site managed by B.R. Llywellen.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    They actually became pretty good 
                    friends... and I don t think this 
                    show has provided the type of 
                    comeback either of them were hoping 
                    for... 

      Rockwell lowers his head.

      FLASHBACK!  Rockwell coordinating with Bevin, giving him 
      access passes, call sheets, carefully and methodically 
      plotting different attacks.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   49.

                    I could keep going... but I m happy 
                    to give you the floor.

      Nigel is absolutely shocked and appalled.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    What s he going to say?  He can t 
                    speak!

      Rockwell looks up, then stands up, then explodes:

                                  ROCKWELL
                    Yes, I can!  You just don t let me!  
                    I was the first to sign on!  This 
                    was supposed to be my show!  My 
                    shot!  My comeback!  You turned me 
                    into a simp!  I am not your dog, 
                    dawg.  People don t even know who I 
                    am!  I get fan letters addressed to 
                    Jodeciand El Debarge.  You ruined 
                      everything!  Why won t you DIE????

    And Rockwell lunges at Nigel and attempts to choke him.  
      Nigel recoils.  Interim Chief Vick snaps into action and has 
      Rockwell cuffed in a matter of seconds.  Nigel looks at her 
      with pure adoration in his eyes.  He pauses.  Takes this all 
    in.  Looks at Rockwell as they finish cuffing him.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    That was your plan?  Really?  
                    That s the poorest executed attack 
                    in history.  I was TWO FEET from 
                    you the whole time!  You are 
                      absolutely, without doubt, the 
                    worst murderer I ve ever seen!

      INT. CONVENTION CENTER - LATER - SHOWTIME

      Shawn and Gus are on stage, performing the last bit of their 
      rendition of SHOUT by Tears For Fears.  Shawn is a dead 
      ringer for Roland Orzabaland Gus is kicking it with some old 
      school MJ.The crowd is eating them up.

      Juliet watches from the wings as they end the song and NAIL 
    the dying, Wilting Robot.  She exalts.  Shawn and Gus are 
      quite pleased. 

    The applause ends and Lester Beacon joins the guys.

                                  BEACON
                    Give it up for Shawn Spence Starr, 
                    and Guster T.T.Showbizz!

    The crowd roars again.

                                  LESTER BEACON
                    Let s see what our judges 
                    thought...

      REVERSE and REVEAL Nigel.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    That was... without question... the 
                    most REVOLTING thing I ever seen in 
                    my life that didn t involve natural 
                    child birth.  Are you kidding me? 
                    You re like a couple of rodeo 
                    clowns up there -- nothing was in 
                    sync, your hairstyles are 
                      ridiculous... you butchered a 
                    terrific song and it s time you 
                    went home.  Please spare us the 
                    additional torture and just 
                      euthanizeyourselves...

      Shawn and Gus are stunned --

                                                                  AND WE FADE OUT
