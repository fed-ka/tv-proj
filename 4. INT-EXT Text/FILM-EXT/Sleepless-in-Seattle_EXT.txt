Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.
Sam's hand is on
his shoulder.
As the mourners go past and each takes a
turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --
SAM
If we start asking why we'll go
crazy.
So, rule number one.
We don't ask why.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON ANNIE REED
Pretty, blonde, animated.
Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore
Orioles hat.
ANNIE
Why? I just want to know why?
That's my first rule.
I always
ask why.
Come on.
Tell me.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
And pull back to reveal:
Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy
named SETH.
They're carrying packing boxes into the
house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.
The same stunning architecture in the b.g.
They go up
the back wooden staircase to the house.
SETH
There's no why, Annie.
I'm
just not up for it.
I never
said I was.
ANNIE
Is there somebody else?
SETH
Nope.
ANNIE
You don't love me, is that it?
SETH
Nope.
Follow them into:
Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.
It's a
gorgeous day for a game.
They high-five each other.
ROB (V.O.)
Where you going to go?
And cut back to:
The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for
instructions.
And now they both start to take off.
In opposite
directions.
And we pull back back back back as the planes take off,
one flying east, the other flying west.
And further and further back as they soar into the air
and leave the frame.
The night sky.
Stars twinkle.
And now tilt down to see the United States.
It looks
like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by
Saul Steinberg.
A light goes on in Baltimore.
A light goes on in Seattle.
They are the only lights on the map.
As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER
JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.
They're
carrying an armful of Christmas presents.
They're
walking toward the parking lot.
WALTER
The short one with black hair
is your cousin Irene --
ANNIE
-- who's married to --
WALTER
Harold, who ran away with his
secretary but came back --
ANNIE
-- because Irene threatened to
put the dog to sleep if he
didn't --
WALTER
And your brother Tom is a
psychology professor and is
married to...Betsy --
ANNIE
-- who is the most competitive
woman in the world --
They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and
pull out together.
Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in
front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park
their cars.
They get out assembling presents.
WALTER
Your Uncle Milton lost all his
money in a Puerto Rican
condominium that went belly up,
don't mention the IRS or the
Federal prison system.
Your
mother is Barbara, your father
is Cliff --
ANNIE
I hope he doesn't get out his
slides.
WALTER
Am I what they had in mind?
ANNIE
They're going to love you.
As they start toward the house.
CUT TO:
CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.
AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on
the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.
ANNIE
They loved you.
I told you
they would love you and they
did.
WALTER
I love you.
ANNIE
I love you, Walter.
(beat)
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?
WALTER
Nope.
ANNIE
Even when you were young?
WALTER
Nope.
Not even when I was
young.
It's starting to rain.
WALTER
You sure you don't want to
drive with me?
ANNIE
How will I get back to
Baltimore Saturday?
(remembering something)
Oh God, I forgot my present for
your stepmother -- I took it
inside by accident.
WALTER
I'll wait.
ANNIE
Don't be silly.
I'll just be
ten minutes behind you.
As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.
Raining.
As the car drives along.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
JONAH (V.O.)
I've been pretty sad, but I
think my dad is worse.
As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
We've been talking to -- well,
let's just call him Sleepless
in Seattle, and we'll be right
back after this break with
listener response, your
response, to the things we've
been discussing.
The number to
call is...
As Annie gets into her car.
STREET - NIGHT
Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents
live.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
Do you think there's somebody
out there you could love as
much as your wife? Maybe even
more?
SAM (V.O.)
It's hard to imagine.
And cut back and forth between the car and the
houseboat.
Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but
Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.
Sam is stroking
the boy's hair.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
What are you going to do, Sam?
SAM
I don't know.
When I met my
wife, it was so clear.
I just
knew.
Annie is listening now.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
What was it that made you know?
SAM
I don't think I could really
describe it.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
Why not?
SAM
And if I could describe it,
it probably wouldn't be on a radio
show.
(he laughs to himself)
But what the hell.
It's not
one specific thing.
It's more
of a feeling.
(continued)
Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in
Washington, D.C., the motor running.
She's hooked now,
she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it
all.
SAM
You touch her for the first
time, and suddenly... you're
home.
It's almost like...
ANNIE
Magic.
SAM
Magic.
CLOSER ON ANNIE
realizing she has just said this.
Realizing that it
must mean something but not knowing what.
SHE'S CRYING.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
Well, it's time to wrap up,
folks --
A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which
Annie doesn't notice.
She's wiping the tears away with
her hand.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
We hope you'll call again soon.
The figure TAPS on the window --
WALTER
(muffled, outside car)
Annie?
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
... and let us know how it's
going.
-- and taps again.
WALTER
Annie?
She turns.
He's pointing at the locked door.
She
searches for the button.
Finally finds it so that
Walter can open the door.
ANNIE
I'm sorry, Walter.
I just
heard the most amazing thing on
the radio.
They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie
carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.
ANNIE
People call up these shows and
you can't believe the stuff
they say.
It's the end of
privacy as we know it, this
country is just one big global
village with everyone out there
going blah blah blah --
As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see
a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.
CUT TO:
A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS
as we pull back to reveal:
As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his
tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new
plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam
takes his picture.
Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he
made in woodworking class.
SAM
The hopes are perfect --
beautiful, identical, smooth --
and they are for something
really amazing I feel it in my
bones --
JONAH
It's a spice rack.
SAM
We desperately need a spice
rack.
Desperately.
CUT TO:
Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.
SAM
How many people do you think
heard that thing last night?
JONAH
It plays in 50 states.
SAM
What?!
JONAH
Nobody else is going to know it
was us.
SAM
You're right.
(after a beat)
You better hope so.
Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying
to catch up.
BECKY
What was that about up there?
ANNIE
What was what?
BECKY
What's with you?
ANNIE
Nothing's with me.
A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle
newspaper, and
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old
house that's being renovated.
Jonah, who is playing
Cameboy, is walking along with him.
WORKMEN are active
everywhere.
Dry wall going up, cabinets being
installed, tile being set.
One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him,
and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for
them in an unfinished doorframe.
Bob is hefty, older,
always eating something dietetic.
Jay is younger and
always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.
BOB LANGMAN
Now she wants a circular
stairwell off the den.
JAY
(to Jonah, in b.g.)
Punch me, punch in right here.
(points to his stomach;
Jonah punches)
And she wants the Sub-Zero with
the side-by-side doors --
BOB
Which means --
SAM
The cabinets have to be redone
--
They all nod at each other.
The woman has been a
nightmare.
BOB
So we thought --
JAY
Since you're on the make again
--
Sam looks at Jonah --
SAM
Great.
This is great.
The
whole town knows.
Just out of
curiosity, how do you two know?
BOB
Grace heard it.
SAM
Grace the dispatcher.
Great.
BOB
The point is, take the client
out to dinner and ask her to
marry you and then maybe we
won't have to redo the kitchen
cabinets.
SAM
Why me? What about Jay?
JAY
Hey, my plate is full.
SAM
Well, okay.
What's the big
deal?
If she'll forget the
new fireplace, I'll marry her.
Just point me in the right
direction.
JONAH
Dad, I don't know about this
one --
SAM
Oh, you're changing your mind
--
JONAH
No, I'm not, but --
SAM
What's the matter with this
one? Wouldn't you like to have
Imelda Marcos as your mother?
JONAH
Dad --
Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.
SAM
We better take the measurements
for the new cabinets.
He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.
and
starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in
another area of the site.
Bob follows after him.
Jay
tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into
the wall.
BOB
Sam, if you're not doing
anything New Year's --
obviously you're not doing
anything New Year's -- we're
having some people over, all of
them married, not one even
remotely interested in playing
around.
Does that sound great
or what?
(whistfully)
I can't think of the last time
I was at a party when anything
actually happened.
SAM
Thanks, but I'll pass.
It's
kind of a big night.
I don't
like to leave Jonah alone.
CUT TO:
SHOT OF
HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A
SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT
Jonah watching it.
Sam visible in the distance in the
kitchen.
Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over
his face.
A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the
front door of the houseboat.
Jonah is signing a receipt
for the mail.
JONAH
Look at this, Dad.
They're
all for you --
Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.
It's
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.
Marcia
Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.
He's
stunned.
As he signs the receipt:
MAILMAN
If you're having trouble
sleeping, you might want to try
drinking a glass of water from
the other side.
JONAH
I thought that was for hiccups.
MAILMAN
Does it work for hiccups?
JONAH
For hiccups, a spoonful of
sugar, you hold it in your
mouth for a minute.
MAILMAN
Really?
The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.
Sam and Jonah start toward the door.
As Annie starts to run down the street.
CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING
And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running
down.
Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.
Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.
And another: Your feet are cold.
And another: Will you find love.
And another: Before you're cold?
And another: Burma Shave.
And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running
across a map of the United States -- it's a little like
the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's
like the famous map of the United States by Saul
Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one
is about Seattle.
In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two
indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.
They start
to wave at her, very slowly.
Annie's eyes widen.
CUT TO:
We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the
Peabody Library.
Annie gets out of the car.
Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the
street.
JAY
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda
... She's a weightlifter, but
it's not like her neck is
bigger than her head or
anything --
SAM
I'm not asking you to set me
up, Jay.
That's not what I
need your help for.
I want to
know what it's like over there.
JAY
And that's what I'm trying to
tell you.
What women are
looking over, okay? Pecs and a
cute butt.
SAM
You mean, like, "He has the
cutest butt"? Where did I hear
that recently?
JAY
Everywhere.
You can't even
turn on the news without
hearing about how some babe
thought some guy's butt was
cute.
Who the first babe to
say this was I don't know,
but it caught on.
Sam coming home.
AS MUSIC CONTINUES.
Annie waves as Becky gets into her
car and rides away.
Annie turns to her doorway and
stops.
She can't go back in.
She needs to walk and
think.
She crosses the street into a little
neighborhood park.
We can see the moon.
CUT TO:
Sam comes out onto the porch.
Flops down in his deck
chair.
The city lights in the background.
Same moon.
The MUSIC CONTINUES.
CUT TO:
Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.
MUSIC CONTINUES.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON SAM
CLOSE ON ANNIE
AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING
As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled
out of.
Annie starts toward him.
A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT
Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late
tonight, blackbird, bye bye.
FADE IN:
Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in
downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.
Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-
chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.
The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All
major credit cards accepted." And then everything on
the sign is translated into Spanish.
JONAH
Dad!
SAM
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson
is the greatest.
JONAH
It's a sign.
SAM
Oh, right.
Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back
into the house.
SAM
Come here.
I want to show you
something.
They're standing at the rail, talking.
Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware
that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.
VICTORIA
Is he there?
SAM
(turning back)
No.
(beat)
After he was born, every time
we started to make love, he
would cry.
He had an uncanny
sense of timing.
We really
shouldn't do anything here
anyway.
VICTORIA
Absolutely.
Right.
And she moves in to kiss him.
ON JONAH
Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the
coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a
kiss.
JONAH
Oh God, it's major.
He's
kissing her on the lips.
I
have to stop this.
ON BROOM CLOSET
ANNIE
(muffled)
Come on, Jonah --
BECKY (V.O.)
Do something --
ON JONAH
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
Jonah, you can't butt in here.
JONAH
Yes, I can.
He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.
CUT TO:
ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.
SHE SCREAMS.
It's Walter.
WALTER
Miss Scarlett.
In the broom
closet.
With the radio.
ANNIE
(to Becky)
I gotta go.
I'll see you at
work.
(she hangs up, turns
off radio)
Walter, you scared me.
Don't
ever do that again.
Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.
As Jonah opens the
mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF
BRAKES.
It's Sam's car.
SAM
(angry)
Get in the car right this
minute.
Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.
JESSICA
I'll call you later.
Jonah gets in.
As the car drives off.
SAM (V.O.)
Don't open your mouth again.
Ever.
And pull back to reveal:
As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a
dinner.
WALTER
Couldn't you just do a phone
interview?
ANNIE
Not for the kind of place I
want to do.
I won't be in
Chicago that long.
WALTER
When you get back, I'll be
gone --
ANNIE
And then I'll see you in New
York --
WALTER
Okay, okay.
A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the
winter sky.
As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.
As
she gets in and starts the car.
Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring
continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger
seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.
Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the
Baldwins' marina.
She stops, blocking the driveway to
the marina.
ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR
checking the map.
Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.
She looks
into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in
their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into
their driveway.
Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and
speeds away, tires squealing.
Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.
ON ANNIE
watching.
She's at a safe distance, across the street
and down some from the marina entrance.
She watches it
for a moment, then gains courage.
She starts to cross
the street to enter the dock.
Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.
Nervously.
Goes up
to the door.
Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.
No
response.
Let down, she's just about to walk away when
she hears a motor REV UP.
Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots
Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy.
Annie races back to her car, jumps in and follows the
boat along the seashore drive.
As we see Annie driving along the water as Sam and Jonah
chug along in the water.
They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken
clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.
They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of
skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.
ON ANNIE
checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANNIE'S POV - ON SAM AND JONAH - LATER
They're throwing a football.
Jonah catches it and
starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and
feinting.
Sam tackles him and they tumble together on
the beach.
CLOSE ON ANNIE
watching.
The purity and innocence of this little scene
-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more
than she ever could have imagined.
Their LAUGHTER
filters up to her.
Right to her heart.
ANNIE (V.O.)
I watched him play with his son
at the beach.
Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.
Sam's van pulls into a parking space.
Jonah in the
front with Sam.
They're diagonally across a four-lane
street.
ON SAM AND JONAH
As they start to get groceries out of the car.
Annie watching.
This is it.
No chickening out this time.
She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole
thing.
It's now or never.
Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.
Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and
rightness with every step.
But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:
SUZY
who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at
the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide --
beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose
boys have just come back from the front.
Sam and Jonah
are overjoyed to see her.
Jonah breaks into a run,
nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings
up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped
when he started running.
ON ANNIE
She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.
In shock.
The scene in front of her is too horrible to
bear.
ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA
Sam catches up.
Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious
than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam
and hugs them both.
ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.
SAM
God, it's wonderful to see you.
Where's Greg?
SUZY
He's over at the boat show.
He'll be by later.
(she looks around)
It's so beautiful here.
ANNIE
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about
this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the
middle of the street.
A car HORN blares at her... all
she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.
She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --
A TAXICAB
coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.
Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van
bearing down from the opposite direction.
She steps
back to the middle line.
The cab goes into a skid.
Annie freezes.
Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.
The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.
Annie screams.
The cab stops inches from her body.
The van in the
other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.
ON SAM
responding.
He runs from the gate toward the near-
accident.
ON THE CAB DRIVER
getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the
sidewalk.
DRIVER
Lady, what the hell are you
doing?
Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster,
hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.
Stunned, she
turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.
Their
eyes meet.
Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw
in the airport.
SAM
Hello.
ANNIE
Hello.
Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything
that's happened, bolts for her car.
Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is
coming past and he can't cross the street.
Annie gets
into her car, starts and pulls away.
Sam stands there,
deflated.
ANNIE (V.O.)
How could I have been such an
idiot?
Becky's car driving toward Annie's house.
BECKY
You were standing in the middle
of the street?
As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car.
BECKY
And what did you say?
Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the
door.
ANNIE
All I could think of to say was
hello.
CUT TO:
"AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER" ON THE TELEVISION SET.
DEBORAH
KERR IS SAYING: "ALL I COULD THINK OF TO SAY WAS HELLO."
And pull back to reveal:
A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop
windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts,
lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral
arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young
ladies selling perfume.
A red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk,
and pull back to reveal:
Annie steps out of a cab.
And pull back to reveal that it's a shot from "An Affair
To Remember."
And pull back to reveal:
- DAY
formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in
pink light and spotlighted in white.
Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples
mostly -- looking in the windows.
Each one a variation
on the heart motif.
They move to a window -- "Broken
Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out
of the wound in the middle.
ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION
in the Broken Heart window.
They're both in their own worlds.
Then they both start
to speak at once.
They stop.
Annie looks at Walter.
ANNIE
You go.
WALTER
Ever since Christmas, you've
been different.
Kind of
distracted, distant.
But I
feel like you're coming back
from wherever you were.
ANNIE
I am.
(she smiles at him)
I was just... I just got... I
think I got nervous.
It's
normal, right? Don't you ever
feel nervous about, you know?
WALTER
What?
ANNIE
About forever.
WALTER
No.
ANNIE
Well, I did.
And you know what
I think? I think that it was
almost... too perfect.
- DAY
As they start down the street and go off into the
distance.
ANNIE
(continuing)
Promise me something, Walter.
Promise me you will never have
a surprise party for me.
Ever.
You know what happens, you walk
in the door in some horrible
sweater you put on that morning,
and there are hundreds of people
in their best clothes shouting
"Surprise!"
As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat.
We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle
bus.
The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to
"Marina."
Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his
Mariners backpack.
He just stands there a beat, looking
around.
Then he goes through the glass doors.
As his car takes the airport exit.
Jonah stands in a taxi line.
It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.
CABBIE'S VOICE
There it is.
We are watching from:
As Sam rushes out of the terminal.
Desperate.
A cab pulls up.
Sam bolts to the head of the line and
muscles his way into the cab.
The other people in line
are irate.
SAM
Sorry, this is an emergency.
The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.
SAM (V.O.)
Empire State Building.
Looking down on the observation deck.
The city below.
The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the
deck.
Looks around.
Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan,
heading for the Empire State Building.
A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.
And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is
actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:
NIGHT
Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.
He turns
around, forlorn.
He takes off his backpack and is about
to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the
observation deck.
Jonah leaps into his arms.
SAM
You're my family.
You're all
I've got.
What if something
happened to you?
Sam's eyes well up.
Jonah starts to cry.
SAM
What if I couldn't get to you?
JONAH
I was scared of what you were
gonna do.
SAM
When I found you?
JONAH
If I didn't go.
SAM
Listen, have I ever done
anything really stupid?
JONAH
No.
SAM
I mean, so far, have I screwed
it up for you?
JONAH
No.
The two of them hold each other tight.
After a beat:
SAM
I can't believe you flew first
class.
JONAH
It was all they had.
As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.
As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.
Annie's cab stuck in traffic.
As Annie gets out of the cab.
She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State

The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States
spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.
And
FADE OUT
