      SOARING over verdant mountains, lush countryside... we think 
      we re looking at the Hawaiian landscape, until we crest a

                      operating.

      MUSIC -- MOMENTUM -- soldiers break to their vehicles and

                    to Naples, Victor s last known 
                    location.  Let s move -- 

      When Anton s led out, he and McGarrett lock eyes: mutual 
      hatred.  Anton s placed into the Stryker.  McGarrett climbs 
      in behind him -- rear ramp CLOSES -- the caravan pulls away --

      SOARING over the highway as the MILITARY MOTORCADE chews road 
      -- in column, Stryker number 2 --     

      INT. M1126 STRYKER INFANTRY CARRIER VEHICLE ICV - DAY

      McGarrett sits across from Hesse and two MP s. 

      And now, a word about our hero: If you d ask McGarrett s 
      Naval Instructors at Annapolis for a recommendation, they d 
      say he s the best man for the job, only sometimes you don't 
      want the best man if he won't listen to a word you say.  

      Anton just STARES at him with a strange expression:

                                  ANTON
                    You don't look Hawaiian.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 3.

      For all his cool, that catches McGarrett off guard: how does 
      Anton know he s Hawaiian?  As he leans in, dark, quiet: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You re gonna tell us everything.

                                  ANTON
                    You were born there, right?

                      MCGARRETTANTON

                                                    homework on you?

      And then McGarrett s cell RINGS -- HARSH -- SUDDEN.  He 
      checks caller ID:  DAD .  

                                  ANTON (CONT D)
                    You should really answer that... 
                    you don t talk to your father often 
                    enough.

      Fear grips McGarrett s heart.  What the hell is this?  Anton 
      gestures, almost casual:  Answer.   Finally, he does -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Dad...

                    You all right?

      INT. MCGARRETT HOME - HONOLULU, HAWAII - DAY

      We re TIGHT on the bruised and bloody face of JAMES McGARRETT 
      (sixties, ex Honolulu PD), phone pressed to his ear -- along 
      with the BARREL of a CZECH-MADE CZ-TT .45 PISTOL:

                    people, Ste--?

      -- now the phone s pulled away by VICTOR HESSE (mid-
      thirties), the man we saw in the briefing -- Anton's even 
      deadlier brother -- and we WIDEN to reveal James bound to a 
      chair in the kitchen:

                                  HESSE
                    Now I know where you get it from --

                    Can I call you  Steve ?  Steve: I m 
                    offering you a trade.  Your father 
                    for my brother.   

      Steve s eyes SNAP UP to meet Anton s across from him -- maybe 
      three feet away -- just grinning a big, fat  eat shit  grin.  

                                  HESSE (CONT D)
                    All things considered, I d say it s 
                    more than generous, wouldn t you?

      McGarrett -- MOTION -- grabs a PAD from his cargo pocket and 
      scribbles a NOTE: 

      "CONTACT THE TOC, SEND HONOLULU PD TO MY FATHER S HOUSE NOW  

      -- TEARS it off, hands it to an MP, who hands it to the 
      VEHICLE COMMANDER -- the Commander looks at the note, 
      confused -- McGARRETT SNAPS HIS FINGERS URGENTLY:  Fucking do 
      it!!  -- the Commander accesses the FBCB2 digital comm 
      system, quickly sending the message via text --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You know how this works: even if I

      Little relief -- McGarrett -- mind racing -- knows he s gotta 
      try something else -- anything -- switches gears:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Alright, look... look... don t do

      convoy in GRAYTONE and WHITE HOT SPOTS. Eltsin grabs a 
      WALKIE, MURMURS to someone on the other line as McGarrett 
      keeps talking to Hesse:

      INT. M1126 STRYKER INFANTRY CARRIER VEHICLE - INTERCUTTING:

                    Give me the phone.  

      Hesse looks over at JAMES in the chair, pleading:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Please.  I can get him to help you.

      Hesse considers -- his eyes shoot to Eltsin, who mouths:  30 
      SECONDS...  Hesse Puts the gun and phone next to James' face 
      again -- the old man wracked with fear, yeah, but something 
      MORE: an insane GUILT he's been shouldering for a lifetime:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)

                    I love you, Son. 

      McGarrett is STRUCK.  Words he has rarely, if ever, heard 
      from this man:

      Eltsin signals:  10 SECONDS...   James stares right down the 
      barrel of Hesse s gun -- heartbroken, scared, but STRONG: 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)

      But the line is DEAD.  McGARRETT SHAKING -- FURY -- THEN: 
      Sound of ROTORS THUMPING.  McGarrett looks up at Anton, who 
      says -- simply:

                    Boom.

      The two lock eyes.  Anton just fucking GRINNING -- loving 
      every second of this.

      As it passes over the bomblets, the Stryker s ARMOR ATTRACTS

      We re CLOSE on McGarrett -- dazed -- as he starts to pick 
      himself up -- CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM and as we REORIENT, now 
      realizing he s UPSIDE DOWN -- the roof of the Stryker has 
      become the floor -- 

      McGARRETT S POV -- BLURRING IN AND OUT: We see people getting 
      out of their cars, disoriented -- running scared -- and then 
      he sees the EXTRACTION SOLDIERS LAND around the vehicle -- 

      McGarrett reaches for Anton, grabs his flex cuffs and TORQUES 
      his wrist -- Anton WINCES -- McGarrett SHOUTS to his men: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    MOVE OUT!  TAKE POINT, I GOT HIM! 

      -- he grabs an M-4 out of the weapons rack as -- 

      EXT. M1126 STRYKER - ROAD - CONTINUOUS

      The three Extraction Soldiers move in on the Stryker --  
      WHAM: the back ramp flies open as McGarrett, his Driver, the 
      vehicle commander and the two MP s leap out, GUNS BLAZING.  
      As the MP s bound toward an outcropping of rocks, they re 
      SHREDDED -- the Vehicle Commander makes it and lays down 
      suppressive fire, killing one of the Extraction Team Members:

      CLOSE ON McGARRETT, crouched behind the downed Stryker -- 

      HIS POV - THE HELICOPTER: Hovering over the road ahead -- POV 
      WHIPS DOWN to one of the machine guns on the ground. 
      Shielding Anton from the attack, McGarrett runs over and 
      grabs the 240 -- aims it at the helicopter and OPENS FIRE 
      with a stream of tracers -- 

      THE HELICOPTER - AS BULLETS TEAR THROUGH ITS SIDE -- SMOKE 
      starts to billow and the chopper VEERS OFF over the tree 
      tops, damaged -- but it ain t over:

      Rounds PEPPER the ground around McGarrett -- he scrambles to 
      the other side of the Stryker, still pulling Anton -- Out of 
      bullets, McGarrett tosses the machine gun and draws a SIG .40 
      cal from his hip -- peers out -- UNLOADS on the last soldier 
      standing -- turning his back on Anton for a SPLIT-SECOND -- 
      when he wheels back, he finds Anton GONE -- scrambling away -- 
      grabbing a SIDEARM off the dead MP -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    NO!!!  DROP IT!!!

      -- but Anton WHIRLS, turns the weapon on McGarrett -- no 
      choice --  BLAM!  BLAM!  MCGARRETT FIRES FIRST -- shoots 
      Anton in the chest, into the body armor -- knocking him back 
      like the sack of shit that he is.  McGarrett rushes the body  
      -- checking the armor, finds the SECOND ROUND missed the 
      armor plate and punctured Anton s chest.  A last death gurgle 
      -- COUGHING BLOOD --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 9.

      And that s it... Anton Hesse is DEAD.  

      ON McGARRETT.  Mind tumbling, knowing with gut-wrenching 
      certainty what this means -- as we PUSH IN ON HIM, backlit by 
      the flames, the bodies, destruction.  

      RIIIIING.  He whirls -- the PHONE -- where? -- there, on the 
      ground -- but McGarrett doesn t move.  Just STARES. The phone 
      sits there like a rattlesnake you do not want to go near.  
      But he has to:  

      Finally picks it up.  Hits  Answer.  Puts it to his ear.  
      Hand shaking.  A look of pure dread.  

                                  HESSE (V.O.)
                    What happened?  

      Impossible silence.  The worst moment of McGarrett s life.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Victor...

                                  HESSE (V.O.)
                    Put Anton on the phone. 

    A forever pause -- words catch in McGarrett s throat -- he 
      can t bring himself to speak -- 

      INT. MCGARRETT HOME - INTERCUTTING:

      INTENSELY CLOSE ON HESSE -- eyes on the laptop.  Only one 
      VIBRANT HEAT SIGNATURE remains.  Hesse knows what it means --   

                                  HESSE
                    My brother s dead, isn t he?
                         (rage + grief)
                    ISN T HE? 

      INTENSELY CLOSE ON McGARRETT -- going insane -- tears 
      flooding his eyes -- his silence confirms it --

                                  HESSE (CONT D)
                    So is your father.  

      BLAM!  AS MCGARRETT FLINCHES AT THE GUNSHOT -- WE SLAM TO THE 
      MOMENT WE VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR:

      A POUNDING RENDITION OF THE FIVE-0 THEME KICKS IN OVER A 
      BREAKING WAVE -- mind-blowing, rapid fire IMAGES from the 
      story you re about to see -- images that set the tone, 
      introduce soon-to-be familiar faces, and showcase the islands 
      of Hawaii -- it BUILDS and BUILDS until we SLAM TO:

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

      A MASSIVE USAF C-17 GLOBEMASTER TRANSPORT PLANE flies over 
      the Pacific -- beginning its descent towards the Hawaiian 
      islands.  OVER THIS, Elvis Presley's "Rock-A-Hula" --

      INT. C-17 COCKPIT - MID-AIR

      -- BLASTING from a boombox.  A vintage DASHBOARD HULA GIRL 
      dances atop the instrument panel.  As the crew prepares for 
      final approach, McGarrett, in uniform, ducks in unannounced: 
      CAPTAIN DEMARCO kills the music, stows the topless hula girl, 
      as the rest of the crew lose their smiles --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    At ease, Fellas.  

                                  MAJOR KNOWLES
                    Excuse us, Sir --  little ritual we 
                    do when we approach the islands.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Mind if I sit up here for landing?

                                  MAJOR KNOWLES
                    Go right ahead. 

      McGarrett takes the jumpseat.  As the plane breaks through 
      clouds... THE ISLAND OF O AHU IS REVEALED.  McGarrett stares  
      -- haunted.  Old ghosts.  The crew can sense this.

                                  CPT. DEMARCO
                    Sir, how long since you've been 
                    home?

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (beat, quietly)
                    I don't remember.

      EXT. HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE - O'AHU, HAWAII - DAY

      The C-17 hits the runway.  TRACK as it taxis to a stop.  The 
      cargo bay door lowers and McGarrett dramatically steps out, 
      DUFFEL over his shoulder.  On a mission.  Waiting for him is 
      a black Suburban with official plates -- and RICHARD FEENEY, 
      the Governor's young, eager Administrative Assistant:

                                    RICHARD
                    Aloha!  Commander McGarrett?

      He offers a hand but McGarrett doesn t stop.  Richard trails:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know you.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 11.

                                    RICHARD
                    Richard Feeney, I work for Governor 
                    Jameson.  She'd like a word.

      He gestures to SECURITY AGENTS in sunglasses waiting by the 
      Suburban.  Off McGarrett, knowing he isn t being asked -- 

      EXT. USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

      TRACKING ALONG the memorial structure spanning the mid-
      section of the sunken battleship.  Richard and the agents 
      lead McGarrett past THE WALL OF HONOR.  Names of men entombed 
      here.  One stands out -- "S. McGARRETT."  His grandfather.  
      McGarrett stares, confronting his family's legacy.  

      Up ahead, a LONE FIGURE approaches to meet him -- GOVERNOR 
      PAT JAMESON, a rather beautiful woman in her early 40 s; 
      local Hawaiian with a Washingtonian s backbone, she s a 
      unique mix of brilliance, grace, and compassion:

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    Thank you for seeing me, Commander.  
                          (offers a hand; he shakes)
                    I m so sorry for your loss.  There 
                    are no words to make this easy.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Is this about the investigation?

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    We re doing everything we can.  We 
                    have alerts out across all the 
                    islands. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    All due respect, you're not going 
                    to find Victor Hesse with 
                      roadblocks and search warrants.  
                    He s gone underground until he can 
                    find a safe way to leave the 
                    island.  Now why am I here? 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I d like to help you get what you 
                    came for. 
                         (off his look)
                    ... let s walk.

      And they do... against the endless ocean horizon... 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON (CONT D)
                    You know as well as I do: When 
                    people think of us, it s beaches, 
                    Luaus, and Mai-Tais -- that goes 
                    for the wallets in Washington, 
                    until I reminded them our strategic   
                      importance hasn t changed since 
                    World War Two: these islands were

                    the early warning and first line of 
                    defense against invading armies, 
                    only now we do it with 
                      international terrorists -- to say 
                    nothing of the drug smugglers, 
                    organized crime, human trafficking 
                    and prostitution -- it all comes 
                    through here first.  Except we 
                    can t just close the roads and 
                    bridges when someone pulls the 
                    alarm -- we re surrounded by water 
                    in case you haven t noticed, and if 
                    the number eight arms dealer on 
                      Interpol s watch list can just slip 
                    in undetected and murder a police 
                      officer... it s time for a game-
                    changer.
                         (stops walking) 
                    Your father s death was a wake-up 
                    call -- I can t afford to wait for 
                    the next appropriations bill to 
                    pass: I'm putting together a task 
                    force.  I want you to run it.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... you don t even know me.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I know your resume.  Annapolis. 
                    Navy SEALS.  Four years as a 
                    special investigator.  Then five 
                    with Naval Intelligence.  I can't 
                    think of anyone bett--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Okay, lemme stop you right there: 
                    I ve been tracking Victor Hesse for 
                    five years.  His reach is far and 
                    wide, his sources are well hidden -- 
                    the man s a ghost, like I ve never 
                    seen in my career -- if he was bold 
                    enough to surface, I promise you 
                    he s already planned an exit 
                    strategy and he knows I know it -- 
                    which means I can barely even 
                    afford the hour it ll take to bury 
                    my father, let alone stand here 
                    talking to you.

      With that, he turns and starts to go... 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    According to the Director of Naval 
                      Intelligence, you ve taken extended 
                    leave -- I assume that s because 
                    the military isn t in the revenge 
                    business?

      That STOPS him.  He turns back, eyes narrow.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 13.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON (CONT D)
                    Well I am.  And going up against 
                    Hesse as a vigilante is a mistake.   
                    At worst, it ll get you killed -- 
                    at best, incarcerated -- either 
                    way, your father will have died for 
                    nothing.  So what I m offering you 
                    isn t just common sense, it s a 
                    chance to go get the sonofabitch... 
                    with complete immunity and means.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Lady, I m not a cop.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I m not talking badges and sirens. 
                    I m talking results.  A federalized 
                    unit empowered by the Patriot act, 
                    with full blanket authority to hunt 
                    big game and get  em the hell off 
                    my island.  Your rules, my backing, 
                    no red tape.  
                          (beat)
                    And I promise you, Commander, what 
                    you see with me is what you get.

      He looks at her, steps closer -- shakes his head:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Here s what I see: an election year 
                    coming up and a politician who 
                    needs the PR -- who s willing to do 
                    whatever it takes... including 
                    bringing me here to Pearl Harbor, 
                    where my grandfather was killed -- 
                    knowing I d have to walk past his 
                    name on that wall -- the same name 
                    my father gave me -- and feel 
                    compelled to fulfill my family 
                    destiny.  That about right?  

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                          (beat; a touch of emotion 
                            now)
                    None of that makes me feel any less 
                      responsible.  

      And he sees she means it.  A real person here.  But it 
      doesn t change McGarrett s resolve:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Pass.  

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    Just think about it.  Please. 
                    Mahalo.

      She hands him her card, goes.  McGarrett can t deny he s a 
      little impressed by her.  But fuck it.  He starts to move --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 14.

                    She's a smart lady, that one...

      McGarrett wheels -- as CHIN HO KELLY (50s) approaches, Ex-
      Honolulu Police Detective turned Federal Security Guard.  
      Something FAMILIAR to McGarrett, he SOFTENS... 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I know you...

                                  CHIN
                    You better: Chin Ho Kelly.  I 
                    worked with your father in the 7th.  
                    Back in the day, he made me go to 
                    your little league games when he 
                    was working.  I was your biggest

      Chin pulls McGarrett into a BEAR HUG; McGarrett GRINS:

                                  MCGARRETT
                      I remember.  You were very loud.

                                  CHIN
                    Big lungs.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    And good ears.

                                  CHIN
                    Yeah, sorry about that.  Old habit 
                    from my last job.  You know... see 
                    and hear everything.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Looks like you've moved on to 
                    greener pastures.

                                  CHIN
                          (a chuckle)
                    Thanks for putting it that way.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m sorry, I didn t m--

                                  CHIN
                    -- no, you re right.  Let's just 
                    say the Honolulu PD and I had a 
                      disagreement over my job 
                      description.
                          (beat)
                    Your father understood.  He was 
                    very good to me after I was let go; 
                    stayed my friend and I know it cost 
                    him something.  Only wish I could 
                    pay some of that loyalty back.  But 
                    now that you're here, maybe you can 
                    do something.

                    the shots put a Haole on your 
                    father's murder investigation.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What do you know about this guy?

                                  CHIN
                    Not much.  Word is he's fresh meat 
                    from the mainland, which means he 
                    has no clue how the island works.

      INT./EXT. HPD UNMARKED SEDAN - DIAMOND HEAD ESTATE - DAY

      The man they're talking about, DET. DANNY WILLIAMS, is parked 
      outside a palatial ocean view gated estate in Diamond Head.  
      Danny s ex-Baltimore PD, real working man in paradise.  Only 
      guy on the island without a tan and always looks like he 
      slept in his clothes.  Next to him, in the passenger seat, 
      sits a brand new stuffed animal -- a PINK BUNNY RABBIT.  He 
      skims the McGARRETT CASE FILE as he talks on a cell:  

                                  DANNY 
                    -- I need a warrant write-up for a 
                      surveillance wire on a suspect in 
                      connection to the James McGarrett 
                    murder.  Suspect name is Frank 
                    Doran... D-O-R-A-N...   
                          (the gates start to OPEN)
                    Terrific, call me back -- 

      He hangs up and gets out, greets the 7-YEAR OLD GIRL walking 
      down the driveway, wearing a backpack and carrying a small 
      cage with a REAL PET RABBIT inside.  This is Danny's daughter 
      GRACE WILLIAMS.  The only reason he smiles occasionally.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    'Morning, sunshine.

                                  GRACE
                    Hi daddy.

                                  DANNY
                    Who's this?

                                  GRACE
                    Mr. Hoppy.  Stan bought him for me 
                    for animal show and tell.

      Danny keeps his emotions in check, but we see the hitch, 
      feeling like he's always coming up short.

                                  DANNY
                    That's great... we better go.  We 
                    don't want Mr. Hoppy to be late for 
                    his first day of school.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 16.

      As they get to the car, Danny manages to toss his Pink Bunny 
      into the back seat before Grace can see it.  They drive off -- 
      BAGPIPES FADING IN OVER --

      EXT. HONOLULU STREET - DAY

      Funeral procession.  Street lined with civilians and cops in 
      dress blues, saluting.  McGarrett and his younger sister, 
      MARY ANN McGARRETT, walk behind the hearse carrying their 
      father's flag-draped coffin.  Mary wears shades, we presume 
      to hide her grief.  Multiple bracelets and nose stud betray 
      her punky roots.  There s silent TENSION between them -- 
      troubled history now forced back into the present.

      McGarrett, for his part, seems anxious, distracted, eyes 
      scanning faces.  Does not allow himself time to grieve.  
      Further up the road -- standing apart from the cops -- 
      McGarrett notices CHIN HO KELLY paying his last respects.

      EXT. NATIONAL MEMORIAL CEMETERY OF THE PACIFIC - LATER

      Belly of the Punchbowl Crater.  Post funeral.  Last MOURNERS 
      drift away.  As McGarrett accepts condolences from a couple, 
      he gets distracted by Mary, too-loudly FLIRTING with a group 
      of cops.  LAUGHING.  It could not feel more inappropriate. 

      McGarrett leaves the couple and heads for his sister, gently 
      but firmly takes her by the arm:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Scuze us, Gentlemen -- 

      He pulls her to a secluded spot.  She YANKS her arm away from 
      him, like an annoyed teenager -- this goes to  11  FAST:

                          MARYMCGARRETT
      What -- -- what d you take?
      -- nothing --  -- take off your sunglasses-- 
      -- No --  -- you were never a good 
                                                  liar -- 
      -- you really wanna do this 
      now?  Here?-- well, we could wait 
                                                    another three or four years 
                                                  before we see each other 
                                                  again.

      She takes off the shades to look him in the eye.  Yeah, she s 
      stoned -- and PISSED:

                                  MARY
                    It s a skill, you know?  Starting a 
                      conversation this badly.  How 
                     bout:  Hi, Little Sister, how s 
                    LA?  How s work?   Y know, like a 
                    person -- not a military drone --

                                  MARY
                    It s a Vicodin, why should I have 
                    to justify anything to you?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I dunno, Mary, maybe because I m 
                    the one who let dad go to his grave 
                    believing you were his perfect 
                    little girl.  You called me when 
                    you got arrested, you called me 
                    when you went to rehab -- and I m 
                    glad you did, but don t pretend I m 
                      overstepping my bounds now when I m 
                    trying to keep you from 
                      embarrassing yourself.  
                          (then)
                    How s LA?

                                  MARY
                          (struck, quietly)
                    ... traffic sucks....

                                  MCGARRETT
                    How s work.

                                  MARY
                    Got fired.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Sorry.

      For a beat, it s quiet.  Mary exhales and sits on a bench.  
      Pause, then McGarrett sits beside her.  Staring at the gave. 

                                  MARY
                          (sad smirk)
                    Last time we were alone with dad 
                    together was mom s funeral... guess 
                    this is how we do family reunions.  

      Hear the pain in that, but anger too.  He stares off.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He wanted me to tell you... that he 
                    loved you, Mar.  That he should ve 
                    said it more.  And he was sorry.

                                  MARY
                    For what?  Shutting down 
                      completely?  Shipping us away when 
                    we were teenagers?  It s a little 
                    late.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (looks off, troubled...)
                    He said something else... you ever 
                    remember him calling me "champ?"  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 18.

                                  MARY
                    "Champ?"  And he apologized?  
                    You sure it was dad?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It wasn t a normal apology.  It was 
                    like a... confession.

      She knows her big brother won t rest til he s solved this...

                                  MARY
                    You re gonna get the guy who killed 
                    him.  Aren t you. 

      He looks up at her.  His eyes say  yes.   And her voice 
      CRACKS a little, a thousand emotions pushing to the surface -- 

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    Do me a favor?  Hurt him.  

      Brother and Sister lock eyes: at least this they agree on. 

      EXT. MCGARRETT HOME - 404 PIIKOI STREET - DAY 

      A TAXI rolls up.  McGarrett gets out, in civvies, duffel in 
      hand.  Been a long time since he's laid eyes on the place.  
      Ducks under the crime scene tape to the backyard -- finds an 
      old PLANTER by the back door.  Underneath there's a KEY --  

      INT. GARAGE - MCGARRETT HOME - DAY

      -- McGarrett uses it to let himself in. Turns on the lights -- 
      and there she is -- his father's pride and joy, a 1968 
      MERCURY BROUGHAM.  Tarp partially rolled back, a restoration 
      project forever.  Suddenly, we FLASH CUT TO:

      INT. MCGARRETT HOME - GARAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

      SIX-YEAR OLD STEVE MCGARRETT by his proud FATHER'S side -- as 
      they circle the old beater --

                                  JAMES
                    Feast your eyes -- The Park Lane 
                    Brougham.  Mercury's flagship

                    make her cherry and when the time 
                    comes, she's yours.

      RESUME MCGARRETT.  His face.  He's just fed the fire. 


      INT. KITCHEN - MCGARRETT HOME - DAY

      Light pops on: BLOOD STAINS SCREAM AT US from the already- 
      processed crime scene.  McGarrett just stands there a beat.  
      Sick.  Then: 

      JUMP CUTS: McGarrett conducts his own investigation.  Using 
      directionality of the blood spatter, he stands where Hesse 
      shot his father.  Looks to the wall.  Sees more spatter.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 19.

      Nearby, he spots a partial BLOODY SHOE PRINT.  McGarrett 
      measures it against his own shoe.  Smaller.  Cause for 
      concern.  Uses his iPhone to SNAP A PHOTO -- then notices 
      something odd about the cluttered kitchen table across the 
      room -- one area looks like someone made room for something -- 
      and the chair is slightly backed away.  This space is away 
      from all the blood, not processed by crime scene.   

      McGarrett considers, opens his duffel for his laptop -- holds 
      it over the small, empty space on the counter: perfect fit. 

      McGarrett mimics the same position -- gets an idea -- on a 
      shelf, lined up, are PINEWOOD DERBY CARS.  Pristine.  His 
      father s hobby.  Grabs a tube of  Hob-e-Lube  dry graphite 
      lubricant powder -- SQUEEZES the tube coating the table and 
      BLOWS lightly:  

      The dust causes two PALM PRINTS to materialize at the edge of 
      the table!  McGarrett snaps photos.  Speed dials a NUMBER:  


      INT. NAVY OPERATIONS CENTER - NO LOCATION - DAY

      REVEAL OF WHERE WE ARE YET --  as we STOP ON LT. CATHERINE 
      ROLLINS (30), smart and beautiful, manning an INTEL 
      PROCESSING NODE.  BING:  she receives and EMAIL on her 
      console, non-navy.  Email ID shows a photo of McGARRETT, 
      smiling against a tropical backdrop -- a picture surely taken 
      during off-hours.  She reads:  NEED YOUR HELP.  CAN YOU 
      TALK?  Turns to her enlisted COUNTERPART next to her:

      passes under the caption on the building -- US NAVY CENTRAL 
      COMMAND HQ, US FIFTH FLEET.  We are in the Persian Gulf -- 
      hot, bright and everything a desert tone.  Once clear of the

      -- same way he came in -- through the garage -- Taking it all 
      in one last time: the tools, the clutter, a man's workplace.  
      And then he stops.  Suddenly.  Because he sees something on 
      the shelf that he was totally unprepared for... an old 
      toolbox with a faded CHAMPION SPARK PLUG logo -- but "CHAMP" 
      is the only thing legible after years of use. 

      McGarrett pulls the box off the shelf. Opens it. Inside is AN 
      OLD KEY and a stack of crime scene photos: the aftermath of a 
      car bomb.  All of them are marked with a date that means 
      something to McGarrett. His mind spins -- what is all this?   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 21.

      Then -- a FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Someone s in the house.  
      McGarrett quick-draws his automatic, pins himself to the wall 
      -- finger on the trigger -- ready to kill the intruder as he 
      comes around the corner -- TENSION -- and when he does, it s:

      DANNY!  GLOCK OUT.  FRANTIC, OVERLAPPING: 

                        DANNYMCGARRETT
      Don't move -- ! -- who are you?!
      -- who the hell re you?-- Commander Steve McGarrett, 
                                                  this is my father's house --
      -- Detective Danny Williams, 
      Honolulu PD, put your gun 
      away ---- no, you put your gun away 
                                                  and let me see your ID -- 
      -- you show me yours ---- I m not putting my gun 
                                                  down -- 
      -- well I m not either -- 

      Pause -- eye lock -- neither gun lowering -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Fine: don t put your gun down, just  
                    use your free hand to pull out your 
                    ID --

                                  DANNY
                    After you -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    At the same time -- 

                                  DANNY
                    On three: one... two... three... 

      And they MOVE in tandem -- slowly -- drawing wallets -- now 
      both aiming guns and ID s at each other.  The truth verified, 
      each holsters their weapon... 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Look, I m sorry about your father, 
                    but you can t be here -- it s still 
                    an active crime scene -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Doesn t seem that active. 

                                  DANNY
                    I can t share information with you.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then I ll share some with you: 
                    Hesse wasn t here alone -- someone 
                    was sitting at the kitchen table 
                    working on a laptop when my father 
                    was murdered. 
                                  (MORE)  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 22.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT'D)
                    There was space cleared on the 
                    counter, size of a 13 inch Macbook 
                    pro, and my father hated computers.

                                  DANNY
                    Look, you need to leave now -- 

      McGarrett nods, picks up the CHAMP box and heads out --

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    You can't take that, you know 
                      everything s evidence -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (bold lie)
                    I came with this.

                                  DANNY
                    No you didn t, I can see the dust 
                    void it left on the shelf.  What re 
                    you hiding in there -- ?  

                                  MCGARRETT
                        (dodging)
                    How long have you been with 
                    Honolulu PD?

                                  DANNY
                    None of your damn business, Barbara 
                    Walters -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It is if you re investigating my 
                    father s death -- 

                                  DANNY
                    I d really like to get back to 
                    that, so the sooner you leave, the 
                    sooner I can get on with it -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Anything you say.

      Again, McGarrett starts to walk out with the box:

                                  DANNY
                    Leave the box, or get arrested.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You gonna call for backup?

                                  DANNY
                    An ambulance.

      Stare off.  Finally, McGarrett puts the box down.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 23.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t thank me yet -- 

      -- as he s pulling the Governor s card from his pocket, 
      dialing his cell -- punches in the number -- waits -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Governor Jameson, please... 

                      MCGARRETTDANNY
      Tell her it s Steve (a chuckle)
        McGarrett...Yeah, right.

      McGarrett just grins to Danny:  Be with you in a sec  -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I'll take the job...              
                          (with a look to 
                           the Champ box)
                    Let s just say I found something 
                    that changed my mind.
                          (listens, then)
                      Immediately.  But on one condition  
                    -- when the time comes, I don't 
                    want to hear the words "red tape  
                    or  I'll get back to you."  That 
                      bureaucratic bullshit does not work 
                    with me.  
                          (long beat)
                    Are you serious?  Right now?

      Danny staring.  The hell s happening?  A little sheepishly, 
      McGarrett raises his right hand.  Takes the Oath of Honor: 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    I, Stephen J.  McGarrett, do 
                    solemnly declare upon my honor and 
                      conscience that I will act at all 
                    times to the best of my ability and 
                    knowledge in a manner befitting an 
                    officer of the law. I will 
                      faithfully obey the orders of my 
                    superiors and will be ready to 
                    confront danger in the line of 
                    duty.  
                          (for Danny; ultra-cheery)
                    Thank you, Governor.
                          (hangs up)
                    Now it s my crime scene.  

      And with a flourish, he sweeps up the CHAMP BOX and heads 
      OUT, leaving a stunned and furious Danny -- 

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      INT. HONOLULU POLICE DEPT - LATER

      SEE DANNY behind closed doors with his boss, CAPTAIN HOOKANO  
      -- Danny argues to keep his case, LOUD and ANGRY:

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                    -- I don t care who he is, I m   
                    working a solid lead here, making 
                    progress -- and I don t like being 
                    benched for some gung-ho Jarhead --

      FIND McGARRETT outside, listening.  Finally, Danny storms 
      out, looks surprised to see McGarrett -- who GRINS:

                                  MCGARRETT
                       Jarhead s  slang for Marine.  I m 
                    Navy.  You wanna insult me, call me 
                    a  Squid. 

      Danny throws him the case file --

                                  DANNY
                    Knock yourself out, Squid.

      Off he goes, to his desk.  Finds a gift waiting for him: a 
      tube of INSTANT TAN wrapped in a bow.  Looks over to 
      DETECTIVE BEN KOKUA and the cluster of fellow Det s nearby, 
      chuckling --

                                  DETECTIVE KOKUA
                    In case you need to go undercover, 
                    brah.

                                  DANNY
                    Wow.  That is funny.  Sun tan 
                    lotion, how d you think of that?

                                  DETECTIVE KOKUA
                    You got some time on your hands 
                    now, solve it.

      Danny watches as the Detectives drift off together, a 
      camaraderie Danny s not a part of... and never will be.  He 
      chucks the tube in the garbage and leaves the precinct, 
      hating his job right now -- KICKS a trash can on the way out. 

      RACK FOCUS to McGarrett, having witnessed this.  Behind him, 
      Hookano has appeared in the doorway, beckoning...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What do you think of him?

      As they enter...  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 25.

      INT. CAPTAIN HOOKANO S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                    CAPTAIN HOOKANO
                    Bad temper, good cop.  Probably 
                    best they had in Baltimore: Medal 
                    of Honor, bravery in the line of 
                    duty -- but that don t make his job 
                    easier here.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You don t seem bothered by that.

      Hookano sits at his desk, leans the chair back:

                                    CAPTAIN HOOKANO
                    He s got an attitude that doesn t 
                    wear well.  Things run a little 
                    different here.  Some of the guys 
                    work in their own time zone -- they 
                    call it  Island Time.   You either 
                    adjust to it or you don t. 
                          (offhanded shrug)
                    I give him a year before he quits.

      There s a  prejudiced  quality that McGarrett  -- despite not 
      knowing Danny, despite not even really liking Danny -- finds 
      himself reacting to on Danny s behalf:   

                                  MCGARRETT
                    And would that year be in  island 
                    time ?

      Hookano looks at McGarrett -- now not liking him either.  
      McGarrett holds the look, steely:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    He said he was working a solid 
                    lead... what was it?

      EXT. HONOLULU CLUB MOTEL - PALOLO, HAWAII - DAY

            A $49-a-night-park-by-the-door nestled in the lush Palolo 
      Valley.  Neon blinks VACANCY.  McGARRETT pulls into the 
      parking lot -- JUMP CUT TO ROOM 47.  He KNOCKS.  A beat -- 
      the door opens: DANNY.  Sees McGarrett, case file in hand:

                                  DANNY
                    What do you want?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You requested a wire put on someone 
                    named Frank Doran.  Tell me about 
                    him.

                                  DANNY
                          ( go away )
                    I got a pot pie in the microwave.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Sounds mouth-watering.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 26.

      Beat: against his instincts, Danny lets McGarrett in -- 

      INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      A lonely little pit: king bed and a neatly-made kid-size cot.  
      Clothes still in the suitcase.  Empty six packs.  Old take-
      out.  McGarrett picks up a framed photo of Danny's daughter:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Your kid?

                                  DANNY
                    Stunning detective work.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You don't really let her stay with 
                    you here, do you?

                                  DANNY
                    What are you, Nanny 911?

      He snatches back the photo.  Sets it down.  McGarrett opens 
      the case file, pulls a mugshot: FRANK DORAN.  Real lowlife.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    So who s this guy Doran?  

                                  DANNY
                    Suspected arms dealer: two years in 
                    Maui Correctional for weapons 
                      possession.  Currently a person of 
                    interest in an unrelated homicide, 
                    but the weapon was never found.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What s he have to do with my 
                    father's case?

                                  DANNY
                    When I ran a ballistics comparison 
                    on the bullet that killed your dad, 
                    I got a hit to the Doran 
                      investigation.  I think the first 
                    thing Hesse did when he got to the 
                    island was get his hands on a gun.        
                    Only I couldn t figure out why he d 
                    hook up with a small fish like 
                    Doran... then I realized: small 
                    fish are harder to trace.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    That s Hesse s M.O. -- less 
                    linkage.  But since it hasn t even

                    like a pain in the ass, thinks 
                    you re good.  That s what I m 
                    looking for.

                    You got no choice, Detective.  The

                    Doran's a shooter and I don't like

      Before Danny can respond -- McGarrett is out the door.  Shit.  

      EXT. FRANK DORAN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY

      Danny catches up to McGarrett, says low, sharp:

                                  DANNY
                    Cowboy.  Slow down...

      They approach the front door -- HEAR shouting inside -- two 
      people fighting -- then suddenly, the door opens and Doran's 
      girlfriend storms out, catching our heroes off-guard.  This 
      is JAYCEE, ex-arm candy turned sun bleached junkie. Danny 
      instinctively GRABS her, slaps his hand across her mouth, 
      stopping her from warning --

      INT. FRANK DORAN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY

      -- FRANK DORAN, who comes storming out of the bedroom:

                    Where do you think you're going, 
                    Jaycee?  Get your ass back in here!  
                    You hear me?

      He looks to the half-open door.  It's quiet out there.  Maybe 
      too quiet.  Paranoia takes over.  Something's not right.

                                  DORAN (CONT D)
                    Jaycee -- ?

      No response.  Doran sees shadows out there.  Oh shit.

      EXT. FRANK DORAN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY

      Our heroes duck the assault -- but not before Danny drops, 
      bleeding, GRAZED in the shoulder.  As McGarrett makes his way 
      over -- Doran unloads on a side window: GLASS EXPLODES.  
      Doran splits into a side alley --

      -- Comes in full stride.  Place is empty.  Under renovation. 
      TRACK McGarrett and Doran as they duck and move through a 
      maze of tools and supplies -- trading fire.  McGarrett dodges 
      a barrage as he RUNS OUT OF BULLETS.  Gun CLICKING crazily on 
      empty.  Shit.  He scrambles -- loses Doran -- takes cover in 
      a side room.  Trapped now.  Trying not to breathe -- face 
      streaked with sweat -- eyes constantly moving -- searching.  

      Doran stalks McGarrett.  Dumps an empty clip.  Quietly 
      reloads.  Getting warmer.  McGarrett needs a weapon -- 
      something -- anything.  He lands on tools and supplies left 
      behind.  A plan is forming: he unscrews a LIGHT BULB -- fast -
      - quietly CRUSHES IT -- sprinkles the glass around the 
      perimeter.  Next, he grabs a box of NAIL GUN LOADS.  Removes 
      one.  Moves to a dolly.  Pulls off a wheel, empties the ball 
      bearings into his hand.  

      Now he hears -- CRUNCH!  CRUNCH!  It's Doran approaching.  
      McGarrett QUICKLY affixes the bearing to the tip of the load 
      with electrical tape -- JAMS the make-shift round into the 
      chamber of his gun: HE'S JUST QUICK-BUILT A BULLET OUT OF 
      NAIL GUN CHARGE AND BALL BEARING. 

      And JUST IN TIME as Doran WHEELS around the corner and 
      McGarrett FIRES!  BLAM!  Doran SLAMS into the wall -- belly 
      leaking blood -- still doesn t stop him from moving -- 

      EXT.  ALLEY - DAY 

      -- Doran busts from the house, leaving a trail of blood.  
      McGarrett on his heels -- they emerge from the alley -- 
      running across Kuhina Street -- Cars SKID -- Doran looks back 
      -- sees McGARRETT thirty yards behind -- Doran FIRES over a

      Weaver Road -- McGarrett, half a block behind -- running full-

      Up ahead -- EWA BEACH PARK -- Doran cuts through -- Lei-
      wearing TOURISTS run -- SHRIEKING -- Doran grabs a FEMALE 
      TOURIST and uses her as his shield -- 

                                  DORAN
                    PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!

                    YOU DON'T THINK I'LL DO IT?!!

      As McGarrett puts down his gun -- BLAM!  DORAN COLLAPSES.  
      DEAD.  McGarrett, stunned, turns to where the shot came from -
      - and there's Danny.  Shaken.  McGarrett grabs the screaming 
      Woman and holds her as MUSIC RINGS OUT TO:

      WHIP PAN TO McGARRETT, alone, searching for clues, connecting 
      Doran to Hesse.  He HEARS a noise coming from the bedroom 
      closet.  Two deadbolts on the door. McGarrett draws his Sig, 
      cautiously unlocks the door -- finds a terrified 14-YEAR-OLD 
      GIRL crouched in the dark.  Chinese refugee turned sex slave.   
      She flinches, recoiling, a wounded animal protecting itself --

                    It's okay...  I'm not gonna hurt 
                    you...

      He kneels.  Regards her tenderly.  The fresh track marks on 
      her arms, soiled clothes hanging off her starved frame.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)

                            head, he tries MANDARIN)
                    What's your name?

      She finally speaks, her mouth dry, words barely a whisper:

                    ... Chen-chi...

      He watches her go -- then moves to Danny --  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    She says she was smuggled from 
                    China four days ago on a cargo ship 
                    with her parents and a couple 
                    hundred refugees, but when she got 
                    here, she was traded to Doran --

                    -- you ve gotta be kidding me -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- if these same guys are moving 
                    people out of Asia, they could ve 
                    smuggled Hesse into Hawaii--

                                  DANNY
                    Hey: you took a stupid risk -- I am 
                    not getting myself killed for your 
                    vendetta.  I have a daughter for 
                      chrissakes.  

      And he starts to walk off, furious -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    That girl in there, she s someone s 
                    daughter too.       

      That STOPS Danny in his tracks.  He turns, narrow-eyed:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    What if she was yours?  Is there 
                    anything you wouldn t do?  To hunt 
                    down the sonofabitch that did that 
                    to her?  And kill him?

      And despite his indignation, his instinct to flee, Danny 
      can t argue this one.  McGarrett comes closer -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    You don t have to like me -- but 
                    right now?  There s no one else to

                    -- that you got that GI JOE 
                    thousand yard stare from chasing 
                      shoe-bombers around the world -- 
                    but civilized society has rules, 
                    it s the unspoken glue that 
                    separates us from hyenas and 
                    jackals --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- hyenas and jackals?

                                  DANNY
                    The animal kingdom, whatever, and 
                    rule number one is: if you get 
                    someone shot, you apologize --

                      MCGARRETTDANNY
          (quietly)(on a roll, not hearing)
      I m sorry.-- you don t wait for a 
                                                    special occasion like a 
                                                    birthday or Christmas or 
                                                    President s Day -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I said I m sorry.  Sincerely.  
                          (Danny looks at him)
                    That s what I wanted to tell you.  
                    Last year.  When this conversation 
                    first started.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 34.

      There s a pause.  Danny straightens his tie:

                                  DANNY
                    Your apology is noted.  Acceptance 
                    is pending.  

      He says this with a straight face -- but there s a little 
      glint in his eye.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You ll let me know.

      And finally, despite himself, Danny sort of SMIRKS.  The ice 
      is breaking...

                                  DANNY
                    That girl you found... how old was 
                    she?

                                  MCGARRETT
                      Thirteen... fourteen... 

      DANNY -- ANGRY as this hits home, regains a sense of purpose.     

                                  DANNY
                    How s she connect to Hesse? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He made a lot of money in the human 
                      trafficking business, so he s got 
                    ties to the world.  Which means he 
                    could ve used those connections to 
                    smuggle himself into Hawaii.  

                                  DANNY 
                    You re talking organized crime on a 
                    federal level -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Governor gave us her umbrella -- if 
                    this thing goes Federal, it s still 
                    our case.                       

                                  DANNY
                    Even if we do find out who let 
                    Hesse in through the back door, if 
                    they re local, no one in that 
                    world s going to help two guys that 
                    look like you and me. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I think I know someone they might 
                    talk to...

      INT. SECURITY OFFICES - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

      ON CHIN HO KELLY, in full blown interrogation mode:

                                  CHIN
                    Let's cut to the chase: you and I 
                    both know what went down here --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 35.

      REVERSE TO REVEAL a very scared 8-year old BOY.  A souvenir 
      USS ARIZONA snow globe on the table between them:

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    You saw that snow globe and had to 
                    have it, so you went for the five 
                    finger discount.  I want the truth.

      He waits for a response.  And the kid bursts out in TEARS:

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    Kid, just-- stop crying -- hey -- 
                    take the globe -- just-- 

      A KNOCK on the door.  He answers: surprised to see McGarrett 
      and Danny, who see the kid crying:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We interrupting?

      INT. SNACK SHOP - PEARL HARBOR - LATER

      The three of them at a table.  Chin looks up from a photo of 
      Chen-Chi on McGarrett's cell phone, troubled. 

                                  CHIN
                    -- where d you find her? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Locked in a house.               
                         (then, affected)             
                    She came here to start a new life.  
                    They drugged her and turned her 
                    into a prostitute...  

      Chin turns to McGarrett -- sees something unexpected.  Grins. 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    What -- ?

                                  CHIN
                    You sound just like your father.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then help me.  You said you wanted 
                    to.  Here s your chance.                 
                          (shows photo of Hesse)                     
                    Guy I'm looking for s high profile: 
                    Victor Hesse.  FBI.  CIA.  
                    Interpol.  He's on everyone's 
                    radar, which means he 
                    didn't just land here and get his 
                    passport stamped.  He was back- 
                    channeled in.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 36.

                                  CHIN
                    And you think the same network that 
                    brought this girl to the island, 
                    smuggled Hesse in? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He made a fortune trafficking kids 
                    out of Malaysia -- 

                                  CHIN
                    Then you're looking for a 
                      Snakehead.  Local Chinese gangs 
                    that specialize in human smuggling. 

                                  DANNY 
                    We need a name. 

                                  CHIN
                    Are you kidding?  Look at me.  I'm 
                    a rubber gun now.

                                  DANNY
                    You were a cop here for twenty 
                    years. 

      Chin exhales a heavy SIGH, thinking...

                                  CHIN
                    I do know a guy who's got ties to 
                    that world, but--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- get us an introduction --

                                  CHIN
                    -- forget it.  He's a former 
                      Confidential Informant.  Trusts no 
                    one.  Especially Haoles.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then you talk to him.

      Chin saw this coming.  We sense deep wounds somehow opening -- 

                                  CHIN
                    I'm busy.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You expecting a crime wave in the 
                    gift shop this afternoon?

                                  CHIN
                    Forget it.  I can t be a cop 
                    anymore. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Why not?

      Chin turns -- HARD -- and a little too LOUD:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 37.

                                  CHIN
                    Because I can t be, you understand?  
                    HPD accused me of taking payoffs -- 
                    I m the last person the department 
                    wants to see wearing a badge.
                          (then, sees a few people 
                            staring)
                    I have to go.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Did you take the money?

                                  CHIN
                    What?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Did you.  Take.  The money.

                                  CHIN
                    No.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then come with us, and we don't 
                    need to talk about this again.  
                    Ever.  This is your ticket back in 
                    the game.  Call it payback.  Call 
                    it whatever.  But I need you.

      McGarrett won t let this go.  And Chin knows it.  

                                  CHIN
                    How do you know you can trust me?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Because my father did.

      This lands.  For Chin, it's a prayer answered -- the second 
      chance he never thought would come.  Off Chin, GALVANIZED: 

      INT. KAMEKONA'S SHAVED ICE - KAPAHULU AVENUE - DAY

      Chin greets KAMEKONA, Ex-con turned Shaved Ice King, wearing 
      an XXL Pro Bowl t-shirt.  They grip hands and hug as 
      McGarrett and Danny watch -- 

                                  CHIN
                    What flavor s good today?

      Chin looks at his  partners :  Pony up.   They do --   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 38.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I ll take Cotton Candy.

                                  DANNY
                    Plain.

                                  KAMEKONA
                    Two cones and two t-shirts to go.

      Kamekona holds up a t-shirt with HIS OWN SMILING MUG on it.  
      Chin's look says: "buy it now."

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... okay.  Medium.  

                                  KAMEKONA
                    Only comes in XL, Brah.  My face 
                    don't fit on anything smaller. 

      McGarrett shells out a fifty.  Kamekona shakes his head: 
       more.   McGarrett looks to Chin, who holds out 5 FINGERS. 
      Jesus.  McGarrett pulls out 4 hundred dollar bills, hands 
      them over.  Kamekona pockets them, hands over the shirts:

                                  KAMEKONA (CONT D)
                    Cool.  One more thing I need you 
                    two fine gentlemen to do... 

      EXT. KAMEKONA'S SHAVED ICE - DAY

      MINUTES LATER, and McGarrett and Danny, now WEARING the 
      oversized shirts, leaning against their car eating shaved ice  
      -- looking RIDICULOUS and annoyed -- as people pass and grin.   
      McGarrett notices a 7-year old GIRL staring at them.  Looks 
      at her.  She keeps staring.  His eyes say:  What? 

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    Are you a policeman?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    No.

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    You look like a policeman.

      McGarrett lowers himself to the girl.  Eye-to-eye.  Offers 
      his uneaten shaved ice:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Go away. 

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    I don t like cotton candy.

                                  DANNY
                    I got something you might like... 

      He reaches into the backseat of his car.  Hands the girl the 
      pink bunny he bought for Grace.  She LIGHTS UP:   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 39.

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                     Thanks!

      And takes off, thrilled.  McGarrett throws Danny a look: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You always carry around pink bunny 
                    rabbits?

                                  DANNY
                    What, you don t?

                    You better have a name.

                                  DANNY
                    Even if Sang Min's for real, he's 
                    got no reason to tell us where 
                    Hesse is.

                    Then we motivate him.

                    Forget it.  Coercion won t hold up 
                    in court. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m saying we find some leverage, 
                    use it to twist his arm.

                    Simple bait and trap with an 
                      undercover we wire up.

                                  CHIN
                    Only one problem, keiki.  That 
                    might work well on the mainland, 
                    but we're on an island with less 
                    than a million people.  Which means 
                    the bad guys know the good guys, so 
                    we need to look for our bait 
                    outside the box.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I take it you have the perfect guy 
                    in mind.

                                  CHIN

                    Oh yeah.

      EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

      KONO KALAKAUA (23) shreds a long, MASSIVE wave.  The woman is 
        spectacular.  Not just because she's got wave cred and fills 
      out a wetsuit, but homegirl's got serious akamai (smarts).  
      Our heroes watch her from the beach, wowed...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    That's your niece?

                                  CHIN
                    Choose your next words carefully.             
                    Both of you. 

                                  DANNY
                    She s very... talented.

                                  CHIN
                    Kid s off the charts: speaks 4 
                      languages, including Japanese and 
                    Mandarin.  2nd degree black belt --  

      ON KONO, in the mix with a half dozen guys, all vying for the 
      same set.  She takes off, has the inside track --  

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    -- and then there's surfing.  Had 
                    offers to compete, but all she ever 
                    wanted was to wear a badge.  
                    Graduates the police academy in a 
                    month... unfortunately she's my 
                    niece, which means the HPD will 
                    never take her seriously.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 41.

      Kono gets to her feet first -- drops down -- carving a BOTTOM 
      TURN at the base of the wave -- carves back up the face and 
      lines up to shoot the barrel... but ANOTHER SURFER suddenly 
      DROPS IN on her.  Kono YELLS at him to pull out.  He ignores 
      her -- and she EATS IT.  Pummeled in the washing machine -- 
      finally bursts to the surface.  Pissed, she paddles in...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You sure about this?  She's got no 
                    street experience.

      Kono -- on shore now -- rushes up behind the surfer -- 

                                  KONO
                    Ho brah -- !!
                          (the guy turns; she SLUGS 
                          HIM HARD)
                    Think twice next time you wanna 
                    drop in on someone s wave.  

      She makes tracks, stops: surprised to see Chin.  Kisses him:

                                  KONO (CONT D)

                    Kono, meet Commander Steve 
                    McGarrett and Detective Danny 
                    Williams.

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (as they shake)
                    You got a nice left hook.

                                  KONO
                    Nah, Man, that was a love tap.

                                  DANNY
                          (chuckles; to Chin)
                    I think I found my Cinderella.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Your uncle tells me you're 
                      graduating from the police academy 
                    next week.  How d you like to earn 
                    a little extra credit before you 
                    do?

      She looks at Chin, then back to McGarrett, intrigued:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 42.

                                  KONO
                    I'm listening...

      And as our latest team-member s brought into the fold:

      EXT. MCGARRETT HOME - SUNSET - ESTABLISHING

      INT. MCGARRETT HOME - SUNSET

      CLOSE ON THE  CHAMP  BOX, as McGarrett OPENS it.  Removes the 
      KEY.  JUMP CUTS: McGarrett tries the key on EVERY LOCK IN THE 
      HOUSE -- doors -- boxes -- NOTHING.  Our cuts end on 
      McGarrett in his father s STUDY, at a loss...

      Then.  He notices a LOCK on his father s DESK DRAWER.  Slips 
      the key in: BINGO.  It OPENS and he starts sifting through 
      the contents -- nothing of significance in here.  But 
      McGarrett knows his father -- feels around for a hidden 
      compartment -- finds it -- removes a large MANILA ENVELOPE. 

      Dumps the contents onto the desk: A USED OPERA TICKET with a 
      YAKUZA MON CREST sketched on the back, a dusty old FLOPPY 
      DISK, POSTCARDS marked  Osaka, Japan  with a series of hand 
      drawn STICK FIGURE DANCING MEN (ciphers for letters).  

      ON McGARRETT.  Reeling.  What is all this?  

      Then, an EMAIL PING from his laptop.  He checks the sender: 
             rollinsc@navcentcom.navy.mil   Clicks it.  The email reads: 
       HERE S YOUR PALM PRINT... BE CAREFUL. LOVE, C.   

      Clicks the ATTACHMENT: A CIA FILE WITH A PHOTO OF JOVAN 
      ELTSIN, matching McGarrett s print to the same one on the CIA 
      database.  McGarrett scans -- processing DETAILS on the file  
      -- then, a KNOCK at the door.  McGarrett looks through... 
      DANNY.  Opens it:

                                  DANNY
                    -- got the surveillance equipment 
                    you asked for.  You hear from Chin? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Not yet.  
                          (the laptop photo)
                    Recognize this guy?   

                                  DANNY
                    No.  Who is he?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Jovan Elstin.  File says he used to 
                    work for the Russians as a computer 
                      programmer in SVR, the equivalent 
                    of our CIA.  He was here when my 
                    father was murdered. I found his 
                    palm prints and partial boot print 
                    in the kitchen.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 43.

                                  DANNY
                    How d you know they didn t belong 
                    to the guy who killed your father? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Hesse wears size eleven, like me, 
                    except double E.  The one I found 
                    was smaller, and Hesse gets his 
                    footwear custom made.  Direct 
                    injected polyurethane midsole with 
                    a nitrile rubber outsole.  This 
                    print was made from a Terra Steel 
                    Toe EH GoreTex boot, footwear of 
                    choice for a lot of mercenaries in 
                    Eastern Europe.

      Jesus.  Danny can t help but be impressed: this guy is good. 

                                  DANNY
                    ... well I could ve told you that.
                          (then; opens the fridge)
                    Need a beer.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t touch that, it s evidence -- 
                    this is still a crime scene. 

      He says that MOCKINGLY.  The ice is thawing between these 
      two.  Danny tosses him a beer -- McGarrett heads outside to:

      EXT. MCGARRETT HOME - DECK - SUNSET

      Golden sunset.  They emerge onto the deck, staring out at the 
      water... McGarrett clearly deep in thought... 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    So you ever gonna tell me what 
                    Danno means?

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe.  If you tell me what s in 
                    the box.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Truth is... I don t know yet.  All 
                    I know it was important enough to 
                    be the last thing my father said.      
                          (then)
                    Right now... it s just a puzzle. 

      Danny sees the pain, the confusion in McGarrett.  Offers:

                                  DANNY
                    Me and Grace... we love puzzles.  

      McGarrett stares, grateful.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 44.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You re a good father. 

                                  DANNY
                    ... yeah, well.  I don t know 
                      sometimes... guess there s three 
                    ways of looking at that.  I might 
                    just be stupid enough to get killed 
                    chasing some scumbag meth head... 
                    and then what kind of father would 
                    I be?  Or maybe I m just a selfish 
                      sonofabitch...            
                       (beat, with some humility)    
                    ... cause truth is, I need this.  I 
                    wanna do what I m good at... and be 
                    reminded I m good at what I do.  
                    And if that means having to put up 
                    with your twisted belief that 
                    you re never wrong, so be it.           

      McGarrett sort of grins, appreciating the honesty...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... so what s the third?

                                  DANNY
                    Even though I do tell myself this 
                    isn t permanent... it s Grace s 
                    home now.                            
                          (beat)                      
                    And my job s to make it safe.  

      That RESONATES with McGarrett.  Words his dad lived by.  He 
      raises his longneck in a toast.  They CLINK glasses -- a nod 
      of mutual determination.  Then, his cell RINGS.  He answers:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Yeah.

      FIND McGarrett, Danny and Chin looking over a map of Sang 
      Min's trucking facility.  Kono exits the next room, wearing a 
      well-worn dress.  Hair tied back.  Playing the role of poor 
      immigrant.  She s AMPED, feeling the adrenaline rush of her

      McGarrett, Danny and Chin crammed in.  Quiet, intense 
      activity.  They use a military grade Audio Surveillance 
      System to monitor the room.  Sound wave vibrations are 
      transmitted and played over a speaker system.  A THERMAL

      The Samoans escort Kono into the room.  Behind his desk is 
      SANG MIN, fat and deeply-tanned.  He takes his time looking 
      up from paperwork, and when he does, he likes what he sees.

                                  SANG MIN
                    My friend says you need my help.

                                  SANG MIN
                    I can have your family here within 
                    a week.  Getting them out of China 
                    is easy.  Paying for it is the hard

                    I work at the cannery on Pacific.  
                    And weekends as a housekeeper at 
                    the Royal Hawaiian.

                                  SANG MIN
                    Two jobs.  Very commendable.  Only 
                    I'm afraid the kind of money we're 
                    talking about might be out of your

                    form of payment --

      He suddenly reacts to something.  Removes his hand from her

      Kono's dress hits the floor.  And she's now standing before 
      them in only her bra and panties.  Sang Min rises.

                    I said turn around...

      She does.  Nothing but bronzed skin and cotton.  Sang Min 
      circles her.  No wires.  She can feel him behind her.  His 
      breath on her neck.  His eyes narrow on a nasty reef scar.  
      He says something in Mandarin.

                    He asked how long she's been 
                    surfing.

                    You need to do a better job 
                    avoiding the reefs.  A person can 
                    lose their life playing in 
                    dangerous waters.

                    I'd like to put my dress back on 
                    now.

      Sang Min gestures; do it.  Returns to his desk.  As Kono 
      dresses -- Sang Min brings up his iPhone and SNAPS a photo:

                    Head.  I wonder what he ll think 
                    when he finds out his father takes 
                    children just like him and puts 
                    them on the streets to be pumped
                    full of black tar heroin, then sold 
                    to strangers like animals.  

      Still, Sang Min is stone.  Cold stare.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    You re going to jail, that s not up 
                    for negotiation.  Your family s 
                    about to lose a husband and father  
                    -- in my eyes, now they re your 
                    victims too.  Trouble is, the law 
                    doesn t see it that way since you 
                    all came here illegally.  Your 
                    wife s from Rwanda, she ll be sent 
                    back -- they both will.  If they're 
                    lucky, they'll make it to a refugee 
                    camp.  And your son -- seven s old 
                    enough to carry a gun for the Hutu 
                    Militia.  I can prevent all that... 
                    but I don t help people who don t 
                    help me.

      Sang Min looks to Chin, then back to McGarrett -- and we see 
      it now: he s SCARED.  

                                  SANG MIN
                    What kind of cops are you?

      On the cut, McGarrett BURSTS out of the manager's office --

      the accelerator -- driving like a madman.

      EXT. PIER 39 - HONOLULU HARBOR - DAY

      -- they come in hot.  McGarrett hits the brakes. Our heroes 
      scramble out and down the pier -- only to find it empty. 
      McGarrett stops a passing DOCK WORKER --

                    We re too late.

      Off their frustration, adrenaline pumping, CAMERA RAMPS BACK, 
      leaving them alone on the empty pier, as we --

      INT. HPD CRUISER - TRAVELING -DAY 

      McGarrett and Danny -- totally on it -- pedal down -- blowing 
      past light traffic.  Up ahead -- the Nimitz Highway --

      EXT. JAYHAWK - MID-AIR - DAY

      McGarrett and Danny check weapons, strap on body armor.   
      Grim, silent.  Eyes scanning for the ship.  Then, Danny s 
      ringtone:  PSYCHO  THEME.  He hesitates, then answers --

                                  DANNY

                      helicopter...

      As McGarrett racks the slide on his Sig with a loud CLICK -- 
      am ominous sound the underscores how life-or-death this is --

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Listen, just do me a favor?  Tell

                            sees her again?)
                    ... tell her Danno loves her.  

      ... a beat, and he hangs up.  Finds McGarrett's eyes on him.  
      A look that says:  Tell me already.   Fuck it:

                    from the -- from the altitude.  
                          (off McGarrett s grin)
                    Leave me alone.  

      SUDDENLY -- OVER the headphones:

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT
                      Commander, I have a visual.  Three 
                    o'clock.

      McGarrett looks out, and there s the container ship just 
      ahead.  It's a big one.  15,000 TEU (Twenty-foot equivalent 
      unit).  Forty foot shipping containers stacked 6 high.

      EXT. JAYHAWK - MID-AIR - DAY

      The Jayhawk BANKS HARD, heading for the ship -- 

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Container ship Emma Maersk, this is 
                    Jayhawk 25 calling you on channel 
                    16, over.

      EXT. JAYHAWK - MID-AIR - CONTINUOUS

      NO RESPONSE -- the pilot tries again:

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT (CONT D)
                    Captain Emma Maersk, you are 
                    ordered to alter your course and 
                    return to port.  Do you understand, 
                    over?

      Long, crackling silence.  McGarrett and Danny meet eyes: 

                                  DANNY
                    Looks like we re being ignored.

                    Get us as close as you can!

      INT. CREW QUARTERS - CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP - DAY

      HESSE -- urgent -- on a wall phone.  ELTSIN behind him.

                                  HESSE
                    They ll try and board us. 

      INT. PILOTHOUSE - CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP - INTERCUTTING:

      TIGHT: The CAPTAIN. On the phone -- 

                                  HESSE  (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Whatever happens, do not stop this 
                    ship.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 57.

      EXT. JAYHAWK - MID-AIR - DAY

      The Pilot swoops in low.  McGarrett and Danny take off their 
      helmets, SLIDE OPEN the cargo door, YELLING over the engine:

                                  DANNY
                    How do you wanna do this?!

      In response, McGarrett LEAPS.  Hits the container, rolls onto 
      his side -- a perfect military parachute landing fall (PLF).

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)
                    Of course.

      Danny hesitates -- no choice really -- JUMPS too:

      EXT. CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP - TRAVELING - DAY

      -- and hits the deck, smashing his left arm on a large valve.  

      As McGarrett runs to him: BANG BANG!  They immediately take 
      on gunfire.  CREW MEMBERS with AK-47 s rush the deck --  

      McGarrett and Danny return fire, covering each other as they 
      weave through the narrow passageways between containers.  And 
      our guys are dead-on shots, as one-by-one they pick off the 
      crew -- leaving only Hesse and Elstin.  The hunt is on.   

      At the end of the passageway, Danny breaks left -- going 
      after Elstin, McGarrett right -- going after Hesse. 

      Eltsin is SHOT in the ankle, goes down, tries to get up but 
      Danny is THERE to disarm him -- using his knee to keep him 
      down, ties on the flex cuffs:

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Don t make me shoot you again.

      MEANWHILE: McGarrett, in full pursuit -- reloading as he 
      ducks for cover -- sees movement up ahead.  Heads for it.  
      Weapon aimed.  Eyes over the sight.  Comes around a corner -- 
      rushing the container -- nobody.  Then -- BLAM!  BLAM!  
      There s Hesse, climbing the side of a container.

      INT. PILOTHOUSE - CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP - TRAVELING - DAY

      The Captain, watching from the Pilothouse window, suddenly 
      feels cold steel pressed against the side of his head.  It s:

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Stop the ship now.

      EXT. CHINESE CONTAINER SHIP - DAY

      As the Captain kills the engines, the huge ocean swells begin 
      to rock the slowing vessel as McGarrett climbs the container 
      after Hesse.  As he crests the top: BANG!    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 58.

      Hesse FIRES at him -- McGarrett catches a rung before falling 
      -- but not before losing his Sig -- it CLATTERS to the deck, 
      slides away.

      Hesse races off.  McGarrett gets his wind and regains footing 
      -- accelerates after Hesse -- across container roofs.  Never 
      breaking stride.  Six foot gap ahead.  Hesse LONG JUMPS it.  
      McGarrett's right there -- jumping --

      As Hesse raises his CZ-TT .45.  BLAM!  McGarrett's leg 
      explodes crimson just as he TACKLES HESSE -- Hesse s gun 
      slides away as they both SLAM down on the container top -- 

      Adrenaline forces McGarrett on through the pain -- they 
      stagger up -- brutal HAND-TO-HAND -- on unsteady footing -- 
      exchanging punishing blows -- there's also the matter of 
      Hesse being a master at mixed martial arts, which he breaks 
      out to great effect on McGarrett.  Meanwhile: 

      The .45 skitters across the container roof -- back and forth  
      -- propelled by the motion of the ship -- McGarrett goes DOWN 
      -- Hesse pulls a knife from his pocket -- that's when 
      McGarrett sees it -- the .45 -- just sitting there at the far 
      end of the container -- the rocking of the ship about to 
      slide it back -- But there's no time -- Hesse is advancing --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You should know something about 
                    your brother...

                                  HESSE
                    What about him?

      McGarrett buys himself an extra second.  All the time he 
      needs: the .45 slides back -- lands in McGarrett's reach --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He died the same way you did.

      BLAM!  Hesse is blown backwards -- off the container -- off 
      the ship -- into the churning Pacific.  Holy shit!  McGarrett 
      slowly gets to his feet.  Body wracked.  Leaking blood.  His 
      gun hand drops to his side as he steps to the edge of the 
      container and looks down.

      Hesse never surfaces.

      Overhead, the chopper circles.  Coast Guard cutters approach.  
      McGarrett sees Danny leading Eltsin below.

                                  DANNY
                    What do you want me to do with him?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Book 'em, Danno.

      Danny drills him with a look -- though, with a smirk:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 59.

                                  DANNY

                    that?

      EXT. WAIMEA BAY - DAY

      Sitting in the sand, staring out at the water are McGarrett 
      (crutches beside him) and MARY.  He s just filled her in -- 
      she s, upset, trying to make sense of it: 

                                  MARY
                    ... I don t understand... 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    When I opened the box, there were 
                    these photos... and a key to dad s 
                    desk. I found an envelope inside 
                    with all these weird things: an 
                    opera ticket, postcards from Osaka -

                                  MARY
                    -- what are they?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know.  But he kept them for 
                    a reason. 
                          (then, the kicker)
                    Mar, the photos were taken at a

                    date she died was written on them.  

      Sledgehammer.  Mary s eyes -- blinking -- what?

                                  MARY
                    What do you mean --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    She didn t die in a car accident.  
                    Mom was murdered. 
                          (beat: her SHOCK)
                    A car bomb.  I think Dad believed 
                    it was meant for him.  That s why 
                    he was apologizing on the phone.

      She s stunned silent.  Mind tumbling.  

                                  MARY
                    Who-- who wanted to kill him?  I 
                    mean, why would--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know yet.

      examining her father, her life, in a nanosecond:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 60.

                                  MARY
                    ... why didn t he just tell us the 
                    truth?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We were kids.  

                                  MARY
                    So he sent us away... to protect 
                    us?

      McGarrett stares: yeah.  Mary looks off.  For a long beat, 
      she s quiet.  Then, softly:

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    All those years he let me hate him 
                    for that.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Maybe hating him... was the 
                    sacrifice he lived with.  So we 
                    could grow up without being afraid. 

      And that brings it right to the surface for her.  Eyes well, 
      as she stares at him... 

                                  MARY
                    Except now I m scared for you. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t be.  
                          (beat, thoughtfully)
                    This is where I belong... I think 
                    it s why I spent so much time 
                    running away from it. 

      And she sees he means it.  Their look HOLDS. 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Whatever happened.  Why it 
                    happened.  I m gonna find out.   
                    I promise you.

                                  MARY
                    You don t owe me anything.  I m the 
                    one who should be--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- no.

      INT. STATE POLICE TASK FORCE HQ - LOLANI PALACE - DAY

      Outside a MAMMOTH WINDOW is a stunning view of the ocean. 
      DOLLY PAST WORKERS filling the space with equipment.  INTO 
      FRAME comes McGarrett, on crutches.  Slowly, we TRACK AROUND 
      to face him in CLOSE UP: his eyes.  New beginnings.  He sees 
      Danny unloading boxes at a desk... hobbles over...

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    We get a trace on the call Sang Min 
                    made to the precinct?

                                  DANNY
                    No.  Whoever it is is using a VOIP 
                    number.  The trace ends at the 
                    server.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We got us a mole to find.  

    A beat.  McGarrett drops a HOTEL KEY HOLDER on Danny s desk:

                                  DANNY
                    What s that?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Three nights at the Kahala Hotel. 
                          (Danny stares: surprised)
                    Look, I know you re gonna say no -- 

                                  DANNY
                    Yes.  I m gonna say no.  What is it 
                    with you and my living 
                      arrangements? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Grace is coming over this weekend, 
                    right?  I hear this place has a 
                    pool and you can swim with the 
                    dolphins. 
                          (then)
                    Just take it. 

      Long beat.  Finally, Danny does.  Genuinely touched:

                                  DANNY
                    ... thank you.  

      McGarrett GRINS.  No way around it: they dig each other.

      It s LATER, a glorious red SUNSET -- the place is empty now, 
      only McGARRETT, DANNY, CHIN and KONO -- sitting around a 
      table sharing celebratory BEERS -- and slowly, we DOLLY 
      AROUND THEM -- LAUGHING -- a sense of improv, of fun -- a 
      sense, above all, they ll make one helluva team:

                                  CHIN
                    How about: A'ohe hana nui ka  
                    alu'ia -- it means:  No task is too 
                    big when done together.  

                                  KONO
                    I was thinking more like "Strike 
                    Force."  Or "Hawaii Special 
                    Police." 
                          (their looks: no)
                    "Hawaii Vice?" 

                                  DANNY
                    Slow down, girl, you ain t even 
                    graduated yet -- 

                                  KONO
                    -- next week -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then it s off to Turtle Bay: drunk 
                    tourists, golf cart accidents -- 

                                  CHIN
                    -- how about "IIU."

                          (Kono waves it off)
                    C mon, you got something better?  

      McGarrett has NOTICED something on the wall: a map of the 
      Hawaiian islands with every state numbered.  He stands, 
      ambles over... remembering something... they all watch him 
      looking at the wall... 

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    ... Boss?

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (beat; very quietly)
                    Five-0.  

                                  DANNY
                    What d he say?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It s what my father used to call 
                    our family because we weren t 
                    native Hawaiians. It was his way of 
                    making us feel like we belonged 
                      someplace.  

      That LANDS on everyone.  They feel it too: a sense of 
        belonging... together.  McGarrett steps closer to the map...

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    See?  That s us.  Hawaii.  Five-0.

      INT. GARAGE - MCGARRETT HOME - DAY

      McGarrett closes the old "Champ" toolbox.  Sets it down.  
      Pulls the tarp off the Mercury Broughman.  Cracks the hood.  
      Assesses the work.  Grabs a wrench.  MATCH TO:    

      The same tool in the hands of six-year old STEVE McGARRETT -- 
      as it's handed off to his father --  

      RESUME McGARRETT.  He gets to work -- under the hood -- his 
      way of honoring dad.  Our first real moment of peace... IS

      EXT. BEACH - PLUSH MAUI RESORT - DAY

      Commotion.  A LIFE GUARD ATV blazes by.  Arrives at a crowd 
      gathering around a FEMALE LIFEGUARD who just pulled someone 
      out of the water -- got him breathing again: it's Victor 
      Hesse.  Anemic and dehydrated.  Despite the bullet hole in 
      his shoulder and loss of blood, he tries to get up.  

                                  FEMALE LIFEGUARD
                    Sir, please, you shouldn t move. 
                    You ve been shot. 

      Hesse pushes her out of the way.  Gets to his feet and cuts 
      across the sand -- 

      INT. PLUSH MAUI RESORT - DAY  

      -- Marches through the lobby -- attracting stares -- this 
      waterlogged monster -- leaving puddles in his wake --

      Outside he finds the first VALET on duty --  

                                  HESSE
