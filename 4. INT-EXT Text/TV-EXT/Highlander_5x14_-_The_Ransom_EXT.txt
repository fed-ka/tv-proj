      A steep, twisting road, with switchbacks, hairpin turns, and
      no room for mistakes.  Rounding a corner --

      An old DEUX CHEVAUX (2 CV) grinds slowly up the hill.  At
      the wheel, the ELDERLY DRIVER steers cautiously.  This road
      is more than his nerves can stand.  Then, in the distance,
      we HEAR the full-throated roar of exotic CAR ENGINES coming
      DOWN the mountain.

      ANGLE - FURTHER UP THE HILL

      a gleaming RED FERRARI blasts around a corner, a BLACK PORSCHE
      right on its tail.  They're driving fast and furiously -- on
      a collision course for the old car.

      RESUME - THE DEUX CHEVAUX

      As the Elderly Driver looks up to see --

      ELDERLY DRIVER'S POV - THE RACING CARS

      coming straight at him, side by side, engines roaring as
      they jockey for position.  There's only room for ONE CAR to
      pass without crashing or sailing off the mountain.

      The horrified Elderly Driver shuts his eyes and brakes hard,
      waiting for the impact.

      WIDER

      as at the last second, the PORSCHE brakes -- and the Ferrari
      SPEEDS UP, takes the lead from the Porsche, and SCREAMS PAST
      the old car with inches to spare.

      RESUME - ELDERLY DRIVER

      he opens his eyes, astonished and grateful to be alive. 
      Then he looks down at his pants -- his face falls.

                                      ELDERLY DRIVER
                    Oh, non.

      FOLLOWING THE FERRARI

      as it snarls onto a straightaway, a jagged single-note GUITAR
      starts up ala the JAMES BOND THEME.  The THEME SWELLS as the
      Ferrari shrinks in the distance.


      An elegant building on beautifully kept grounds.  The FERRARI
      wheels up beside a collection of expensive cars parked in
      front.  As the Ferrari's DRIVER slides out --

      PAN UP from a pair of beautiful leather shoes, crisp pant-
      legs, to a white-on-white shirt inside a tux.

      The driver's hands snap his CUFFS with a practiced motion,
      straighten a BOW TIE with an elegant tug.  Then camera MOVES
      UP, and we see the driver is --

      RICHIE

      playing the role of wealthy playboy to the hilt.  He turns
      as the BLACK PORSCHE rumbles into the drive, and the beautiful
      BLOND DRIVER gives him a look that suggests he's an idiot.

      Richie flashes a sardonic, patronizing Bond smile.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Don't feel bad.  I'm a pro.

      She shakes her head and roars away.  Richie turns to see the
      PARKING ATTENDANT watching him with a bemused look.  Richie
      straightens his tie, trying to recover his dignity.  He hands
      him the keys and heads for the Casino.  The Attendant rolls
      his eyes.


      The PARKING ATTENDANT closes the Ferrari door for Marina. 
      She's behind the wheel, Richie in the passenger seat,
      definitely feeling woozy.  He's slurring slightly.

                                      RICHIE
                    I really can drive.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 6. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

                                      MARINA
                    I insist.

      Marina pulls out with a wild lurch, spinning the tires.  As
      they fishtail out of the drive --

                                      RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Okay.  Jus' watch out for a blonde
                    inna black Porsche.


      Marina pulls the Ferrari into a roadside stop.  Richie is
      blinking, struggling to keep his eyes open.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why we stopping here?

                                      MARINA
                    Because I thought you might want to.

      Richie straightens into a semblance of sexy charm.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good idea.  'S perfect....
                          (earnest)
                    And so are you, Marina... You're
                    perfect.

      He leans toward her, aiming for a kiss -- just as Marina
      slips OUT.  Richie flops into the vacant seat.

      Richie straightens, to see EDOUARD standing beside Marina. 
      Richie bridles, staggers from the car.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you're the waiter guy.

                                      EDOUARD
                    So?

                                      RICHIE
                    We'll have another.

      Richie steps forward -- and falls flat on his face.

                                      MARINA
                          (dismayed)
                    How much did you give him?

                                      EDOUARD
                          (shrugs)
                    One dose.  Fifty milligrams.  Like
                    the farmer said.

                          (beat)
                    Edward, that's the dose for a horse.

      Edouard shrugs and takes the driver's seat.  Marina sits by
      Richie.  Richie sinks into a warm, fuzzy world.

                                      RICHIE
                    Where we goin'?

                                      MARINA
                    My place.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good.  Wake me up when we get there.

      His head slides down onto Maria's chest.  Edouard glares at
      him, annoyed.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Does he have to do that?

                                      MARINA
                    He's unconscious.

                                      EDOUARD
                            (suspicious)
                    He's American.  They have a ridiculous
                    obsession with breasts.

                                      MARINA
                    Edward?  Just shut up and drive.
                          (beat)
                    We got our millionaire.

      She gives him a triumphant look.  The Ferrari pulls onto the
      road, with the kidnapped Richie inside --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

13061306OMITTED


      MacLeod is coming out of a shop with a few groceries --
      baguette, bottle of wine.  He reacts to the sight of

      HIS CITROEN

      Being hooked up to a TOW TRUCK.

      MACLEOD

      rushes over, waving at the TOW DRIVER.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Hey!  Hey!  Stop!
                          (trying French)
                    Arrette!

      The Driver looks over to JAMES FOULARD, forties, a humorless
      man in a suit, carrying a small notebook.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (to Foulard)
                    What's going on here?

                                      FOULARD
                    James Foulard, Mr. MacLeod.
                          (to the Driver)
                    Go ahead.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But that's my car!

                                      FOULARD
                    You will get your car back when I
                    get mine.

      He slaps an official-looking document against MacLeod's chest.

                                      FOULARD (CONT'D)
                    See you in court.

      MacLeod fumbles to look over the court order.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What the hell is this about?

                                      FOULARD
                    Don't play with me.  I want my
                    Ferrari.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What Ferrari?

                                      FOULARD
                    Your name and address were given as
                    security.

                                      MACLEOD
                    By who?

                                      FOULARD
                    A young American.  He took it from
                    my dealership for a test drive...
                    and it has not come back.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And he gave you my address?  That's
                    all?

                                      FOULARD
                    He left this.

      He takes a PASSPORT from his suit, holds it out.  MacLeod
      takes it and glances at it --

      INSERT - THE OPEN PASSPORT

      the name is "Richard Redstone," but the photo is RICHIE.

      MacLeod reacts to the face.

                                      FOULARD (CONT'D)
                    So you know him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who doesn't know Red Richovich?

                                      FOULARD
                    Who?  It says here his name is
                    Redstone.

      MacLeod looks around to make sure no one is listening, then
      speaks in hushed tones.

                                      MACLEOD
                    An alias.  Richovich is a hired killer
                    for the Russian Mafia.  One of the
                    most dangerous men in Europe.  Do
                    you know where he is now?

                                      FOULARD
                    He was last seen at Casino Montecour
                      yesterday.  Since that... nothing.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re the paper work)
                    So you took it to the police.

                                      FOULARD
                    Of course.

      MacLeod nods sympathetically, puts an arm over his shoulder
      as he steers him out of the Driver's earshot.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Have you sufficient life insurance?
                          (beat)
                    You know what they do to informants.

                                      FOULARD
                    I do?

      MacLeod demonstrates as he describes the gruesome torture.

                                      MACLEOD
                    First they take these large fish
                    hooks and they put them in your nose. 
                    Then they pull them behind your head
                    to expose Your Adam's apple.  Then
                    they bring out the leeches and then...
                    trust me, you don't want to hear the
                    rest.

                                      FOULARD
                    I don't?

      With a significant look at the innocent-looking Driver:

                                      MACLEOD
                    They say they have people...
                      everywhere.

      Foulard pales visibly.

                                      FOULARD
                    What do I do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tell the police it was a mistake. 
                    I'll see what I can do about the
                    car.

                                      FOULARD
                    I'll be forever grateful.

                    Unhook it.

                    Unhook it, I tell you.  Idiot, you
                    have the wrong car!

      Foulard hurriedly gets in his own car as the Driver starts
      to unhook the Citroen.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Have a nice day.

      Foulard takes off.  MacLeod turns back as the Driver lowers
      his car back to the pavement.  The Citroen sinks alarmingly
      on one side, the tire flat from the hookup.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Richie.  This better be good.


      A beautiful chateau, seemingly deserted.  The red Ferrari is
      parked in the drive.  OVER, we hear a loud GROAN.


      MacLeod pulls up in the Citroen.  He looks older: a little
      grey on the temples, glasses -- he has aged a graceful twenty
      years.

      A PARKING ATTENDANT approaches the window.  MacLeod looks in
      the car mirror, checking his altered look.  As CAMERA PUSHES
      into the mirror --

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    Just trying to show you a good time.

      PULL BACK as MacLeod's beautiful girlfriend DESIREE checks
      her face in the bike's mirror, while MacLeod hauls his big
      MOTO GUZZI onto the kickstand.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Desiree, the tables are
                    waiting.

                                      DESIREE
                          (reproving)
                    Duncan, you're a madman.  Three
                    hundred miles in three hours? Look
                    at my hair.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (smiles)
                    Desiree, no matter what you do, you're
                    still going to be beautiful.

      He pulls her away from the mirror and they head for the
      Casino, passing a brace of racy cars and bikes.


      In the darkness, a sinister BLACK CAR pulls up quietly.  The
      door opens, and a LOW ANGLE reveals DARK BOOTS landing on
      the ground.  They start towards the Chateau.


      ANGLE - THE BLACK CAR

      As a sinister BLACK SILHOUETTE moves away from it, towards
      the Chateau.  A gleaming BLADE comes out, glints in the night --
      an Immortal's sword.


      Richie wobbles to his feet, shaking off the fall.  The BEDPOST
      is still attached.  He turns toward the BUZZ --

      THE IMMORTAL is approaching in the dark.

      Richie swings up the huge bedpost to defend himself with.

                                      RICHIE
                    Okay, pal, I'm ready for you.

      MACLEOD

      steps into the light.  He takes in the handcuffs, the raised
      bedpost, and lowers his sword.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let me guess.  Halloween?

      Richie lowers the bedpost in relief.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, what are you doing here?  And
                    what the hell happened to your hair?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Never mind that.  You're not even
                    supposed to be in France!  You died
                    here, remember?

                                      RICHIE
                    I know, but I got a new identity.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Right.  Richie Redstone, international
                    car thief.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I didn't steal it, I was kidnapped! 
                    Held against my will!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (doubtful)
                    By Marina LeMartin, a twenty-year
                    old mortal girl?

                                      RICHIE
                    Not alone.  She's got an unemployed
                    painter with her.  They think I'm a
                      millionaire.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re the post)
                    So now you're stealing her furniture?
                          (settling in)
                    This should be good.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, she's gonna lose the family
                    chateau.  The Baron lost all their
                    money, and unless she marries the
                    guy who holds the loan, they're out
                    on the street.
                          (beat)
                    She really needs two-hundred thousand
                    francs.

      MacLeod sees his deep concern, and twigs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You wouldn't be falling for this
                    Marina LeMartin, by any chance?

                                      RICHIE
                    How come, every time it's a girl,
                    you always assume --
                          (beat)
                    Alright, maybe I like her a little.
                    But I really want to help her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then why are you running away?

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm not... I just... I felt... Oh,
                    man.  I gotta get back inside before
                    they find I'm gone.

      There's a LOUD SCREAM from inside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think they know.

      And OFF Richie's look --


      Birds chirp.  All seems peaceful and normal.


      as OVER WE HEAR.

                                      CARLO (V.O.)
                    Richard Redstone?


                                      MACLEOD
                    Ten million francs?  Are you out of
                    your mind?

      MacLeod stares across a cup of coffee at Richie.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    That's two million dollars Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    I m supposed to be a millionaire.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But you re not a millionaire
                          (beat)
                    Listen, Pinocchio.  Not only don't
                    you have two million dollars... but
                    you owe someone a new Ferrari!

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't remind me.
                          (beat)
                    Mac, I was thinking.  You think
                    there's any way you might be
                      interested?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (seeing it coming)
                    No.

                                      RICHIE
                    C'mon, Mac.  You even told Marina it
                    was a good investment.  It would
                    make a great hotel!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It probably would.  But a million
                    dollars by Friday?
                          (beat)
                    It's not gonna happen, Richie.

      Richie sags in despair.

                                      RICHIE
                    What am I gonna tell her?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why not try something different for
                    a change?
                          (off Richie s look)
                    The truth.


      Marina is standing in the drive, a small suitcase beside
      her, waiting for Carlo.  MacLeod steps up beside her.

                    I know what the chateau must mean to
                    you.
                          (beat)
                    But it's not worth the price you're
                    paying.

      Marina fights back tears.

                                      MARINA
                    Mr. MacLeod... please, don't make it
                    any harder.

      ANGLE - THE DRIVE

      Carlo's BIG MERCEDES rolls up.  As Carlo climbs out, MacLeod
      makes a last pitch.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What about Richie?

                                      MARINA
                    He'll forget me in time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe, but will you forget him?

      She reacts, biting her lip.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We'll find another way.

      Carlo holds the door for her.

                                      CARLO
                    Come, my love, we haven't got all
                    day.

                                      MARINA
                          (to MacLeod)
                    I have no choice.

      She gets in.  Carlo turns to MacLeod.

                                      CARLO
                    We'll send you an invitation to the
                    wedding.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Don't do this, Carlo.

                                      CARLO
                    I'd love to stay and chat.

      He climbs in, shuts the door and leans out.  He holds up his
      watch to the light.

                                      CARLO (CONT'D)
                    But we really have a great deal to
                    do... Ciao.

      CLOSE - THE WATCH

      the SAME WATCH MacLeod wore in 1978!


      The old 2-CV is chugging up the hill.  As it does, the FERRARI
      takes a tight corner heading down the road.  It blasts past,
      horn blaring.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 46. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

      The 2-CV swerves, lurches to the side of the road, and we
      HEAR --

                                      ELDERLY DRIVER (V.O.)
