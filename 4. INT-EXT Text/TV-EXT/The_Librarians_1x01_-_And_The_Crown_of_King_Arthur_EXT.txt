      CHYRON: "PARIS"

      ESTABLISH the INDUSTRIAL AREA.  It's the Paris tourists don't
      see: warehouses and slum buildings jammed against ancient
        architecture and winding alleys.

      A HEAVYSET THUG emerges from one of the Warehouses. He looks
      around.  No one.  Satisfied, he steps back inside.  

      ZOOM BACK from his door to find a FULL SQUAD of anti-terrorist
      soldiers hidden behind the burned out trucks. 

      One Soldier runs to the join another SQUAD hidden behind the
      building. She pulls off her helmet: meet British Counter-
      terrorism COLONEL EVE BAIRD.  Baird (no one calls her "Eve",
      not even her mother) spends two hours at the gun range every
      weekend, speaks five languages.  No one's seen her smile. 
      Ever. 

                                      BAIRD 
                          (into mic)
                    This is team leader, we have
                      confirmation on a weapon of mass
                      destruction inside the building.

                                                                                SLAM TO:


                                      BAIRD
                          (into mic)
                    ... or we may all die.  But I will
                    be very angry first, and you do not
                    want that.                                                                                        2.

      A SOLDIER next to her snorts.  She glances at him.  He gulps. 

                                      SOLDIER
                    No ma'am, your anger is ... umm.

      Glaring, she lowers her helmet, charges forward. 

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm on Alpha. On my mark, Beta team
                    breach in three, two, one -


      Baird's squad spots the scrum of terrorists as they dash
      from the Warehouse into the winding streets.  

                                      BAIRD
                    Two to the left. Two right!

      The soldiers split off.  Alone, she rounds a corner and sees
      Adel and Sami heading for an old CHURCH.


      CHYRON "NEW YORK CITY - THE NEXT DAY" 

      PROFESSOR JONAS SHEIR rushes though the crowded streets.
      He's an action-hero Professor, wiry and handsome.  But now
      he's running scared, carrying THICK FILES stuffed with papers. 

      CHAOTIC FAST CUTS show his paranoia.  He looks back --                                                                                        8.


      -- to spot an older man in the crowd, GALEAS, sleek and
        professional in a finely tailored suit.  European money,
      could've played Bond in his younger days.  He never makes
      eye contact but smiles when Sheir's gaze falls on him.  As
      if he knows.

      The Professor dials his cell, glances again.  Galeas is gone.

                                      SHEIR
                          (into phone)
                    Hello, I must speak to Flynn Carsen.
                    I must speak to the Librarian.


      Sheir climbs the stairs, pushing through the crowd. 

                                      SHEIR
                    Never mind, I'm here! Tell me where --

      Suddenly Galeas appears, nose to nose.  He STABS the Professor
      just below our line of sight.  The Professor chokes, a bit
      of blood coming from his mouth.     

                                      SHEIR (CONT'D)
                    The Crown.  I've found the Crown ...

      Galeas gently takes the cell from him.  The Professor
      collapses, his FILE falling to the ground. 

      As SPECTATORS just begin to notice the fallen man, Galeas
      scoops up the file.  He misses just one PAGE of the file,
      which blows away ...                                                                                        9.



      The page BLOWS across the sidewalk just below the steps. A
      well-travelled BOOT steps on it. 

      We're BEHIND Flynn, in his rough traveling clothes.  He kneels
      and picks up the page.  Then a shot of JUST HIS EYES. 
      Brilliant, even a bit mad. 

      ON THE PAGE is a PRINT of a 1100's PAINTING of KNIGHTS
      FIGHTING BARBARIANS.  One of the knights holds a CROWN.

      Now 3/4 BEHIND Flynn. He looks up, spots the dead man on the
      stairs.  Police run toward the scene.  

      As the officers WIPE across the Librarian, he's gone.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:


        ESTABLISHING the nightlife of London.  Couples walk past
      converted brownstones.  Friends call out, already drunk.

      ON BAIRD as she walks the street in simple travel clothes,
      bag over her shoulder.  She's arguing on a cell phone.  

                                      BAIRD
                          (into phone)
                    No, sir, no I do not need a leave of
                    absence.  I wasn't exposed to
                      radiation.
                          (beat)
                    There's nothing in my report -- him? 
                    He was there, and I'm not saying he
                    was a Librarian, he claimed -- a
                    month on leave?!  What am I --
                          (slapped down)
                    Yes sir.  Thank you.  Sir.

      She hangs up, pushes through the carefree crowd.  Just a
      GLIMPSE at the happiness, a look she's not even aware of.


      Baird considers the front of the Metropolitan Public Library
      cautiously. She enters.


        ESTABLISHING the busy metropolitan hospital.                                                                                         20.


      CHYRON: "MOSCOW"

      Crisp blue skies over heavy buildings built by Czars and
      staffed by ex-Communists.  Tourists enter and exit.


        ESTABLISHING the muscle cars and pickup trucks in the parking
      lot, the big FRONT WINDOW filled with neon beer signs.


      Three, two, one -- Baird and Stone CRASH through the front
      window, roll, and are up and running before the last of the
      glass hits the ground.

      They run to Stone's classic MUSCLE CAR, dive in.  Stone peels
      out as Lamia leaps nimbly out the bar window.  As the car
      fishtails across the lot, Baird looks in the rearview mirror. 
      Lamia throws her a kiss.  This isn't over.


        ESTABLISHING the Library once again, but this time we PRELAP:

                                      EZEKIEL (PRELAP)
                    I don't get why I'm stuck here --


      CHYRON: "MUNICH"

        ESTABLISHING the 16th century aspects of the city, the castles
      and walls and Old World Vibe of the place.


      Flynn and the Candidates burst onto the roof.  He points to
      a METAL SUNDIAL set on one edge of the roof.                                                                                        41.

                                      FLYNN
                    There.


      Baird exits, right into some scaffolding with pulleys and
      wooden loads.  The Assassins are hot on her heels.  Dodging,
      she grabs a ROPE, tangles them up.  One arm, then two.  She
      hops lightly across a pallet, grabs a rope and pulls.

      Baird -- holding the rope -- and the tangled Assassins RISE
      as a load of cement descends.   The Assassins are left
      dangling. Baird steps lightly onto --


      -- directly next to Flynn and the others at the sundial.  He
      reads an INSCRIPTION around the edge.

                                      FLYNN
                    Latin.  "Crown of the Celts lies
                    Seventy Leagues to the Great Woods." 
                    Then there are some coordinates ... 
                          (points)
                    The Black Forest.  The Crown of King
                    Arthur is real, and it's buried in
                    the Black Forest.

      He spots Baird.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Where have you been?  Very exciting
                    stuff is happening!

      He runs off again, Candidates in tow.  Baird sighs.  As she
      crosses, one of the Assassins pulls himself onto the ledge
      of the roof.  Without looking she PUNCHES him back off.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        42.

                                        ACT FOUR


      A RENTED TRUCK stops on an isolated mountain trail in the
      forest. Flynn, Baird and the Candidates pile out, exhausted.

                                      FLYNN
                    We should be within a hundred yards. 
                    Stay in the truck.

                                      BAIRD
                    Spread out and search. 

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Snack break!  And hydrate.  

      Cassandra offers lunch from an adorable backpack.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    I've got sandwiches, cucumbers,
                    crackers, delicious prosciutto ...

                                      STONE
                    People are trying to kill us and you
                    packed a picnic.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    C'mon cowboy, have a little fun.
                    You're on an adventure.

                                      STONE
                    Yep.  This adventure of driving around
                    on bad roads in crappy truck sure
                    beats my day job of driving around
                    on bad roads in a crappy truck.

        A LOW-FLYING HELICOPTER roars overhead. 

                                      FLYNN
                    The Serpent Brotherhood.

                                      BAIRD
                    They have a helicopter.  Why don't
                    we have a helicopter?

                                      FLYNN
                    Because we have a Charlene, and she
                    approved the budget for one truck.
                          (setting off)
                    We still have the advantage.  Any
                    clues to the Crown's location will
                    be down here on ground level.                                                                                          43.

                                      BAIRD
                    They have a helicopter and are trained
                    killers.  You and I have very
                    different definitions of "advantage".


        ESTABLISHING the chopper flying over the woods.


      Outside a London bank GALEAS, walks to a waiting car.

                                      GALEAS
                    Lamia, centuries of planning depend
                    on you outrunning one half-mad
                      Librarian, his part-time bodyguard,
                    and their amateur sidekicks.  You
                    can understand my frustration. 

                                      LAMIA
                    We had some ... issues at the museum.

                                      GALEAS
                    Get the Crown.  Kill whom you must. 
                    But understand, without the Crown it
                    will take us a hundred years to remake
                    the world.  With the Crown, we can
                    do it in a single night.


      Flynn and Baird are still searching. He clears his throat.

                                      FLYNN
                    Good job, by the way.  The Museum.

                                      BAIRD
                    You think about it, we have the same
                    job.  Running around the world,
                    finding dangerous objects ...

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes, important work which is why I
                    need to stay focused.                                                                                        44.

                                      BAIRD
                    I get that.  The whole time I'm home,
                    I'm just thinking about the next
                    job.

                                      FLYNN
                    Exactly.  Don't need friends or family
                      cluttering up my life and I'm just
                    sitting there, can't wait --

                                      BAIRD
                    -- can't wait to get back out there. 
                    Yes.  I get so sick of my ... family
                    and friends.

      That sentence somehow turned into something else, right in
      the middle.  Flynn and Baird share an awkward, honest look.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    For what it's worth, you're nowhere
                    near as annoying as I thought you
                    were in Paris.

                                      FLYNN
                    I think you're -- henge.

      Flynn suddenly runs past her.

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm "henge".  Sweet.


      The others fall in as Flynn paces around a set up UPRIGHT
      STONES like a ruined Stonehenge, but smaller, man-sized.

                                      FLYNN
                    Henge.  Unheard of in this area.
                          (pacing)
                    A second clue to the Crown's burial
                    place. 

      The HELICOPTER ZOOMS overhead, coming in for a landing. 
      Baird's already moving.

                                      BAIRD
                    You solve this, I'll go stall them. 
                          (over him)
                    I'm your Guardian. For now.

                                      FLYNN
                    You're not my Guardian.  But take
                    Ezekiel.

      Baird grabs Ezekiel by the jacket-front, drags him with her.                                                                                        45.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    What, because I'm expendable?!

                                      FLYNN
                    For ancient astronomical puzzles, I
                    need a scientist and a historian. 

                                      BAIRD
                    And you're a little expendable.


      Baird and Ezekiel rush from cover to cover.

                                      BAIRD
                    They'll be spread out in pairs so we
                    can pick them off one team at a time.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    I've sneaked past police in twenty
                      countries, I know what I'm doing.

                                      BAIRD
                    I know, I've read your FBI file.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Well, criminals tend to get those.

                                      BAIRD
                    No.  Your other one.

      Ezekiel freezes.  Baird cocks that eyebrow and continues
      down the hill.  Ezekiel swears quietly and follows her.


      Flynn, Cassandra and Stone circle the Henge, reading.

                                      STONE
                      Astrological symbology in Latin.
                    "When the sun passes through upon
                    the fourth day after solstice ..."  

                                      FLYNN
                    Like Stonehenge, the sun only comes
                    through certain openings on certain
                    hours of certain days.
                          (realizing)
                    You can only read it on one day a
                    year, and that's not today.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    We could recreate the sun's path.                                                                                        46.

                                      FLYNN
                    Over several days months apart,
                      triangulating each position.  I can
                    do the math but it'll take a while.

      Cassandra's in the center of the henge. We SPIN around her.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It won't take me a while.  Where are
                    are we?

                                      STONE
                    The Black Forest.

                                      FLYNN
                    No, she means 48.3 degree North,
                    8.15 degrees East.  At Solstice, the
                    height is 52.5 degrees --

      Cassandra' Gift KICKS IN.  Shimmering planets, arcs and angles
      flood her vision.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The sun's on the ecliptic 23.5 degrees
                    off the celestial equator, equator,
                    equator Solstice degrees add latitude
                    then subtract one degree a day --

                                      FLYNN
                          (concerned)
                      Cassandra.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Find it, 48.5 degrees over that rock,
                    how high's the rock?

                                      STONE
                    About six foot.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Two meters, Cosine 48.5 times ...
                    its shadow ends there.

      Stone crosses to the spot. Flynn reads another rock.

                                      FLYNN
                    "Beneath Venus at Harvest moon."

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Venus's progression across the sky
                    at this latitude is on a fifteen
                    degree arc.                                                                                        47.

                                      FLYNN
                    This part of the world, Harvest was
                    a late October festival.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    October stars stars the Orionid meteor
                    shower from Halley's comet --

      Cassandra's Gift builds.  The images come faster, spinning
      with us, too much, too many images.

                                      FLYNN
                      Cassandra.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Can't stop, Venus is over that rock
                    in late October, line up.

      Flynn and Stone triangulate to a third rock, both run to it.

                                      STONE
                    "But two months march past the rise
                    of Spring as the rise of Kings".

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Vernal equinox, sun crosses the the
                    equator, ninety degree minus latitude
                    plus sixty degrees, rising rising --

      Flynn races to the last rock.  Sights past a notch.

                                      FLYNN
                    Got it.  

      Cassandra collapses in Stone's arms, eyes shut.  Flynn steps
      forward ... but hesitates.  Sees something there, in the two
      of them.  

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Rising into aphelion, farthest from
                    the sun, during summer, that's funny --

                                      STONE
                    What's going on --

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Summer smells, oranges, ugh nothing
                    but oranges all the numbers are smells --

                                      STONE
                    Right, you're a synasthete.  Look,
                    there's a trick. Your sensation --

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Oranges.                                                                                        48.

                                      STONE
                    -- needs context, one place where
                    you remember smelling oranges.  Strong
                    memory, stronger than the smell.

                                      CASSANDRA
                            (concentrating)
                      Breakfast.  Breakfast, I'm twelve.

                                      STONE
                    Good.  Good girl.  Lock in on that.

        Caqssandra's spinning down.  Flynn backs away, not wanting
      to interrupt, just ... the connection got to him.  Stone
      looks to him.  Flynn nods for him to continue, and sets off.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Dad's doing the bills, I balance the
                    checkbook in my head.  He's so proud. 
                    They're so proud.
                          (eyes open)
                    I'm -- how did you do that?

                                      STONE
                    Boccioni, Italian artist in the 1800's
                    was a synesthete.  He mentioned that
                    trick in his memoirs.

      He pulls her up. She wipes tears from her eyes.  

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I think that was the last time they
                    were proud of me.

                                      STONE
                    Parents ain't ever easy, Cassie.

                                      FLYNN  (O.S.)
                    Got it!


      Stone and Cassandra arrive as Flynn cleans dirt off a MOUND,
      where a SIMPLE IRON DOOR is set into the rock.  Stone tugs
      it.  It's sealed shut.

                                      STONE
                    Old iron.  I could cut through it
                    with a welding torch.  Don't suppose
                    we packed one.

                                      FLYNN
                    Actually, Cassandra did.

      He grabs her backpack.                                                                                         49.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    In the truck, there's an oxygen tank
                    in the first aid kit.

      Stone runs off.


      Baird and Ezekiel find the helicopter guarded by one Assassin.

                                      BAIRD
                    They've already moved off.  We need
                    to draw them back here.
                          (beat)
                    Can you hotwire a helicopter, thief?

      Ezekiel just grins.


      Baird PLOWS into the Assassin.  Ezekiel rushes the chopper,
      pries open a side panel with a found CROWBAR.


      Lamia leads four Assassins.  She hears a CAR DOOR slam.

                                      LAMIA
                    Up there, I think I heard --

      Then the sound of a HELICOPTER engine roars to life.  As
      one, they run back to the chopper.


      Stone tosses Flynn a small breather OXYGEN TANK.  Flynn pulls
      off the attached mask as Cassandra hollows out the CUCUMBER.

                                      STONE
                    Pure oxygen'll just burn off.

                                      FLYNN
                    You need a high energy medium to
                    sustain the flame, to create the
                    thermic lance.  Most use metal, like
                      magnesium, but high protein meat ... 

      He hands Stone the ad-hoc cutting torch.  Stone LIGHTS the
      torch.  It burns INSANELY hot.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Bacon's better, but prosciutto is
                    rich enough.  I'll be back.

      Flynn runs off.                                                                                        50.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He made a cutting torch out of a
                    picnic lunch.

      Stone begins to CUT the iron seal with the torch.

                                      STONE
                    This is exactly like my day job.


      One Assassin drops as Baird KICKS another.  In the BG we see
      Ezekiel DODGING two of the men.  Lamia crosses, exchanges
      blows with Baird. It's brutal, close up.  They separate.

                                      LAMIA
                    You should come work for us.

                                      BAIRD
                    I like the Librarian.  He's weird,
                    but he's interesting.

      Lamia's SWORD is suddenly in her hand.

                                      LAMIA
                    I'll tell him that when I kill him.

      Lamia slashes, Baird dodges.  They're both fast, but Lamia's
      sword tags Baird.  As she goes down, Lamia's sword sweeps in --

      CLANG. Flynn's blocking it with the crowbar.

                                      FLYNN
                    Trade you.

      Baird rolls away, launches into an Assassin holding Ezekiel. 
      Flynn and Baird exchange blows, sword on crowbar.

                                      LAMIA
                    You brought a crowbar to a sword
                    fight.

                                      FLYNN
                    I had a very good teacher. I'll make
                    do.

      ON BAIRD as she finds Ezekiel. He begins to run away.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    We do not want to be here!

      The helicopter suddenly gives off a WHINE.  Lamia's
      distracted.                                                                                        51.

                                      FLYNN
                    Gas tank three meters high,
                      overheating coil in the tail rotor
                      conversion assembly, blast will be --

      Flynn DUCKS as the helicopter EXPLODES.  


      Flynn catches up with Baird and Ezekiel.

                                      EZEKIEL
                      Helicopters are incredibly dangerous
                    things.  They're like halfway to
                    blowing up just sitting there.

      They arrive as Stone kills the thermic lance, pries open the
      small VAULT DOOR.  Flynn reaches inside and pulls out an
      ancient, jeweled CIRCLET.  The crown of a Celtic King.

                                      FLYNN
                      Congratulations.  We've done what no
                    Librarian has accomplished in the
                    last thousand years.  We found the
                    Crown of King Arthur.

      A moment of awe.  Then KNIVES thud into the trees.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    And this is the part where we run.


      Flynn and the others pile back into the truck.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    There seems to be quite a lot of
                    running!

                                      FLYNN
                    You get used to it!

      Flynn jams the truck into gear.  Lamia and the Assassins
      burst from the trees, but the truck is already hurtling down
      the mountain path and disappearing into the Bavarian fog.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        52.
