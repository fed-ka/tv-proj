      The Lady, bathed in electric luminescence, noble and
      mysterious on her island in the night... Far off a lonely
      FOGHORN SOUNDS...

                                                                CUT TO:



      Decay and disrepair have long since extinguished any nightlife
      this neighborhood might have supported. Tennants have fled the
        near-crumbling buildings. Commercial establishments once
      pockmarking the street are now barren, tomblike.


      A yellow cab slides INTO FRAME and stops.



        The cab pulls away, accelerates. She watches its tail lights
        fade into the darkness, draws her coat about her to ward off
        the chill, then starts down the sidewalk, her footsteps
        LOUD, echoing in the oppressive silence...

        CATHY. MULTIPLE SHOTS - HIGH AND LOW ANGLE, TRACKING WITH

        her as she walks through the lifeless landscape... very much
        alone...

        CLOSE - CATHY

        as she stops, listens... hears nothing. But she feels a
        presence. She looks warily up and down the empty street, the
          gnawing fear in her belly closing into an icy fist... Just as
        she starts forward, A HAND shoots out of the darkness, CLAMPS
        ON HER SHOULDER. She whirls, a startled cry breaking as she
        bats the hand away with a classic self-defense move, to see


          VINCENT

        step from the shadows, phantom-like, yet regal.

                                      VINCENT
                        Catherine...

        She sags with relief; he steadies her.

                                      CATHY
                         Vincent... You startled me.

                          You were right to be afraid. This is
                          a dangerous place. I sensed your
                          fear.

                                        CATHY
                          I'm supposed to meet a witness. He
                          set the time and place.

                                        VINCENT
                          Can you trust him?

                                        CATHY
                          I think it's worth the gamble.

                                        VINCENT
                            Sometimes your fear can keep you
                          alive. You should listen to it more
                          often.

                          I have to go alone.I gave my
                          word.

                                        VINCENT
                          Then: know I'll be near.

            She smiles tenderly, gratefuly... A long beat... then she
            leaves him... STAY WITH VINCENT as Cathy walks up the empty
            street, deeply concerned for her, yet moved by her courage. He
            slips OUT of FRAME, disappearing into the shadows.


            NIGHT

            creaking in the wind, weatherbeaten and faded... "BAR &

            TILT DOWN to FIND CATHY walking up the street...

            PAST CATHY

            as she stops, taking in the old building... the windows are
            boarded up, but LIGHT SEEPS between the boards. Someone's
            inside...

  She goes to the door, tries the handle... the DOOR SCREECHES
    OPEN... She hesitates, reaching down inside herself for
    strength, then goes IN...

    Vincent is going up the fire escape. He reaches the landing
  on the second floor, crouches there... He twists the
    trusted door knob, it breaks off in his powerful hand.



        A car is approaching. Its HEADLIGHTS cut OFF as it nears the
        bar, whispers into the curb. It's an old El Dorado ragtop.
        The top is UP.

                                                                    CUT TO:

              pile from the car in a stylized, flashy way... They line up
                facing the bar... CAMERA MOVES down the line, giving us a
              look at each...

                PYTHON... a small, gaunt man in his twenties, slicked back
              hair and ferral eyes. The .357 Python he carries looks
                outsized in his small hand...

                HOWIE... a huge hulk of a man. It's hard to tell how old
              he is, but his brain never made it past ten or eleven.
                Probably early twenties. He cradles a pump shotgun;
              it looks like a toy in his meaty grip...

                CHEECH... Short and stocky, a bodybuilder. Buzz cut hair.
              He carries a .45 auto...

                TONY... Tall and lithe, the build of an athlete. Mid-
                twenties, a 9 mm. auto is his weapon of choice.

                CHRIS... The leader of the Silks... Handsome in a cruel,
                challenging way. Sculpted hair, Elvis-style, hawk-like
                features- Charismatic and dangerous. He's Tony's younger
                brother, but obviously in command. He methodically taps a
              PIPE BOMB against the palm of his hand.

                      Let's go see what's left.

    The group moves toward the bar's entrance. Howie looks
      worried, ill at ease, like a child that knows he's being
    bad...

      Sco swings at her, misses. She moves on him, but Dice grabs

      runs wildly across the street, almost hit a number of times,
        disappears into the shadows on the other side...

      Vincent moves along the darkened street, ducking back into
      al1eymouths and shadowy alcoves when cars or people pass. He's

      ready. Chris leads them toward the alley, wary and cautious...


      They step into the mouth of the alley, guns up, ready to
        fire...

      It's more an alcove than an alley -- a dead end. And no

                        He must have gotten out. They
                        didn't find his... body.

          Isaac looks around, spots a couple of winos on a bench
          across the street.

                                        ISAAC.

          The 1st Wino tilts his brown bag; the bottle inside is empty. Be
          looks at her expectantly... Cathy gets money from her purse,
          gives it to him.

                                          ACT THREE



        FADE IN:


        The camera FOLLOWS Vincent as he makes his way slowly down
        the street, past a row of delapidated tenements. He stays
        close to the buildings, feeling his way along the walls,
          hugging the shadows, his features hidden by his hooded cloak.
        From the way he moves, it's obvious that he's hurt and in
        pain, his vision still badly impaired.

                                                                  CUT TO:



        The small street Vincent has been following intersects here with
        a broader avenue; along the the block we see various closed
        shops, most pretty seedy (pawnshops, used clothing stores, a
        greasy spoon, etc.), with apartments above them. Most are shut
        for the evening, but a half-block down a strip joint called
        SQUEAKY'S is open, its neon lights reflecting off the wet
        pavement. There's a cluster of activity down by the strip joint,
        and PARKED CARS all along the block. A couple of CABS and a car
        or two whiz by the intersection, until the TRAFFIC LIGHT at the
        corner turns red.

          VINCENT

          emerges from the side street, crouching low, wrapped in his
        cape. He SCRAMBLES quickly across the sidewalk, and crouches
        low between two parked cars near the corner. But there's no
        real cover here, and he's painfully exposed, and he knows it...
        but his escape is somewhere in the middle of this street.


          VINCENT'S POV

        We PAN as he scans the intersection, trying to makesome
          sense of these twisted shadows and blobs of coloredlights.
        The street is a distorted blur. Be can see motion,shadow,
        the headlights of passing cars, but everything is
          indistinct. The neon of the strip joint flickers on and off,
        but so blurred that he cannot discern what it is. But he does
          recognize the steady RED eye of the traffic light. We HOLD on
        it as Vincent stares, waiting for it to change.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/12/8729.

      ANGLE ON EL DORADO

      as it pulls up to the intersection and stops for the light.
      Chris drums his fingers against the wheel impatiently.

                                  COZY
                    Where'd he go??

                                    CHRIS
                    He's around here somewhere.He
                    can't get too far.

      His cold eyes flick around restlessly. We INTERCUT between
      Chris and Vincent, crouching by the cars, waiting for his
      chance.

                                  COZY
                            (she leans over the
                              seat, puts her arms
                              around him)
                    Know what...?

      The light TURNS, and Chris floors the accelerator. The El
      Dorado roars out of the intersection, throwing Cozy back in
      the rear seat. Miss patricia LAUGHS.

                                                                CUT to:

      VINCENT POV


      The blur of the traffic light goes from red to green.

      THE INTERSECTION
      With a speed born of desperation, Vincent darts across the the
      street, crouched low. He STOPS in the middle of the
        intersection, drops to his knees.

      VINCENT

      A drainage grate is clearly visible a few feet to his right --
      his sanctuary, the road that will take him underground and
      home. But he can't see it, black metal against the rain-slick
      black asphalt. Be feels for it with his hands, slowly widening
      his search.

      visible in the far b.g.

                      Shut the hell up, both of you.

      As he speaks, Chris' eyes flick to rear-view mirror and he
        REACTS.

        INSERT - REAR VIEW MIRROR

        Vincent's cloaked, hooded form is clearly visible, still
        groping for the drainage grate.

        SERIES OF SHOTS


        intercutting between Vincent and the El Dorado...

      a) Chris smiles with icy savagery and spins the wheel hand
      over hand...

      b) The El Dorado skids into a tire-smoking 180 turn...

      c) Vincent's FINGERS brush against the edge of the iron
        drainage grate.

      d) Chris floors the gas pedal; the E1 Dorado leaps forward
      with a squeal of rubber, picking up speed fast....

      e) Vincent grasps the edge of the heavy drainage grate,
      his fingers trying to find purchase on its slick edges.
      He HEARS the SOUND of the El Dorado, looks up, SEES the
        oncoming LIGHTS briefly...

      f) Chris grins and TURNS OUT HIS LIGHTS.

      g) From VINCENT'S POV, the on-coming car is gone. He turns his
        attention back to the drainage grate, pulls the edge of it up,
      gets his hands underneath it and begins to shift it to one
        aide...

      h) As the car bears down on Vincent, Howie grabs the
        steering wheel at the last minute...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)      Rev.31.

      against a parked car. The big car then goes out of control,
      jumps the curb on the opposite side of the street, blowing both
      front tires.

      VINCENT

    is on his back on the sidewalk, trying to turn over, to get to
    his feet... WE HEAR shouting, screams, running feet. Vincent
      hears it too, knows he must get to cover. He lurches to his
      feet, feels his way along the wall, limps into an alley...


      ANGLE - THE STREET

      Lots of commotion. Various patrons emerge from Runway Lounge.
      Among them we SEE LUCY, a tired-looking middle-aged hooker in
      her working clothes...

      Chris has banged his head on the wheel: Cozy and Miss Patricia
      are hovering over him. The crash has shaken them all.


      Python's on the floor of the car, searching for his gun;
      Howie rolls his head, rubbing his neck and wincing.

      He moves to hit him again, then changes his mind and starts the
      car.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Some of the patrons from the Runway Lounge are moving to
      surround the car when Chris tries to back away. Both front
      tires are ruined; they flop loudly.

      Chris jumps out, wild with fury, looks at the damage and kicks
      the car savagely a couple of times...

                    seen him! Where the hell is the
                      freak!

      No one says anything; the guy's obviously off the long end of a
      short pier. The other gang members are now out of the car...

        We HEAR the click of heels against the pavement on a dark,
        empty street. LUCY, the hooker we glimpsed earlier, walks
        briskly past the darkened tenements, her purse swinging at her
        side. She's heading home alone, having turned her last trick
        for the night.



        A squalid three story six-flat with a small stoop, narrow
        basement windows visible along the sidewalk. Lucy has the
        basement apartment, under the steps. She starts down the
        stairs, fumbling for her key, then stops and REACTS.

        LUCY'S POV

        Huddled in his cloak, Vincent leans against the wall at the
        foot the steps near her door, his features hidden by the
        darkness.

        LUCY

        looks briefly afraid, then angry -- she's been ripped off by
        muggers before. She has a hand in her purse, and tries to
        bluff it out, all tough street-wise hooker.

                                      LUCY
                      What do you want? Get out of here,
                      you! I got a can of Mace
                      in here, I'm telling you, you try
                        anything I'm goin' to make you real
                      damn sorry.

                                      VINCENT
                              (from the dark, in great
                                pain)
                        Please... I won't hurt you.

        Her fear turns to concern at the sound of his voice, but
        Vincent shrinks away as she moves closer.

                                    LUCY
                      You drunk?
                        What's wrong?

                                      VINCENT
                              (urgently)
                      ... Don't come any closer ...
                        please...

                                      LUCY
                        You're the guy got hit back by
                        Runway Lounge. I'll call you an*
                        ambulance.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      35.

      She fumbles for her key, opens the door to her apartment.
        Vincent struggles to his feet, using the wall for support,
      but he's in great pain.

                                    VINCENT
                      No... no police, no ambulance...

                                    LUCY
                      Yeah, okay. I been in trouble
                      myself a time or two.

        Vincent tries to take a step, and almost collapses. Lucy
        leads him inside. The apartment is still dark, lit only by
        the streetlight flooding through the basement windows.
        Vincent's face is still hidden.



        Dark and spooky.



        A dingy little pocket park with barrels, swings, a slide and
        seesaw, and a half-size basketball court. Four of the Silks

      Chris strokes the lapel of his fashionable jacket, where
      there's a large stain from dried blood. When he speaks his
      voice rises steadily to a scream.

                                    CHRIS

      We're CLOSE ON CATHY; PULL BACK to reveal her staring down
      bleakly at the open drainage grate, the grate lying several
      feet away, the street littered with broken glass.

      In b.g. Isaac is talking to some people (detectives, a stripper
      or two, etc) at the scene of the accident. The police have
      cordoned off the site with sawhorses. Floodlights illuminate
      the wrecked cars. Cathy's eyes are full of fear and concern...

      Isaac breaks off his conversation, walks over to join her. He
      looks down at the open drainage grate.

      Cathy nods slowly, obviously afraid to hear what he'll say
      next, but knowing she has to.

                                    CATHY
                      He's not dead... I'd know it if he

                    were doing at least fifty... and
                    he still gets up and runs off.

      Cathy breathes a tremendous sigh of relief and throws her
      arms around Isaac.

                                    CATHY

      Vincent, with Lucy'S support, is limping across the same
      small playground where the Silks met earlier.

      Suddenly we HEAR the sound of approaching footsteps. Vincent
      and Lucy hear it too.

      ANGLE. COZY

      She stands in an alcove just off the playground.She's
        spotted Vincent and Lucy. She dashes off...

                    Go on, get out of here. Go.

      For a moment he hesitates, but when Lucy TURNS HER BACK on
      him and walks away, Vincent finally departs, his cloak
      swirling behind him.

      A moment later, python ENTERS the playground, wary, spooked,
      hyper. Lucy steps out from behind a barrel, and he WHIRLS toward
      her, snaps his gun up to firing position... then sees her, and
      LAUGHS.

      Lucy's posture, attitude, and personality change: she's very
      much the hooker now, standing provocatively, taunting him,
        working her trade.

      They both REACT to the sound of others approaching.
      Howie enters the playground.

                      Hi, Miss Lucy. Look what I found.

      Howie pulls an old-fashioned glass paperweight with a winter
      scene inside.

                      trouble.

      She starts to step away, but Chris GRABS her by the arm and
      spins her around savagely. He SHOVES her at Howie, who holds
      her by the arms, immobile, as Chris gets in her face.

      He moves his huge hand up to her throat, leans down to whisper
      in her ear, to plead with her... but he's so carelessly strong
      that he begins choking her, without even meaning to...
