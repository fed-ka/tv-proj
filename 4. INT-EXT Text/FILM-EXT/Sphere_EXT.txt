STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.
Apartment
buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.
In one building, six floors
up, a bedroom light is on.
WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE
looking out the window.
WIFE (O.S.)
What kind of a crash was it?
NORMAN (O.S.)
You seen my suitcase?
WIFE (O.S.)
There's nothing on the news about a
crash.
Did he say what airline?
NORMAN (O.S.)
He didn't say much at all.
Honey --
WIFE (O.S.)
In the closet.
I don't understand,
Norman -- why would they call you?
NORMAN (O.S.)
Don't be so supportive, honey.
WIFE (O.S.)
Well, I can't imagine five years of
unemployment --
NORMAN (O.S.)
Four.
Four years --
WIFE (O.S.)
Four years of unemployment would
look too good on a resume.
NORMAN (O.S.)
Keep watching the news.
Are you
watching the news?
WIFE (O.S.)
How are you getting to the airport?
You need money for the bus?
A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front
of the apartment building.
A U.S.
NAVY decal is on the door.
WIFE (O.S.)
There's a U.S.
Navy car outside,
Norman.
NORMAN (O.S.)
What?
WIFE (O.S.)
Was it a military crash?
NORMAN (O.S.)
I don't know.
WIFE (O.S.)
They never used to send a Navy car.
CUT TO:
THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER
PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY
Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the
Pacific Ocean.
SHIP DECK -- DAY
The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.
A
young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.
She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.
OFFICER
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
NORMAN
Just that.
Careful, it's heavy.
She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.
OFFICER
No other equipment?
Scientific
instruments?
NORMAN
No, they didn't say --
OFFICER
This way, sir.
Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.
BARNES' OFFICE
Norman stands in front of the door.
The doorplate reads: PROJECT
COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.
Norman straightens his big-knotted
tie.
Deep breath.
SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT
THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.
ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at
the water.
ON NORMAN, approaching him.
Arthur never looks at Norman, he just
stares out at the water.
ARTHUR
I don't know you, but I'll be honest
with you.
I don't like this.
I don't
like any of this.
Especially, the
water.
NORMAN
Seasick?
A marine biologist?
ARTHUR
I don't belong here.
None of us
belong here.
Look at that.
ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.
NORMAN
Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
it?
ARTHUR
It scares the shit out of me.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.
It is dark.
His eyes are open.
He
stares at the ceiling.
CUT TO:
OCEAN
WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.
DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK
The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.
Around
it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.
HABITAT -- UNDERWATER
SWARMS of pretty, pink JELLYFISH.
Everywhere.
FROM UNDER THE HABITAT -- Fletcher swims up to them with a net.
It's
beautiful.
Eerie.
Almost idyllic.
UNDERWATER
WHITE EGGS, the size of golf balls descend from above.
Hundreds of
them.
Beth catches one, inspects it...
BETH
Norman.
NORMAN
What are they?
BETH
Eggs.
From inside their helmets...
BARNES (O.S.)
You people need to hurry back.
The
sensors have activated.
I don't
think you're alone out there.
HABITAT -- UNDERWATER
AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls.
UNDERWATER
Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.
Lands on the ground.
BREATHING.
Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.
She must've fixed it.
BETH
You're clear, Norman.
He walks along, out from under the habitat.
Carefully, looking around.
BETH (O.S.)
The sub's a 100 feet in front of
you.
You see it?
NORMAN
I can't see anything.
How does it
look?
Still clear?
BETH (O.S.)
Still clear.
Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.
The DARK WATER.
Looking around.
Anything could be out here.
Walking.
WE HEAR him BREATHING.
His
BREATHING gets shorter.
He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.
BETH (O.S.)
What's the matter?
NORMAN
You fixed this suit?
(no reply)
Beth?
BETH (O.S.)
Yes, Norman.
I did.
You're just
nervous.
NORMAN
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
BETH (O.S.)
You can't.
Counter's at 10 minutes.
You don't have time.
His BREATHING is short, but managable.
He continues on.
AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,
forty feet high.
NORMAN
Still clear?
BETH (O.S.)
Still clear.
UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.
Looks
below him.
Nothing around him.
He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the
HATCH OPEN.
Lifts himself up, awkwardly.
Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS
himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.
THE SUB -- in front of him.
He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
the sub.
UNDERWATER
CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.
Looking everywhere.
Searching.
Doesn't
see anything.
Lands on the bottom.
His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.
Shortness of BREATH.
He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.
The DARK
WATER.
Can't see anything.
Scared to death.
NORMAN
Beth?
Beth?
Shit.
THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.
Norman goes to a STANCHION.
Grips onto it.
Twists around.
Looking.
Searching.
Doesn't see anything.
LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.
Barely BREATHING.
HARRY (O.S.)
... you there?
Norman?
NORMAN
Harry?
HARRY (O.S.)
Norman, where are you?
NORMAN
I can't breathe...
Am I... clear?
HARRY (O.S.)
You're clear.
You see the airlock?
Norman, twists around, and as he does...
A SEA SNAKE
HISSES at his faceplate.
Norman SCREAMS.
ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.
HARRY (O.S.)
Norman!
Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,
slithering between the grid-like posts.
THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.
THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.
Norman
backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman
falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when...
NORMAN is whisked up.
HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.
Taking him up.
OCEAN -- UNDERWATER
His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.
He grabs a PIPE
next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.
HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.
MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.
He loses grip.
His body thrusts
upwards.
CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
Barely gripping.
HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.
He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES
burst from his lips.
HIS BODY slightly descending.
HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.
He continues on.
HAND OVER HAND.
Pulling himself...
UNDER THE HABITAT
He SEES the airlock in front of him.
He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.
He stops.
Can't continue.
He clasps
his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.
He SEES the airlock.
His eyes
fluttering, he's losing consciousness.
He can't do it.
And he lets go
of the pipe.
FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?
HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.
His body flat underneath it.
Being sucked upwards against it.
He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.
He's
inches from the airlock.
Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.
His body
SUCKED UP and away...
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER
Norman carrying Beth on his back, hurries through the water.
MAN (O.S.)
Five minutes.
I repeat five minutes
to detonation.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER
UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER
Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.
She falls
off, deadweight to the ground.
NORMAN
Shit.
(picking her up)
Harry!
I'm gonna have to lift her up
to you.
Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock...
HARRY
Alright.
Hurry.
Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.
HARRY
I can't reach her.
NORMAN
Hold on.
Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.
HARRY
Push her, c'mon.
NORMAN
I'm trying.
Shit.
Here -- catch her.
He flops her up again.
HARRY
Missed.
NORMAN
Are you trying, damn it?
Just --
MAN (O.S.)
Four minutes and counting.
Norman loses grip, drops her.
NORMAN
Hold on.
HARRY
Hurry, Norman.
Four minutes.
NORMAN
I heard!
I heard!
Picking her up...
HARRY
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five,
three --
NORMAN
Shut up and catch.
Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.
HARRY
I got her.
I got her.
Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.
UNDERWATER
The SUB comes out from under the dome.
Rising above the habitat...
HARRY
Less than a minute, we're never
gonna make it.
NORMAN
Nine hundred feet to surface.
HARRY
It's not fast enough, Norman.
There's a helluva lot of explosive
down there.
UNDERWATER
The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin.
DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER
TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.
CREWMAN #1
Has anyone spoken to them yet?
CREWMAN #2
(shakes his head)
The Admiral's going over the tapes
they brought up now.
CREWMAN #1
Does he know yet what really
happened down there?
Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.
SHIP DECK -- DAY
A bright, sunny day.
ON THE HELIPAD -- the helicopter's propeller begins whirling.
