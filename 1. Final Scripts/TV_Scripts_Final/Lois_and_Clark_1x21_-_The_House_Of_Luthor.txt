left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

    FADE IN:

 1  EXT. SKIES ABOVE METROPOLIS - (NIGHT #1)                     1 

    We are CLOSE ON Superman in flight, so close we see only 
    the red and blue-clad body, not the face, as he weaves
    lazily between the skyscrapers, out for a pleasure cruise.

    We slowly PAN to the chest emblem... but something's
    wrong.  Instead of the famous "S," there's a "LEX" on the     *
    yellow shield.  We MOVE to the face: it's LEX LUTHOR.
    He's smiling blissfully.  He looks down to see...


2   LOIS LANE'S APARTMENT                                        2 

    LOIS is being fitted for her wadding dress, yards and
    yards of elaborate, frilly, formal white.  She seems happy
    and excited.


3   LUTHOR                                                       3 

    nods his head in satisfaction, continues on, looks down
    again.


4   INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT                                  4 

    CLARK, unshaven, is trying to type, but a pile of
    crumpled-up papers testifies to his futility.


5   LUTHOR                                                       5 

    laughs, looks down again.


6   EXT. METROPOLIS PARK BENCE                                   6 

    JIMMY, wearing a thin jacket and shivering with the cold,
    studies the want ads, occasionally circling something.


6A  CLOSE ON WANT ADS                                           6A 

    Jimmy circles an ad saying "Dishwasher Wanted."

    shakes his head in false sympathy, looks down again.


 8  EXT. METROPOLIS JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY                  8

    executes a playful roll in the air, looks off toward the
    far horizon to see...


10  INT. PERRY WHITE'S FLORIDA HOME                             10 

    PERRY, holding the remote on his belly, is asleep in front
    of the TV test pattern, SNORING.  He seems years older.


11  LUTHOR                                                      11 

    rights himself, looks down one last time.


12  EXT. METROPOLIS GRAVEYARD                                   12 

    The lonely, untended grave of Superman.  A flash of           *
    LIGHTNING briefly illuminates the grave.                      *


13  LUTHOR                                                      13 

    sighs with satisfaction, then _ROCKETS_ _OFF_ at top
    speed, master of all he surveys


14  INT. LUTHOR'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT  14

    Luthor sits in front of his fireplace, arms extended
    wing-like, dipping or raising them to simulate flight.  A
    Virtual Reality helmet covers his head.  He removes it to     *
    reveal an enormous smile... because soon he will need no      *
    helmet.

                                                FADE OUT.

    FADE IN:

15  INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT - (DAY #2)                      15 

    Clark "sits" crossed-legged in the air,, typing at
    _SUPERSPEED_ on a laptop computer, the attached printer 
    cable dangling like a lifeline.  He pauses, reads the 
    screen, presses "Print."  As the printer begins to work, 
    Clark lowers himself down, stands, stretches, in the
    process _LEVITATING_ up several inches before coming back 
    to earth.  Clark is unshaven, uncombed, wears rumpled 
    baggy sweats.

    Clark walks into the kitchen, looks in the fridge.
    Nothing but a bag of onions and garlic. But, he's 
    suddenly famished, starts scrounging.  He looks in the 
    cabinets, then the freezer:  frozen steak.  He puts the       *
    steak on the counter, uses his _HEAT VISION_ on low to        *
    defrost, then throws the meat into a pan and cranks up the
    level to _COOK_.  When it's almost done he grabs the 
    onions and garlic from the bag, dicing then faster than 
    Benihana's ever could, and adds them to the pan.  By the 
    time he grabs a soda, his meal is done.  He puts it on a 
    plate, is about to turn back to his work when his eyes
    fall upon something else.  On his coffee table: a framed 
    photograph of himself, Lois, Perry, Jimmy, and Cat 
    standing in front of the Daily Planet.  He picks it up,
    stares at it, lifts the phone, dials long distance.

                             CLARK
               Mr. White?

16  EXT. PORCH - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - INTERCUT                16 

    Perry, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts and sun hat, sits
    on the porch sipping a fruit smoothie and reading a book.
    He speaks into his cellular phone.

                             PERRY
               Clark?

                             CLARK
               Yes, sir.  How are you?  You
               sound... tan.

                             PERRY
               See, son, you got to _layer_ in a
               good brown.  Little bit at a time,
               so you don't peel.  It's an art.

                             CLARK
               Uh... huh.  How's the good life?

               You tell ms.  I get up around nine,
               take a stroll on the beach.  By the
               time I get back, Alice pulls a 
               fresh-baked bread out of the oven.
               Then I sit and read my papers, have
               my coffee.  Sometime around noon,
               I'll walk over to the club house.
               There's usually a card game going
               on.  In the afternoon, there're 
               first run movies, arts and crafts,
               lemonade and cookies.  I go to bad
               around nine, sleep like a baby.
               Weather's perfect, never changes,
               and I haven't had a cab try to run
               me down since I got here.

                             CLARK
               You're miserable.

                             PERRY
               Completely.  To tell you the                       *

                     (beat)
               How's the novel coming?

    Clark leans over, pulls the pages out of the printer,
    scans them:  a series of title pages with different titles
    on each.

                             CLARK
               Not so good.  I've been spending
               most of my time trying to figure
               out what really happened to the
               Planet.

               Actually, I'm calling about Jimmy.
               Have you board from him?

                             PERRY

    reads:  "Metropolis Blues."


17  INT. LUTHOR'S PENTHOUSE - DAY                               17 

    Luthor and Lois are studying the blue prints for their new

                             LUTHOR
               This is wrong.  I wanted the doors
               off the master side balcony to be
               sliders.
                     (explaining)
               French doors make the room look
               smaller.

                             LOIS
               Lex, the master bedroom is three
               thousand square feet.  That's more
               than twice the size of my
               apartment.

               Well, what about the exercise area?
               Should we put it back on the ground
               floor?

                             LOIS
               No, I think this is right.  It'll
               be great to get out of bed and have
               that stair climber staring me right
               in the face saying 'Now, Lois.
               Now.'

               But, darling, that'll be My line.

    Luthor kisses her.  When they break...

                             LOIS
               Thank you, Lex, for understanding
               about my wanting to wait... for our
               wedding night.  I just want it to
               be special.

                             LUTHOR
               It will be.

    A KNOCK on the door and MRS. COX enters.

                             MRS. COX
               Lex, could we run through your
               schedule for tomorrow?

                             LUTHOR
               Of course.  Come in, Mrs. Cox.

    Lois eyes Mrs. Cox as she approaches Luthor, sits next to
    him, and shows him a calendar.  Even though the ladies
    acknowledge one another with smiles, we can tell there's
    no love lost between them.

                             MRS. COX
               You'll notice the Series K field
               test is set for 3:45 p.m.

                             LOIS
               What's Series K?

                             MRS. COX
                     (deliberately vague)
               Oh. something we've been working
               on.

    Lois is being subtly baited and doesn't like it.

               Lex has no secrets from me.

               Tell me, Mrs. Cox, is there a _Mr_.
               Cox?

                             MRS. COX
               He died.

                     (suddenly chagrined)
               Oh, I'm sorry.

                             MRS. COX
               Don't be.  I'm not.

    Lois' eyes widen as Luthor re-joins them.

                             LUTHOR
                     (to Mrs. Cox)
               Anything else?

                             MRS. COX
               Nothing I can't handle.

                             LUTHOR
               Thank you, Mrs. Cox.  That'll be
               all for now.

    Mrs. Cox stands and exits.  When she's gone, Lois turns to
    Luthor.

                             LOIS
               I don't like that woman.

               up.  All girls, all the time.
               Girls, girls, and more girls.
               Seven, count 'em, seven revolving
               stages for your viewing pleasure.

    Jimmy stands outside one of these establishments (The         *
    Go-Go Club), his collar pulled high to brace himself          *
    against the cold.  Two sailors pass.

                             JIMMY (Cont'd)
               Hey, the fleet's in!  Guys!  You
               want girls?  We got 'em short, we
               got 'en tall, skinny, meaty, blond,
               brunette.  They dance, they prance,

               You're leaving?  Anchors aweigh!                   *

    But they walk on by.  Jimmy can't seem to find any
    customers.  Out from the club steps a burly GIANT with a
    face only a mother could love.

                             GIANT
               Hey, punk!

               No, your kid sister.  Get over
               here.

    Jimmy moves toward the man, who helps by reaching his long
    arm out and grabbing Jimmy by the collar.

                             GIANT (Cont'd)

                             JIMMY
               Do you think I could come inside
               for a minute?  It's pretty cold and
               my throat...

                             GIANT
               Whadda ya think this is?  A hotel?
               You want this job or not?

               I'll get your customers, don't
               worry.

    The Giant lets go, moves inside.  Jimmy sighs, starts
    his "barking" again, although his throat's getting a
    little hoarse.

                             JIMMY (Cont'd)
               Step right up, folks.  We got 'em

    picks his head up we see it's none other than...

                             JIMMY
               Jack!

    They trade back-slaps, then Jimmy realizes, grabs him and
    drags him into a nearby alley.

               No. That wasn't it.  I overheard

    Jimmy relents, throws an arm around Jack and they start
    walking off.  He dumps his stack of handbills in the first
    trash can they pass.

    He still hasn't shaved.

               Hi. It's me.

    Clark, a towel around his waist, shaves Kryptonian style.
    Because his beard is too tough for razors, he holds a hand
    mirror in front of his face and bounces his _HEAT VISION_ 
    off of it to burn off the stubble.  Little by little, his 
    beard comes off.  When he's finished, he feels his smooth 
    face with his hands, then, satisfied, slaps some 
    aftershave on, winces at the burn.  The doorbell RINGS.
    He moves from the bathroom and into...

    exchange a warm handshake.  Clark grabs Perry's suitcase

    door open.

               Just that it was someone important,

               He called him:  'The Boss.'

               burn down the Daily Planet just to
               frame you for the job.  There's got
               to be another, bigger reason.  You

    In _SLOW-MOTION_, Clark's hands move into frame as the 
    bottle falls.  He catches it, screws the cap on, then lets

    expression changes from dismay to confusion.  He thought 
    he left it uncapped.  Quickly, Clark jumps in, indicating 
    Jimmy and Perry.

45  INT. LUTHOR'S WINE CELLAR - DAY                             45 

    Luthor draws himself a taste from a wine cask, makes a 
    face, spits it out.

                             LUTHOR
               Not quite ripe.

    There's a KNOCK an the metal door.  It opens and Mrs. Cox 
    ushers in SUPERMAN.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               Come in, come in.  Don't be shy.

    Mrs. Cox leaves, closes the door behind her.  Luthor has 
    picked up a dust bottle of wine from a crate.  He wipes 
    it clean, holds it up to the light.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               They say that civilization was
               invented so that men could 
               cooperate in the making of wine.

                             SUPERMAN
               What do you want, Luthor?

                             LUTHOR
               A favor.

                             SUPERMAN
               From me?  You must be joking.

                             LUTHOR
               Hear me out.

    When Superman doesn't speak...

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               My fiance, Lois Lane, _should_ be
               deliriously happy at the prospect
               of our forthcoming wedding.  
               Unfortunately, she is not.  She 
               misses her friends from the Daily 
               Planet.  Especially Clark Kent.

    Despite himself, Superman is fascinated.  Why is Luthor 
    discussing this with him?

                             SUPERMAN
                     (warily)
               So?

                             LUTHOR
               So, you and Clark are friends.  He
               was even able to bring you here.

    Luthor strolls among the casks, Superman follows.

                             SUPERMAN
               I'm not following.

    Luthor looks back, sees Superman _is_ following, smiles, 
    continues on.

                             LUTHOR
               I'm asking you to use your 
               influence to convince Clark to 
               attend our wedding.
                     (beat)
               You're invited, too.

    Luthor stops.  Superman stops several paces away.

                             SUPERMAN
               You live in a fantasy world, 
               Luthor.  Neither Clark nor I will 
               ever do anything to support your 
               marriage to Lois.

                             LUTHOR
               I see.  Then, I suppose, you're of
               no further use to me.

    Luthor pulls a lever mounted on the wall.  A metal cage drops 
    from the ceiling to encase Superman.

                             SUPERMAN
                     (scornfully)
               Bars won't hold me, Luthor.

                             LUTHOR
               Oh?  I think they will.

    Superman strides to the bars, reaches to crush them, then 
    recoils in pain and drops to one knee.  Luthor switches 
    off the overhead lights.  The bars GLOW an eerie green 
    from their Krytonite coating.  Superman falls over onto 
    his back.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               A fantasy world?  Perhaps.  But 
               it's all about to come true.

    On Luthor's smile we...

                                                FADE OUT.

    FADE IN:

46  INT. CLARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - (NIGHT #4)           46 

    Perry's cooking up a storm in the kitchen: every burner
    in use.  He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the lock
    and looks up.

                             PERRY
               About time.

    Jimmy and Jack enter thru the door:  not unwelcome, but 
    not who Perry was expecting.

                             JIMMY
                     (echoing Perry's
                      concern)
               Where's Clark?

                             PERRY
               I don't know.  He should have been
               here.

    Perry taps the biggest pot with a wooden spoon.

                             PERRY (Cont'd)
               Crawfish etouffee anyone?

    Perry pours in the raw crawfish.  They hit the boiling 
    water with a HISS.  Jimmy and Jack exchange a glance.

                             JACK
               Actually we just ate.

                             PERRY
                     (unphased)
               You'll eat again.

                      liquids)
               You gotta use the sweet paprika,
               not the regular.  And cayanne 
               pepper, plenty of it.  'Course the 
               secret is the apple juice, half a 
               cup.

    Perry points to the plates.  Reluctantly, Jimmy and Jack 
    begin to set the table.

               Any particular reason for this

                             JACK
               It might be related to a certain

               never receives.

                             LOIS
               You're right.  I just wanted our 
               wedding day to be something I could 
               share with Clark and Perry and the 
               others.

               After the honeymoon, I promise you
               we'll heal all old wounds.

                             LOIS
               You still won't tell me where we're
               going?

    words so as not to put Luthor on his guard.

               Lex... when the Planet was 
               destroyed, you lost quite a bit of 
               money, didn't you?

                             LUTHOR
               Yes, but I have wide shoulders and
               deep pockets.

                             LOIS
               But, I mean it wasn't a total loss.
               There was insurance.

                             LUTHOR
               Several policies.  Unfortunately,
               not enough to justify
               reconstruction.

               Why the sudden concern?

                             LOIS
               Because I can't help but feel that 
               your buying the Planet in the first 
               place had something to do with me.

                             LUTHOR
               It did.  I'm embarrassed to admit 
               it, but I bought the Planet in a 
               desperate, lovesick attempt to 
               bring us closer together, to bring 
               my life in tune with yours.
               Ironically, it wasn't necessary: 
               here we are together. Our love was 
               too strong.  We were _meant_ to be

               The Daily Planet was more than

               I love Lois, but she's much too
               independent, don't you think? 
               Well, leave that to me.

               That's right.  I'll have to kill
               him, too.

               The red, or the white?  Red for 
               passion, or white for purity?

    Superman struggles to a sitting position.  Luthor loops 
    the white cumberbund around Superman's neck and pulls him
    back down.  Superman moans in pain.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               I agree.  Definitely the red.

    Lois wears her magnificent wedding gown, stares into a        *
    full-length mirror.  Intermittently, she practices a wide 
    smile, then bursts into SOBS.  She goes through this cycle

58  INT. LUTHOR'S WINE CELLAR - DAY                            58  

    Superman has crawled to a position near the bars across
    from where the key still rests on the wine cask.  The
    closer to the bars he is, the more intense the pain, but
    he bears it.  Concentrating, trying to build power by
    breathing deeply in and out, Superman finally "aims" at
    the key and _INHALES_. It's weak, a pale shadow of his
    former power, but does have an affect.


59  THE KEY                                                     59 

    flutters, slides to the edge of the cask, but sticks there
    with the ring dangling over the side.


60  SUPERMAN                                                    60 

    collapses, COUGHING from the exertion.  Inadvertently, he
    grasps the bars for balance and CRIES OUT in pain,
    clutching his hands as if burned.  He lies back, resting
    his head on the fallen cummerbund.  Faintly, in the
    distance, he hears ORGAN MUSIC.


61  INT. LUTHOR'S BALLROOM - DAY                                61 

    The room is packed with the cream of Metropolis Society.
    Ellen Lane sits toward the front.  Conversation dies as       *
    the WEDDING MARCH begins.  Luthor enters from the side and
    takes his place by the altar.  Now Lois appears in back
    and all eyes turn.  Slowly, she begins to walk.  As she
    walks, she remembers.

    FLASHBACK #1

    Lois and Clark share Chinese food (pilot episode).

    FLASHBACK #2

    Lois shows plenty of leg as she perches on Clark's desk
    ("Pheromone My Darling").

    FLASHBACK #3

    Lois and Clark brush their teeth together ("Honeymoon in
    Metropolis").

    FLASHBACK #4

    Clark, having quit, walks away from Lois ("Man of Steel
    Bars").

    BACK TO SCENE

    Lois continues down the aisle.

    Superman stands shakily by the bars.  He has torn the
    white cummerbund into strips and tied then together.  He
    now holds one end and tosses the other to land several
    feet away from the key.  He rests a moment, tries to
    compose himself, and BLOWS.


63  THE CUMMERBUND                                              63 

    lifts, a silken snake, and drifts toward the key.  The end
    flutters up and near the key, then, like threading a
    needle, moves through the ring and twists back on itself
    to create a loop.


64  SUPERMAN                                                    64 

    in great pain, leans through the bars and gives his "rope"
    a tug.

    is pulled off the cask onto the floor, within several feet
    of Superman's outstretched hand.


66  SUPERMAN                                                    66 

    near collapse, tries to _INHALE_, but the key moves only
    an inch.  He sits there, gasping for breath.


67  INT. LUTHOR'S BALLROOM - SAME TIME - DAY                    67 

    The Wedding March ends as Lois joins Luthor, smiling with
    pride, at the altar.  She stares in shock at who's to
    perform the ceremony.

                             LOIS
                     (whispering)
               The Archbishop?

               in the presence of these witnesses, 
               to join together this man and this 
               woman in holy matrimony.

    Lois desperately scans the audience, but is disappointed.
    The faces she hoped to see aren't there.

    Lois, Perry's jacket draped over her shoulders, is led 
    outside by-the rest of the gang.  Police cars and 
    personnel are everywhere.  Lois is still in shock.

                             LOIS
               I've always been such a good judge
               of character.

                             CLARK (O.S.)
               Right here.

    Still shaky and pale, Clark steps to her side.  They look 
    at each other.  He holds out his arms... she moves into 
    them.  Suddenly, a police walkie-talkie delivers a loud 
    burst of STATIC.

               It's over, Luthor.  Give yourself

    Luthor looks at Henderson, then over the edge.  He climbs
    up on the ledge.

                             LUTHOR
               Lex Luthor will not live in a cage.

    The crowd REACTS as the body falls.  Clark releases Lois, 
    steps forward as if to fly... but can barely walk.

                             CLARK
                     (anguished)

    Lois averts her eyes, buries her face in Clark's chest.
    The bouquet drops from her hand to the sidewalk.  Someone 
    running by steps on it.

    Lois, Clark, Perry, Jimmy and Jack have convened on the 
    sidewalk.  The entrance has been boarded up, "BUILDING 
    CONDEMNED" signs are posted, and the area is still 
    cordoned off.

                             JIMMY
               I wish they'd get it over with and
               tear this old place down.

    her stare and turns to her.  Quickly she changes the

                             LOIS
               Forever.

                             CLARK
               Now, what did you want to say?

                             LOIS
               Oh, nothing.  The same.  What you
               just said.  Sort of.

    They're about to share a hug, but, at that moment, Clark, 
    with _SUPER HEARING_, picks up...

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Help!

                             CLARK
               Uh, could we continue this later,
               Lois?  I've got to go.

    He hurries off.

                             LOIS
                     (slightly put off)
               Sure.  Why not?  Go.  Run off and 
               disappear like you always do 
               whenever we're having a discussion.
                     (a sigh)
               I guess everything's back to
               normal.

                     (looking up)
               I'm not done with you either, big
               fella.

    Superman pauses, looks down on Lois and the city of 
    Metropolis, and smiles.  As he _ROCKETS_ off into a new 
    season we...

                                                FADE OUT.
