                    Here's to the crazy ones.  The
                    misfits.  The rebels.  The trouble-
                    makers.  The round pegs in the square
                    holes.  The ones who see things
                      differently.

      REVEAL

      BAY AREA - MORNING

      SYDNEY ROBERTS, thirty-two, sits in front of a MONITOR
      in the bay area of Lewis, Roberts & Roberts, a modern,
      eclectic imaginarium passing itself off as an advertising
      agency.  She is rapt.  Gripped, even, as THE ICONIC
      APPLE "THINK DIFFERENT" COMMERCIAL PLAYS OUT.

                                        RICHARD DREYFUSS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    They're not fond of rules.  And
                    they have no respect for the status
                    quo.

                                        ZACH (O.S.)
                    Syd?

      REVEAL ZACH CROPPER, thirty-one, copywriter, the most
      beautiful man in the world.  Oozes charm.  He's a cool
      breeze, he speaks so smoothly it's almost musical.   

                                        ZACH (CONT'D)
                    I see you're watching your lucky
                    video, sweet, and in this case
                      justified, luck is a good thing to
                    have today, take my hand, Sydney.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (sensing)
                    What's wrong?



                                                                (CONTINUED)      "THE CRAZY ONES" - Pilot - WRITER'S DRAFT - 1-8-13        2.


1CONTINUED:1

                                        ZACH
                    Your father doesn't know the pitch.

        A half-beat.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (with a swallow)
                    What are you talking about?  It's
                      McDonald's. 

                                        ZACH
                    That he knows.  The pitch -- not so
                    much.

      A beat.  Sydney leaps up; Zach holds tight to her hand,
      nearly causing her arm to come out of its socket.

                                        ZACH (CONT'D)
                    I'm not nearly done with my bad
                    news, there's more.

                                        SYDNEY
                    What?

                                        ZACH
                    You know how I like to be conjugal
                    on occasion.  It's my way, often
                    for the benefit of the agency,
                    sometimes it's less philanthropic,
                    anyway, the woman I was with last
                    night -- lovely woman, I think you'd
                    quite like her -- she works in
                    Account Management at Chiat.  She
                    told me Sam Peters, their CCO, met
                    with McDonald's yesterday.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (alarm; shock)
                    Excuse me?

                                        ZACH
                    The rumor is McDonald's is coming
                    in this morning to fire us.  

      Sydney charges off; Zach holds her hand, CLOTHESLINES
      HER TO THE FLOOR.  WOMP.

                                        ZACH (CONT'D)
                    My bad.  I should've let go there.

                                                              CUT TO:      "THE CRAZY ONES" - Pilot - WRITER'S DRAFT - 1-8-13        3.




2INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING2

      Zach, Sydney, along with her father, SIMON ROBERTS,
      fifties, brilliant, vibrant, a genius, and a bit out of
      his mind.  On a fast move with them are art directors
      ANDREW KENNEDY, thirty-two, neurotic, nebbishy, and
      LAUREN SLOTSKY, twenties, easygoing, sexy.

                                        SIMON
                          (to Sydney)
                    They're not going to fire us.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (furious)
                    How do you know this, if they met
                    with Chiat, they must-- why else--
                    do you know the pitch?

                                        SIMON
                    Hum a few bars.

      SYDNEY SNORTS, grabs him, stops him.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Dammit, Dad.

                                        SIMON
                    Honey,
                          (relax)
                    Trix are for kids.  Not sure why I
                    said that, could be Freudian, my
                    mother took away my Trix when I hit
                    puberty, whereas my sister at that
                    age got to start turning them, life's
                    not fair, don't you agree? 

      She stomps her foot on his.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                          (simply)
                    That was violent.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Now you listen to me right now.

      As she spots Lauren, fighting a giggle--

                                        SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Stop it.
                          (back to Simon)
                    The client on the other side of
                    that door makes up sixty percent of
                    our business. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "THE CRAZY ONES" - Pilot - WRITER'S DRAFT - 1-8-13        4.


2CONTINUED:2

                                        SIMON
                    Indeed. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    So what exactly do you plan to say
                    to them?

                                        SIMON
                    No idea, I only know what I'll tell
                    myself.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Which is what?

                                        SIMON
                    "Leap.  And the net shall appear."

      SYDNEY MAKES A LITTLE SNORT SOUND, it's a nervous tic
      caused by panic.

                                        SYDNEY
                    I am going in there to buy you
                    another thirty seconds.  During
                    which time you will suck it up,
                    enter, and pitch the Authenticity
                    campaign exactly as we prepared it. 
                    Got it?

                                        SIMON
                    I do.  Enter.  Pitch.  Suck.  Is
                    the order important?

      As Lauren fights another smile, Sydney freezes her again. 
      Then, to the others--

                                        SYDNEY
                    Let's go.

      She shoots one more look at Simon for good measure. 
      Zach, Sydney, and Andrew enter the conference room; as
      Simon holds back, Lauren sees the doubt on his face.

                                        LAUREN
                          (to Simon; simply)
                    Smell my products?

                                        SIMON
                    Beg pardon?



                                                                (CONTINUED)      "THE CRAZY ONES" - Pilot - WRITER'S DRAFT - 1-8-13        5.


2CONTINUED: (2)2

                                        LAUREN
                    My grandfather told me that smelling
                    a young woman's shampoo was life-
                      affirming, it awakened romance,
                    boosted confidence, whatever.  Smell
                    'em?

                                        SIMON
                    It might be best.

      He gives her head a deep snort, as we: 

                                                              CUT TO:


3INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS3

      SIX MCDONALD'S EXECUTIVES, suits, stern, sit along one
      side of a long conference table.  HANNAH SHARPLES, fifty,
      handsome, formidable, sits center; she's clearly the
      alpha male.  And she does not look pleased.  We can
      feel the tension as our Team enters and sits.  Simon
      then enters, tries his best to lube up the room.

                                        SIMON
                    Good morning, everybody.  I should say
                    "Good McMorning," how we doing Steve,
                    Cindy; Hannah, Hannah, Hannah, sexy as
                    ever.  I so love it when you shoot me
                    that little un-smile of yours, y'know I
                    was in on the 7-Up Uncola campaign, I
                    love "un," you actually ooze it, and I
                    so adore your un-smile, could I have
                    one more please?

      A MUTED SNORT FROM SYDNEY.

                                        HANNAH
                    Simon.  I have something to say. 
                    And I'm afraid this is rather
                      difficult.

      Silence.  The room is frozen.

                                        SIMON
                    "You're fired."  Is that what you
                    came to say?  That's the rumor
                    anyway, Zach sleeps around, he hears
                    things, I'm sure he's slept with
                    some of us here today, show of hands,
                    how many have slept with Zach?

      As Lauren's hand begins to move, SYDNEY grabs it.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "THE CRAZY ONES" - Pilot - WRITER'S DRAFT - 1-8-13        6.


3CONTINUED:3

      Hannah and Simon stare at each other, this is a
        longstanding relationship.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Have you come to fire us, Hannah?

      A long beat which nearly confirms it.  Then--

                                        HANNAH
                          (giving him the rope
                          to hang himself)
                    Why don't you share the Authenticity
                    campaign with us.

      Ugh.  That sounded fatal.  A beat.

                                        SIMON
                      Certainly.

      HE PICKS UP THE REMOTE, stares at the big black screen on
      the wall.  He might as well be staring at a blank page,
      which Sydney detects.  SIMON THEN ACTIVATES THE SCREEN: A
      BUNCH OF FAST-SHIFTING IMAGES AS HE SCROLLS THROUGH.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Okay, let's see, I know it's in
                    here somewhere, not that one, no,
                    that's Charmin, the "Wipe-your-
                      worries-away" campaign we didn't
                    sell that, oh, Pringles, I love
                    them.  "It's a potato crisp, not a

                    I so love those old Fed-Ex
                      commercials.  I find the quicker
                    one talks, the less it becomes about
                    content,

                    sometimes I can get going so fast
                    it becomes impossible to follow my

      He gives a quick glance around the room, looking for

                    Not done.  I've one last marble.

      Sydney sits.

                    The gem, actually.  The gem in that
                    spot... nevermind how entertaining
                    it was, or funny, the "nugget" was
                    that it communicated a singular
                    idea that resonated with the
                    consumer.  Speed.  Federal Express. 
                    "When it absolutely, positively has
                    to be there overnight."  Speed. 
                    Imagine being able to communicate a
                    core value with such amusing
                      precision.  What's your idea, Hannah? 
                    Does McDonald's have one?  Is it
                    the Happy Meal?  Is it Ronald?  I
                    like Ronald.  He's one of my favorite
                    clowns.

                    me.  I think I was perhaps five
                    years old.  Simpler times. 

      An awkward beat.  Sydney stares: "Where is he going

      Simon then goes to the Magic board, PULLS UP A VIDEO ON

                    This is the McDonald's spot of 1972.

                    is simply no message more consumer-
                    relevant in 2013.  In this economy...

                    I don't care that he pulled it off. 
                    He basically went into a meeting
                    with our biggest client and he was
                      unprepared.  It was beyond reckless.

                    I thought he was kinda funny.

                    Look, Syd, that was magic he just
                    pulled off, it was high-wire art

                    Creative in our business is not
                    art, Zach, it is not clever, creative
                    is what sells, it's moving product,
                    creative is "Head-on, apply directly
                    to the forehead;" it's "I can't
                    believe it's not butter;" "Nationwide
                    is on your side,"
                            (escalating)
                    driving the message into the greatest
                    number of heads at the least possible
                    cost, that's creative and the fucking
                    devil has hijacked my mouth.

      Upon which, she ducks into a soundproof booth -- known
      as the "Scream Room" -- and SHE SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF
      HER LUNGS, which WE SEE BUT DO NOT HEAR.  She then re-
      emerges, now with some self-control.

                    Lunch with Mariah Carey.  Turns out

                    So let's review.  He basically takes
                    a flying header with this morning's
                    pitch and gets a lunch out of it
                    with Mariah Carey.  What the hell
                    is that?

                                        SYDNEY
                          (weakly; exasperated)
                    That would be his net appearing.

5INT. RESTAURANT - DAY5

      Simon sits in a corner booth with the one and only...
      MARIAH CAREY.

                                        SIMON
                    It's Sarah Dipity that you happen
                    to be here in Chicago right now,
                    have you met Sarah, she's splendid. 
                          (takes her hand)
                    Such soft hands, do you believe in
                    destiny, Mariah?

                                        MARIAH
                    Not yours, if that's where you're
                    headed.

                                        SIMON
                    That was wit.  I happen to be a big
                    fan of wit, when used responsibly 
                    of course, mine can get unwieldy.  

      As she extracts her hand from his--

                                        MARIAH
                          (polite, but...)
                    Mr. Roberts.  I don't mean to be
                    rude.  Actually, I do.  I'm only
                    sitting at this table because the
                      commercial you pitched to my agent
                    speaks to my massive ego, my core
                      narcissism, and I figure to make
                    heaps of money.  We have a business
                    deal, subject to a creative meeting,
                    this would be that meeting.  You've
                    got two minutes.

                                        SIMON
                      Wonderful, I rarely last longer
                    anyway, this piece is about family,
                    it's about emotion, it's about people
                    coming together in a way--

                                        MARIAH
                    It's about meat.  You want me to
                    sing about meat.

6INT. SIMON'S OFFICE - DAY6

      Sydney with Simon in his office; it's decorated in
      primary colors, including framed iconic one-sheets: 7-
      UP, the Un-cola; Campbell's Soup, etc., there's also a
      life-size rock'm sock'm robot... it's a bit like toyland,
        a playground for the imagination.  Google would drool
      for this place.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (stunned)
                    She's doing it? 

                                        SIMON
                    She is.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Mariah Carey is coming here to record  
                    "You Deserve A Break Today"?

                                        SIMON
                          (high-pitched)
                      W-e-e-e-l-l-...

                                        SYDNEY
                    Wait.  Wait.  What do you mean
                          (high-pitched)
                      "w-e-e-e-l-l?"  I don't
                    like "w-e-e-e-l-l".

                                        SIMON
                    She's coming to sing.  She just
                    thinks she'll be singing a different
                    song.  Life's a dance, honey.

      Sydney's face clenches.  Then--

                                        SYDNEY
                          (a bad feeling)
                    Exactly what song does she "think"
                    she'll be singing?

                                        SIMON
                    "It Ain't The Meat, It's The Motion." 
                    Also catchy.

      A beat. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    That's a sex song. 

                                        SIMON
                    Isn't it exciting?

7EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT7

      Andrew and Sydney walk.

                                        ANDREW
                    You got to admit, it is exciting. 
                    Mariah Carey coming in to our
                    recording studio.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Under totally false pretenses.

                                        ANDREW
                    Even so.
                          (off her look)
                    What's wrong?

                                        SYDNEY
                    Nothing's wrong.

                                        ANDREW
                    Hey.  It's me.

      They stop outside her apartment building.  Hold a look.  

                                        SYDNEY
                    Did you hear the words coming out
                    of my mouth today?  "Creative is
                    what sells."  I'm not the person I
                    set out to be in life.

                                        ANDREW
                    Who is?  My passion for advertising
                    comes from not being able to sell
                    my screenplay.  We all...

                                        SYDNEY
                    Settle?
                          (off his look)
                    There, I said it aloud, the dirty
                    little secret is out, "I've settled,"
                    it's not my life dream after all,
                    to write copy for Chicken McNuggets. 
                    Who knew? 

                                        ANDREW
                          (simply)
                    Your life dream is to be your dad.

                    what he did today, the stuff he
                    came up with... I could never...

                                        ANDREW
                    You're being crazy.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Really?  You're not just saying
                    that to make me feel better? 
                          (off Andrew)
                    I'm not crazy, that's the problem. 
                    I'm reasonable.  I'm practical. 
                    Life gets choked out of me by common
                    sense.

      He takes her hand.  Smiles.  

                                        ANDREW
                    Now you listen.  As genius, or nuts,
                    as your father is, this place is
                    you.  And has been for awhile. 
                    You're our creative director.  Our
                    producer.  You're the main reason
                    Zach, Lauren, and I so love our
                    jobs.

                    You are without doubt the sweetest
                    person I have ever met.

      A beat.  Uh oh.  Andrew makes the fatal best-friend
      mistake, he leans in to kiss her.  SHE SNORTS.

                                        ANDREW

                    I am so sorry about last night.

                    Don't worry about it, Andrew.  Forget
                    about it.

      SHE then blows her cover with a SNORT.

                                        ANDREW
                    I don't want to.  I feel even worse
                    about never ever talking about it.

      A SNORT, followed by silence.

                    I know you're my boss-- 

      ANOTHER, MUTED SNORT stops him.  She covers her mouth. 
      Then--

                    any sense?

                    Oh, sweetie, that's the essence of
                    marriage: find the perfect mate,
                    then insist on change.

                                        SYDNEY
                    And here I am doing the exact same
                    thing.  Trying to make you into
                    something you're not, or... which
                      especially doesn't make sense when
                    it's you who makes this place run.

                                        SIMON
                    That isn't true, you do that.  You
                    don't stop me from being me, honey,
                    you allow for it.  Let's face it.

      A beat. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    Dad.  Do you think what we do here...
                    has any real meaning?

                                        SIMON
                    I don't know.  Kafka said the meaning
                    of life is that it ends, his point
                    being: enjoy it.  Which I think we
                    do.  I get to think wild thoughts,
                    lunch with rock divas, box robots. 
                    Is there more?

                                        SYDNEY
                      I remember the very day I decided
                    my life would have meaning.  I was
                    seven years old,
                          (grabs the keyboard)
                    and you showed me this.

      She pulls up the "Think Different" spot, and IT PLAYS. 
      AS WE SEE THE IMAGES--

                                        RICHARD DREYFUSS (V.O.)
                    Here's to the crazy ones.  The misfits,
                    the rebels.  The trouble-makers.  The
                    round pegs in the square holes...

      SHE THEN FREEZES THE FRAME.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (with a half-laugh)
                    It should've occurred to me that
                    none of the people featured in that
                    Apple ad -- John Lennon, Picasso,
                    Gandhi -- none of them worked in
                      advertising.

      A beat.

                                        SIMON
                    When Steve Jobs saw that spot, he
                    said it told him what Apple should
                    be.  How they should behave.  That
                      commercial inspired Apple, a company
                    that altered the course of the world. 
                    Pretty dramatically.  I could be
                    wrong.  But I'd say the people behind
                    that spot were about something.

      Sydney's clinging to that notion.  It's a touching image,
      a father and daughter... a quiet conversation in relative
      darkness.  Their devotion to each other, the tenderness,
      it's palpable.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    This man was on the street, begging,
                    with a sign: "I am blind.  Please
                    help."  Nothing in his cup.  Another
                    guy walked up, flipped the sign
                    over, and wrote: "It is spring and
                    I am blind."  The blind man's cup
                    was soon overflowing.  "It is spring
                    and I am blind."  With one sentence,
                    the other guy conjured up the beauty
                    of a blooming flower, the smell of
                      freshly-cut grass, the hope that
                      accompanies so many of our
                      springtimes.  That guy was David
                    Ogilvy.  He was a copy writer.  We
                    do have poets among us, honey. 
                    You're one of them.

                                        SYDNEY
                    You have no idea how desperate I am
                    to believe that.

                                        SIMON
                    Honey.  The question isn't whether
                    life has meaning in the world. 
                    Rather, it's 'does it have meaning
                    to you?'

                                        SIMON
                    I get to wake up every day and go
                    to work with my daughter.  

      A beat.  Sydney smiles softly.  WE CAN SEE THE EMOTION
      IN SIMON'S EYES; she is absolutely the love of his life.

                    So much life to be lived/ So much reason

25INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY25

      MARIAH IS RECORDING "YOU DESERVE A BREAK TODAY."

                                        MARIAH
                          (singing)

      ANGLE IN THE STUDIO...

      ANDREW, SIMON, ZACH, AND LAUREN.

      Sydney folds in, sits next to Andrew.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Hey.

                                        ANDREW
                    Hey.

      She takes his hand.

                                        SYDNEY
                    We probably should talk about it.

      SNORT.

                                        ANDREW
                    I'm actually okay.  I re-watched
                      "Broadcast News" and remembered...
                    when Albert Brooks couldn't get
                    Holly Hunter, he went on to marry
                    somebody else, they had three
                    wonderful children.  I figure if he
                    could fake a happy life, so can I.

      She smiles.

                                        ANDREW (CONT'D)
                    Fine, melt me with a smile, why don't you?

                                        SYDNEY
                    You're the most incredible person--

                                        ANDREW
                          (puts a finger to her
                            lips)
                    --and we'll leave it right there.
                          (off another smile
                            from her)
                    We're good.

      Upon which MARIAH KICKS INTO A MORE SEXUALLY-CHARGED
      VERSION OF THE SONG; SHE MAKES TINA TURNER LOOKS LIKE
      JULIE ANDREWS.

                                        ANDREW (CONT'D)
                    And in deep shit.  There goes the
                    client.

      MARIAH RATCHETS IT UP.

      ANGLE SIMON AND ZACH

                                        ZACH
                    Who's netting her this time?

                                        SIMON
                    Let's both go.

      And Zach and Simon rise, head for the stage, dancing,
      shaking body parts as they go.

      ANGLE SYDNEY AND ANDREW

      as they watch Simon and Zach, Frick and Frack.  Sydney
      just shakes her head in quiet disbelief.

                                        ANDREW
                    What are you thinking?  Tell me.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Oh.  I was thinking all this time
                    it's been spring.  And I've been a
                    little blind.

      ANGLE STAGE

      By now, Simon, Zach, and Mariah are pelvic-thrusting,
      synchronized.  OFF this, we eventually:
