The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just
as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.
Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes
A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds
that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural
webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and
we see
Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of
great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled
but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.
4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS
As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.
5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER
The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly
along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly
starts to descend.
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR
From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great
height.
As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into
the crowd.
7 		OUT
8		WITH THE RUNNER
As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a
kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is
moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.
9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR
Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,
a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.
It is FRANCIS.
10		WITH THE RUNNER
Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the
presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in
terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.
11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)
Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.
12		P.O.V.
The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.
People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.
13		THE SANDMAN
Emotionless. Aims. Fires.
14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE
Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal
Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in
behind him, applauding, congratulating him.
15		THE SANDMAN
Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,
lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black
flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd
CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.
16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)
Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
(TITLES END)
17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)
Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,
each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.
FRANCIS (peering
at Logan curiously)
Why?
LOGAN
just wondered...what happens?
FRANCIS (shrugs)
Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever
happens, you can bet it's final.
But who would want to find out?
One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The
two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the
doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a
kind of twilight.
Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city
as it goes. slowing finally as we see:
23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE
Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears
into a tunnel.
24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE
As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into
a
gathering
CROWD.
25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE
Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --
you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too
much to take in at a glance.
26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...
LOGAN
but you don't know, you Just
say what everyone says.
One for
one. One for one."
FRANCIS
Well, why no!? That's exactly how
everything works. How else could
the city stay in balance -You have
a better idea?
LOGAN (laughs)
No, but at least I wonder sometimes --
instead of doing that "one for one" song
of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher
With a stuck tape.
FRANCIS
Well the minute you get a better
idea you can stop wondering.
(beat)
You know, Logan -- you wonder
a lot. Too much for a Sandman
They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:
RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND
RENEW ANYTIME!!
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling
into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops
abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts
back to RELIVE.
As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to
Logan and Francis and moves on.
27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU
They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young
woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of
her with his hands framing his face.
MAN
Well? How do you like it?
WOMAN (critically)
I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
look a little -
MAN
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much,
you think?
WOMAN
Too little.
MAN
Too little?
(gestures)
Too little. Okay, wait for me.
And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,
smiles and goes off with a passer-by.
28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP
Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and
out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she
passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves
with them.
LOGAN
Did you ever see Francis-8?
FRANCIS (shaking his head)
I never even visited Nursery before
tonight.
(beat)
When you wonder, it slows you up --
you know?
They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:
LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply
excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...
FRANCIS
I don't know what makes you so curious.
You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
LOGAN (quickly)
Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
(laughs)
The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan
and Francis are swallowed up in the group.
29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL
An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation
stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,
waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a
beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,
and as they break:
FRANCIS
and that's my friend, Logan.
(as she acknowledges
the introduction)
We're celebrating his next in line.
Carousel - Arcade - who knows?
Want to come along?
WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
Only if I make it to the top of
Carousel.
(she holds up her hand)
Thirty -- and the big spin.
In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a
half-squeeze.
FRANCIS
You're thirty -- already? I always
thought I was older than you -
(beat)
Well, give it a good try.
WOMAN (pleasantly)
You know I always have.
Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.
2ND WOMAN (to the first)
Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight.
Its
my Love-Shop turn.
WOMAN
That's all right. Happy turn.
2ND WOMAN
You'll renew. I've got a feeling.
WOMAN (smiles)
So do I...but if I don't at least I'll
have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost
rather have that than renew.
2ND WOMAN
I feel the same way. Sometimes I think
I'm not even going to try and renew when
my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
So long.
The 2nd Woman walks away.
FRANCIS (after a beat;
to first Woman)
It's been nice.
WOMAN
Um-huh.
They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and
they move off.
FRANCIS
I guess you never had her?
Logan shakes his head.
FRANCIS
You missed something special.
LOGAN
Well...you can't have them all.
LOGAN AND FRANCIS
(together, it's an old joke)
But you can try.
They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving
with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking
Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see
the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming
with shrill joy as they disappear.
FRANCIS
The damned Yellows are getting out
of hand. Those three ought to be in
Cathedral. No business scrambling in
Arcade...
LOGAN (laughs
cuffs Francis' arm)
What an old, old man you're getting
to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a
Yellow? I bet you were even wilder
than -
(he breaks off as the lights
in the Great Hall dim)
-- come on, Sandman.
The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL
As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great
curtains
have parted to reveal
31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE
AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance
The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling
TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE
deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...
32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,
DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they
speak now, their voices are hushed.
LOGAN
You should have been with us in Nursery,
Daniel. I'm positive I
recognized him -
FRANCIS (hustling
Logan)
Come on. I don't want to miss the
filing-in. There'll be some I know
tonight, I think...
DANIEL (glances at his
own red crystal, nods)
Yes. Me, too. You know we're
both on Monitor tonight.
FRANCIS
Damn! That's right. Just when I
feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
Arcade .
LOGAN
Want me to take your shift? I'm
feeling restless anyway
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see
33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL
framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided
arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which
even now pulsates and flickers in
changing
dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...
34.		ANOTHER ANGLE
Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.
LOGAN
Now there's a few who could have been
his seed-mother.
FRANCIS
Only a few? You're just not trying.
35-36
OUT
37		PANNING THE CROWD
As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...
SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...
38 		OUT
38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS
Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.
39		THE CROWD
Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.
40		LASTDAY GROUP
Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.
41		CROWD
Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.
42		CAROUSEL
As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...
43		CROWD
Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see
44		CAROUSEL
Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.
45		LOGAN
Caught up in it Like the rest.
46		CAROUSEL
Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.
Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.
47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN
Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:
48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL
High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.
49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN
At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...
50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD
Hysterical...starting to chant...
CROWD
Renew!
The man continues to strain:
CROWD
Renew!
51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN
Almost a blur...but still straining:
CROWD'S CHANT
Renew!
52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS
LOGAN AND FRANCIS
(chanting with the rest)
Renew!
53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN
The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...
CROWD'S CHANT
Re...
Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.
54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.
55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS
Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.
56 		OUT
57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.
58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS
As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.
Logan looks at the box. On it we see:
MAN: RELIVE STORE 14
LOGAN
(to Francis)
Looks like I'm working.
Francis stands.
LOGAN
Who invited you?
FRANCIS
I'm in my party mood.
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.
They make their way into the hall.
Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.
Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.
As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:
59-
59X11
WIDE ANGLE - A MAN
running.
CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.
A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.
B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.
C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.
D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:
A little cat and mouse is in order.
(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)
E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.
F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.
G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.
H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.
I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.
J. The Runners face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.
K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.
L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.
M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.
N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.
59X12-
63X1
OUT
63X2		WITH LOGAN
As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.
63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER
A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE
As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.
63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:
The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION
63X6		LOGAN
Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.
LOGAN
Runner terminated 0:31
(a beat)
Ready for cleanup.
Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.
LOGAN
(smiling)
That was a great shot you made.
FRANCIS
Yes.
(beat)
But you look a little rusty to me --
what were you doing, wondering?
Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE
We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.
63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY
The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)
It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.
63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS
Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
63X11		2ND STICKMAN
Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN
Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE
As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.
63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE
Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.
FRANCIS
...Well I think you're getting stale.
You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole
burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell
me it turns you inside out...
He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.
FRANCIS
(calling after him)
I'll look for you here when I'm off--
And he is gone.
63X15		LOGAN
waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.
Crazy, man.
63X17		BACK TO LOGAN
Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS
The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.
63X19		LOGAN
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.
63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT
As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.
63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS
As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.
63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE
Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN
Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.
64		LOGAN AND JESSICA
As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.
LOGAN
What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA
(breaking away gently)
Please . . .No.
She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.
LOGAN
Please . . . no ?
(noting that she looks trapped,
he understands)
You mean "not here"--that's it?
You're a private Available but
particular,
(he is moving in on her
as he speaks, she retreating,
which amuses him)
Don't worry. There's no one here but me.
And you.
JESSICA
No.
(that stops him)
Just no.
LOGAN
You prefer women?
JESSICA
No.
LOGAN
Well then...?
JESSICA
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN
Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA
A friend of mine went on Carousel
tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN
(after a beat)
Yes...probably he was renewed?
JESSICA
(flatly)
He was killed
LOGAN
Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA
Isn't it right? Isn't that what
you do? Kill.
LOGAN
I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
Sandmen terminate
Runners
(a beat)
Who brought you?
JESSICA
Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
on the circuit.
LOGAN
You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA
Jessica.
LOGAN
(matter-of-fact)
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA
No.
LOGAN
Later.
JESSICA
No.
LOGAN
But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA
I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN
And?
JESSICA
I changed my mind
LOGAN
And now?
JESSICA
Curious.
LOGAN
About what?
JESSICA
How a Sandman lives.
Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.
LOGAN
Let's have sex.
(as Jessica shakes her head)
I thought you were curious.
JESSICA
Not about that.
LOGAN
(after a beat)
I'm listening.
JESSICA
I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN
(smiling)
I'm not armed.
(a beat)
Well?
JESSICA
Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN
You shouldn't even think such things...
(smiles)
And you picked a strange person to
say them to -
JESSICA
I suppose. But what if you want
to live?
LOGAN
So? Do what everyone does. Try
like hell for renewal.
Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.
LOGAN
When this turns black...that's it.
(laughs)
If for any reason you want to be 31...
you have the same chance as everyone
else...Carrousel.
Logan takes his gun and points it at her.
LOGAN 		(playfully)
But if you're one of the misfits...
that's where I come in.
JESSICA (somewhat
frightened)
I didn't say that I would run...
I Just...
LOGAN (interrupting;
turning over her palm)
Are you a 5 or a 6?
(we see a green crystal)
JESSICA
Six. I go red next year.
LOGAN
You're years away . . . I don't know
why you're thinking of these things,
much less talking about them.
(offering Jessica the gun)
Want to try?
Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.
LOGAN
What Quad do you live in?
JESSICA
K.
LOGAN (softly)
You're sure you don't want to try?
Jessica nods.
LOGAN
It's nice to know you can nod.
Jessica smiles.
LOGAN
It's nice co know you can do that,
too.
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
FRANCIS
These are for me -- you've got your
own.
(looking after Jessica)
She must have been something--?
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.
A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:
LOGAN
What happened to you?
SANDMAN (embarrassed)
I lost a Runner in Cathedral.
LOGAN
How come?
SANDMAN
Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage.
(as they stare)
One of them cut me bad...
(extends his arm and moves
a finger from his shoulder to
his wrist)
all the way down.
FRANCIS
(with anger)
CUBS!
SANDMAN (shrug)
On my way to the New You for repairs.
LOGAN
Get yourself a new face while you're
at it They know you now.
They wave. Logan and Francis continue.
64AX1-
64BX1

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.
SECOND MAN
He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get
old, too.
FIRST MAN
But what if he's telling the truth?
THIRD MAN
I say no. It's not worth the risk.
WOMAN
I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners
for a decade. He has no feelings.
JESSICA
He was born a Sandman. He had no
choice.
WOMAN
Neither do we.
87-88 	OUT
88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM
Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
1ST SANDMAN
Thanks, Francis.
FRANCIS (taking his
place at the console)
Just don't be forever about it like last
time.
1ST SANDMAN
Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
you'll miss a really good Run.
They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.
89 OUT
89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA
Leaning together talking in an undertone
SECOND MAN (urgently)
If he believes you, he'll come.
JESSICA
Why Arcade Station?
SECOND MAN (impatiently)
Why? It's our only chance--kill him
and get away in the crowd heading
for the evening slaughter --
JESSICA
Right at the station itself?
MAN
No - just there - on the first level.
(beat)
Don't look for us. We'll see you.
WOMAN (cutting in)
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
(beat)
Can you do it? Will you?
Slowly, Jessica nods.
THIRD MAN
Tonight?
JESSICA (stalling)
Y-yes...if I can find him.
WOMAN
I think you can. Don't you?
Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.
WOMAN
I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard
about Sanctuary -- and that makes him
dangerous to all of us.
After murmurs of agreement:
SECOND MAN
(staring at Jessica)
We're counting on you.
Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.
90-92	OUT
93-94 	OUT
94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS
Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
94X1		WITH JESSICA
Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.
94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE
The man from the restaurant, following.
94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA
Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.
Logan opens the door, reacts.
LOGAN
Are you here to help me?
JESSICA
What do you need?
A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.
94X4 	OUT
DISSOLVE TO:
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).
JESSICA
What're you going to do?
LOGAN
That's tomorrow.
JESSICA
(turning away slightly)
I wish I could help you.
LOGAN
(turning her gently back)
Maybe you'll chink of something...
JESSICA
(hating herself)
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE
The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.
94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
LOGAN
If you did know, you'd tell me.
JESSICA
Of course--
LOGAN (overriding)
If you trusted me, you'd know.
JESSICA (evading it)
We're coming to Arcade.
(beat)	-
Shall we Relive together?
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE
As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.
94X9 	OUT
94AX9	READY ROOM
As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.
94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL
Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.
94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE
Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.
94X12	FEATURING JESSICA
As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.
94X13	THE AMBUSHERS
Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.
LOGAN
Tell me, Jessica.
Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN
As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message:
RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
...LOGAN-5
The Sandman at the console turns and says:
1ST SANDMAN
Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
why don't you--
But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.
95-105 	OUT
105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH
The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.
LOGAN
A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.
106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE
JESSICA
You're not going, are you?
LOGAN (a beat)
Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
You won't. You'd better stay here.
The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
JESSICA (touching his
arm)
I'd rather be with you.
LOGAN (knowing she is
lying through her teeth)
That's nice.
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.
107-
109X1 	OUT
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE
As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

120 		OUT
121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT
LOGAN
Have you ever been through Cathedral?
Jessica shakes her head.
LOGAN
They're like beasts. Wild.
JESSICA
Maybe they're angry because they're
grown in meccano-breeders.
LOGAN (interrupting,
grimacing)
Instead of what? Nine months inside a
woman:
(ugh)
We're all raised the same but most of
us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
JESSICA
Some people say children need human
mothering.
LOGAN
Insane. Nurseries are better than any
mother could be.
JESSICA
I'm only telling you what I've heard...
(slightest beat)
Haven't you ever wondered what your
seed-mother was Like...?
LOGAN
Uh-uh.
JESSICA
I have.
LOGAN
(after a beat)
When did you begin to question Lastday?
JESSICA
I don't remember exactly...except I was
a Green.
(another beat)
What would you like to relive, Logan?
LOGAN (smiling)
Let's see - how long has it been?
As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.
A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.
VOICE
Attention passengers. Cathedral
Station is a personal risk area.
Persons with business are warned
to be careful.
Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.
JESSICA
I've never been in this quadrant.
(looks off)
Is that Arcade off there?
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL
Arcade shining like distant fireworks.
Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."
Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.
LOGAN
Let me go first. Sometimes they're
waiting just inside there--to rush
you when it opens...
LOGAN
Quickly now--
He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:
An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.
Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...
SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.
Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:
LOGAN
Runner!
Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!
There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.
As Logan whirls:
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE
Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.
A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.
BILLY
(speaking of the Runner)
Don't worry about her. We'll have that
one later. Right now I think we've got
a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!
The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.
A VOICE
We're going to have ourselves a time,
we are. Right, Billy?!
There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.
LOGAN
I'm a Sandman!
BILLY
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.
They
said I'd never get him...but I cut
him up good, I did.
LOGAN (firm tone)
I feel sorry for you, boy!
Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.
BILLY
For me? Better feel sorry for your-
self, Sandman!
LOGAN
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Billy is silent.
LOGAN
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running
out. How long can you last? A year. Six
months?
(he points to the yellow
flower in Billy's palm)
What happens when you're sixteen and
you go green?
BILLY (lashing out)
Nothing will happen! I make the
rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
Always have! Always will! I got
Cathedral and I'll never let go!
LOGAN
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever
heard of a cub with a green flower?
You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy,
when you're on green, because they
won't let a green stay here.
(slightest beat)
If you try to stay the young ones will
gut-rip you apart!
BILLY
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.
ANOTHER VOICE
Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut
his mouth! Let's watch him shake
himself to death!!
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
A VOICE
Give him some Muscle!!
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA
Watching..terrified.
127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
ANOTHER VOICE
Shake him to death!!
A VOICE
Kill him!
128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.
Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.
BILLY (chilling laugh)
He's trying to hold his breath...
As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:
With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.
He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.
BILLY
We can rush him...we can take
can take him	again, we can!!
The pack hesitates...stops backing away.
LOGAN
(moving the gun slowly
back and forth)
All right! How many of you want this to
be Lastday?!
The pack moves back again...and
disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.
LOGAN
Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
a Sandman, didn't you?!
Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.
LOGAN
Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on
After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.
Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.
The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.
They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.
We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.
LOGAN
(shaking his head)
They've got someone else! Why would
anybody come here?
Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.
The BEEPING is now very loud.
Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.
We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.
129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN
frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.
130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA
watching
131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN
WOMAN (nearing
hysteria)
There's been a terrible error! My
Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
(rising tone)
I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
green! Did you hear me?
(shouting)
Green!
LOGAN (quietly)
Don't be afraid--
Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
WOMAN
I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!
After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:
LOGAN (breathing hard)
I'm not going to hurt you.
Slowly, she rises.
Logan takes out the ankh.
LOGAN
Sanctuary? Anything?
Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.
LOGAN
If they find you throw this hard
enough to break it. Then hold your
breath till you get away...It's
blind gas.
Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.
During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.
Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING
He is shocked, unbelieving.
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS
Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble...
134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS
shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
tone)
Runner!
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;
134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN
hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.
135		LOGAN AND JESSICA
At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.
136		FRANCIS
After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:
FRANCIS (quietly)
Runner terminated at G.16
Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
Quadrant 39.
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE
The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.
They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.
SECOND MAN
I almost believed her.
They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.
138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS
Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.
as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:
141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN
A safe distance behind.
Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.
Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.
They are blinded by:
274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN
As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:
Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.
JESSICA
Is there something on fire!!
Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.
As Logan looks up at the sun.
LOGAN
It seems to be moving away.
Come on...
274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.
274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS
Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.
JESSICA (frightened)
What's that?
LOGAN
It feels like breath. It makes
everything move. Your hair is moving.
JESSICA (smiling)
And yours.
They reach the level below and pause, look around.
LOGAN
Jessica -- we must be outside!
She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.
275-276	OUT
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.
Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.
Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.
He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.
walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.
His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.
He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.
He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.
As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:
Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.
288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
Reaching...
289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK
They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:
JESSICA
Logan!!!Look!!
(Logan turns around)
No...your palm...look!!!
Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.
He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.
JESSICA (quietly)
What does it mean?
LOGAN (trying to
assimilate its meaning
himself)
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.
JESSICA (with laughter)
You can have any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
LOGAN (straight)
You know, Jessica.
JESSICA. (a beat)
...But I still have the choice...?
LOGAN
Of course.
JESSICA
Then the answer's Yes...
They embrace there in the water...

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY
As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.
Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.
339X2	JESSICA
quietly watching:
DISSOLVE TO:
On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.
As Logan wakes he hears:
OLD MAN
Of course...that's settled then.
But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA
We'll remember. But that's a long time
off...
She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.
LOGAN
What are we promising him? What can we
possibly give him?
JESSICA
He asked if we would bury him when his
time comes.
LOGAN (beat)
We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA
To what?
LOGAN
I'm going to try and tell people what
we've seen and--
JESSICA (interrupting)
You're lying! You'll never have the
chance to tell anybody anything!
You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN
Do you expect me to let things go on
without trying to change them?!
JESSICA
Things won't change...you know that!
We can live here together, Logan...
have a life as long as his... together!
LOGAN (showing his palm)
Things change!
JESSICA
You want to go back to kill, is that it?!
Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill
Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!
Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.
LOGAN (softly)
Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
(as she quiets down)
The Lifeclocks made me kill
Francis. They make people die or
be killed every day. If I didn't
try and destroy that...I couldn't
live here or anywhere. Do you
understand?
JESSICA
I want to be alive and with you,
that's all I want.
Logan puts his arms around her.
LOGAN
I know...I know...
The Old Man comes to them, wondering.
LOGAN
We're leaving.
OLD MAN
What a pity. I was hoping you'd
be here to bury me.
JESSICA
Come with us.
OLD MAN
Where are you going?
LOGAN
To a city with thousands and thousands
of people.
OLD MAN
Alive?
Logan nods.
OLD MAN
Thousands and thousands...as many as
my cats?
LOGAN
More...many more.
OLD MAN
And all alive you say?
Logan nods.
OLD MAN
Yes, I would like to see that. Is it
a long journey?
Again, Logan nods.
OLD MAN (mumbling)
Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

351-361 	OUT
The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.
As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily.
As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:
OLD MAN (marveling tone)
Never see the sun or the moon...
I hope we get there soon...
361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE
On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.
OLD MAN (weary but
enthusiastic)
Is that really it? It doesn't
seem very far. Will we be there
soon?
LOGAN
I promise. We '11 go on as soon
as it's light.
JESSICA (gently,
turning O.M. away)
But now I'm tired. Let's go back to
the fire...
They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.
P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)
NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.
As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.
OLD MAN
That's better than gold when it's cold.
LOGAN
Thank you.
(turning to Old Man)
Tell me - what do those words mean?
"Beloved husband...Beloved son"...
"Beloved wife"'...
OLD MAN
My father was the husband and my
mother was the wife. "Beloved" is
a word they used - to stay together.
LOGAN
Stay? They lived together all their years?
OLD MAN
Oh, yes...I think...
JESSICA (reading;
moved)
Beloved son...
(a beat)
So people stayed together for that
feeling of love... They would live and
raise children together and be remembered.
(another beat)
I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we
be that way?
LOGAN (facing Jessica)
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
(a beat)
JESSICA
And Sanctuary?
LOGAN
Sanctuary is the right to live....
nothing more. But nothing less, either....
There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.
JESSICA (whispering)
Beloved husband...
LOGAN (kissing her)
Beloved wife...

As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.
The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.
362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY
Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They
HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER
As they approach cautiously...they see:
365		WAVE POWER INLET
Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.
JESSICA
What does that water do?
LOGAN
It's part of the hydrogalvanic
system. The ocean tides are changed
into energy somehow.
JESSICA
Is it inside the city?
LOGAN
Of course.
(a beat)
I don't know where...
(frowning)
I Just took them for granted.
(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
It's our only chance.
The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:
366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER
At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.
After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
LOGAN (softly)
I know...
(after a beat; to the
Old Man)
We're going to try and get in this
way. I don't think you can make it.
OLD MAN (sadly)
Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
all those people.
LOGAN
I'm sorry.
OLD MAN
Yes...
LOGAN
Can you make it back?
OLD MAN
Oh my...I'll try.
JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
Goodbye.
OLD MAN
Oh, my...
The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.
367		THE OLD MAN
he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.
Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.
People getting the hell out of there.
Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.
The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.
410X11	GREAT HALL
The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.
410X12	CAROUSEL
As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.
410X13	GREAT HALL
The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.
410X14	ARCADE
People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling
each other in their fright.
410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.
B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.
C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.
D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.
E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.
F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.
G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.
INTERCUT with above:
410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.
410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
Running past Power Center.
The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.
A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.
Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:
412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.
AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.
Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.
As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.
Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.
FADE OUT:
THE END
