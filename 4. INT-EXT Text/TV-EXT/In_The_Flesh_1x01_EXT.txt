        A panoramic view of the small rural village of ROARTON in 
        Lancashire. It s a remote, location surrounded by woodland, 
      that s in the books as an  Outstanding Place of Natural 
      Beauty . And from this hill top view it certainly seems like 
      it. But looks can be deceiving... if you look really 
      carefully you may catch sight of a gibbet, left over from the 
      rising, in the distance.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Dead of night. The whole street is asleep. The Walker s front 
      door opens slowly and Sue, dressed in her Sunday best, sneaks 
      out. She is followed by Steve, dressed in a suit. They creep 
      to Steve s CAR, and get in as quietly as they can.

      The Main Gate still has TWO SOLDIERS posted on it. However

      The Walker s car pulls up. Steve rolls down the window. He 
      has paperwork and passports at the ready.

      Steve and Sue freeze. She wants a lift in the car. 

                                    STEVE
                    Well, we don t have room for 
                      everyone.

      Shirley fixes Ken with a look.

      Ken closes the back door. 

                                  KEN (CONT D)
                    Tafor the offer, Steve, but I have 
                    to speak to Shirley about 
                      something.

                            window)
                    Okay. No trouble. Bye then. 

      Steve rolls up his window.   Puts his foot down and turns 
      right into the road leading their culde sac.   Sue and Steve 
      look at each other -  Jesus, that was close . 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The car pulls up in the driveway. STEVE and SUE get out. Sue 
      goes to the front door. Opens it, steps inside. Steve surveys 
      the cul-de-sac. No one in sight. He opens the back door. 
      KIEREN gets out, a coat over his head, Steve quickly ushers 
      him into the house. Sue closes the door behind her. 

      In the background a curtain twitches and we see the shadowy 
      figure of a woman who we will later know as MAGGIEBURTON 
      (63).

                                                                            CUT TO:

      It s pouring with rain.Billopens the backyard gate and 
      crosses to his truck. He puts the bag of weapons in the back

      And with that he drives the pick up out the drive way.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      It s raining. Jem s in the bus shelter with a bottle of 
      cider. The WALKIE TALKIE Bill gave her sits idly by her. It

      Normal looking shed. Freezer. A few bikes. Lawn mower. Steve 
      moves the freezer out of the way. Jem turns on the 
        flashlight. There behind the freezer is an assortment of 
      gardening equipment that has been  weaponized  (a rake with 
      knife blades attached to the end, a cricket bat with nails 
      hammered through it). They look old, rusty and used. Sue 
      grabs a chainsaw. Jem grabs a LOCKED MONEY BOX.

      Bill gets out of his pick-up. Dean, Gary. They all carry

      Dean restrains him.

      Ken lets out an awful primal cry of pain. Jem can t believe 
      what she s just witnessed. Neither can Gary and Dean. 

      Ken runs to his wife and cradles her in his arms.  

      Bill turns to Jem.

      Jem can only stare at Ken holding his dead wife. 

      Bill turns and gets in his pick up truck. 

      Gary and Dean just stand there in shock. 

      Bill beeps the horn. Gary and Dean snap out of it and join 
      him.  

      We pan up to Kieren s bedroom window. There Kieren is looking 
      in horror at the weeping, devastated Ken, widower for a 
      second time, cradling Maggie sbody in the street.
