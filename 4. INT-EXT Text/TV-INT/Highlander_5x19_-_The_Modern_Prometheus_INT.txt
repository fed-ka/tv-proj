      Dim lights struggle against the blue haze of Gitanes.  On
      stage, MIKE PALADINO, early twenties, plays guitar with
      Dawson's bass and drum player to a small after hours crowd. 
      Mike's eyes are closed, his fingers dance over the frets in
      a reverie that is a cross between magic and a religious
      experience.

      At a table not far from the stage, METHOS, DAWSON and MACLEOD.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This kid's great.

                                      DAWSON
                    We picked him up in London.  He came
                    to every show, every night.

                                      METHOS
                    No accounting for taste.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is the first time he's been
                    onstage.  He was with us for/two
                    weeks hauling amps for a bus ticket
                    before we even found out he played.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He plays.
                          (beat)
                    Just look at him.

                                      DAWSON
                    Never gets tight or nervous.  Just
                    lays it out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nervous?  He's already forgotten
                    anybody else is here.
                          (beat; to Methos)
                    Remember what that's like?

                                      METHOS
                    I never played guitar.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's not what I mean.
                          (beat)
                    To be so lost in what you're doing
                    that there's no time, no space.

      Methos takes a drink of beer, plays it cool.

                                      METHOS
                    There's a greeting card in there
                      somewhere.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    I don't remember, but I wish I did.

      MAURICE stops by MacLeod's table.  He's the Manager of the
      club.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you think, Maurice?

                                      MAURICE
                    Your friend plays well.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon, Maurice, book him for a night
                    or two as an opening act.

                                      DAWSON
                    The kid's got chops.

      Maurice nods, listens to something in the music.

                                      MAURICE
                    He has more.  He has passion.  It's
                    a gift.
                          (knowing eyebrow)
                    And a curse, n est-ce pas?

      BUZZ.  MacLeod and Methos look toward the doors.  Byron enters
      with two beautiful GIRLS, one hanging on each arm.  A murmur
      of recognition ripples through the crowd.

      Methos reacts.  A little smile.  Byron spots him and heads
      their way.

                                      METHOS
                    Well, well.  Look who's here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who's that?

                                      DAWSON
                    Byron.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So that's Lord Byron.

      Byron reaches their table, grabs Methos' hand warmly.

                                      BYRON
                    Doc!  It's been ages.

                                      METHOS
                    You've become quite famous again.

      Byron brushes it aside.

                                      BYRON
                    Can't seem to shake it.

      Methos handles the introductions.

                                      METHOS
                    Duncan MacLeod.  Joe Dawson.

      Byron and MacLeod shake.

                                      BYRON
                    Any friend of Doc's...

      MacLeod takes in Byron -- dressed in black leather, a cape,
      sporting a cane -- and his spandex-clad entourage.  He's not
      impressed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Charmed.

      But Dawson beams...

                                      DAWSON
                    My pleasure!  Been a big fan of yours
                    for a long time.

                                      BYRON
                    In that case, let me buy you a drink.
                          (to Maurice)
                      Champagne.  For everyone.

      Maurice moves off.

      Byron smiles a twisted smile.  He maneuvers the two Girls
      into chairs and takes a seat at the table.

      ON STAGE

      Mike finishes to wild applause.

                                      BYRON
                          (re: Mike)
                    Who's the kid?
                          (without waiting for
                          an answer)
                    He's not bad.

      Mike comes bouncing back to their table, pumped.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nice job, Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    Oh, man, what a rush!

                                      DAWSON
                          (re the happy crowd)
                    You did great.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks, Joe, I --

      His eyes land on Byron, widen in recognition.  Byron smiles
        expansively.

                                      BYRON
                    Great chops, kid.

      Mike's in heaven.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you... who I think you are?
                          (overwhelmed)
                    I've got all your CDs, man.  Even
                    the imports.

      It's a love-fest.  Dawson grins, punches Methos in the
      shoulder.

                                      DAWSON
                          (re: Byron)
                    All this time, you knew this guy...
                    you didn't tell me?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Methos)
                    Yeah... Doc...

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      A roaring fire casts the room in an eerie light.  Byron stands
      by the fireplace, book in hand.  Methos, entering, looks at
      Byron with amused suspicion.  The others straggle in behind
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    What are you up to now?

                                      BYRON
                    It is time for more stories.

      He dramatically throws the book into the fire.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Let us call forth the armies of the
                    night and do them battle, soul to
                    soul, until they or we call hold,
                    enough, and give over the field.

                                      SHELLEY
                    Sounds thrilling.

      Mary reacts, exchanging a look with Methos -- less thrilled.

                                      METHOS
                    Sounds morbid.

                                      SHELLEY
                    Let us bring forth our own ghosts
                    from deep within us.  From those
                    dead humors rattling round the
                    midnight of our souls.

      Byron turns his gaze directly on Mary.

1708CONTINUED:1708

                                      BYRON
                    Who's next?  The quiet "Mrs. Shelley?"

                                    MARY
                    You mock me, sir, but I have known
                    death.  I have held it in my arms.
                          (beat)
                    I hope never to feel the like again.

                                      BYRON
                    But feel you did.  In tasting grief,
                    in tasting fear, is that not the
                    time we truly live?
                          (a challenge)
                    So, fair muse, what ghosts have you
                    to share tonight?

      Mary's confidence wilts in the blinding spotlight of Byron's
      attention.  She turns her eyes away.

                                    MARY
                    I'm afraid my imagination fails me
                    at present.

                                      BYRON
                    But look, dear lady.  Your neighbor
                    greedily gulps the nectar of
                      creativity itself.

      He takes the vial of laudanum from Claire and offers it to
      Mary.  Conscious all eyes are on her, Mary seizes it boldly. 
      She takes a quick sniff, then drinks deeply.

      Almost immediately, her eyes glaze over, she begins to tremble
      violently.  Byron glares at her suspiciously.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What melodrama is this?

      Shelley giggles in a drunken stupor.  Claire dances to music
      only she can hear.

      But Methos sits up, concerned.  Mary begins to CHOKE
        uncontrollably.  He rushes to her side and supports her as
      her breathing eases.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Shelley)
                    I think your wife has had enough,
                    sir.

      Shelley, too drunk to help, waves a languid hand.

                    Carry on, dear doctor.  Into your
                    hands I commend her spirit.

      With a snort of disgust, Methos turns his back on Shelley
      and scoops the swooning Mary into his arms.

      A barely conscious Mary tosses in her bed.  Confused, blinking
      through her laudanum haze, she looks up at Methos, who stands
      over her.

                                    MARY
                    Am I dead?

      Methos smiles.

                                      METHOS
                    If you are, then I must be an angel,
                    and that's the one thing I'm not.

                                    MARY
                    All this talk of death and ghosts.

      She begins to get drowsy again.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    I had a baby once.  Clara.
                          (beat)
                    I dreamt she came back to life.
                          (through labored
                            breaths.)
                    With a beak for a mouth, snarling
                    teeth and claws for hands.

                                      METHOS
                    It was only a dream.

                                    MARY
                      Sometimes...
                          (she swallows)
                    Sometimes I wonder who is more
                      unhappy... those who die?  Or those
                    who live.

      She shivers.  He softly strokes her hair, comforting her.

                                      METHOS
                    You are wiser than you know.

      He pulls the covers up, tenderly tucking her in.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Perhaps, dear Mary... death is not
                    truly journey's end, but merely
                    another bend in the road.
                          (beat)
                    If we truly believe that, we can
                    live without fear.

      Her eyes closer she drops off into sleep.

                                      BYRON (O.S.)
                    Bravo!  Bravo!

      Byron stands in the doorway, applauding and smirking at
      Methos.

                                      METHOS
                          (a whispered hiss)
                    Be still!

      Byron sits on the bed beside the barely conscious Mary.  He
      fondles her hair.

                                      BYRON
                    Still.  So quiet.  Almost like death.

      His hand slips along her side, drifts down to her leg.  Mary
      stirs in response.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Yet look!  She stirs.  Is she not
                      beautiful?

                                      METHOS
                    That she is.

      Byron places Methos' hand on Mary's breast.  Methos lets it
      stay for a moment, his eyes going from Byron's face to Mary's. 
      Finally he takes the hand away.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Let her rest.

      Byron's fingers trace the line of her leg up to her inner
      thigh.  Mary MOANS softly.

                                      BYRON
                    But would she want to sleep?  I say
                    we take her, and push the bounds of
                    our rapture to heaven itself.

      Methos is tempted, but resists.

                                      METHOS
                    I think we should leave before we
                    push the bounds of decency.

      Byron laughs, and starts to unbutton Mary's gown.

                                      BYRON
                    Decency means nothing.  All that
                    matters is this moment, the three of
                    us here, in this room.
                          (with passion)
                    Look at her, feel her hunger.
                          (beat)
                    What's the point in living if we
                    don't taste what life offers us?

      He kisses Mary, deeply.

                                      METHOS
                    Enough!

      Methos tears him away from Mary.

                                      BYRON
                    How dare you!
                          (beat)
                    This is my home.  My life.  I will
                    do with it as I choose.
                          (with a smile)
                    Unless you choose to stop me.

      With catlike grace, Byron draws his sword from his cane,
      holds it at the ready.  Methos shakes his head, does not
      answer the challenge.

                                      METHOS
                    Put it away and leave her be.  I'd
                    rather have your poetry than your
                    head.

      There's an edge of steel.  Something in the voice.  There's
      no sword in his hand, but Byron sees the tip of the iceberg
      of something he doesn't want to mess with.  He petulantly
      sheathes his sword.

                                      BYRON
                    Very well.  As a favor to you.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Decorated in eclectic Punk-Gothic.  Oversized windows show
      the lights of Paris.  Giant modernistic CANDELABRAS throw
      molten half-light on twisted shapes of furniture.  Bizarre
      works of ART dot the walls (Monet meets Kandinsky),
        interspersed with various ro ck and movie POSTERS.  One of
      them is an oversized poster of "Frankenstein."  The overall
      effect is sensual, exciting... but also unsettling.

      An UNEARTHLY WAIL rips through the air.

      Mike riffs drunkenly on his guitar.  A near-empty glass of
      whiskey sits at his elbow.

      Something moves across the room.  A dark, squirming mass of
      human limbs.  A MOAN.  A SHRIEK.  Pleasure?  Pain?

      The shadows shift.

      It's Byron and the Girls playing Kama Sutra - The Home Game. 
      Byron unravels himself, applauds Mike s playing.

                                      BYRON
                    Bravo!  You are the man.

      Mike's got whiskey tongue.

                                    MIKE
                    Uh... thanks.  You really think so?

                                      BYRON
                    I said so.
                          (to one of the Girls)
                    Didn't I say so?

      She nods.  The Girls float over, snuggle up to Mike, now
      duly baptized by the Master.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                          (back to Mike)
                    You're coming by the studio tomorrow,
                    right?  Sit in on some tracks.  Meet
                    some people.

                                    MIKE
                          (going for cool)
                    You know it.

      Byron pulls out a small packet, raises it high above his
      head.

                                      BYRON
                    Nightcap, anyone?

      He snorts a pinch of white powder, offers it next to Mike. 
      Mike shakes his head.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks, but... I don't think so.  I,
                    uh, I oughta get going.

      Byron's eyes turn to ice.

                                      BYRON
                    That's cool.

                                    MIKE
                    So... what time tomorrow?

                                      BYRON
                          (cool)
                    Actually, tomorrow's a little busy. 
                    But my manager'll send you a coupla
                    tickets for the show.

      He turns his back on Mike.  A silent signal.  The Girls drift
      back to Byron, sidestepping Mike like fresh roadkill.

      Disappointed, Mike grabs his guitar, weaves toward the door.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Don't know what you're missing.

      Mike turns around.  Byron's smiling face floats an inch away. 
      His eyes flash like Fourth of July fireworks.  Inside, Mike
      feels himself slipping off that railing again.  Slipping and
      falling.  Into Byron's eyes, Byron's smile... how bad could
      it be?

      He puts out his hand, takes the packet of white powder.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You're the man.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      It's early in the day, the club is empty.  Except for Dawson
      and his band practicing on stage for an audience of MacLeod
      and Methos.  Maurice putters around behind the bar.

      Mike enters, high as a kite.  He heads for the stage, starts
      taking out his guitar.  Everyone stops playing and looks at
      him.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're late.

                                    MIKE
                    Sorry.

                                      DAWSON
                    You don't want to do this, just say
                    so.

                                    MIKE
                    No, man, I'm ready.

      He runs a couple of chords.  With a shrug, Joe signals his
      guys and they start playing.  Mike joins in, but he's sloppy,
      fighting to keep up, squinting at his instrument.  Yesterday's
      magic is nowhere in sight.

      MacLeod and Methos exchange a look, realizing, just as

      DAWSON

      stops playing and puts a hand on Mike's arm, stopping him.

                                    MIKE
                    What?

                                      DAWSON
                    Maybe you should get some sleep. 
                    We'll do this later.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tough night?

                                    MIKE
                    It was hot.  You should've heard me. 
                    Byron said I was awesome.  I was
                    flying.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think you still are.

      MacLeod and Dawson share a look.

                                      DAWSON
                          (beat)
                    He give you something to help you
                    along?

                                    MIKE
                    What do you mean, man?

                                      DAWSON
                    Look...

      Dawson takes a deep breath, decides to take the plunge.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Maybe this is none of my business.

      Mike sees it coming, starts to squirm.

                                    MIKE
                    Maybe it isn't.  You should have
                    heard me.  I was never better.

                                      DAWSON
                    Getting high doesn't help your
                    playing.  You just think it does.

                                    MIKE
                    You accusing me of something?

                                      DAWSON,
                    Nothing I haven t done myself.  And
                    paid for.  Words of wisdom... take
                    'em or leave 'em.

      Mike gets his back up.

                                    MIKE
                    Look, man.  We re talking about
                    Byron.  You should be happy for me,
                    not bitching at me.

      He storms off, almost knocking Maurice down as he exits. 
      Dawson looks after him in frustration.

                                      DAWSON
                    Screwed that up, didn't I?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Somebody did.

      He looks over at Methos, waiting.  With a sigh, Methos stands
      up.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll go talk to Byron.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll join you.
                          (off Methos' reaction)
                    Just to make sure he listens.

                                      DAWSON
                    Thanks, guys.

      They exit.  Dawson picks up his guitar, but his heart's not
      in it, he doesn't play.

      Maurice, wiping a nearby table, looks up at Dawson.

                                      MAURICE
                    You are worried.

                                      DAWSON
                    Damn right.  Kid's in a tough place.

                                      MAURICE
                    To play the great music, one must
                    embrace life, yes?

                                      DAWSON
                    The good and the bad, hallelujah.

                                      MAURICE
                    I was a young man, working in my
                    Uncle's club, the first time I heard
                    Charlie Parker.
                          (beat)
                    Sometimes the man is not as strong
                    as the music.

      Maurice shrugs his world weary shoulders, moves off, leaving
      a troubled Dawson on stage.


      Lord Byron lays down the law to his MANAGER, who scribbles
      notes furiously on a pad as Byron is lambasting him.

                                      BYRON
                    Life, my friend, is in the details. 
                    I like almonds, not cashews.

      MacLeod and Methos enter mid-harangue.  Byron stabs the air
      with his cane for emphasis.  It's clear he's just busting
      the guy's chops.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)

      Methos watches this display with bemusement, but MacLeod
      registers a scowl of distaste.  Byron plays up the moment
      for their benefit.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    And fed to me by women... Tall
                    women... With long black hair...

                    I know you want to make me happy.

      The Manager scampers off.  Byron relaxes, all calm and grace,
      turns to MacLeod and Methos.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                      Afternoon, boys.

                    Kid's got a good shot.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's why we're here.

      Byron ignores MacLeod, pulls out another packet of white
      powder and offers it to his guests.

                                      METHOS
                    Pass.

                    idling.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just fine, thanks.  And so did Mike. 
                    At least until last night.

      Byron snorts some coke, reacts.

                                      BYRON
                    Whoa!  That's better.  Immortality
                    gets pretty damn dull after the first
                    couple centuries, doesn't it?

      He sniffs, wipes his nose, refocuses on Methos.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What's the secret, Doc?  What do you
                    do when there's nothing left but the
                    deep, cold emptiness that stretches
                    for centuries behind us... when you
                    look in the mirror and all you see
                    is the abomination that you are.

      Methos doesn't answer.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Mary stands by the door to the drawing room.  She appears
      tentative, unsure of entering.

      Footsteps behind her.  She turns.  It's Methos.  He offers
      her his arm.

                                      METHOS
                    Shall we?

                                    MARY
                      I confess, I'm afraid to go in.

                                      METHOS
                    It's just his way of being
                      entertaining.

                    They're only ghost stories.

                                    MARY
                    Told by master wordsmiths.  Lord
                    Byron's words are things that will
                    live forever.  What have I to offer
                    in such company?

                                      METHOS
                    Your heart.  Your dreams.
                          (beat)
                    Your nightmares.

      Mary turns sharply.  Something in his voice.  A confession?

                                    MARY
                    Is that where you found your story?

      Methos nods slowly.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    Pray, tell me.

      He shakes his head.

                                      METHOS
                    Not now.

      He gently takes her hand and pulls her toward the drawing
      room.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Come, let us show Byron and Shelley
                    that they do not have the only
                    creative minds of the day.


      Claire, stoned and drunk, dress falling off her shoulders,
      plays the piano for Shelley, Byron and Dr. Polidori.  As
      Methos and Mary enter, Byron stands, aims his cane in their
      direction.

                                      BYRON
                    We began to despair of your company.

      He bends over Shelley's ear, whispers loudly so all can hear.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Hark, Percy!  The good Doctor is in
                    love with your Mary.  What say you
                    to that?

      Shelley raises a glass of claret in a drunken toast.

                                      SHELLEY
                    I say run!  And fleet be thy feet. 
                    Fly from love, that horned beast
                    that impales all men!

      Mary looks stricken, but says nothing -- this isn't the first
      wound she's received at Shelley's hand.

      Methos is about to retort when he gets the BUZZ.  His eyes
      meet Byron's -- another Immortal.  Byron moves to him.

                                      BYRON
                          (sotto)
                    It seems my destiny awaits.
                          (to the assembled
                            company)
                    With your permission, my friends.

      He takes Methos by the arm and they leave the drawing room
      together, Mary's eyes following them out.96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   31.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97




      Methos and Byron move toward the front door.

                                      METHOS
                    The jealous husband?

      They reach the door.  Someone is pounding on it from outside. 
      Byron pulls it open to reveal Hans Kershner, soaked to the
      skin from the storm outside.

                                      BYRON
                    Hans, good friend!  Come, man.  Warm
                    thy sodden self by my fire.

      WHAM!

      Kershner lets loose with a roundhouse punch.  Knocks Byron
      on his ass.

                                      KERSHNER
                    That is for my wife!

      Kershner draws his sword.

                                      KERSHNER (CONT'D)
                    Defend yourself!

      Byron makes a show of standing shakily, leaning heavily on
      his cane, favoring his lame foot.

                                      BYRON
                    Alas, my good man, I am a poet, not
                      a warrior.

                                      KERSHNER
                    What you are is a cuckolding cripple.

      Byron whips his sword out suddenly, coming erect, putting
      paid to the image of a man too lame to fight.

                                      BYRON
                    Try me, and you shall see the poet's
                    mettle.

      Methos hastily tries to intervene.

                          (to Byron)

                          (to Kershner)
                    Think, man, who this is.  Would you
                    be Lord Byron's murderer?

      Kershner draws his own sword.

      makes the first lunge, driving Kershner through the door and

      Byron stands in front of the giant "Frankenstein" poster. 
      He reads to MacLeod and Methos from a book...

                                      BYRON
                    "Light, feeling, and sense will pass
                    away; and in this condition must I
                    find my happiness."

      He snaps the book shut.

                    Get to the point.

                                      BYRON
                    The point is we're all Frankenstein's
                    monster.  Doomed to walk the frozen
                    tundra for eternity.

                    At least this gives us the illusion
                    of life.

      He holds it out to MacLeod.  MacLeod SMACKS it out of his
      hand, scattering white powder everywhere.

      Byron raises his hands in mock surrender.  MacLeod turns on
      his heel, storms out with Methos on his tail.

      Byron stands alone with the giant poster of the monster he
      has come to despise as himself.


      Byron sits alone in his loft, a half empty bottle of Jack
      Daniels in one hand, "Frankenstein" looming over his shoulder.

      A KNOCK at the door.  Byron twitches -- the spider sensing
      the fly.  He's his old arrogant, sneering self as he opens
      the door on Mike.

      He moves to a table, opens a drawer, and takes out a silver
      case containing a syringe.

      Someone pounds on the door.

      THWACK!   The door flies open, SPLINTERS the frame.

      MACLEOD bursts in.  He quickly scans the room... it appears
      to be empty.

      He turns to leave, notices something...

      something white...

      a HAND...

      trailing out from behind the sofa.

      He dashes over looks down.

      MACLEOD S POV

      MIKE lies in a contorted heap, his dead white face staring
      glassy-eyed at the ceiling.

      MACLEOD knows in his heart it's hopeless, but he drops to
      his knees, feels for a pulse.  The kid is cold.

                    Damn him!

      He grabs the nearest thing that isn't nailed down -- a lamp,
      an empty whiskey tumbler, maybe a chair -- and hurls it across
      the room at the gloomy Frankenstein poster, shattering the
      glass.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                    And disappoint my fans?  I've got a
                    show to do.  Tonight.

                                      METHOS
                    It used to be more than a show.
                          (beat)
                    You were reaching for the heavens.

                                      BYRON
                          (with passion)
                    There is no heaven.  It's an illusion
                    for fools and innocents. 
                          (beat)
                    I have no dreams, no hopes, no poetry
                    left.  I feel nothing but this gnawing
                    hunger and hear nothing but my own
                    voice, screaming my failure.
                          (beat)
                    You know what I am.

                                      METHOS
                          (with sympathy)
                    Yes.  I know.

      Byron can't take pity.  He comes up close to Methos, slinks
      an arm around his shoulder.  Covering up his moment of pain
      with a mocking tone:

                                      BYRON
                    But do you know who you are?  You're
                    the guy in the audience, Doc.  And
                    I'm the guy on the flying trapeze.
                          (the old smugness)
                    Who's having more fun?

                                      METHOS
                    But who lives longest?

                                      BYRON
                    Who cares!

                                      METHOS
                    I do.

                                      BYRON
                    Do you want a tombstone that says,
                    "He lived for centuries."  Or one
                    that says, "For centuries, he was
                    ALIVE!"

                                      METHOS
                    You haven't been listening.  I don't
                    want a tombstone.

      The b.g. noise gets louder as the CROWD begins to CHANT...

                                      CROWD (O.S.)
                    By-ron!  By-ron! By-ron!

      Byron cocks an ear.

                                      BYRON
                    Hear that!?  They're playing my song.

      Byron picks up his guitar and heads for the door.


      Methos walks down the tunnel that leads from the dressing
      rooms to the stage.

      Byron's band can be heard as MUFFLED ROCK in b.g.

      Methos gets the BUZZ.  He turns.

      MACLEOD

      strides purposefully forward.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Mike Paladino's dead.  O.D.ed.

      Methos puts himself in his path, tries to slow him down.

                                      METHOS
                    I don't suppose a discussion about
                    personal responsibility would interest
                    you right now.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sure it would.  I hold Byron
                      personally responsible.

                                      METHOS
                    He didn't force Mike to do anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's a load of crap and you know
                    it.  Mike is dead because of Byron.

                                      METHOS
                    Mike is dead because of Mike.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That boy idolized him, and Byron put
                    the gun in his hand and dared him to
                    pull the trigger.
                          (with passion)
                    "To live like me you have to be like
                    me."
                          (beat)
                    Except Mike couldn't.  He wasn't
                    Immortal.

1729CONTINUED:1729

                                      METHOS
                    And that's Byron's fault?

      He pushes past.  Methos runs to catch up.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Mac, wait!  Think about the poetry
                    he's written, the music he's made. 
                    The music he has yet to make.  Are
                    you prepared to kill all that?

      MacLeod comes up short, gets in Methos' face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And what about Mike?  What music
                    could he have made?

      Methos is quiet.  No answer.

      Eyes hard, jaw set, MacLeod moves off down the tunnel, the
      CROWD CHEERING in b.g.  Methos lets him go.


      Byron's band has finished their set.  Manic CHEERS and
      WHISTLES continue b.g. as Byron bounces backstage.

      Drenched in sweat, eyes blazing, panting like he's just run
      the Boston Marathon...

      He gets the BUZZ.  A tall FIGURE storms down the dark tunnel. 
      It passes under an overhead light --

      MACLEOD

      bears down on him like a freight train from hell.

                                      BYRON
                    Lemme guess?  You want an autograph.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No thanks.

      MacLeod pulls his sword.

      Byron flicks his cane and out comes his sword, and then with
      his freehand, pulls a larger blade.

      In the B.G., the crowd is chanting.

                                      BYRON
                    Listen to that!  They love me!

1730CONTINUED:1730

                                      MACLEOD
                    But it doesn't help, does it?
                          (beat)
                    Tell me, is there anything you despise
                    more than yourself?

                                      BYRON
                          (stung)
                    You.

      Byron lashes out.  MacLeod meets the challenge.  They duel
      down the corridor and out into --


      Quiet.  After hours.  Empty tables.  The late night crowd is
      gone.

      On the dim stage, Dawson and his guitar play a sad, meandering
      melody.

      Methos sits at a nearby table nursing a beer.

      MacLeod enters.  Methos looks up, their eyes meet.  And hold
      for a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Byron's dead.

      Methos goes back to his beer.

      MacLeod glances toward Dawson.  No reaction.  Did he hear
      him?  He takes a step toward the stage.

                                      DAWSON
                    I heard you.

      He looks at MacLeod with empty eyes.  He shakes his head,
      goes back to his guitar.

      MacLeod moves over to Methos' table.  An awkward BEAT --
      MacLeod has nothing to apologize for, but after all... Byron
      was his friend.

      Methos speaks to the table.

                                      METHOS
                    I told you this was inevitable.

      Close enough for MacLeod.  He takes a seat.  Methos looks
      up, shrugs.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Matter and anti-matter.  I think
                    Byron knew it, too.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It didn t have to be that way.  He
                    could have stopped it.  Before Mike
                    got hurt.

                                      METHOS
                    Byron?  Back off?  No way.

                    Not after all the years that led up
                    to this moment.  His life had become
                    one long tragedy.

      He takes a sip of beer.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    And we all know how those end, don't
                    we?

      But MacLeod doesn't answer.

      He just nods, listening to the lonely wail of Dawson's guitar.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
