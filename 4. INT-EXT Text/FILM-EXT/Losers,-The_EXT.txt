Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the
desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck.
ROQUE
Cards.
The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three
(Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.
JENSEN
Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
ROQUE
Your mama had that feeling too.
At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE...
...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.
Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.
3.
ROQUE (CONT'D)
Raise you.
POOCH
(INTRIGUED)
That the one with the hollow points?
ROQUE
Yup.
POOCH
Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.
He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner
looking knife. Twirling it.
JENSEN
This even me up?
ROQUE
Exactly how many knives do you
have, anyway?
Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.
POOCH
Cougar - your bet.
The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a
three. He shakes his head at them. Before he can bet...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, losers!
WHIP PAN to
Clay. Mid-30's. Their leader, and you gotta be a bad-
ass to lead this crew. Tired eyes. A weariness to him
already. And hands faster than you can imagine.
CLAY
It's time...
SMASH TO:
RIPPING ACROSS THE DESERT. Pooch drives, Clay shotgun,
others in the back. Passing a COMPUTER TABLET to Jensen:
4.
CLAY
Authenticate and backtrace.
POOCH
(GRUMBLING)
Send us out to the middle of nowhere
to "wait for instructions"...
JENSEN
(FINISHES CHECKING)
We're good, this baby came out of
the Kandahar Spook Station,
controller's codename is Max.
He hands the tablet back.
ROQUE
(DISTASTE)
This is an Agency gig?
CLAY
We don't get to pick what needs to
be done.
(reading from tablet)
Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is
running a terrorist assembly line
out around the Khyber Pass--
JENSEN
I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
CLAY
We find it, we paint it for a laser
targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.
ROQUE
For that we had to put on a
blindfold and turn around three
times?
POOCH
You'd rather take on fifty mujas
with AK's?
He upshifts a gear as the Humvee drives on...
CUT TO:
P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS
A terrorist looking fellow talks with another. We are...
5.
Our guys, now in full on Black Ops Special Forces combat
desert fatigues, perched high above what looks like a RUN
DOWN AFGHAN PRISON. Roque with the field glasses:
ROQUE
I got eyes on Fadhil.
CLAY
Paint it.
Pooch fires up the LASER DESIGNATOR and aims it at the
compound. A high pitched whine as he does...
POOCH
Call me Michelangelo.
Cougar sights down the LASER SCOPE of his LONG RIFLE.
Just taking in the scenery. Jensen, into a field radio:
JENSEN
Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed
eyes on, target is designated.
A DESERT HAWK ROARS THROUGH THE SKY, enroute to target.
RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
(FILTERED)
Roger, target acquired, exfil
chopper is enroute. ETA to
fireworks is eight minutes.
JENSEN
Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.
(to the others)
So who wants to get a game? We
got eight minutes-
And then, for the first time COUGAR SPEAKS. With concern:
COUGAR
Boss?
Clay immediately looks THROUGH HIS SCOPE --
6.
A GROUP OF CHILD-SLAVES on the ground BY THE PRISON,
being led off a truck. The others look too. Reacting:
CLAY
Call it in.
JENSEN
(INTO RADIO)
Dropkick, children are at target
site, repeat, we have eyes on
children at target site - advise.
RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
Hold the line...
STATIC. Seconds tick by...
RADIO VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Acknowledged, maintain position.
ROQUE
Maintain position? Colonel-
JENSEN
(INTO RADIO)
Dropkick, we strongly recommend
cancellation of payload delivery-
RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
Abort order can only come from
MISSION CONTROLLER-
Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen:
CLAY
Mission Controller is Agency,
Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max,
so get him on the horn and-
RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
Already have, Pinball, your orders
stand. Prep for exfil.
STATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay.
CLAY
Cougar?
Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER
DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio:
7.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting
equipment has suffered system
failure, am calling an abort.
STATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE:
MAX (O.S.)
Well, that was stupid.
The voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned.
CLAY
Who is this? This is a secure
MILITARY NETWORK--
MAX (O.S.)
Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin...
Clay.
Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms.
CLAY
Max? There are children on site-
MAX (O.S.)
And you think I didn't know that?
Not the sharpest of knives in the
drawer, are you? We locked
coordinates the moment you painted;
delivery will occur on schedule.
Max out.
STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a
SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen:
CLAY
Shit! Jensen, call the General at
the Firebase, get him to abort-
JENSEN
Can't, they're jamming us-
ROQUE
Then contact the plane directly-
JENSEN
(trying all channels)
Negative, we're screwed!
(LOOKING UP)
There's nothing we can do...
8.
His face, stricken. They all are. And then:
CLAY
There's something we can do.
Clay hefts his rifle.
The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking
their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them:
ROQUE
Five against a fortress, and we've
got maybe six minutes before an
airstrike sets the world on fire.
CLAY
So?
ROQUE
So, I'll drive.
CUT TO:
WHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS
through the GATE!
POOCH
I guess we're going with the fifty
mujas with AK's option after all!
A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are.
Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --
takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center
of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork
with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out:
CLAY
Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for
the kids, the rest of us will be
out in five-
ROQUE
(CHECKING WATCH)
-airstrike's in four and change-
CLAY
-out in four. On me!
9.
Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and
Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST
fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT.
Clay and Cougar BURST from the fort, FIRING and RUNNING
FULL TILT towards the commandeered TRUCK LOADED WITH KIDS.
As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas:
POOCH
Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
As he RUNS OVER two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the
gate. The sound of a JET APPROACHING. Roque to Jensen:
ROQUE
What kind of blast radius we looking
at?
Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an
animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:
ROQUE (CONT'D)
DRIVE. MUCH. FASTER.
The Fort and the retreating Truck below us mere specks as
the DESERT HAWK SWOOPS IN and RELEASES ITS PAYLOAD...
A moment of silence as it falls... and then STRIKES below,
an orange FIREBALL BALLOONING OUTWARDS...
12.
Ripping across the dunes, FIREBALL EXPANDING behind them...
JENSEN
I think we're in the clear-
As the fireball ENGULFS THEM.
Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the
Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the
YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out:
JENSEN
Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?
My favorite part was when we were
completely on fire. What was yours?
Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING...
POOCH
Exfil incoming. How are we gonna
explain the kids, Colonel?
Clay doesn't seem to hear him.
POOCH (CONT'D)
Colonel?
(Clay looks up)
The kids. What do we tell 'em?
13.
A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK
sets down. Walking up to the chopper:
CLAY
Lieutenant, you're to evac these
civvies to the Firebase immediately-
BLACKHAWK PILOT
Negative, our orders are to
transport a five-man team only.
Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER
CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer:
CLAY
You really want to leave twenty
three kids in the desert to die?
A beat.
BLACKHAWK PILOT
Not enough room for them and you...
CLAY
Then it's them.
The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on...
JENSEN
Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows
perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.
OMAR
Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and
the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.
Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last
Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR...
POOCH
Cute little buggers. Hope they
can make it to our court-martial.
14.
ROQUE
Relax, Pooch, we're not going to
be court-martialed - if anything,
we're going to die of thirst
wandering the desert, right Colonel?
CLAY
(IGNORES THIS)
Jensen, see if you can cut into
that Blackhawk's chatter--I want
to know if he rats us out.
As Jensen tunes his radio...
POOCH
So, how we getting back? Hitchhike?
Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...
ROQUE
(NOTICING)
Guess they hustled up some air
support after all - that's a
Pakistani MiG up there...
Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous.
JENSEN
Guys... This is bad...
TURNS UP THE VOLUME:
MIG PILOT (O.S.)
Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked,
twelve o'clock low...
Their eyes go wide with understanding....
MAX (O.S.)
Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit.
Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the
receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN
BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK....
MIG PILOT (O.S.)
(CALMLY)
Fox One.
WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP!
The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper
spinning and falling but still intact...
15.
Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING:
POOCH
Auto-rotate, go with it, you can
still put her down if you-
FROM THE RADIO:
MAX (O.S.)
And again.
CLAY
NO!
MIG PILOT (O.S.)
...Fox Two.
The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK
proper. Burning, spinning... FALLING. Clay and Cougar,
screaming by the time they reach the wreck...
OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to
dive into the flames, but COUGAR DRAGS HIM BACK. No use,
anyway...
Nothing's alive inside.
SLAM TO:
WIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES!
Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar
being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins.
AS WE SLOWLY FADE TO...
A rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED
COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES
watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's
wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes.
INTERCUT WITH...
As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE
lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO:
BLACK SCREEN. OVER IT IN SMALL LETTERS:
THE LOSERS
FADE UP:
A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole
nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of
a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes.
Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW.
19.
She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse
of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's
bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down.
In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH.
Indulging in a nightly ritual...
Mexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and
masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them.
COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little
faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above...
Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged
between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits.
Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT...
Clay and Roque wolf Big Macs in a 1988 Chevy Crew Cab.
FAMILIES eat outside. KIDS play like hamsters in tubes.
21.
CLAY
We'll stay two more days, try to
get some of the cash back.
ROQUE
Then what?
CLAY
Miami. Jai-Alai.
Various PEOPLE walk to and from their cars. Clay and
Roque shield their faces from them instinctually.
ROQUE
I can't take much more of this.
CLAY
We're on the run. It occasionally
INVOLVES RUNNING-
ROQUE
I'm serious. Grinding out lunch
money on five dollar sports bets,
wincing everytime some overly Aqua-
netted cow stares at my face for
more than two seconds-
(DELICATELY)
I'm at the point where I'm thinking
we ought to try to reach out to
the Company...
CLAY
All we did was say the word "Max"
and they blew up a building. CIA
even gets a whiff of where we're
at, they'll call in an airstrike.
(shakes his head)
Until we figure out how we can
take Max down and get clear, we
lay low.
A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's.
Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot...
ROQUE
Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel
anymore.
CLAY
Anytime you want to move along you
go right ahead-
22.
ROQUE
Like the others? Least I still
talk to them. You pushed them
away. "Max this, Max that" - we
never even saw the guy, Clay-
CLAY
We heard his voice. Guy with a
voice is a guy with a throat. And
if he's got a throat...
ROQUE
(IN DISBELIEF)
We're hiding out in the parking
lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You
actually think we're in any position
to take on some shadowy CIA super-
spook?
CLAY
ROQUE-
ROQUE
No, it's a stellar plan - we can
use this as our base of ops!
(gestures to the
PLAYGROUND)
Pooch can run the motor pool out
of the ball pit and Jensen can set
up communications by the slide!
Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...
CLAY
Go.
Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still
between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:
ROQUE
I was there too. I remember. But
he won. We lost.
(PAUSE)
Maybe it's time for a new game.
23.
With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at
his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...
Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.
CLAY
How'd you find me?
AISHA
It's not too tough if you know
where to look. You guys aren't
exactly subtle.
A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
as if to illustrate her point.
CLAY
How'd you know I was alive?
AISHA
Counted the number of teeth found
in the safehouse debris in Karachi.
Not nearly enough for five men.
CLAY
Who else knows?
AISHA
That you're alive? Just me.
CLAY
So what's to stop me from putting
a bullet in your head?
AISHA
You want Max and I can tell you
how to get him.
CLAY
Max is up to something big, isn't
he? Agency wouldn't have sent you
otherwise.
She gives a little smile.
28.
AISHA
Nice try, but I'm working alone
here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't
need your help. Ready for the
important part?
Clay nods.
AISHA (CONT'D)
There is a plane.
CLAY
Okay.
AISHA
This plane contains a truck.
CLAY
Okay.
AISHA
This truck contains a cargo.
CLAY
Right.
AISHA
This cargo is very important.
CLAY
Is this a riddle?
AISHA
(FORCED SMILE)
This cargo belongs to Max. You
steal the cargo, Max comes looking
for it, you grab Max.
CLAY
What a brilliant plan, and oh, so
simple too. What's the cargo?
Aisha just smiles.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Right. So you want me to steal
some super secret cargo known only
to you and the bad guy, and I'm
supposed to do this because you
know the name Max and look good in
a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.
29.
He turns. Begins walking away. She calls out after him.
AISHA
Hey!
(he turns back)
You really think I look good in
these jeans?
CLAY
Bye...
AISHA
Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to
fund his off the books ops. And
it comes straight from the poppy
fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.
(knowing full well)
Oh... does that name mean something
to you?
A beat as Clay stares at her, realizing...
AISHA (CONT'D)
He used you to kill Fadhil and
take over his operation, that's
right. What did you think you
were doing there in the first place?
Fighting for truth and justice?
Clay stares at her.
CLAY
How do I know I can trust you?
AISHA
Check my background. I'm an ex-
Company hitter. First job was a
junior field officer in Shanghai.
You can Google it under Shanghai
Hilton Decapitation.
CLAY
I mostly Google porn. Then?
AISHA
Two Chinese and an Italian arms
dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.
CLAY
Show-off. Then?
30.
AISHA
Then I stopped auditioning for
you. This is a check for ten grand-
He holds up his hand.
CLAY
We're not mercenaries.
AISHA
Operational capital, that's all.
(holding out the check)
You've been waiting three years
for a shot at this guy. You're
not gonna get another. You want
Max, this is it.
He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.
AISHA (CONT'D)
Intel on the shipment. You check
it out, you check me out, you decide -
are you in or not?
CUT TO:
COUGAR chilling by a small fire. Working his way through
a bottle of tequila. His blackberry rings...
The city midday is UTTERLY PACKED. Overflowing. The
capital of the next great Superpower. Delhi, India.
31.
New Orleans. A non-descript warehouse among many.
ROQUE (O.S.)
So this is what your girl came up
with, huh?
34.
A White Bell AB-139 CHOPPER glides into frame -- FLYING
over a small series of white sanded jungle islands...
MAX (V.O.)
It used to be so simple. A post
9/11 world...
39.
LOOKING UP FROM ONE ISLAND:
HOWLER MONKEYS taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles
over the beautiful deserted island. Outer Fijian Islands.
MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As a country we spoke with one
voice, moved with one purpose. We
had a wicked boner for doing the
right thing, and now look at us!
A US ARMY HUMVEE tears PAST CAMERA, just missing a couple
of freaked out jack rabbits blast-hopping for their lives.
On perimeter patrol at 80MPH down an endless desert road...
RADIO TRANSMISSION (V.O.)
Base One, this is Cavalier 415.
Sector eight perimeter clear,
proceeding to sector nine...
A Kenworth Heavy pulled off to the side. Pooch works on
the front right tire. Sweating buckets in the desert
bake. The Humvee approaches. TWO SOLDIERS get out.
42.
SOLDIER 1
Need a hand, buddy?
Pooch looks up from his tire.
POOCH
Appreciate it.
Fifty feet off the road. A brown blanket slowly rising...
REVEAL the long black barrel of a SNIPER RIFLE.
SCOPE POV -- Colors and graphics we've never seen before.
Cougar's got his own thing going on. More Jerry Garcia
than Tom Clancy. Soldier One's THROAT is smack dab in
the middle of it. CLOSE ON COUGAR'S TRIGGER FINGER:
Slight squeeze. Silenced weapon...
Soldier One slaps at the burning sting in his neck.
SOLDIER 1
AAOW! Something just bit me!
He pulls a two inch TRANQ-DART off his neck.
SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
(staring at the dart)
Is this...?
The three other soldiers see the dart and LEAP out when...
FROM BEHIND THE TRUCK -- ROQUE rises ARMS OUT. Wedged in
each hand -- TWIN JET BLACK .45 CALIBER COLT STUN PISTOLS.
BLASTING AWAY... The soldiers stagger, twist and stumble
before succumbing to the Demerol. LIGHTS OUT.
Clay waves the chopper in. It lands on the road. TWO
EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers. The
first EMT kneels by Jensen.
EMT
Alright buddy, we're gonna get you
patched up in no time...
JENSEN
Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been
gut shot...
EMT
Sure, in Iraq. What a mess...
Jensen pulls his COLT, presses it up into the EMT's GUT.
JENSEN
Means you know what's coming to
you if try to play hero. Now,
lose the radio mic, Bones.
THE CHOPPER, now UNDER A TARP on the back of the truck
trailer. The TRANSPONDER, strapped to a SMALL ROCKET...
JENSEN
We're all set here. Ready to take
a giant step for... well, for
guys who steal stuff, I guess.
CLAY
Hit it.
Jensen FIRES THE ROCKET. The transponder takes off...
JENSEN
Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.
FROM THE CHOPPER'S RADIO:
BASE ONE (O.S.)
Medevac Delta, this is Base One.
What's your situation, over?
Pooch gets up behind the wheel.
POOCH
Time to move.
The team gets into the big double cab. Pooch fires up
the engine and the heave rig tears out onto the highway...
AFTER THEY'RE GONE -- On one of the drugged soldiers.
Trying to sit up. He looks around. WIDE: Seven soldiers
out cold on the side of the road... Alone.
47.
DRUGGED SOLDIER
...Well, shit.
SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between
buildings, past the islands slamming into
A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-
LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.
A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,
surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine
guns, frag grenades, body armor.
BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends,
talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman.
FENNEL
As of this moment, the truck is
designated an extraterritorial
zone of immunity. Under no
circumstances whatsoever are you
or your men to allow the package
to leave the truck before it's
secure in the compound - to do so
would be considered an act of
treason and punishable as such.
LIDDY
Understood and acknowledged, sir.
As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...
WADE
Ten men ride with the package and
another ten ride chase.
Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van.
WADE (CONT'D)
Let's go.
The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private
airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR...
51.
A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's
ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the
lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.
HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding
into frame, buckle-harnessed and very armed --
COUGAR
TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE
SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL
RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --
CLAY (O.S.)
Take em'.
Cougar FIRES --
And everything begins happening very fast.
52.
The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown
clear off the axle mount --
The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --
Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,
and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING
SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...
THE CHASE VAN
Screeches to a hard stop behind. SECURITY CREW OUT --
WEAPONS RAISED -- taking up DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. Ice
cold professionals.
WADE
Form a defensive perimeter around
the truck!
FENNEL
They're out of their minds, there's
no way off this bridge...
Now at the entrance to the bridge. Roque smiles as he
hefts an MGL-40 GRENADE LAUNCHER. FIRING...
BY THE CONVOY
THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across
traffic. SECURITY MEN CHOKE, lost in the SMOKE...
WADE
Masks on! Secure the package!
SWAT GUY
Where are they? I can't see them-
53.
COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-
glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel
DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:
FENNEL
Code RED! We are under attack!
Need Chopper Support right now!
ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --
CIVILIANS running and screaming -- TOTAL PANDEMONIUM --
CONTROL (V.O.)
Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!
As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying
to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...
DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...
The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!
It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...
Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear
DOORS --
WADE
Cavalry's here!
The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the
precious CARGO CRATE towards the Chinook's boarding ramp --
WADE (CONT'D)
Move! Point cover! Go, go!
SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle
the crate into the Chinook's WINDOWLESS HOLD. The ramp
RISING as Fennel dives onboard as well...
BY THE CONVOY
Wade makes a "take off" sign to the Chinook pilot who
flips him a salute as THE CHINOOK LIFTS INTO THE AIR...
The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...
54.
Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.
Twisting in the wind.
As we hear the rotors fade into the distance...
Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase
van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:
CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)
This is Chopper Support--we are
inbound your position, ETA five
minutes! Hang in there!
As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face
and he stares up into the sky...
The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and
crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque.
THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...
55.
Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER
HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE
RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:
AISHA
Open the valve.
TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open...
The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a
bit. Then:
CLAY
I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
ROQUE
And do what - go after this non-
existent hard drive?
CLAY
We find out if it exists. If it
does, we steal it and trade it for
immunity.
Roque stares at him.
ROQUE
That's your plan?
CLAY
You got a better one?
(MORE)
64.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Max gives us back our lives or we
upload the data to the net, show
the American people what's being
done in their names.
ROQUE
Why risk our lives again when we
already have something to trade?
He gestures to the WARHEAD. Clay, shocked.
CLAY
You want to give it back to him?
ROQUE
I want to at least discuss it before
signing up for another suicide
mission on the say-so of some flunky-
CLAY
It's not happening.
Roque blinks at Clay's abruptness. Pissed.
ROQUE
So you want to take down Goliath
now? Then who? McDonald's?
American Airlines? Microsoft?
CLAY
You don't want Max to pay?
ROQUE
I want my life back! This is
supposed to be us getting clear -
not saving the world!
POOCH
ROQUE-
ROQUE
We're not the goddamn good guys
anymore! I love you guys, but I
had a life before this shit, and I
sure as hell am not going to risk
getting it back because you came
down with a case of the Dudley
Damn Do-Rights!
65.
CLAY
Don't raise your voice at me-
ROQUE
I will raise whatever the hell I
want - you got a death wish because
you got beat by a voice on a radio-
WHAP! Clay throws a STRAIGHT RIGHT to Roque's jaw! Roque,
surprised and staggered by the blow... Then he SMILES
through the blood, DRAWING A KNIFE:
ROQUE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna cut your head off...
This got serious quick. Pooch steps between them.
A really dangerous beat...
Clay and Roque, full on eyefucking one another...
On Aisha - she seems to be DIGGING IT... Broken by:
POOCH
I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?
JENSEN
Goliath. Cougs?
Cougar nods.
CLAY
Aisha?
ROQUE
She doesn't get a vote-
AISHA
(staring at Roque)
Goliath.
Silence. Roque, ODD MAN OUT. His fingers tighten around
the handle of the knife...
POOCH
(SOFTLY)
Put it away...
A long beat... and Roque slides the knife back into it's
SCABBARD. Clay, staring at him:
66.
CLAY
You want your life back, you're
gonna have to steal it. We hit
them in two days.
He stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction.
JENSEN
Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad
fight?
Cougar grunts in response.
POOCH
So what do we do about the nuke?
(PAUSE)
Did I just actually say that?
On Aisha. A smile forming...
AISHA
I have an idea...
The street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with
camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find
FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD.
A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America!
in big cheery letters and has a SMILEY FACE on it...
MATCH WITH:
67.
Wade drives in a Jeep, heading back to the city.
WADE
He wants one billion in cash.
INTERCUT WITH MAX in the SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR:
70.
MAX
That's a lot of a paper routes...
WADE
Can we swing it?
MAX
Not even close.
WADE
The Company?
MAX
Won't give it to us willingly...
(THINKING)
You get that six man team together
like I asked?
WADE
Yeah.
MAX
Change of plans. Kill them.
WADE
Kill them?
MAX
Or fire them, whichever's easier.
WADE
Honestly? Firing them.
MAX
Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.
What I need- wait. Did you give
them intel on Clay's people?
WADE
Well, yeah.
MAX
Aaaand we're back to killing them.
WADE
(ANNOYED)
Fine, I'll kill them - what are we
doing instead?
71.
MAX
Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are
you related to them?
WADE
Actually, one of them, yes.
MAX
By blood?
WADE
(he's had it)
A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill
him, what are we doing?
MAX
It's not what we're doing, it's
what Clay is going to do for us...
WADE
And that is?
MAX
(GRINNING)
Get us our billion dollars...
CUT TO:
Clay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city.
AISHA
So, what really happened to you in
Afghanistan?
Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...
And shakes his head.
CLAY
(SOFTLY)
That's not for you.
She traces her fingers over it...
CLAY (CONT'D)
Why do you want Max dead?
Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.
AISHA
He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
CLAY
No.
A beat. She looks at him.
AISHA
When you tell me about Afghanistan?
I'll tell you about Max.
CLAY
Fine. It's hot. There's lots of
sand. Your turn.
Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.
AISHA
Why were you alone when I found
you?
That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.
CLAY
The guys got sick of it.
AISHA
Sick of what?
73.
CLAY
Of hearing about Max. Of hearing
me say we had to do something when
there wasn't anything to do. They
wanted to be around their families.
Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a
wife and daughters.
AISHA
And he hasn't told them he is alive?
CLAY
Would you? The people you loved
the most, would you put them in
that kind of danger?
Aisha, side-stepping the question:
AISHA
So Roque has no one.
CLAY
He's got me.
AISHA
And you have...
CLAY
Enough hate to get us both through
the day. He stuck with me when no
one else would. And I ain't the
easiest guy to stick with.
Aisha studies him.
AISHA
If you two really fought, he would
kill you, I think.
CLAY
You think.
AISHA
I'm almost sure of it.
CLAY
Why?
74.
AISHA
Because you care what happens to
the others. You wouldn't put them
at risk to save yourself.
CLAY
And you think that's a weakness.
AISHA
I know it is. Law of the jungle.
CLAY
We're not in the jungle.
She looks at him.
AISHA
Oh, yes we are...
Henderson plods into his elevator. As the DOORS CLOSE on
his elevator, the DOORS OPEN on the SECOND ELEVATOR.
JENSEN, suited and pressed, steps out. Briefcase in hand.
...smack into COUGAR who points into the sky -- TWO HEAVILY
ARMED COBRAS, searchlights on, headed for the motel. And
again with that one important word:
COUGAR
Run.
The FIRST COBRA OPENS UP with it's AUTOMATIC CANNON. The
BULLETS CHEWING UP the far side of the CHEAP TWO STORY
MOTEL! Our guys VAULT the railing, sprinting to the van...
Coming in for LANDING...
ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN
HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile
from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.
THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS:
GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing
for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a
bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb
sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.
CLAY
You ready?
A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks
back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have
something on his mind.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Roque?
97.
ROQUE
I'm ready.
Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat
towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY
LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...
A block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van.
Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration.
POOCH
The Pooch is good.
CLAY (O.S.)
Cougar, squelch if you're in
position.
A drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it.
We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage
it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe --
through a second opening -- down another long pipe and
SLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal.
Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards.
COUGAR
Squelch.
Clay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending
in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards.
CLAY
Jensen, we're coming. You ready?
98.
Clay and Roque approach. Knock. From the inside, Jensen
leaning up against the door.
JENSEN
What's the password?
ROQUE (O.S.)
Open the door before we kill you.
Jensen opens the door. Clay and Roque quickly move in.
JENSEN
Drive should be in the Computer
Room, two skylights over.
CLAY
Roque and I will set the charges
here but we won't detonate until
you have the drive.
ROQUE
You can't settle for stealing the
drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's
shit too.
CLAY
What can I say, I hold a grudge.
(TO JENSEN)
Get gone.
Jensen nods. Knows how important his job is. Heading
for a ladder. Clay and Roque begin to set CHARGES
throughout the room...
CLAY (CONT'D)
Be ready to move the second Cougar
hits the fire alarm...
99.
Cougar avoiding security. SCALING A LARGE OIL TANK, taking
up a sniper position on top of it...
ACROSS THE TERMINAL
Jensen hopping rooftop to rooftop...
BACK TO
Cougar in full sniper fire position. His sights dead on:
A MASTER FIRE ALARM -- 300 yards down. His RADIO CRACKLES:
POOCH (O.S.)
Guys, we got a problem...
Pooch in the van, seeing through BINOCULARS...
POOCH
Wade's here.
And he is. Being given a TOUR by PAR-SEC GUARDS...
Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down
into the room). Attaching a HARNESS to his waist...
JENSEN
I'm above the computer room, maybe
thirty seconds from the drive...
Jensen, finally ready to hit the computer room, GENUFLECTS
once for luck...
Jensen, leaping through the SKYLIGHT... SMASHING DOWN
through the GLASS...
101.
Cougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire
alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his
temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands
behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT...
PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:
They've lost.
CLAY
(answering the question)
Roque.
Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
Gone.
The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.
LEAD GUARD
On your knees.
Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in
BOTH LEGS!
Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
POOCH
Get on with it...
105.
The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...
LEAD GUARD
That's a nice hat.
He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
Levelling the rifle at his head...
LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)
Don't really care of there's a
hole in it. One wash, good as...
(NOTICING)
What are you smiling at?
Cougar's nods past him...
As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...
AISHA
As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...
And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as
THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.
JENSEN
Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
106.
WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:
JENSEN (CONT'D)
Can you stand?
POOCH
I've been shot in both legs, what
kind of dumbass question is that?
JENSEN
Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
not the only one who's been shot
recently, you know!
He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...
AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when
A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's
CLAY. They stare at each other...
Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.
AISHA
Did you kill my father?
Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
JENSEN
Clay?
CLAY
Kind of in the middle of something
here, Jensen-
AISHA
Did you kill him?
JENSEN
There was no drive, Clay-
107.
CLAY
(eyes on Aisha)
I KNOW-
JENSEN
There was no drive and Roque's
gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
Pooch could bleed out-
Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:
AISHA
Did you kill him?
Clay, about to respond when:
COUGAR (O.S.)
I did.
They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.
COUGAR (CONT'D)
He asked us. It was mercy. But
you're his family, so I understand.
And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.
SURRENDERING...
COUGAR (CONT'D)
But only me.
Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...
A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...
In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.
The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!
Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.
AISHA
Wear it. Remember him.
108.
Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.
JENSEN
Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
need to go.
As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
hightail it back to where Pooch lies.
CLAY
Can you stand?
POOCH
This is stupid question day, isn't
it? It's stupid question day and
someone forgot to tell me...
Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
PUSH IN on Clay's face for:
CLAY
Let's go.
And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...
They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the
wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...
Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as
Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading
the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.
WADE
Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should
we be worried?
ROQUE
Clay doesn't take risks. It's why
I'm here and he's not.
WADE
You're sure?
Roque nods.
WADE (CONT'D)
Can I ask you something? Why'd
you stick with those losers for so
long?
Roque considers. Then:
ROQUE
They were good guys.
Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.
WADE
No such thing. I'll go call Max.
He begins walking towards HANGAR...
CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS
by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:
110.
CLAY
Hi, Wade!
BY THE PLANE
Roque turns to the Pilot:
ROQUE
Declan, start the plane...
BY THE HANGAR
WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front
tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally
coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:
POOCH
Next time, remind me - car crash
first, then get shot...
JENSEN
Sounds less painful that way...
Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to
Taxi. ROQUE stands in they back - loading ramp still
down. FLIPS CLAY A SALUTE...
CLAY
Cougar and I are going after that
plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
JENSEN
Me and legless Pooch are on it!
(RE: AISHA)
Where the hell is she going?
Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar
run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel
and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
POOCH
You call me legless Pooch again,
you're gonna be Headless Jensen.
JENSEN
What, it's a cool name! It makes
you sound like a pirate!
(off his look)
Fine, let's go kill Wade...
ON THE RUNWAY
111.
Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING
TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at
ROQUE
Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The
PILOT, yelling to him.
PILOT
We don't have enough runway to
take off - we're going to have to
turn around and come back to get
up to speed!
ROQUE
Fine, just get us in the air!
He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
ROQUE (CONT'D)
I'm out!
IN THE CORVETTE -- SIMULTANEOUSLY, Clay, WEAPON DRY.
CLAY
I'm out.
He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Get me closer...
The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
ROQUE
Gotta admit, I always wondered how
this would play out.
CLAY
Aisha thinks you kill me.
ROQUE
It's a distinct possibility...
They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.
ROQUE (CONT'D)
You don't have a knife?
CLAY
Don't need one.
ROQUE
Bit of as longshot for you...
CLAY
(SMILING)
No. It's not.
Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
113.
ROQUE
Now I really am gonna cut your
head off...
He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
Which seems to make Clay happy.
So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
EAGLE levelled at Clay.
CLAY
SHIT-
The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
THE CORVETTE
Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
Clay from rolling off the hood...
114.
THE PLANE
TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
final run to get up to speed...
THE CORVETTE
Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
CLAY (CONT'D)
Rifle...
Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...
VISUALIZE THIS --
AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
THE CORVETTE
PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
causing the bike to
CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
...as Roque dies very badly.
WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
115.
ON THE GROUND
Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
at the sight before him. Only one word for it.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Outstanding.
Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.
JENSEN
Not to rain on everyone's we killed
all the bad guys parade, but we
should probably get gone - legless
Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up
for us in the Hangar.
(off Pooch's look)
It's a cool name-
From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:
CLAY
Hello?
A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window
Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
Opens it and looks out to see...
Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
Her breath hitches in her chest.
A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
knows what it means.
Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
Someday.
