ACT ONE

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

CLOSE ON -- A Molotov cocktail SPINNING mid-air in slow 
motion... Almost beautiful the way it lights the night sky... 
Until it CRASHES into a POLICE VAN... EXPLODING in a ball of 
fire...   

An Illinois field becomes a BATTLEGROUND.  Reeking of manure 
and burnt gunpowder.      

A line of NATIONAL GUARDSMEN stand in riot gear.  Weapons 
readied.  Freezing.  Panting.  Marinating in blood and sweat.  
But holding their ground.   

Through a CLOUD OF TEAR GAS -- A wave of CREATURES stampede 
towards them.  They are men, yet not men.  These are the 
Orions.  Otherworldly.  Scattering in every direction.    

The LEAD GUARDSMAN gives his men a nod and a HAILSTORM OF 
BULLETS STRIKE THE ORIONS.  We track one ORION, who is hit in 
the forehead.  He falls hard with a sickening THUD.  Eyes 
wide open.  Staring right at us.  And as blood drips down his 
face we see ONE SMALL BLACK DOT UNDER EACH OF HIS EYES.  And 
STRANGE MARKS, like tattoos, around his NECK and FACE... 

The guardsmen work to quickly reload their weapons -- But 
 too late for them.  As the Orions continue to charge, it s
COLLIDING with the guardsmen, CRUSHING them in the charge... 

But the Orions are soon met by a greater foe -- TANKER 
TRUCKS.  DELIVERING ROUND AFTER ROUND OF FIRE -- One by one 
the Orions begin to drop -- OUTMATCHED...

WHEN ACROSS THE FIELD -- we zero in on TWO WIDE EYES, peeking 
out from behind a tree.  This is ROMAN (6).  An Orion.  But 
an innocent.  A lost puppy.  He spots a clearing and rushes 
across the field and into the night air... as we CUT TO:   

INT. WHITEHILL HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A NEWS ANCHOR on television.  Behind him, the image of a 
POLICE CAR ON FIRE.

A frightened MICHELLE WHITEHILL (30s) sits watching the news 
from the sofa, nervously fidgeting with a GOLD CROSS around 
her neck.  Her husband RAY WHITEHILL (30s) stands vigilant at 
the window, peering outside.  

MICHELLE

Michelle shakes her head.  Can t believe this is happening...

MICHELLE
So we just sit here and wait for 
them to come for us? 

RAY

they mean any harm...   

EMERY (O.S.)
Wait for who to come for us?

Ray and Michelle turn to find EMERY (6) peeking around the 
corner.  Precocious.  A light in her eyes.  Ray quickly mutes 
the television.  Michelle puts on a fake smile.

MICHELLE
Nothing, baby.  Everything s fine.  
Time for bed.    

RAY

Emery nods.  She may be six, but she s still smart enough to 
know when something is being hidden from her...

INT. WHITEHILL HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Emery enters the kitchen, where she takes a few PILLS from a 
pill box labeled Tuesday, washing them down with water.  A 
familiar routine.  On the news in the next room, an 
EYEWITNESS is interviewed --

Emery looks outside the kitchen window at a SHED in the 
backyard.  Sees the door ajar, FLAPPING in the wind.

EXT. WHITEHILL HOME - NIGHT

A curious Emery exits the house, walking with a flashlight...

INT. SHED - NIGHT

She slowly opens the door.  Scans the dark shed with her 
flashlight... Did something just move?  She scans again... 

EMERY
Hello?

She walks further inside... There, huddled in the corner of 
the shed, she finds ROMAN.  Shivering.  Scared.  His clothes 
dirty.  He looks up at her.  Startling how human he seems.  
Emery, spotting the tell-tale dots under his eyes...    

EMERY (CONT D)

Roman just stares back at her, his teeth chattering... 

EMERY (CONT D)

Emery sees her dad in the hallway pulling a GUN out of a 
safe.  She backs away, the image frightens her.  Ray doesn t 
notice as Emery sneaks past him, grabbing a blanket...

INT. SHED - NIGHT

Emery wraps the blanket around Roman.  

EMERY
You don t look like a monster.

He offers her a grateful smile...

EMERY (CONT D)

Roman watches as she leaves...  As WE TIME CUT TO:

INT. SHED - MORNING

Roman lying asleep under the warm blanket.  Emery tiptoes 
inside, leaving a bowl of LEFTOVER SPAGHETTI beside him.  
While inside the house, dire TV NEWS reportage continues:

TV NEWS (O.S.)
... the public is asked to remain 
watchful and vigilant...

After Emery tiptoes out, he opens his eyes.  Sees the 
spaghetti.  He takes a tentative bite of one strand.  His 
eyes open wide -- intrigued... The texture and taste so 
foreign to him.  Later that night --

INT. SHED - NIGHT

Emery and Roman sit cross-legged on the floor of the shed 
underneath a MAKESHIFT FORT made out of DROP CLOTHS.  Roman 
watches as Emery expertly demonstrates making a STRING FIGURE 
out of yarn with her hands.

EMERY

Roman watches, positively entranced...

EMERY (CONT D)
Here.  You try.

Emery lifts Roman s hands, transferring the string figure to 
him.  Their warm touch connecting them... The moment 
interrupted by the sound of --  

DOGS BARKING.  Emery stands, looks out the window.  Sees TWO 
POLICE OFFICERS WITH DOGS on a sweep of the neighborhood, 
heading towards the shed.  

OFFICER 1 (O.S.)

warning, the cops BARGE into the shed.  Roman instinctively 
grabs Emery, pulling her behind him, protecting her.  The 
cops mistake this as a threat --

The officer brandishes his weapon -- A TREMOR GUN.  Points it 
directly at Roman.  But a frightened Roman does not budge...

 PEWWW -- A GOLF BALL-SIZED LASER SHOOTS from the officer s
gun, hitting Roman directly in the abdomen.  He falls 
forward.  CONVULSING violently.  Emery watches in horror --

EMERY

MICHELLE  (O.S.)
Emery!

Ray and Michelle burst in.  Ray grabs Emery and carries her 
back into the house as she desperately tries to fight free.  
She watches from over her dad s shoulder as the officers lift 
Roman s seemingly lifeless body, carrying him to their van.   

EMERY
My friend!  They killed my friend!

 SCREAMS ECHO IN THE NIGHT, we pan up to see what AS EMERY S
has been hovering above us this entire time...

SIX SPACESHIPS.  A fleet of large, oval, alien crafts.  

AS WE SMASH CUT TO:

NIKE RUNNING SHOES, pounding the concrete.  As ON-SCREEN 
appear the words:  10LATER.  YEARS 

EXT. STREET - MORNING

This is SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD EMERY.  Out for a morning jog.  Ear-
buds in, pushing herself HARD.  Like she s being chased.  As 
she PASSES through a peaceful suburban neighborhood we hear: 

REPORTER (V.O.)
The Orion Sector was constructed 
outside of Chicago not long after 
the Invasion.  No Orions were 
permitted outside its walls without 
authorization and they were forced 
to obey a mandatory curfew...

We INTERCUT the following scenes of TV NEWS FOOTAGE with 
Emery on her run...

EXT. WEST CRAVEN HOSPITAL - DAY

Finally, Emery comes to a stop outside a building -- WEST 
CRAVEN HOSPITAL.  She works to catch her breath before 
entering the sliding glass doors... 

INT. UNIVERSITY BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

A SOCIOLOGIST (50s) sits at a desk with his hands folded.  
Poised.  Academic.  He speaks to the off-screen reporter.

 ROOM - DAYINT. HOSPITAL - JULIA S

A hospital room.  JULIA (16) sits perched on her bed, 
surprisingly vibrant for a girl who has made this place her 
home.  Stacks of magazines and books about the Orions sit on 
her bedside table.  She is watching the news report on TV 
when Emery enters, still catching her breath -- 

JULIA
Only you can pull off sweaty sexy at  
7 AM.

Emery pours herself a glass of water from a pitcher on the 
table.  Downs it.  Once she finishes -- 

EMERY

For us both.  

And Emery takes Julia s hands.  Julia acquiesces, stretching 
her legs out in front of her on the bed.  Emery gently pulls 
Julia forward, stretching her muscles, as a CRAZED WOMAN on 
the NEWS PROGRAM is interviewed --

JULIA
Gotta love the conspiracy theorists.  
One of them was claiming the Orions 
grow a medicinal herb inside the 
Sector called cyper.  

EMERY
Can it cure conspiracy theorists?

JULIA
Just saying.  Maybe you could get 
chummy with one of the Orions.  Get 
a batch.  Fix up everyone in this 
hospital... 

Emery loosens her grip and Julia sits back, taking a breath.   

EMERY
You look tired.  Did you sleep? 

JULIA
My new roommate snores.

EMERY
So did your old roommate.

JULIA
Yeah, but at least I could always 
just pelt her with M&Ms from across 
the room to shut her up. 

EMERY
Thanks for that, by the way. 

Emery smiles... Beat... Then:

JULIA

INT. WHITEHILL HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

RAY and MICHELLE (now 40s) watching the NEWS -- Images of 
MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, road blocks, protests and 
helicopters... They trade a look of concern.  As upstairs --  

 BEDROOM - DAYINT. WHITEHILL HOME - EMERY S

Emery opens her closet, clad in a towel, and surveys the 
options:  An important decision.  She pulls out a purple top 
and snatches a pair of boots, next to which sit an OXYGEN 
TANK decorated with stickers.  A remnant from another life.  
Soon after...

INT. WHITEHILL HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Emery rushes down the stairs.  Michelle is a nervous wreck.  

MICHELLE

That shirt looks nice.  Maybe you 
want a sweater, too?  I packed you a 
lunch.  My chicken salad with an 
apple.  Do you have all your

Emery exits her house.  Takes a deep breath as she closes the 
door behind her.  In the driveway, Emery s best friend LUKAS

cute.  Perpetually in a hoodie.  Minutes later --

WE CUT INSIDE THE BUS TO FIND --

INT. MILITARY BUS - DAY

NINE TEENAGERS sitting in rows -- These are the ORION NINE.  
They look like normal kids, except for a dot under both eyes 
and marks on their face and neck.  One of the Nine, DRAKE 
(16), a macho Orion, eyes a GUARD with an MP5 standing at the 
front of the bus, keeping watch.  Drake leans forward to 
whisper to another MALE ORION sitting in front of him.   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        12.

REPORTERS fight for space on the front lawn, some speak in 
Russian, Italian, German...  DEENA STILES (35), a fame-
seeking reporter, speaks to PRINCIPAL SAUL WESTON (38).  
Strong, but uncomfortable with the media spotlight.

DEENA STILES
Principal Weston, I see in addition 
to your own security, ORC has called 
in armed military guards. 

As we hear the RUMBLING of more MILITARY VEHICLES coming 
around the corner.  Saul, displeased by the overabundance of 
security, tries to smile through his frustration...

SAUL
Safety is key.  But I will not let 
 it interfere with the students 
education.  Our academic record--

And Saul is suddenly cut off by an angry PROTESTOR, who jumps 
in front of the camera, waving a black flag decorated with a 
RED HAWK -- the symbol of the anti-Orion movement.     

PROTESTOR

The ROAR OF THE CROWD begins to rise as GUARDS struggle to 
hold the protestors back.  One HECKLER breaks through and 
tries to JUMP in front of the bus, forcing it to SLAM on the 
breaks.  Guards TACKLE the heckler as he desperately fights 
to break free... As he is carried away, the back door

One by one, the Orion Nine file out of the bus.  Stone-faced 
and silent, they do not acknowledge the protestors.  

Roman makes his way towards the entrance to school, followed 
by his sweet, younger sister SOPHIA (15).  He eyes the

Curious, he strains to peer through the protestors in order 
to catch a better view... But can only catch QUICK POPS of

INT. MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

The Orions stand in line at a SECURITY CHECKPOINT just inside 
 entrance.  ARMED SECURITY GUARDS wand each of the school s
them down and scan their BAR-CODED WRISTBANDS.

Lukas and Emery stand nearby at a row of lockers.  Emery eyes 
Roman standing in line.  Though she does not recognize him, 
she finds herself inexplicably drawn to him... 

TAYLOR (O.S.)
Rumor is they have three penises.  

Emery snaps out of it.  Finds a grinning Taylor before her.  

TAYLOR (CONT D)
Small, medium and extra large. 

Taylor and Rochelle LAUGH, continuing past Emery.

LUKAS
That s Taylor and Rochelle.  They re 
in charge.

EMERY
In charge of what?

LUKAS
All of it.

Emery watches as Taylor and Rochelle are immediately swarmed 
by a gaggle of STUDENTS.  She then turns back to the Orions.

EMERY
Have you ever heard about an herb 
the Orions supposedly grow inside 
the Sector?  Something called cyper? 

LUKAS
No.  But I did hear they eat skunks.

EMERY
Why would they do that?

LUKAS
Cheaper than raccoon.

Emery looks at him.  Lukas smiles.  Emery watches as the 
Orions are shuffled off down the hall and disappear into a 
room...   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        17.

attention...  Until --

towards the Orions, narrowly missing them before CRASH-

INT. MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL - GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY

Sophia enters the empty bathroom.  Finds a DISCARDED MASCARA 
WAND sitting on the sink.  Eyes it curiously.  She hears the 
door to the bathroom OPEN, GIRLS LAUGHING.  

Sophia quickly ducks into a stall, closing the door behind 
her.  She peeks through the sliver in the door at TWO GIRLS.

GIRL 1

GIRL 2
Yep.  And now her parents are 
letting her sit the school year out.  
They think the Orions will try to 
eat the baby or something.

Sophia watches as the girls apply lip gloss and eyeliner.  
She eyes them.  Fascinated by this transformation... As the

The cafeteria, boisterous at lunch time.  STUDENTS file up 
and down rows of tables, surrounded by HIGH-TECH VENDING

humans.  

Drake stands at one of the vending machines.  A SCREEN offers 
him three choices: Low-Fat?  Vegetarian?  Orion?  He presses 
  An AUTOMATED VOICE speaks --the button for  Orion. 

AUTOMATED VOICE

Maybe.  Whatever it is, it s worked 
for me before... 

When their attention is drawn ACROSS THE ROOM, where Eric has 
DUMPED THE BOOKS of one of the Orion Nine (CALEB, 16).  But 
before it gets heated, a TEACHER intervenes.

EMERY (CONT D)
Why does Eric hate them so much?

They watch as the teacher scolds Eric, who merely laughs and 
walks away, leaving Caleb to collect his books and papers...

TAYLOR
His father used to have this totally 
sweet restaurant, a neighborhood 
place.  But it was over in 
Bunkhead... 

EMERY
Where they put the Sector...

TAYLOR
Yep.  And people started moving 
away, on-the-quick.  After that, 
 father did a lot of staying Eric s
at home and drinking his breakfast,

Emery nods... She looks genuinely moved.  Taylor studies her 
for a beat... Then:

We see this surprising information register on Roman s face. 

ROMAN

painting or the scrap-booking?

EMERY
The scrap-booking.  Which some 
people find creepy.  But it s 
helpful when you want to organize

He looks at her.  Gets it.  Nods.  But Emery now notices 
their conversation has gained attention from her classmates.

EMERY
Jules, this is stupid, there has to 
be something else --

Julia shakes her head... Emery fights back her emotions.  
Then, her wheels begin to turn...   

EMERY (CONT D)
Will they let you out for an hour?

JULIA
Probably.  Why?  Where are we going?    

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Lukas pulls up in his car in front of the hospital, where 
Emery and Julia wait.  He rolls down his window.

LUKAS
Ladies.  Your chauffeur has arrived.  

As Emery and Julia trade a look...

EXT. ORION SECTOR - NIGHT 

The Sector looks dark and foreboding.  A walled sprawl of 
silence and ruin...

LUKAS

Lukas pulls up to a SERVICE ENTRANCE near the back of camp.  
 face presses up against the glass, full of wonder.  Julia s  oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        34.

Julia kisses him on the cheek.  And his world suddenly seems 
a little brighter.  As Emery and Julia walk to the gate... 

JULIA

EMERY
 not.  But I had to tell Lukas He s
something...

JULIA
Em, this is crazy.

EMERY
Crazy would be not taking this 
chance...  

Emery produces her FATHER S ID CARD.  As the girls approach a 
GATE, the full weight of this bold and potentially dangerous 
move now hits Emery.  She turns to Julia. 

EMERY (CONT D)
You sure you know what this herb 
looks like?  

Julia nods.  Emery inserts her father s ID card and the gate 
swings open.  MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS fill the DAMP, EMPTY 
MAINTENANCE TUNNEL before them.  As the girls take a 
tentative step inside, the GATE SLAMS SHUT BEHIND THEM, and 
we SMASH CUT TO BLACK --

ACT FOUR

EXT. ORION SECTOR - STREET - NIGHT

FLOOD LIGHTS illuminate dirt streets.  Lined with rows of 
SHIPPING CONTAINER BUILDINGS.  SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are 
 not quite the Warsaw Ghetto, perched on every corner.  It s
but far from a cushy gated community...  

WALKING CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE STREET -- Emery and Julia are on 
high alert... Startled by every MOVEMENT and SOUND...

TWO ORION CHILDREN -- a BOY and a GIRL -- race past them on 
bicycles rebuilt from salvaged parts... 

LAUGHTER turns their heads sharply -- An ORION WOMAN with 
sexy curves chatting up a GUARD at the bottom of a stairwell. 
Emery and Julia keep their heads bowed as they walk quickly 
to avoid the guard, who clearly has other things on his mind.  
They turn a corner, hurrying along to another part of camp... 

EXT. ORION SECTOR - MARKET DISTRICT - NIGHT

A crowded market.  Rows of makeshift booths -- clothing, 
 an of glimpse a catches Emery  tchotchkes. food,  human 
ORION handling smuggled electronics - laptops, cell phones...

Emery walks with Julia through the maze of tables.  A few 
ORIONS eye them suspiciously.  Emery is clearly nervous, but 
s enthralled.  Then -- notice:  She Julia doesn t

ELDERLY ORION (O.S.)

Emery and Julia turn to find an ELDERLY ORION WOMAN offering 
jewelry.  They clock her sharp 4-inch FINGERNAILS.  The 
Elderly Orion eyes the girls, surprised to discover they are 
human.  She strains to convey...

ELDERLY ORION (CONT D)
Bracelets?

EMERYJULIA
No, thanks.  I ll take three!

But as Julia reaches into her pocket and pulls out CASH, a 
CROWD OF CURIOUS ORIONS flock to the girls, eager to make a 
sale.  A SHIFTY ORION (20s) at the lead --

SHIFTY ORION

Emery and Julia trade a look.  Julia goes for it --    

JULIA
Do you have any cyper?

The Shifty Orion eyes them.  Finally shrugs, a sale s a sale:

SHIFTY ORION
Right this way...

The Shifty Orion leads the girls to another booth, but the 
Elderly Orion steps in, threatens --

ELDERLY ORION
Ghaj en klor!     

The Elderly Orion CLAWS at him.  He retaliates, SHOVING her 
 table.  The COMMOTION has invited back into a GRUFF ORION S
attention from other ORIONS, who now surround the group --

When a BLARING SIREN is heard, the Gruff Orion calls out --

GRUFF ORION 
REVSOLO!

ORIONS SCATTER in every direction and the girls know what 
this means -- The guards are coming!

Now panicked and full of dread, Emery and Julia attempt to 
make their way out of this chaos, as as HAND grabs Emery  -- 
Roman, pushing his way through the crowd --   

ROMAN
C mon!

As Emery and Julia RACE away from the market --

EXT. ORION SECTOR - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

A ROOFTOP DOOR opens and Roman, Emery and Julia rush outside 
into a ROOFTOP GARDEN.

Emery considers this... When -- 

BANG -- GUARDS BURST onto the roof of the building DIRECTLY 
across the street.  The three DUCK -- Julia staying low on 
one side of the roof, Emery and Roman on the other...

Emery eyes Roman... Now closer in their hiding spot... She 
begins to put the pieces together... Especially when a guilty 
look sweeps over his face.  Keeping her voice low:

 wall.  He is past the point of no other side of the camp s
return, resigned to his decision.  As the PULSING BEAT OF 
ELECTRONIC MUSIC takes us to --   

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A TWO-STORY ABANDONED FARMHOUSE in the middle of a field.  No 
other homes or lights for miles.  

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Wireless speakers POUND.  GRAFFITI lines the walls.  The 
 ELITE fill the crowded dance floor...  SCHOOL S

ACROSS THE ROOM -- Lukas bobs his head to the beat, clearly 
out of his element, but trying to fake it.  He waves to Emery 
from across the room, relieved to see a familiar face.  

She waves back, looking a bit nervous, as Grayson hands her a 
drink.  She notices he wears a SILVER RING on his thumb.

EMERY
Cool ring. 

GRAYSON
  He got it when It was my brother s.
he became an officer.

EMERY
Is he still in the force?

GRAYSON
No.  He, uhh, was killed in action.  
During the Invasion...

glum guy with the dead brother.  The

Grayson smiles.  Emery loosens up a bit, now seeing this

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

A buzzed Emery LAUGHS with Grayson.  They sit close on a 
discarded mattress, scrunched up against a wall.  

Taylor nods to Emery from across the room.  A look of 
approval and acceptance.  Emery smiles, nods back.  For once 
 somewhere... When an feeling like she might actually  fit 
out-of-breath PARTYGOER bursts into the room --

PARTYGOER
You guys gotta see this...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

 CRONIES has been STRIPPED DOWN and TIED to a One of Eric s
scarecrow pole, his BRIEFS stuffed inside his mouth, his eyes 
wide with fear.  Eric and the stunned partygoers file out.

ERIC
Who did this?

When DRAKE and a few of the other ORIONS step out of the 
cornfields.  GASPS.  WHISPERS.  A few KIDS just turn and run.  

DRAKE
We just want to have a talk with 
Eric. 

Eric steps up to Drake.  Unafraid.  The two boys stare each 
other down.  Close.  Very close.   

ERIC
This ends tonight.

DRAKE
For once we agree.   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        52.


Suddenly DRAKE HEAD BUTTS ERIC -- sending him FLYING 
BACKWARDS. As Drake hovers over Eric, prepared to pounce, TWO 
ARMS WRAP AROUND DRAKE FROM BEHIND -- 

As Roman YANKS him back and away -- 

DRAKE (CONT D)
What are you doing here, Roman?  

ROMAN

you for breaking curfew?  

The humans are watching them argue... Roman spots Emery... 
Sees Grayson take her arm... 

But then - in the distance we hear POLICE SIRENS -- SHIT. 

TAYLOR

COPS!

And it s a SUDDEN MAD SCRAMBLE -- PARTYGOERS bolting in every 
direction.  In the melee, Emery gets KNOCKED over.  Almost 
trampled.  When a HAND reaches out for her... It s Roman.  

EMERY

Grayson finds Emery...

GRAYSON

 C mon!

Emery follows Grayson to his Jeep.  Roman hesitates, but 
decides not to follow her... 

As Grayson, Emery, Eric and Taylor climb in... Emery can see 
Roman, eyeing the SCRAMBLING TEENS as they bail.  He is the 
only one left, as everyone else has jumped into cars and 
peeled off.  Roman scans the field -- Which way should he go?

Emery calls out, waving him over --

TAYLOR
Are you nuts?
(yells)
Hurry up, Rochelle!

Rochelle rushes up to the Jeep, climbing in the back.

EMERY
But do you know what the cops will 
do to him? 

ERIC
His problem.  Not ours.   

An appalled Emery looks to Grayson -- but he knows he s been 
overruled...

Emery considers her options - Should she choose the safety 
and comfort of her new friends?  Or be bold and stand up for 
what she believes is right?  The SIRENS are getting closer...

 about to take off, she makes her choice, And as they re
JUMPING OUT OF THE BACK OF THE JEEP -- 

GRAYSON
Emery!  What are you doing?

But Emery is racing for Roman... Eric shouts to Grayson:

ERIC

GRAYSON

ERIC

Taylor and Rochelle share a stunned look as the Jeep peels 
away and Emery runs up to Roman...

ROMAN

And she takes his hand.  And leads him into the TALL

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Emery and Roman RUSH through the cornfield, breathless...

EMERY
We should be fine here. 

They slow down.  Roman eyes Emery as she catches her breath.

ROMAN

committed social suicide?  Sure.
