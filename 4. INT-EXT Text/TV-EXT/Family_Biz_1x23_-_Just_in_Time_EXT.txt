      CAITLIN and DAKOTA TOYOTA sit on the table.  Eli runs up.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Eli, you're late. 

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA

                                      CAITLIN
                    Who's late to chill?

                                    ELI
                    I'm sorry guys I'll make it up to
                    you.
                          (beat, realization)
                    Time check?

      Eli checks his watch... but it's not on his wrist.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Forgot my...

      Eli grabs Caitlin's wrist to check her watch.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Oh no.  I'm late for my date with -

      TRACY DUPONT-ROYMONT (16, every boy's fevered dream) sips a
      smoothie.  Eli runs up...

                                    ELI
                    Trace!  I am so, so sorry...

      REVEAL CODY FLOWERS (the school's badboy) at Trace's table.

                                    ELI
                    Oh man, Cody.  How could you cut in
                    on me like this?

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    Cut in?  No way.  I'd never do that
                    to you.  Without your permission.
                          (smiles to Trace)

                    Eli, you stood me up.  Not acceptable.

                                    ELI
                    But I'm not late.  We said smoothies
                    at four thirty.  And it's only...

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Eli dressed as an Astronaut waits at the boss stop with Dakota
      Toyota. 

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Hey Space Dude.  What's up?

                                    ELI
                    I think I missed the shuttle bus to
                    the space shuttle.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    And the best class trip ever.  The
                    Moons of Mars.  Martian Princesses
                    make me smiiiiiile.

                                    ELI
                            (Shatner-esque)
                      Noooooooo!

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      And Dave pushes Eli right to... Caitlin and Dakota.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Eli, you're on time!

                                    ELI
                    Victory!  Thanks, Dad.

      Beat.  A bit winded, Dave hangs, happy.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Dad?

                                    DAVE
                    Oh right.  Right.  Don't mind me.

      Dave drifts a few steps away.  And hides behind a tree.

                                      CAITLIN
                    What's the deal with your dad?

                                    ELI
                    He's lonely.  Working at home he
                    kinda misses the human interaction.

                                    DAVE
                          (overheard that)
                    That's true. 
                          (pops out from behind
                          the tree)
                    But, really, I'm here for Eli. 
                    Keeping him on track.

      Dave retreats behind the tree.

                                    ELI
                          (whispers)
                    He just needs to feel useful.

                                    DAVE
                    Also true.  We all do.  All of us. 
                    Everyone.

      And he goes back behind the tree.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                          (really whispers)
                    He's got ears like a bat.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             14.

                                    DAVE
                          (behind tree)
                    Thank you.

                                      CAITLIN
                          (flirty)
                    So Mr. Eli Keller... I was thinking  
                    we could check out the new comics
                    when they come in tomorrow.

                                    ELI
                    Yeah I'm totally down.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Dude, a moment. 
                          (to Caitlin)
                    A little guy talk... I mean guy talk.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Manly grunts.  Got it.

      Dakota Toyota pulls Eli aside, KNOCKS on his noggin.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Dude.  Tomorrow?  After school? 
                      Cheerleader tryouts? 

                                    ELI
                    Oh, right.  Don't sweat it.  With my
                    Dad on my case, I'll be there.

      From across the yard, Dave calls over...

                                    DAVE
                    And where are these cheerleaders
                    going to be? 

      Caitlin shoots Eli a disgusted look.

      Eli shoots a "don't kill me" smile back at Caitlin.

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    It's got to be in the schedule.

                                    ELI
                    Dad, I'll get back to you on that.

                                    DAVE
                    We have to mark it down. Along with
                    all your other appointments. 
                          (note in schedule)
                    What are these cheerleaders going to
                    look like?      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             15.

      Caitlin simmers.  OFF Eli's sheepish smiles --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Just to establish where we are.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


        Eli-The-Astronaut floats in the nothingness, one very long
      bungee is his life line.  We hear the gentle HOOPER HOOPER
      of his breathing. [Prod note: green screen and actor action].

                                    ELI
                    Where am I?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Dave and Eli join Dakota on the slope overlooking the field. 

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Just in time.

      On the field, COACH HAGGIS leads the cheerleader tryouts. 
      Instead of pompoms, the girls practice with cabbages.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    Come on, ladies.  Let's get going!

      As the girls pump their cabbages -

                                      COACH HAGGIS (CONT'D)
                    Build that upper body cheering
                    strength.  Give me a "C"...

                                      GIRLS (O.S.)
                    C...

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    They're going to start throwing the
                    cabbages soon.

      Avalon limps onto the field.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    You're late, Keller.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             24.

                                      AVALON
                    Sorry.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    And you're out.

                                      AVALON
                    What?

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    No room for slackers on my squad. 
                    This is all about dedication.  Hard
                    work.  And timeliness.  My squad is
                    timely.
                          (to cheerleaders)
                    And peppy!  Pep!  Pep!  Pep!

      ON ELI, DAVE AND DAKOTA.

                                    ELI
                    Avalon was late. And for cheerleading. 
                    Never thought I'd see that!

      Avalon limps back to Eli.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    So, Av, maybe women can't juggle as
                    much as men. 

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                          (watching cheerleaders)
                    But they can sure show school spirit.

                                      AVALON
                    It's all your fault.  You made me
                    late!  Both of you.  You mowed me
                    down in the hall.  You... hall mowers.

                                    DAVE
                            (remorseful)
                    Maybe, Chicken, this is for the best. 
                    You really think that cheerleading
                    is the right fit for you?

                                      AVALON
                    Yes, I know it's extremely perky but
                    it is fun!  And very important in
                    certain high school social circles.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                          (watching cheerleaders)
                    They are...soooooo peppy.

                                    DAVE
                    Let's go.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             25.

                                    ELI
                    But it's just getting good.

      Dave pulls Eli away.

      HOLD ON AVALON AND DAKOTA.

                                      AVALON
                    You know what I'm thinking...

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    How do they jump so high?  With so
                    much grace?

                                      AVALON
                    No... how do I seek revenge?  With
                    your help.  Where is Eli heading...? 
                    Dakota?  Where is he going...?

      Dakota skitters away from her, a little scared.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Caitlin waits for Eli by the back door.  Eli and Dave run
      up.

                    Parking meter.

      Too late.  They get tangled around a parking meter.

                                    ELI
                    Ow, ow, ow.

                                    DAVE
                      Clockwise.  You go clockwise.  I'll
                    go counterclockwise.

      Eli looks for his watch.  He still does not have it on.

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    That way.

      While they are still entangled...

                                    ELI
                    Hi Caitlin.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Some really cool titles came in. 
                    Let's check them out.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             26.

                                    DAVE
                    No time.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Excuse me.

                                    DAVE
                    According to the sched you don't
                    have the time to go in and browse. 
                          (hands Caitlin a twenty)
                    Caitlin, could you buy some comics
                    for my son. Oooh and the latest issue
                    of Stratosblast for me. 

                                    ELI
                    What fun is that?

      Dave takes Eli aside.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli.  Focus.  What's your goal?

                                    ELI
                          (quietly)
                    Trace.  You're right.  Stay here.

      Dave holds onto the parking meter.

                                    DAVE
                    I'm ready.  Go.

      Eli stretches the bungee cord to the breaking point to Caitlin
      for privacy.

                                    ELI
                    I'll make this up to you.

                                      CAITLIN
                    You better.

      And... SPROING...

      Eli bounces back, right into Dave's arms.

                                    DAVE
                    Let's go, go, go.

      Dave and Eli rush off.  Re-entangled in the parking meter. 
      Disentangle themselves again.  Rush off again...

      OFF Caitlin's frustration -

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             27.


      CLOSE ON RONNIE as she waits for her pick-up.

      Her eyes widen.

                                    DAVE & ELI (O.S.)
                    Nyaaaaah!

      And they swoop her up and keep on going.

                                      RONNIE
                    Best.  Ride.  Ever.

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:


      Eli and Dave run up...carrying Ronnie.  Dave is winded. 
      They see -

      TRACE AT HER TABLE.

      BACK ON ELI AND DAVE -

      Eli grabs Dave's wrist.  Checks his watch.

                                    ELI
                    Just in time.

      Eli considers himself: sweaty, disheveled and tied to Dad.

      Trace spots them.

                                      TRACE
                    Eli, over here.  Hi Mr. Keller.

                                    DAVE
                    Hey Trace.

                                    ELI
                    Okay Dad.  We did it.  We arrived. 
                    I didn't miss anything.  You can go.

                                    DAVE
                    Right.  Going...
                          (tries to unhook)
                    The bungees are all twisty.

      They are stuck.  Eli struggles with the harness.

                                    ELI
                    Why is this so tight?      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             28.

                                    DAVE
                    Safety.  Go with it.  We'll work
                    this out.

                                    ELI
                          (to Trace, trying for
                            smooth)
                    Hey there.

                                      TRACE
                    Hey, Eli.  Crazy day?

                                    ELI
                    Had some business to take care of...

                                      TRACE
                    With your Dad...?  What's with the
                    bungee?  Separation anxiety?  And
                    your sister?

      ON RONNIE AND DAVE -

      As Dave strains backwards against the pull of the bungee.

                                      RONNIE
                    I'm hungry.  It is snack time.

                                    DAVE
                    Didn't you eat your lunch?

                                      RONNIE
                    Yes and now it's snack time.

      BACK TO TRACE AND ELI.

                                    ELI
                    This is one of those funny stories.

      Eli tries to sit.  He yanks Dave forward to get enough slack.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    I know I'm laughing.  On the inside.

                                    DAVE
                    Excuse me.  Do you mind if I have
                    some water?

                                    ELI
                    Yes... I do....

                                    DAVE
                    Running over here... whoa.  Too many
                    hours behind the desk. 
                          (pounds his tummy)
                    I have got to get back in shape.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             29.

                                    ELI
                    And back to your attic. 

                                      TRACE
                    Eli, be nice.  When our parents get
                    older, we have to look out for them. 

      Trace hands him the water.

                                    DAVE
                    Thank you. 

                                      RONNIE
                    Still hungry.

      And Avalon saunters up.

                                      AVALON
                    Hey Trace.

                                    ELI
                    Wha --

                                      TRACE
                    Your entire family shows up on your
                    dates?  That is so... old world.

                                    ELI
                    Well, not my mom....

                                      TRACE
                    Too bad.  She's a lot of fun.

                                      AVALON
                    Maybe we got our signals crossed. 
                    In these busy times it's so easy to
                    get confused.

                                      RONNIE
                    Or hungry.

                                      AVALON
                    Let me check the schedule.

      Avalon grabs Eli's schedule and... as planned...

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    Look, an ice cream truck!

      While everyone looks off distracted, Avalon scribbles
      something onto Eli's schedule.

                                      RONNIE
                    There's no...      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             30.

                                      AVALON
                    Dad, have you looked at this?

                                    DAVE
                    I'm living it.

                                      AVALON
                    Look again.

      Dave extends to the end of the line.  He reads the schedule.

                                    DAVE
                    Oh.

      ON ELI -

      He leans back as the bungees get tauter.

                                    ELI
                    Ow, ow, ow.

      Suddenly, the bungee goes slack.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Finally.

      REVEAL DAVE -

      Right next to Eli.

                                    DAVE
                    Trace.  It's been lovely... but we
                    have to go.

                                    ELI
                    No we don't.

                                    DAVE
                    Yes.  We.  Do.

      Dave rushes off... SPROING... Eli gets yanked behind him.

                                    ELI
                    Cody!

      From nowhere, Cody Flowers appears.

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    I'm on it.

      He slides in next to Trace.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             31.

                                    CODY FLOWERS (CONT'D)
                    You see Eli and his dad are in
                    training for the World Championship...
                    freestyle bungee sprinting team.

                                      TRACE
                    Really?

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    Okay.  They're junior fire fighters. 
                    In smoke filled buildings firemen,
                    they bungee themselves together...
                          (off her look)
                    I have no clue.

                                                                                CUT TO:

      Eli swoops by grabbing a bag of comics.

                    Wow.  That's so...

      Eli pauses, grabs an errant cabbage, only to get jerked
      forward by Dave...

                    I thought I was like totally making
                    it up... but Eli tells me it's the
                    next big sport.

                    Let's do it.

      REVEAL that Dakota Toyota and Cody Flowers are tied to each
      other by bungees.
