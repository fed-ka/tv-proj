    EXT. CHICAGO -- NIGHT

    In the distance, the flickering city lights dazzle and tease.  
    The icy waves of Lake Michigan lap closer, closer.  Like you, 
    they want in.  Somewhere, an EL TRAIN SCREECHES around a 
    bend.  A TRUMPET WHINES.  THREE GUNSHOTS go BAM BAM BAM.  

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Chicago.  1963.

    CAMERA FLIES with A SHARP GUST OF WIND toward the city.  The 
    MAN S VOICE continues... swaggering, confident.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                The steaming, corrupt, crime-filled Windy 
                City may be all of those things, but 
                there s one place in the toddling town 
                where everything is perfect.

    FLY past this door and that door.  Is it here?  There?  THREE 
    SNARE DRUM RIMSHOTS go BAM BAM BAM.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Where life is magic.

    Around corners, through alleys, heading toward it.  FLASH-CUT 
    with COCKTAILS, HIGH-HEELS, SMOKE, and the LIPS on the BLONDE 
    BOMBSHELL singing a sexy, horny cover of  CHICAGO  --  

                                BLONDE BOMBSHELL (O.S.)
                Chicago, Chicago
                That toddlin  town...

    The song gets LOUDER, CLOSER.  WHIP up a sidewalk, CATCH UP 
    to a well-heeled pair of SHOES -- A MAN S -- as they walk, 
    coming from somewhere great and going somewhere better.  
    FLASH-CUT with BUNNY EARS, TAILS, and the FISHNET CALVES of a 
    BRUNETTE carrying a CIGARETTE TRAY.

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Where you can be anyone you want to be.

    His fingers light a cigarette, his last.  Throws away the 
    pack.  Steps over a subway grate.  Arrives at 163 E. Walton 
    Street.  The Gold Coast District.  Pulls a SINGLE KEY from 
    his Pierre Cardin jacket -- gold, with a certain logo -- 
    hands it to a beautifully-manicured hand that belongs to:

                                DOOR BUNNY
                Good evening, Mr. Dalton.                                                                                      2.


    THE DOOR BUNNY at the entrance to the Playboy Club.  The 
    ears.  The tail.  The satin.  The breasts.  Pretty, friendly, 
    even chews her gum perfectly.  She checks the number on the 
    back of his key, writes it on her clipboard, hands it back.

    He s NICK DALTON (35, a man, a jaw, confident, sharp, genial 
    yet private, the ultimate playboy).  He pockets his key.

                                NICK
                How are you tonight, Kate?

                                DOOR BUNNY
                I m good.  I m always good.
                        (laughs, re her costume)
                A little cold.

                                NICK
                It s worth it.

    QUICK SHOTS: Nick steps in.  Checks his coat and hat with the 
    COAT CHECK BUNNY.  Takes three steps.  Is met by a TRAY, a 
    COCKTAIL and a Bunny whose face we don t yet see.

                                BUNNY (O.S.)
                  Extra-dry, extra-cold, rocks glass, no 
                rocks, three olives.

                                NICK
                I don t know, Brenda.  My mother always 
                told me no dessert before dinner.

                                BUNNY (O.S.)
                A little chocolate never hurts.

    REVEAL Bunny BRENDA (24, stunning, dry, Black).

                                BRENDA
                Just don t tell your mother.  

    Nick smiles.  He s friendly and familiar with all of these 
    Bunnies, but he s only sleeping with one of them...

                                BRENDA (CONT D)
                  Carol-Lynne s on upstairs.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- SAME

    Bunny CAROL-LYNNE (30, think Madonna in Dick Tracy) is the 
    blonde bombshell singing  CHICAGO  on the stage in the 
    glamorous, sparkling club, Moulin Rouge in the 60 s, which we 
    now see in the flesh.  Pun intended.  BUNNIES crisscross the 
    room with drinks for the mostly male crowd -- BUSINESSMEN, 
    POLITICIANS, JOURNALISTS, HUSBANDS AWAY FROM THEIR WIVES, 
    even a few HUSBANDS WITH THEIR WIVES.                                                                                      3.


    CLOSE ON: one new Bunny, that brunette we caught a glimpse 
    of, who isn t crisscrossing the room.  With a cigarette tray 
    in her arms and a determined glow in her eyes, MAUREEN (20, 
    Norma Jean before she was Marilyn, an untethered, unconscious 
    sexuality, eager, inquisitive) watches Carol-Lynne.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                On State Street, that great street
                I just want to say
                They do things that they don't do on 
                  Broadway, say...

                                WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                        (loud whisper)
                Maureen.  Maureen.

    Maureen snaps out of it, turns to see Bunny ALICE next to her 
    (27, a bit awkward, married, takes care of everyone but 
    herself, think Thora Birch.) 

                                MAUREEN
                Oh, hi, Alice.  It is Alice, isn t it?

                                ALICE
                Right.  Hey, so I don t mean to be in 
                your business, but you re gonna get in 
                big trouble if they catch you standing 
                around like this.

    Brenda saunters up, takes a cigarette from Maureen s tray.

                                MAUREEN
                I know, but I can t help it, Carol-Lynne 
                is so perfect and beautiful up there.  
                How come she gets to perform?

                                ALICE
                She was the very first Bunny, she can do 
                almost anything she wants.

                                BRENDA
                And she wouldn't want you on stage.

                                MAUREEN
                        (reacts)
                How do you know I want to be on stage?

                                BRENDA
                You didn t get those legs just from 
                walking, honey.  Plus your tray s almost 
                empty and it isn t even ten.  That means 
                you re selling something people want and 
                it sure as hell ain t cigarettes.                                                                                       4.


                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                Can I have this dance?

    Maureen turns to see a KEYHOLDER (50, handsome enough, tipsy) 
    who had the balls enough to ask.  She smiles, gives an  eek  
    look to Alice and Brenda, sets the tray down and goes with 
    the man onto the floor.  Brenda takes an impressed puff, 
    shares a look with Alice as they watch Maureen dance her 
    heart out with the Keyholder.  And wow, those legs.  

    The man tries to be a little grabby, but Maureen just swats 
    his arm away, laughs it off.  He reacts, but she just moves 
    to the NEXT GUY, and the NEXT.  She s a magnet, an effortless 
    force.  The ROOM S ATTENTION SHIFTS from Carol-Lynne on stage 
    to Maureen on the floor, and Carol-Lynne notices.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the 
                blues in Chicago...

    Carol-Lynne s POV: MORE MEN join on the floor, and new girl 
    Maureen dances with each, shining, a star. 

    Another POV: From the opposite end of the room, the entrance, 
    someone else watches Maureen.  REVEAL: Nick Dalton, who has 
    made his way up from downstairs.  He watches Maureen, 
    intrigued.  General Manager BILLY MORTON (35, all business, 
    ZBT president, young Albert Brooks) walks up, slaps him on 
    the shoulder, has become a friend over time.

                                BILLY
                Saw the afternoon Trib.  Nice work.  Who 
                knew a goy could be such a good lawyer?

                                NICK
                Is she new?

    Billy follows Nick s eyeline to Maureen on the dance floor.  
    Billy sighs, annoyed, starts toward her.

    Maureen spins and twirls on the floor until Billy gently 
    takes her elbow, pulls her off the floor.

                                BILLY
                I m glad you re having fun, Phyllis --

                                MAUREEN
                Oh, shoot, I m sorry.

                                BILLY
                Just get back to work, please?

                                MAUREEN
                Right.  Okay.                                                                                        5.


    Maureen grabs her cigarette tray, starts off.  Spins back, 
    taps Billy on the shoulder.  He turns.

                                MAUREEN (CONT D)
                It s Maureen.
                        (don t forget)
                Maureen.

    She smiles, goes.  Billy shakes his head.  Bunnies.  

                                MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Maureen.

    Maureen turns to see Nick, and his smile.

                                NICK
                Can t imagine how anyone would mistake 
                you for a Phyllis.  

    She smiles, blushes.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                I m Nick Dalton.  Lovely to meet you.

                                MAUREEN
                You, too, Mr. Dalton.  Can I get you --

                                NICK
                Reds.

                                MAUREEN
                        (looks)
                Reds, Reds.  Shoot, I m out of Reds.  
                I ll get more from the back if you don t 
                mind waiting a few minutes.

                                NICK
                I don t mind.

    Maureen goes, smiles to herself, he s gorgeous.  Nick watches 
    her walk off, but for no more than a beat.  Steps into the 
    light of the club.  Carol-Lynne sees him, smiles.  He winks 
    back.  The ultimate Playboy, the ultimate Bunny.  Nick drifts 
    toward the stage as Carol-Lynne s number comes to a close.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
                That's my home town...!

    Crowd APPLAUDS.  Nick helps her off the stage.  They kiss.

                                NICK
                You look great.                                                                                      6.


                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I ll look better in a few minutes.  I m 
                changing into black for the second set.

                                NICK
                My favorite.  With the diamonds?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                If that s what you want to call them.  
                Did you win the case?

                                NICK
                $20,000 for each of the victims.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                  Congratulations.  Where do I sign up to 
                be a victim?

                                NICK
                You couldn t be a victim if you tried.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I could be anything for real diamonds.  
                Be right back.  Grab table three.

                                NICK
                I m waiting for cigarettes.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Yeah, you and everybody else.

                                NICK
                        (reacts, confused)
                What do you mean?

    He s good.  Carol-Lynne walks off.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/SUPPLY ROOM -- NIGHT

    Reds, Luckys, lighters.  Maureen finishes restocking her tray 
    from a cabinet in a back supply room.  She straps it back 
    around her neck, closes the cabinet -- and JUMPS with fright.  
    Behind the door stands the grabby Keyholder who brought her 
    onto the dance floor, an awkward, scary smile on his face.  

                                  KEYHOLDER
                Hello.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Oh, life could be a dream (sh-boom) 
                If I could take you up in paradise up 
                above (sh-boom)                                                                                      7.


    In her exclusive black Bunny costume shimmering with 
       diamonds,  Carol-Lynne sings  SH-BOOM  with the band.  She 
    play-acts the words right to Nick, who sits at the bar, as if 
    she means them.  Maybe she does.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                If you would tell me I'm the only one 
                that you love (sh-boom)
                Life could be a dream, sweetheart...

    Nick smiles, trades his half-empty martini for a fresh one 
    from bartender MAX (27, model looks, model brain, but sweet, 
    think Channing Tatum).

                                NICK
                Thanks.  Seen the Cigarette Bunny?

                                MAX
                  Beautiful, isn t she? 

    Yes, but that s not what Nick meant.  He looks at his watch.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SUPPLY ROOM -- SAME

    Maureen is backed against the supply cabinet as the Keyholder 
    hovers too close.  Something off about him, entitled, scary.

                                  KEYHOLDER
                I just wanted to dance and you pushed me 
                away.

                                MAUREEN
                I m sorry, sir, but I need to get back --

                                  KEYHOLDER
                No, you don t.

    He steps closer, caresses her cheek with his oily fingers.  
    Her hands shake tensely around her cigarette tray.  He moves 
    his thumb over her bottom lip, laughs.

                                    KEYHOLDER/CAROL-LYNNE (O.S.)
                        (mimics along, horrific)
                If you do what I want you to 
                Baby, we'd be so fine...

    Maureen shakes her head  no.   He moves his hand down to her 
    breast.  Maureen flares, SHOVES him off with her cigarette 
    tray.  He flies back, but his grip holds fast on the tray, 
    pulling her with him.  He loses his balance, hits the floor, 
    and as Maureen tries to avoid falling over him, she 
    accidentally steps on his head with a POP.  Silence.  What 
    was that sound?  Maureen looks down.                                                                                        8.


    Her four-inch stiletto heel has driven right through the 
      Keyholder s ear into his skull.  BLOOD gushes everywhere.  
    She stares, horrified.

    Nick walks down a hallway with three doors at the end -- 
    GENTLEMEN, LADIES and heads right through EMPLOYEES ONLY.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/SUPPLY ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

    Nick walks through the web of offices and storage rooms in 
    back of the club, looking for Maureen.  Knows his way around.

                                NICK
                Maureen?

    Nothing.  He passes this office and that, this room and that, 
    until he sees, on the floor, a STREAM OF BLOOD.  He reacts.  
    His eyes follow the blood into the supply room, where the 
      Keyholder s body lies on the floor.  Nick freezes, stares.  
    He hears a WHIMPER from the room.  Takes a slow step in, 
    another.  Sees Maureen, shaking, standing against the supply 
    cabinet, in a state of shock. 

                                MAUREEN
                Did I kill him?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (O.S.)
                      Ya-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, SH-BOOM!


                                                                    SMASH TO TITLE:

                                          PLAYBOY

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SUPPLY ROOM -- RESUME

    Barely any sound.  A SERIES OF CLOSE, QUICK, ECU SHOTS:  
    Nick s eyes still on Maureen.  Sees she s only wearing one of 
    her high-heeled shoes.  Maureen looks down at her bloody 
    fishnets, trembling.  Nick looks at the body.  Sees Maureen s 
    other shoe in the Keyholder s mangled ear.  He steps closer, 
    to get a look at the Keyholder s face.  Reacts.  Takes a 
    quick, urgent step closer.  Holy shit.  He recognizes this 
    man.  Nick drops to the floor, checks for a pulse.  Nothing.  
    Jesus.  Nick s breath races.  Beat.

                                NICK
                Did you have a relationship with him?

                                MAUREEN
                  A relationship?  I ve never spoken two 
                words to him.                                                                                      9.


                                NICK
                I saw you dancing together.  

                                MAUREEN
                He just came up and pulled me on the 
                dance floor -- we didn t even talk until 
                he followed me back here -- 

                                NICK
                        (looks at her, intense)
                What did he say?

    Hot tears come to her eyes.  She can t repeat them.

                                MAUREEN
                Horrible things.  

                                NICK
                Did he tell you who he is?

                                MAUREEN
                No.  Can we call the cops now, please?

                                NICK
                No.

                                MAUREEN
                        (reacts)
                No?  What do you mean,  no? 

    Nick s eyes move around the room, putting a plan together.

                                NICK
                You killed the wrong guy.

                                MAUREEN
                What are you -- I don t understand --

    Nick quickly puts a finger to his lips, silencing her.  
    FOOTSTEPS nearby.  They walk further away.  Good.  Nick turns 
    back to her.  Taking control.  Knows what he s doing.

                                NICK
                I need you to focus and listen to me.  
                I m an attorney, and I m going to tell 
                you exactly what will happen if we call 
                the cops.  They ll show up and shut down 
                the club -- not just for tonight -- for 
                weeks, months, maybe forever.  Not just 
                because some guy got killed at the 
                Playboy Club, because Clyde Hill got 
                killed at the Playboy Club.                                                                                     10.


                                MAUREEN
                Who s Clyde --

                                NICK
                 Who s Clyde Hill?   That s what the cops 
                will ask, but it won t take them more 
                than a few days to figure out that Clyde 
                Hill was a key player with the Bianchis, 
                a major crime family.  No one will doubt 
                you were justified in killing him, 
                except, of course, the Bianchis.  You ll 
                get a bullet within forty-eight hours.

    A stunned silence.  Maureen can barely breathe.

                                MAUREEN
                Can we -- can t we just --

                                NICK
                Walk out of here like nothing happened?  
                No.  Three reasons.  One, the entire club 
                saw you dancing with him, two, there s 
                blood all over your fishnets, and three, 
                one of your shoes is in his ear, 
                  Cinderella.
                        (before she can talk)
                Now listen and do exactly as I say.  See 
                that carpet in the corner behind me?

    Maureen looks over his shoulder.  Sure enough, a giant rolled-
    up RED CARPET stands in the corner.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- RESTROOM HALLWAY -- SAME

    Billy pushes through the EMPLOYEES ONLY door to the back just 
    as Carol-Lynne walks out of the LADIES room.  He turns.

                                BILLY
                How many times -- you re supposed to use 
                the restroom in the dressing room.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                The lock s broken.  Which isn t the only 
                thing that needs fixing around here.

    They hold each others  stares.  An unspoken rivalry.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                I picked out the wallpaper for this 
                  restroom, Billy.  Long before you were 
                here telling me where to tinkle. 

    She walks off.  Billy pushes through the door to the back.                                                                                    11.


    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/BILLY S OFFICE -- SAME

    Down the back hallway, heart pounding, Nick checks to make 
    sure Billy s not at his desk in his office.  All clear.  He 
    goes in, grabs Billy s CAR KEYS from the desk drawer.  Goes 
    out, rounds a corner, just as Billy appears at the other end 
    of the hallway, walking toward his office.  Close call.

    EXT. UNION STOCK YARDS -- NIGHT

    Fifteen minutes south, the Chicago River barely moves behind 
    the stenchy Union Stock Yards.  Pitch black, empty, except 
    for the headlights of BILLY S BUICK.

    EXT. CHICAGO RIVER -- DOCK -- MINUTES LATER

    Nick, steady, and Maureen, not so steady, drag the rolled-up 
    carpet, which now holds Clyde s body, toward the water.  

                                NICK
                Almost there.

                                MAUREEN
                        (struggling, out of her mind)
                It smells.

                                NICK
                Cattle.  The stock yards are right there.

                                MAUREEN
                No, it s him.  We need rocks.

                                NICK
                          (impressed)
                How many bodies have you buried?

                                MAUREEN
                None.  I go to the movies every Saturday.  
                How many have you buried, mister  Don t 
                worry, I know a place ?

                                NICK
                Wait here.

    Nick starts back up the dock.

                                MAUREEN
                Wait here?!  What am I supposed to --

    Maureen catches herself screaming, looks around.  Be quiet.

    STOCK YARDS: Among heaps of old machinery, junk, Nick finds 
    an old rusty CATTLE HOOK.                                                                                    12.


    BACK TO THE DOCK: QUICK SHOTS: Nick checks Clyde s pockets, 
    pulls a WAD OF CASH, a LIGHTER and his PLAYBOY CLUB KEY.  
    Nick and Maureen tie the hook to the rug/body.  They roll 
    Clyde Hill into the water.  SPLASH.  The body sinks DOWN DOWN 
    DOWN.  Nick and Maureen stare at the water.  A silence.

                                MAUREEN (CONT D)
                For the rest of my life, I killed a man.

                                NICK
                You killed a bad man.

    Maureen looks over at Nick.  His stare is still on the water.

                                MAUREEN
                        (senses)
                You knew him well.  Didn t you?  That s 
                how you knew who he was right away. 

    Nick looks at her.  She s smart.  And beautiful enough to 
    make him stupid.

                                NICK
                Come on.  Let s get you cleaned up.

    As he leads her up the dock, Nick hands her Clyde s WAD OF 
    CASH. 

                                MAUREEN
                What?  No, I can t --

                                NICK
                It s the least he can do.

    EXT. NICK S HIGH-RISE -- CHICAGO -- NIGHT -- ESTABLISHING

    Gleaming glass-and-metal, Nick s 50-story building overlooks 
    the shimmering Chicago River.

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

    Nick leads Maureen into his apartment.  She s inward, still 
    in shock.  But then she s shocked again.  Looks around in 
    awe.   Apartment  is an understatement.  This is the most 
    stunning mid-century bachelor pad you ve ever seen.  Eames 
    when it was Eames.  A built-in bar.  A 40th floor view.  On 
    ONE WALL, dozens of FRAMED PHOTOS of Nick with politicians, 
      socialites, policemen, Hugh Hefner.  She turns to him.

                                MAUREEN
                Who are you?                                                                                    13.


    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BILLY S OFFICE -- NIGHT

    Billy, back at his desk.  PHONE RINGS.  Picks up.

                                BILLY (INTO PHONE)
                Billy Morton.

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- SAME (INTERCUT)

    Nick, on the phone, as he plunges Maureen s Bunny costume 
    into a vat of soapy water in the sink.  

                                NICK (INTO PHONE)
                It s Nick.  I m the one who has your car.

    Billy reacts, opens his drawer.  Keys gone.  Didn t know.  
    Nick heads down his apartment hallway toward his bedroom.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                It was a Bunny emergency.

                                BILLY
                        (very funny)
                How bad?

    Nick sneaks into the bathroom where Maureen takes a shower, 
    grabs her STILETTOS from the floor.  Watches her steamy 
    showering silhouette for a brief moment. 

                                NICK
                Well, she s very pretty, Billy, and I 
                just couldn t help myself.

                                BILLY
                Let me guess.  My new Cigarette Bunny.  
                   Maureen. 

    Nick pulls his eyes away, walks back toward his kitchen.

                                NICK
                That many customers complaining?  Very 
                sorry.  Don t tell Carol-Lynne.

                                BILLY
                        (jokes)
                But we tell each other everything.  

                                NICK
                I ll have your Bunny, your Buick and your 
                cab fare back in the morning.  

    Nick hangs up, uses a sponge to clean any remaining blood off 
    Maureen s stilettos.                                                                                      14.


    Billy shakes his head, amused, has to hand it to Nick.  Gets 
    up, needs a Bunny to sell cigarettes.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

    Bunny JANIE (23, life of the party, naughty, carefree, but 
    that hint of a Southern accent suggests she s running away 
    from something, a ditsy Amanda Seyfried) sets down drinks for 
    SIX YOUNG FLOOR TRADERS, thrilled to be here, near drooling.

                                YOUNG TRADER
                        (staring at her ass)
                I don t need a plate.  You can serve my 
                steak right on that.

                                JANIE
                        (smiles, plays along)
                And how would you like that cooked?

                                YOUNG TRADER
                Pink.

    The boys laugh, hard-ons raging.

    AT THE BAR -- SAME: Max watches Janie and her table of 
    traders, jealous.  Clearly a relationship here.

                                BILLY
                        (approaches)
                Hey, Max, when Janie s done over there 
                tell her to switch to Cigarette Bunny.

                                MAX
                I ll tell her right now.  These guys are 
                pissing me off --

                                BILLY
                Not now.  When she s done.

                                MAX
                Do you have any idea what it s like 
                watching your girlfriend get hit on by 
                every guy in the club, every night?

                                BILLY
                Yes, that s why I married her and got her 
                pregnant and ugly.

                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                Mr. Morton.

    Billy turns to see young mobster LEO BIANCHI (34, dark, 
    unpredictable, think Giovanni Ribisi).                                                                                    15.


                                BILLY
                        (you again)
                Mr. Bianchi.

                                LEO
                Stop by our table.  I ve got Gus with me 
                tonight.  He wants to meet you.

                                BILLY
                        (oy)
                Who s Gus?

    Max uses the diversion to head to Janie s table. 

    JANIE S TABLE -- SAME:

                                YOUNG TRADER #2
                There s no prices on my menu. 

                                JANIE
                Because everything s a buck-fifty.

    Janie leans over to set down #2 s drink.  Her cleavage could 
    pick up a salt shaker.  He stares.

                                YOUNG TRADER #2
                  Everything?

                                GUY S VOICE (O.S.)
                Watch it, fellas.

    All look up to see Max.

                                MAX
                This isn t a strip club.  She s not a

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

    Her Bunny costume soaks in the sink.  Maureen sits on Nick s 
    kitchen counter wearing one of his dress shirts, hair wet 
    from the shower.  Even like this, maybe especially like this, 
    she is devastatingly gorgeous.  Nick hands her a mug of tea.

                                MAUREEN
                Thank you.

    She holds the mug, just looks at the tea, thinking.                                                                                    16.

                I ve helped a lot of people.

    She looks at him. !He meets her eyes.  A sexual tension 
    rising, a closeness by virtue of what they ve done.  But 
    she s still not drinking the tea.

                                MAUREEN

                I used to work for the Bianchis.

    She reacts.  Looks at her tea.  Still hasn t taken a sip.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

    Leo Bianchi, with a table of FIVE OTHER BIANCHIS, including 
    GUS (50, a comfortable top dog).  Carol-Lynne finishes her 
    second set with the high-energy  BIG NOISE FROM WINNETKA. 

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I've been the Big Noise from Winnetka for 
                so long
                Time for a new noise to be born
                 Cause I had my fun and there is just one 
                Who's got me from the start
                Exit Big Noise for Winnetka
                Enter Big Noise in my heart...!

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BUNNY DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

    Lockers, makeup mirrors, garment racks.  Carol-Lynne enters, 
    done for the night.  Walks to the single bathroom, opens the 
    door, only to be confronted by Max s ass thrusting into Janie 
    against the wall.  They don t stop.

                                JANIE
                Sorry!  Sorry, Carol-Lynne!

                                MAX
                Come on in!

                                JANIE
                        (laughs)
                Max!

      Carol-Lynne rolls her eyes, closes the door, goes to her 
    locker to change.  Next to her is Alice, shift also over.  
    Out of her costume, you d never think Alice was a Bunny.  Not 
    ugly, just plain, modest, underwear a little too big.

                                ALICE
                We should get a new lock on that door.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                We should get a lot of new things.  Like 
                  a Cigarette Bunny.  Did you see that new 
                girl just set down her tray and start 
                dancing like she didn t have a job to do?                                                                                     19.


                                ALICE
                Oh, Maureen?  She s nice, she s new, I 
                don t think she meant to --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                During my show.

                        (beat, always the caretaker)
                If it makes you feel any better, she left 
                halfway through her shift.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                There s another thing.  Since when is it 
                okay to leave halfway through -- when did 
                she leave?

                                ALICE
                I think around eleven?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Right when Nick walked out during my set.

      Carol-Lynne is tough as nails, but that doesn t mean she s 
    not stung.  She slams her locker.  Alice tries to Band-Aid --

                                ALICE
                You don t know that they -- 

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Alice, please stop only seeing the good 
                in everybody.  It s taxing.

      Carol-Lynne stares at the air, thinking.  Alice feels bad.

                                ALICE
                I m sorry.  It s so hard to work here and 
                hold a steady relationship, isn t it?  My 
                husband hates that I work here, but I 
                just tell him the money s too good.  I 
                make more money than my father.

      Carol-Lynne comes out of her own thoughts, wheels turning.  
    Looks at Alice.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Don t give up that ring on your finger 
                for this.  You can t be a Bunny forever.

      Carol-Lynne grabs the rest of her things.  Alice looks down 
    at her hand, at her pretty, simple WEDDING RING.  The WHISTLE 
    OF A TEA KETTLE...                                                                                    20.

    Their eyes are locked on each other, on their secret.  She 
    takes a sip of the tea.  She trusts him.  He smiles.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK -- NIGHT

      Carol-Lynne passes Billy s office on her way out, sees him in 
    a meeting with the Bianchis.  Stops to watch curiously.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BILLY S OFFICE -- SAME

    Billy, at his desk.  Top dog Gus sits in a chair opposite, 
    old school, relaxed.  Leo stands in the corner, tossing a 
    glass SNOW GLOBE up and down in the air, up and down.

                                BILLY

                be any different.  It s not just my 
                policy, it s Hef s policy.  I m sorry.

    Gus pulls a box from his jacket, flicks open the lid, sets it 
    in front of Billy.  A DIAMOND-STUDDED GOLD WATCH.  

                                GUS
                Are you sure?

    Billy looks up at him.                                                                                    22.

                Think about it for a week.  If you say 
                 no deal,  no problem.  Just give back 
                the watch.  But you might want to find 
                out what it s worth.

    ANGLE: Carol-Lynne sees everything.  She shifts behind a rack 
    of Bunny costumes as -- 

    Gus stands, tips his hat, goes.  Leo threateningly sets the 
    snow globe back on Billy s desk, follows Gus out.  Billy 
    looks at the snow globe.  The snow swirls and falls around an 
    inset PHOTOGRAPH OF BILLY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO KIDS.

                I d always pretend and invent things, you 
                know?  I d make up fantasy worlds in all 
                the different orphanages.  I d sing and 
                dance for myself or anyone who d watch.  
                 I always wanted to be a big star more 
                than anything.  It s something precious.                                                                                     23.

                Marilyn Monroe said that.

                She was on the cover of the first issue 
                of Playboy.  I read the article.  Very 
                  carefully.

                        (laughs, then)
                Well.  I always told myself if she could 
                make it then so could I.

                You will.  But you ll live longer than 
                she did.

                As long as you never tell a single person 
                about this.  And you keep doing what I 
                say.  Like staying here tonight.
                        (off her look, a gentleman)
                In the guest room.

    The door to his apartment opens.  The CLICK-CLICK of high-
    heels, then she appears: Carol-Lynne.  Nick closes his eyes.  
    Shit.  Maureen looks to Nick, had no idea.  Carol-Lynne is 
    nothing but calm and collected, even smiles as she drops 
    Nick s DOOR KEY in his hand.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Doorman went on a potty break.

                No, don t let me interrupt, I m just here 
                to get my things.

                This isn t what you think.  Really.

                You don t know what I m thinking.  May I?

      Carol-Lynne continues into the apartment to get her things.  
    Maureen looks to Nick, unnerved.                                                                                      24.

                                NICK
                Don t move.

    Nick goes after Carol-Lynne.  Off Maureen.

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- CLOSET -- SAME

    Nick s closet, the size of a small bedroom.  Lined with 
    suits, shirts, shoes, belts, ties, suspenders.  Everything in 
    perfect order, color-coordinated.  Carol-Lynne flatly grabs 
    the few things of hers in here, stowed at the end of a rack.  
    Two dresses.  A purse.  A mink stole.  Nick steps in.  Beat.

                                NICK
                There s a good explanation, but you don t 
                want to hear it.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I didn t ask for it.

    She gives him a curt smile, walks past him and out.

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

    Nick trails behind Carol-Lynne, watches the front door close 
    behind her.  He looks back to the kitchen.  Reacts.  Maureen 
    is gone, too.  As are her shoes and her Bunny costume.  Her 
    tea sits on the counter, half-full.

    EXT. CHICAGO -- SIDEWALK -- NIGHT

      Carol-Lynne walks up the sidewalk, wipes a half-tear from her 
    eye.  Her face changes, takes on a fierce determination.  She 
    won t be trodden upon.  She whistles for a TAXI.

    EXT. LINCOLN PARK -- NIGHT

    Small houses sit only feet apart in this leafy district on 
    the North end of the city.  A TAXI pulls up to a small house.  
    A Bunny gets out.  Not Carol-Lynne.  Alice.

    INT. ALICE S HOUSE -- NIGHT

    Alice s husband SEAN (32, bright, complex, think Patrick 
    Wilson) drinks a beer, preoccupied, trying to distract 
    himself with TV.  A COKE COMMERCIAL comes on with a certain 
    young beauty queen (23) and 4 ALL-AMERICAN GUYS behind her:

                                ANITA BRYANT (ON TV)
                Hi!  I m Anita Bryant!  The Brothers 
                Four!  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                ANITA BRYANT (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                We d like to sing you the new song for 
                  Coca-Cola!
                        (all sing)
                King Size Coca-Cola gives you that 
                  refreshing new feeling 
                  Refreshing new feeling...

                                ALICE (O.S.)
                          (imitating, chirpy)
                  Refreshing new feeling.

    Sean turns to see Alice, just walked in, removing her coat.

                                ALICE (CONT D)
                Can t get that song out of my head.

    Alice moves to sit next to Sean on the couch, hands him the 
    $200 CASH she made tonight.  Sean shakes his head at the 
    money, impressed, can t believe their luck.  Not how Alice 
    described him to Carol-Lynne at all.  He looks up at her.

                                SEAN
                How long can we keep this going?

                                ALICE
                Until I slip up.

    EXT. NORTH STATE PKWY -- 2:00 A.M.

    A third TAXI drops Maureen off in a residential area of the 
    Gold Coast.  She uses her key to unlock the front door at her 
    own home on North State Parkway.  REVEAL... the gargantuan 
    PLAYBOY MANSION.  A man sings from somewhere inside... 

                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                ... The best is yet to come, come the day 
                you re mine...

    INT. PLAYBOY MANSION -- CONTINUOUS

    Maureen walks through the glamorous foyer, past a piano den 
    where a drunk CY COLEMAN (34) plays the piano, singing  THE 
    BEST IS YET TO COME  for an in-love BUNNY.

                                CY COLEMAN
                Wait  til you see that sunshine place 
                There ain't nothin  like it here...

    Maureen continues through... past the bi-level swimming pool, 
    the billiards room, climbs the twisting stairwell into the 
    Bunny Hutch.  The top floor of dorm-style apartments where 
    Bunnies can live cheap.  Walks down the hall --                                                                                    26.


    INT. MANSION -- MAUREEN & JANIE S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

    -- and tiptoes into the room she shares with Janie, who 
    sleeps in the bed across.  Or doesn t sleep.  Amused, Janie 
    watches Maureen as she tries to creep into bed. 

                                JANIE
                          (sing-song)
                Out with Nick Dalton already.

                                MAUREEN
                        (looks at her)
                How -- how did you know?

                                JANIE
                Max said Nick was at the club for fifteen 
                minutes before he went to look for you 
                and neither of you came back.  I don t 
                blame you.  He is Nick Dalton.  

    Janie smiles, having fun.  She doesn t know anything.  Good.  

                                JANIE (CONT D)
                Is it true what they say about him?  That 
                he has a really big --

                                MAUREEN
                What?  I don t know, we didn t --

                                JANIE
                Maureen.  You have a dirty mind.  I was 
                gonna say  penis. 

    Maureen can t help a laugh.  

                                JANIE (CONT D)
                No.  I was gonna say  heart. 

                                MAUREEN
                Oh.  Maybe.  Yeah.  I don t know.

                                JANIE
                        (smiles, playful)
                You re in trouble.

    Maureen says nothing more, turns over, tries to fall asleep.  
    In trouble, indeed.

                                CY COLEMAN (O.S.)
                Still it s a real good bet the best is 
                yet to come...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    27.

    EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION -- 3:00 A.M. -- ESTABLISHING

    It s still dark outside The Playboy Mansion, which sits on a 
    wealthy residential street one block from the lake, with 
    neighbors just like anybody else.  From inside, we hear a 
    faint scratchy record playing  GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL ...

    INT. MANSION -- PIANO DEN -- SAME

    Through a haze of smoke, FIND Maureen, curled up in an 
    oversized leather club chair, chain-smoking, the Steve 
    Lawrence RECORD quietly spinning on a turntable next to her.  

                                STEVE LAWRENCE (ON RECORD)
                Go away, little girl
                Go away, little girl
                It's hurting me more each minute that you 
                delay...

    SONG CONTINUES THROUGH....

    INT. NICK S HIGH-RISE -- BASEMENT -- SAME

    Nick, at his fiery building incinerator.  He burns Clyde s 
    lighter, his Playboy Club Key.

                                STEVE LAWRENCE (ON RECORD)
                When you are near me like this
                You're much too hard to resist...

    INT. MANSION -- PIANO DEN -- SAME

    Maureen picks up the book next to her, One Flew Over the 
    Cuckoo s Nest, rereads the first page for the fifteenth time.  
    She can t take it in, tosses it aside, lights another 
    cigarette instead.

                                STEVE LAWRENCE (ON RECORD)
                So, go away, little girl, before I beg 
                you to stay...

    EXT. CAR WASH -- 9:00 A.M.

    Nick waits while Billy s car is washed within an inch of its 
    life.  Thumbs through today s Tribune.  On Page 2, HIS 
    PICTURE next to the headline DALTON WINS HEFTY SETTLEMENT FOR 
    SEWAGE VICTIMS.  Yesterday was very good.  And very bad.

    EXT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- 10:00 A.M.

    Nick parks Billy s Buick out front.  MUSIC OUT.                                                                                    28.


    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/BILLY S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

    Nick walks toward Billy s office.  Stops when he sees Billy 
    already has a visitor, Clyde Hill s wife GLADYS (40s, stern, 
    fur coat).  Nick knows exactly who she is.

                                GLADYS
                -- five-ten, a little overweight, dark 
                eyes, red hair, gap-toothed, and somehow 
                not terrible-looking?

                                BILLY
                Yes, according to the door list, your 
                husband was here last night, but we have 
                  thousands of Keyholders and I don t know 
                everyone by face.  I can ask if anyone 
                saw him at today s Bunny meeting.

                                GLADYS
                Okay.  I ll give you my telephone number --

                                BILLY
                No need for that, it ll be in your 
                  husband s member file.  If you like, you 
                can use our phone to call the police --

                                GLADYS
                No.  Don t call the police.  Thank you.

    Gladys walks out, past Nick, she doesn t know him.  Nick 
    watches her go for a split-second, continues into Billy s 
    office, sets down his CAR KEYS and a $10.00 BILL.

                                NICK
                And I got it washed.

                                BILLY
                Keep your ten dollars. 

                                NICK
                I stole your car, Billy, let me do what I 
                can to avoid a beating next time I see 
                your wife.

                                BILLY
                Like the beating that woman s husband is 
                getting next time she sees him.  

                                NICK
                        (plays dumb)
                Who s her husband?                                                                                      29.


                                BILLY
                Clyde Hill, comes in about once a month.  
                Nice guy.  

                                NICK
                You just told her you didn t know him.

                                BILLY
                It s the Playboy Club, not a knitting 
                club.  Can you see if I tattled to every 
                panicky wife?   Yeah, Gladys, matter of 
                fact I saw your husband dancing with my 
                new Cigarette Bunny, she s got great 
                legs, you can bounce a dime off her ass. 

                                NICK
                Well, we know he didn t go home with her.

                                BILLY
                And we know I didn t tell your  wife. 

                                NICK
                She found out anyway.

    Nick goes.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- RECORDS ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

    Nick sneaks in, finds a series of FILE CABINETS labeled 
      KEYHOLDERS.  Files through G-L.  Thomas Hibbard, Milton 
    Higgins... Clyde Hill.  Pulls Clyde Hill s file.

    INT. MANSION -- MAUREEN & JANIE S ROOM -- DAY

    Next to her ashtray, Maureen finally sleeps.  Janie enters, 
    toothbrush in mouth, tap-tap-taps Maureen.  She bolts up with 
    a start, out of a nightmare, ashtray goes flying.

                                JANIE
                It s okay it s okay you re awake!  Sorry!  
                We just have the Bunny meeting in a half-
                hour and I didn t want you to -- crap, I 
                made you spill all your ashes.  

    Janie halfheartedly starts to clean up the spilled ashes, 
    finds a half-smoked cigarette, pockets it for later.  

                                JANIE (CONT D)
                At least I stopped your nightmare, right?  

    Maureen is still in those few seconds of post-dream 
    confusion.  But then she gets clarity.  Remembers.                                                                                     30.


                                MAUREEN
                It wasn t a nightmare. 

    EXT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- DAY

    Nick steps out a side-door, runs into Carol-Lynne on her way 
    in.  Both didn t expect to see the other.  Both play it cool.

                                NICK
                Hi.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                What are you doing here?

                                NICK
                        (doesn t miss a beat)
                I left my coat here last night.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                No time to stop for a silly coat when 
                you re chasing Bunny tail.

                                NICK
                Cute.  It was nothing.  Take tonight off, 
                let s have dinner.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I m not hungry.

    She walks past him into the club.  Off Nick, staggered, 
    surprisingly stung.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY

    Bunnies, strewn about  The Living Room,  a fireplace/piano 
    enclave in the middle of the club.  Maureen sits with Janie, 
    Alice and Brenda, waiting for the Bunny meeting to start. 

                                JANIE
                -- if you didn t do it, what did you do?

                                MAUREEN
                Nothing, we just -- talked.

                                JANIE
                        (uh-oh, to the others)
                She wants to marry him.

                                ALICE
                As much as he s a catch, Maureen, you 
                really shouldn t go for Nick Dalton.

                                MAUREEN
                I don t want to marry him.                                                                                    31.


                                JANIE
                That s a big fat lie.  Every girl working 
                here is trying to marry a man just like 
                that and if you tell me you re not I ll 
                never trust another word you say.

                                ALICE
                Janie, not every girl is here looking for 
                  a husband.

                                JANIE
                        (rolls her eyes, obviously)
                Well, not if you already have one.  

                                MAUREEN
                        (tries to sound legit)
                I mean, of course he s perfect, but he s 
                not single.  He s with Carol-Lynne.  

                                JANIE
                But he hasn t married Carol-Lynne, has 
                he?  No, he hasn t.

                                MAUREEN
                Maybe he won t ever marry anybody.  
                  Otherwise why isn t he married already?

                                ALICE
                That s all I m saying, Maureen.  Don t 
                fall for him, because in the end, he ll 
                break your heart.

                                BRENDA
                And Carol-Lynne will break your face.

    Maureen reacts, looks around for Carol-Lynne as more Bunnies 
    take their seats.  Carol-Lynne isn t here.  

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/BILLY S OFFICE -- SAME

      Carol-Lynne is here, staked out, waiting behind a corner near 
    Billy s office.  Billy finally walks out to start the 
    meeting.  As soon as he s safely gone, Carol-Lynne slips in.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- LIVING ROOM -- MID-MEETING

    Billy leads the Bunny meeting, a LIST OF TO-DO S in his hand. 

                                BILLY
                -- so from now on, ten percent of your 
                tips go to the busboys.

    Bunnies react, annoyed.  Bunny Kate, the gum-chewing Door 
    Bunny we met at the beginning, raises her hand.                                                                                    32.


                                KATE
                I know the Door Bunny never gets tipped, 
                but can she wear a coat between the 
                months of September and April?  

                                BILLY
                No, Kate, the Door Bunny is the first 
                thing men see when they get here, and you 
                know what they want to see.  How many 
                times are you going to ask me this?  

                                KATE
                My mom said I should ask you again.

                                BILLY
                        (rolls his eyes, ends meeting)
                Okay, that s it for -- oh, I promised I d 
                ask -- did anyone wait on a Keyholder 
                named Clyde Hill last night?

    Maureen reacts, freezes.  Already?

                                ALICE
                        (raises her hand)
                I did.  He skipped out on his check.

                                BILLY
                        (confused)
                We weren t under last night.

                                ALICE
                  I covered it from my tips.  Isn t that 
                what we have to do?

                                BILLY
                          (impressed)
                Yes.  Thank you, Alice.  Any idea where 
                he went? 

                                ALICE
                No, I just turned around and he was gone.

    Maureen feels bad Alice had to cover it.  And feels sick to 
    her stomach, everything rushing back.  It s real.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BACK/BILLY S OFFICE -- DAY

    Billy walks back to his office.  Stops in the doorway when he 
    sees Carol-Lynne, going through his files, a few of them 
    already stuffed into her large purse.

                                BILLY
                What are you doing?                                                                                    33.


      Carol-Lynne looks up, caught.  Billy bolts over, dumps out 
    the contents of her purse.  BUNNY PROFILES, APPLICATIONS.  
    Looks at her.  She stares back, flat.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                You know you can use my help, Billy.

                                BILLY
                        (incensed, wry)
                  Interesting.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                It s obvious you can run the numbers, you 
                can pay the bills, you re good back here.  
                But out there, half the girls don t know 
                how to serve drinks without their tits 
                falling out.  They re leaving in the 
                middle of their shifts, they re chewing 
                gum, they re saying  buck  instead of 
                   dollar,  they re having sex in the 
                  bathroom.  We re better than that.

                                BILLY
                We are not a  we.   Thank you for your 
                  exhaustive list of complaints, I don t 
                get enough of that from my wife, but I 
                don t need another manager, especially 
                one who s breaking into my office.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                You may be my boss, Billy, but I ve been 
                here longer than you.  I ve been here 
                longer than anyone.  I ve also always 
                known the day would come when I couldn t 
                be a Bunny anymore, but I promised myself 
                it wouldn t be because I was too old, it 
                would be because I was too good.  

                                BILLY
                And it turns out it s because you re a 
                thief.  You re fired.

    He hands her the empty purse.

    EXT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

      Carol-Lynne walks out, seething, jumps into a TAXI.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE

    INT. NICK S HIGH-RISE -- BASEMENT -- DUSK

    Nick tosses Clyde Hill s member file into the incinerator as 
     THE WANDERER  by Dion plays on a radio in...

    INT. NICK S APARTMENT -- CLOSET -- DUSK

    CLOSE ON: Nick, naked, dripping, just out of the shower, 
    holding his own stare in a full length mirror, as if looking 
    into the past.  And last night.  What has he done?  Then, 
    QUICK SHOTS, as if erasing all this... Nick puts on a shirt, 
    a suit, buttons his cuff links, perfects the knot in his tie.  
    Looks at himself in the mirror again.  That s better.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BUNNY DRESSING ROOM -- SAME

    Another face in a mirror -- Maureen, thinking very similar 
    thoughts -- as she Janie, Alice, Brenda and 20 OTHER BUNNIES 
    in bras and fishnets apply lipstick and tease hair.  A BUNNY 
    walks through naked --

                                NAKED BUNNY
                  After-party at the mansion!  No swimsuits 
                in the pool!

                                MAUREEN
                Can anyone go?

                                JANIE
                No no no.  No way.  Mansion parties are 
                  guest-list only, very exclusive.  

                                ALICE
                        (stop torturing her)
                Bunnies are always invited.  

                                JANIE
                        (to Alice, re Alice)
                But not all Bunnies go.

                                ALICE
                Husbands aren t allowed.  If I could 
                bring my husband, I d go.

                                BRENDA
                When are you gonna show us this husband, 
                Alice?  I ve known you almost a year and 
                I ve never met his ass once.

                                ALICE
                Well, it s not like he s gonna come watch 
                me work at the Playboy Club.                                                                                    35.


                                JANIE
                Well, it s not like he d see anything so 
                bad.  You walk around here with that 
                wedding ring like a man will get 
                  electrocuted if he so much as glances in 
                the region of your kitty-kat.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BILLY S OFFICE -- SAME

    Billy, at his desk, picks up the RINGING PHONE.

                                BILLY (INTO PHONE)
                Billy Morton.
                        (reacts, straightens up)
                Oh.  Hello, Mr. Hefner.  Uh-huh.  I see.

    Carol-Lynne, wearing a hot Givenchy dress and pearls, steps 
    into his doorway.  And smiles.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BUNNY DRESSING ROOM -- SAME

    The girls continue with their makeup, chatter about tonight s 
    mansion party.

                                JANIE
                At the end?  It s so late?  There s a 
                  breakfast buffet.  I mean early.  And 
                they have these blueberry crepes with 
                this kind of vanilla sauce?  I always 
                have way too many, but then I just stick 
                my finger down my throat and throw them 
                up.  It s this new diet I heard about.  
                You can t go more than five pounds over 
                your weight when you were hired, so.

                                MAUREEN
                Is the party all to do with... sex?

                                JANIE
                If you want it to do with sex.  But 
                  basically it s just a perfect party with 
                only the best people invited.  Guess who 
                I met at the last one?  

                                BRENDA
                        (has heard this sixteen times)
                Sammy Davis, Jr.

                                MAUREEN
                Are you serious?

                                JANIE
                And Hef is obviously the host.  If he 
                notices you, then you re set.                                                                                     36.


                                MAUREEN
                For what?

                                JANIE
                Life.  Whatever you want to be set for.  
                You could be a centerfold, maybe.  You 
                could be his girlfriend.  I hear he s 
                ready to get married.

    Maureen shakes her head, smiles it off.  

                                BRENDA
                        (flat, applying mascara)
                I m gonna be the first Black centerfold.

    The girls are blank.  No idea what to do with this... joke?

                                BRENDA (CONT D)
                I am.  You can t discriminate against 
                these tits.

    Door opens.  Carol-Lynne walks in.  The Bunnies react, 
    surprised by her appearance, clothes.  She walks down the 
    line of Bunnies, casually, to each --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                More curls.  More cleavage.  Gum.

    Bunny Kate spits her gum into Carol-Lynne s hand.  Like Kate, 
    all the Bunnies are confused.  What is going on?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                        (to Janie)
                Stand up straighter.
                        (to Alice)
                Lose the wedding ring.
                        (to Maureen)
                Smile.
                        (turns to all)
                Girls.  I am now your Bunny Mother. 

    Blank stares.  Huh?  From out in the club, LIVE MUSIC STARTS, 
    the opening vamp of an up-tempo DOO-WOP SONG.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Like a House Mother in a sorority.  Or 
                the Mother Superior in a convent.  Or 
                your mother, who whips you into shape, 
                who encourages you, who teaches you.  
                Starting now, I am now in charge of all 
                things Bunny.  Starting now, I ll be 
                watching all of you very closely.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    37.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Because you either are the living, 
                  breathing fantasy that is the Playboy 
                Bunny, or you re not.

    Bunnies react, nervous.  Maureen assumes she s done for.  The 
      seamstress, BETTY (40, Black) enters with a rack of Bunny 
    costumes.  Carol-Lynne takes one, holds it up.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Betty recut all of the costumes higher at 
                the hip.  More leg.  More tips.

    Bunnies react, now with smiles, cautious excitement.  Maybe 
    this will be a good thing?  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                And new corsets.  Tighter.  Higher.  See?  
                Just like your mommy giving you a 
                training bra.  Only... Bunnier.

    As Carol-Lynne hands Bunny Kate a FUR-LINED BUNNY COSTUME to 
    keep her warm at the door, WHIP TO A SERIES OF HOT, SEXY 
    SHOTS as all Bunnies don new CORSETS, COSTUMES, HEELS.  
    Jeweled CUFFS, glittered EARS, poofier TAILS, DOUBLE-LENGTH 
    FALSE EYELASHES.  Blink.  Blink.  Each goes from regular girl 
    to super-glam Bunny.  This doesn t feel like the back of a 
    club anymore, it feels like the back of a theatre.  SHOWTIME.

    Maureen looks at herself in the mirror, one last swipe of 
    lipstick.  Maybe she can forget all this ever happened.  Puts 
    the lipstick back in her purse, and inside sees the WAD OF 
    CASH Nick gave her from Clyde Hill s pocket.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                And there s a new rule.

    Maureen spooks, looks up to see Carol-Lynne in her mirror.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                        (at Maureen, loud enough for all)
                Bunnies are now expressly forbidden to 
                date Keyholders.  Or slip into the back 
                with them.  Or anything.

    Maureen freezes.  Does Carol-Lynne know about the murder?

                                GIRL GROUP (PRELAP)
                Watch out!
                Oh, girls you know we've got to --

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

    An opening act, 3 BLACK GIRLS sing doo-wop song  PLAYBOY .                                                                                    38.


                                GIRL GROUP
                Watch out, here comes that playboy
                Watch out, here comes that playboy...

    Cigarette tray in hands, Maureen walks through the club, 
    panicked that Carol-Lynne knows.  That the mob knows.  She 
    sees Nick at a CORNER TABLE OF 8, hobnobbing with CHICAGO 
    ELITE.  She looks away.

                                GIRL GROUP (CONT D)
                Playboy find yourself another toy
                This is one heart you won't destroy...

    NICK S TABLE: Nick s eyes travel the club.  Sees Leo, Gus, 
    the Bianchi mobsters.  Gus looks over at Nick.  A strange 
    nod.  Nick gives the smallest of nods back, then pulls his 
    eyes away.  Sees Maureen, walking past, in a daze.  A 
    KEYHOLDER, whose back is to Nick, walks up to her.

    WITH MAUREEN: The Keyholder approaches.  She scares.  It s 
    Clyde Hill, the man she thought she killed.

                                CLYDE HILL
                Hello.

    Maureen blinks.  It s not him.  Just another KEYHOLDER.

                                  KEYHOLDER
                Luckys, please.

    She blinks again.  Yes, it is Clyde Hill.  No, it s not.  
    Yes, it is.  Maureen loses her footing, nearly faints, drops 
    her tray.  From his corner table, Nick sees this, gets up.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

    In a dark corner of the club, Nick gives Maureen a glass of 
    water, helps reorganize her cigarette tray. 

                                MAUREEN
                She knows.  She said  No more dancing 
                with Keyholders, no more slipping into 
                the back with them -- 

                                NICK
                She s just jealous.

                                MAUREEN
                You don t know that.  I keep seeing his 
                face, I m having visions --

                                NICK
                Maureen, you have to be the same person 
                you were before yesterday.                                                                                     39.


                                MAUREEN
                But I m not the same person I was before 
                  yesterday.

                                NICK
                Pretend that you are.

                                MAUREEN
                That s not so easy --

                                NICK
                It should be.  You ve been pretending 
                since you were little, right?

    Maureen reacts.  He remembered.  And he s serious.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                You came here to be a performer.  Here s 
                your chance to really perform.  Not just 
                for you.  For me.

    Maureen nods, stressed.  She ll try.

                                NICK (CONT D)
                Drink the rest of that water.

                                MAUREEN
                        (looks at it, frowns)
                I hate water.

                                NICK
                        (a genuine laugh)
                Me, too.

    A moment between them.  The escalating romance undeniable. 

                                MAUREEN
                        (beat)
                  Carol-Lynne also said Bunnies can t date 
                  Keyholders anymore.

                                NICK
                Then she s absolutely just jealous.

    Maureen reacts, smiles.  He winks back.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SUPPLY ROOM -- NIGHT

    Where the murder took place last night.  Max leads Janie in.  
    She sees something across the room, gasps.  REVEAL: a 
    romantic candle burns between two glasses of scotch.

                                JANIE
                Max... what s this for?                                                                                    40.


    Max gets down on one knee.  Pulls out a  sweet  RING. 

                                MAX
                Because I love you Bunny Janie, and I 
                love you plain Janie, and I want to spend 
                the rest of my life with you.  Marry me.

    Janie reacts, totally confused.

                                JANIE
                Marry you?

                                MAX
                You could get any man in the world, and 
                God knows working here you meet most of 
                them, but I don t want any man to get you 
                except me. 

    Janie is blank.  Beat.  Beat.

                                JANIE
                Max... I ve only known you two months.

                                MAX
                So what?  My parents got married after 
                two weeks.  

                                JANIE
                Max, I love you.  I really do, but... we 
                don t know each other that well.

                                MAX
                You know everything about me.

                                JANIE
                Okay, well... you don t know everything 
                about me.

                                MAX
                        (reacts)
                What do you mean?

    Janie keeps her eyes on the floor.  Now Max is angry.

                                MAX (CONT D)
                What do you mean?

                                WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                Janie, can I see you for a second?

      Carol-Lynne stands in the doorway.  Saved.  And caught.                                                                                    41.


    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- COAT CHECK -- NIGHT

    The Coat Check area looks Bunny-less until we find Alice, 
    buried beneath leather and sable, using a few quiet minutes 
    to make a phone call.  RING.  RING.

                                SEAN (ON PHONE)
                Hello?

                                ALICE (INTO PHONE)
                Hi.  I only have a second.  Do you know 
                where we re meeting yet?

    INT. ALICE S HOUSE -- SAME (INTERCUT)

    Her husband Sean, on their living room couch.

                                SEAN
                Yes.  The basement of St. Mary s Church 
                at Lincoln and Kinsey.  Two a.m.

                                ALICE
                Okay.

    ANGLE: Maureen sneaks up to Alice s tip jar outside the 
    closet, puts $40 in from the wad of Clyde Hill s cash, to 
    cover his bill which Alice covered last night.  Darts off.

                                SEAN
                How much have you made tonight?

                                ALICE
                Over a hundred and it s only eleven.

                                SEAN
                They re gonna think we re criminals.

                                ALICE
                In most states we are.  I think it s 
                because I took off my wedding ring.

                                SEAN
                You what?

                                ALICE
                I had to, it s a new rule they --

                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                Hello?  Coat, please?

    Alice fumbles the phone, realizes a KEYHOLDER is waiting for 
    his hat and coat.  She hangs up.  STAY WITH SEAN as he hangs 
    up the phone.  REVEAL: on the couch with him is another man, 
    scruffy, shirtless (28, JOSHUA), sipping a beer.                                                                                    42.


    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BUNNY DRESSING ROOM -- SAME

    A nervous Janie sits across from Carol-Lynne, who has set up 
      a temporary  office  in a corner of the dressing room.

                                JANIE
                -- I m sure I gave it when I was hired.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I m sure you didn t, Janie, and in order 
                for you to work here, we need your social 
                security number, so what is it?

    Janie shifts, clearly has something to hide.

                                JANIE
                We make almost all our money in tips, why 
                do you need my social --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Janie.

                                JANIE
                Is this because you saw me and Max in the 
                bathroom --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                This is because Playboy Bunnies are the 
                most important part of the Playboy Club 
                and we need to know who you are.

                                JANIE
                We all make mistakes, right?  Can t we... 
                can t we leave our past behind?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                The thing about pasts, Janie, is that we 
                all have them.  Your social security 
                number by Monday or you re fired. 

                                  ANNOUNCER (PRELAP)
                And now, for the main attraction of the 
                evening, the Playboy Club is proud to 
                  present... Ike and Tina Turner!

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

    The shimmering CURTAIN flies into the ceiling.  The club is 
    instantly transfixed, gaga, as TINA, IKE and the same three 
    black girls who opened the night, who we now realize are THE 
    IKETTES, launch into a show-stopping  SHAKE A TAIL FEATHER.                                                                                     43.


                                TINA TURNER
                Well, I ve heard about the girl you've 
                been dancin' with 
                All over the neighbourhood 
                Tell me why didn't you ask me, baby?
                Or didn't you think I could? 

    Maureen walks through the club selling cigarettes, a pop in 
    her walk, a smile on her face, performing.  It makes it a 
    little easier watching Tina, whose performance is electric. 

                                TINA TURNER (CONT D)
                And I know there s somethin   bout you 
                that won t step aside 
                I ve seen you do The Bird all night
                But now why didn't you ask me, baby?  
                  I would've shown you how to do it right

                                IKETTE #1
                Do it right!

                                IKETTE #2
                Do it right!

                                IKETTE #3
                Do it right!

                                TINA TURNER
                Do it right!

                                TINA TURNER & IKETTES 
                  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
                Twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, 
                shake it, baby! 
                Here we go loop-dee-loop 
                Shake it up, baby! 
                Here we go loop-de-li 

    Tina points to Maureen as she walks across the floor.

                                TINA TURNER
                Bend over, let me see you shake a tail 
                feather!

    Maureen laughs, bends over, shakes her Bunny tail.  

                                IKETTE #1
                Bend over, let me see you shake a tail 
                feather! 

    Each Ikette points to a different Bunny.  Janie, Alice, 
    Brenda, Kate.  All shaking their Bunny tails.                                                                                    44.


                                IKETTE #2
                Bend over, now let me see you shake it!

    Soon all the Bunnies make their way to the floor, the whole 
    club going absolutely nuts.  

                                TINA TURNER & IKETTES
                  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
                Twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, 
                shake it baby! 

    Maureen dances, sparkles, more than performing... forgetting.  
    This isn t a fantasy, this is real.  She catches Nick smiling 
    at her from his table, a smile that says  You re doing great. 

                                TINA TURNER
                Do The Fly, oh!
                Do The Swim, ha ha ha!
                And do The Bird!
                Well do The Duck!
                And do The Bunny!
                  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

    Bunnies shaking their tails, patrons dancing feverishly, the 
    song accelerates, the place might explode.  And Maureen, at 
    the center of it all.

                                TINA TURNER & IKETTES
                Twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, 
                shake it baby 
                Twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, 
                shake it baby 
                Twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, 
                shake it baby 
                  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  
                TWIST!

    The number ends in a sweaty fever pitch.  The club goes nuts 
    with UNENDING APPLAUSE.  Maureen s smile could not be bigger.  
    Nick walks to her, talks close in her ear over the applause.

                                NICK
                That.  Keep doing that.

    Maureen smiles.

    ANGLE: From a perch in the balcony, Carol-Lynne watches 
    Maureen and Nick, shoulder-to-shoulder, whispering in each 
    others  ears.  Carol-Lynne is not applauding.

                                        ACT FOUR

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

    Draped in Bunnies, Cy Coleman is at the piano in the smoky, 
    glittering living room, playing his  PLAYBOY S THEME. 

                                CY COLEMAN
                        (to the Bunnies, a joke)
                How do you shoot a blue elephant?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                        (on approach)
                With a blue elephant gun.

                                CY COLEMAN
                How do you shoot a yellow elephant?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Have you ever seen a yellow elephant?

                                CY COLEMAN
                How do you shoot a red elephant?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Hold his trunk until he turns blue, then 
                shoot him with the blue elephant gun.

    The Bunnies laugh.  Cy winks at Carol-Lynne.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Come on girls, tails up.

    The Bunnies stand up, get back to work.  Carol-Lynne 
    continues through, checking on the room.

                                MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                You forgot these.

      Carol-Lynne turns to see Nick, and a small jewelry box.  She 
    takes it, opens it.  A pair of ruby studs.  

                                NICK
                I saw them at Tiffany three weeks ago.  
                They ve been in my dresser waiting for 
                your next birthday, but I want you to 
                have them now.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Because you want me back or because you 
                won t see me at my next birthday?                                                                                    46.


                                NICK
                Can I have you back?  I hear there s a 
                new rule, no Keyholders dating Bunnies.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                I m not a Bunny anymore. 

                                NICK
                Oh, right.  Congratulations.  Will you 
                still perform?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                          (pointed)
                I m performing right now.

                                NICK
                        (beat)
                Look, I know why you made the rule, and I 
                swear to you, nothing happened with --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                The rule was made because we don t want to 
                  jeopardize our liquor license.  We can t 
                be accused of being a brothel, can we?

    Nick gives her a dubious look.  She doesn t flinch.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                That is the law, isn t it, counselor?

                                NICK
                Yes.
                        (then, the earrings)
                I ll get you something even better for 
                your next birthday.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                  I accept.

                                NICK
                Good.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                The earrings.  

                                NICK
                I see.

    ANGLE: Maureen enters the room with her cigarette tray, stops 
    short when she sees Nick and Carol-Lynne talking close.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Do you think I don t know why you come to 
                the Playboy Club every night, Nick?  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    47.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT'D)
                Do you think I don t know you need every 
                man in the place thinking  I wish I could 
                be him  as he watches you cross the room?  
                And every girl thinking  Pick me ?  It s 
                your fuel.  You feed on it.  It s what 
                you need to propel your meteoric rise to 
                Best Man Ever.  I know you, Nick, which 
                is exactly why you couldn t say those 
                four little words. 

                                NICK
                You know I m not ready to get married.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Not those four words, especially since 
                thirty seconds ago you couldn t even say 
                 I want you back. 

    Those four words.  Beat.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                I ll tell you why you couldn t say them.  
                Because you want you back.  You want the 
                you who never had the woman walk away.  
                Well, you can t have us all and I m a one-
                strike girl, baby, so I m walking away.  
                Good luck finding the one for you.

                                NICK
                  I thought I d already found her.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                She doesn t exist.

      Carol-Lynne turns to go, instantly sees Maureen.  Maureen 
    quickly turns away, pretends she wasn t watching, but Carol-
    Lynne sails past her, and without stopping, says...

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Follow me to the back, please.

    Maureen goes pale.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- BUNNY DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

    Maureen walks in, not sure where to sit.

                                MAUREEN
                Should -- here?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                That s fine.                                                                                    48.


    Maureen sits across from Carol-Lynne.  An awkward, forced 
    silence.  Carol-Lynne smiles thinly.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                So.  You ve been here about a week now.  
                Are you liking it?

                                MAUREEN
                Yes.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Enjoying the money?

                                MAUREEN
                I guess.  I m not really interested in 
                money.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                What are you interested in?

    Tension is high.

                                MAUREEN
                Look, nothing happened with Mr. Dalton.  
                It s just this week has been -- a big 
                change.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Yeah.  For me, too.

    A chilly beat.  But Maureen is no wilting flower.

                                MAUREEN
                  Carol-Lynne, if you re going to fire me, 
                please just go ahead and do it, I can 
                handle it just fine.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                  Sweetheart, no.  I called you in here 
                because Billy threw you out on the floor 
                last week without any training.  You re 
                leaving in the middle of your shifts, 
                you re having trouble handling the 
                  cigarette tray, you have no idea what 
                you re doing, but that s not your fault.

    Maureen blinks.  Confused.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                I m working on a training manual.  
                Starting now, every new Bunny will go 
                through six weeks of training before she 
                steps out on the floor by herself.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    49.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                You ll be paid hourly, and by the end 
                you ll have all the tools you need to be 
                an excellent Bunny.  
                        (off Maureen s look)
                Does it really sound so bad?

                                MAUREEN
                No, but -- 

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                Then why the face?

                                MAUREEN
                I guess -- I guess I don t believe you 
                really want me to be an excellent Bunny.  
                I think you want to -- what do they say?  
                Keep your enemies close?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                        (reacts, surprised)
                Well, you re more interesting than I 
                thought you were.  Are you my enemy?

                                MAUREEN
                        (means it)
                No.  I idolized you from the minute I saw 
                you, I wanted to be your friend, but --

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                        (leans in, real)
                Believe it or not, Maureen, I m on your 
                side.  I am your friend.  Nick Dalton?  
                He s not.  He s his friend.

    Maureen reacts, a lifetime of walls and defenses shooting up.  

    She stands, walks quickly out.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    50.


                                        ACT FIVE

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- SHOWROOM -- NIGHT

    ON NICK -- watching Tina Turner and the Ikettes perform a 
    bluesy show-stopper,  TELL MAMA. 

                                TINA TURNER (PRELAP)
                You thought you had found a good girl
                One to love you and give you the world
                Now you find that you ve been misused
                Talk to me, I ll do what you choose, I 
                want you to... 

                Tell Mama all about it 
                Tell Mama what you need
                Tell Mama what you want...

    Nick clocks the new  Mama  walking through the club -- Carol-
    Lynne.  Bittersweet.  He s happy for her.

    BIANCHI TABLE -- SAME:  MIKEY (28, loud) tries to impress.

                                MIKEY
                Who s the most famous female singing 
                  elephant?

    Gus, Leo, the others stare back.

                                MIKEY (CONT D)
                  Elephants Gerald!

    Crickets.

                                WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                Looking for this?

    Gus turns to see Carol-Lynne, bent close with the DIAMOND-
    STUDDED WATCH he gave Billy dangling from her fingertips.

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                You re more than welcome as Keyholders, 
                but Hef s never giving you the keys, so 
                either get on board, or get off.

    Gus reacts, stunned, even a little impressed.  Leo is pissed.  
      Carol-Lynne smiles, hands Gus the watch. 

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Anything else I can get you boys?

                                GUS
                Matter of fact, there is.                                                                                    51.


    BAR -- SAME: Janie calls in a drink order to Max.

                                JANIE
                Scotch, Cutty Sark.  Two bourbon, Old 
                Forester and 7 Crown.  Martini.  Tom 
                Collins.  Pink Lady.  Heineken s.

    Max makes the drinks, fast and frustrated.  Janie garnishes.  

                                MAX
                I made the decision.  You re quitting.

                                JANIE
                        (looks up, offended)
                What do you mean,  I made the decision, 
                you re quitting? 

                                MAX
                It s not so crazy for a man not to want 
                his girl working as a Playboy Bunny.   

                                JANIE
                But I like working here, Max.  I want to

                  Goddamnit, you re not on your own 
                anymore, Janie, you re with me.  
                        (beat, sweeter)
                Look, I make enough money for the both of 
                us.  I want to marry you.  I don t know 
                what it is you think I don t know about 
                you, but I know that.

    A heavy beat.  His sincerity is heartbreaking.  

                                JANIE
                Max... I can t marry you because I m 
                already married.

    Max reacts, stares in disbelief, crushed.  Takes off his 
    apron, bolts.  Janie is sick to her stomach.  The BAR PHONE 
    RINGS.  No one to pick it up.  RING.  Janie finally leans 
    over, picks it up.

                Playboy Club, Bunny Janie speaking.

    NICK S TABLE -- SAME: Nick, on his third martini with his 
    close friends and those who think they re close friends.

                Daley s suicide note is on the cover of 
                the Trib.

    Nick smiles, stubs out his cigarette.  Janie walks up with a 
    TELEPHONE, sets it in front of Nick, hands him the receiver.

                                JANIE

    Nick reacts, doesn t even have to look.  Knows who it is.  
    And knows what it s probably about.  REVERSE: Gus Bianchi, on 
    an IDENTICAL PHONE, not looking back at Nick.

    INT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- COAT CHECK -- FIVE MINUTES LATER

    One hat, one coat left.  Impatient, Alice looks at her watch.  
    2:06.  Six minutes past the 2:00 AM rendezvous time.  Nick 
    strides up with his ticket.  Finally, Alice can leave.

    EXT. PLAYBOY CLUB -- ALLEY -- MOMENTS LATER

    Nick rounds the corner into the black, shimmering, wind-
    whipped alley behind the club.  Waits.  Paces.  His breath 
    visible in the cold night.  A DOOR SLAMS.  He turns.  It s 
    Maureen, slipping out the back door of the club, dried tears 
    on her cheeks, lighting a cigarette, walking off.

                                NICK
                Maureen.                                                                                    53.


    Maureen turns, sees him.  Turns back, flustered, keeps 
    walking.  He catches up to her.

                I want you here.

    She looks up at him.  The connection between them rages.  She 
    doesn t want to acknowledge it.

    Her eyes get wet.  She sighs, mad at herself for even 
    starting to cry.                                                                                    54.

    She reacts.  He holds her gaze, won t let her look away.  Her 
    heart wants to trust him, but her walls are strong.

    Their lips almost touching.  Breath visible between them.

    Maureen reacts.  He was an orphan, too.  Nick turns, walks to  
    the limo.  Off Maureen, a small smile.                                                                                    55.

                He trusted you, Nicko.  He showed you his

                that much.

                that s not what I m talking about.  Give 
                back the watch, Billy.

      Carol-Lynne fixes him with a look, walks off.  Billy tries to 
    stay calm.  Once she s gone, Billy opens his desk drawer, 
    pulls out the watch box the Bianchis gave him.  Reacts.  It 
    feels too light.  Opens it.  Of course, the watch is gone.  

    ANGLE: Carol-Lynne smiles to herself as she walks out, she ll 
    make Billy sweat it out for a little while longer.

    EXT. ST. MARY S CHURCH -- 2:30 A.M. -- ESTABLISHING

    A stone church at the corner of Lincoln and Kinsey. 

    INT. ST. MARY S CHURCH -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

    Alice pads in late.  Before her, rows of chairs, FIFTY MEN, A 
    FEW WOMEN, listening to an opening salvo from a man named 
    WALLACE.  Behind him, a banner: MATTACHINE SOCIETY MIDWEST.

                                WALLACE
                -- like the Renaissance peasants from 
                whom we get our name, we must be masked.  
                Yet like the Mattachine, who fought 
                against the oppression of their lords, 
                there is power in this room...

    Alice scans for Sean.  There he is, in the back row, closest 
    to her.  She makes her way to the aisle chair beside him.  On 
    the other side of Sean is Joshua, the guy who was with him on 
    the couch.  Alice waves to Joshua, knows him well.  He smiles 
    back.  Alice doesn t seem to mind very much that Sean and 
    Joshua are holding hands.                                                                                    58.

                Tonight is our beginning.  I see fire in 
                your eyes, I see dreams, and while those 
                dreams are assuredly far away, we are 
                here tonight, and you may be homosexual.

    Nervous smiles.  Clammy hands.  A lot of fear.  A donation 
    jar is passed around, gets to Alice.  She puts all $250 of 
    tonight s tips straight into the jar, passes it to a WOMAN 
    (30, pretty, strong-willed) across the aisle -- their fingers 
    touch around the jar.  Their eyes lock nervously.  Alice 
    looks away.  Has been used to looking away her whole life.

                                WOMAN
                I m Sally.

    Alice looks back.  Maybe she won t have to look away anymore.

                  I didn t.  I m married.  To a mean 
                bastard who s looking all over tarnation 
                for me right now while I m hiding here 
                with a fake name and fake eyelashes.  
                        (has to laugh, releasing it)
                He could come crashing through that door 
                any minute.                                                                                    59.


                                MAUREEN
                Janie, I had no idea --

                                JANIE
                Nobody does.  But I m not telling you 
                because I want you to feel bad for me.  
                I m telling you because life will always 
                be rough, Maureen, but it s lot more fun 
                if you join the party.  

    Maureen reacts.  Janie smiles.

                                JANIE (CONT D)
                Come on, there s a really cute stock 
                broker named Mark something pouring 
                  champagne down everybody s boobs.

    Maureen laughs.  Janie pulls her out the door.

                                MAUREEN
                Wait, wait, I can t go down like this, 
                I m wearing a nightgown --

                                JANIE
                Hef will love it.

    INT. MANSION -- BUNNY HUTCH -- CONTINUOUS

    As Janie and Maureen run down the hallway, laughing like two 
    sisters, we hear a DRIVING BASS JAM coming from downstairs...

    INT. MANSION -- PARTY -- SAME

    The party sizzles with MEN IN GUCCI and WOMEN IN PUCCI, 
    BUNNIES, SOCIALITES, CELEBRITIES.  In the piano den, Ike 
    Turner plugs in his guitar and Tina and the Ikettes blow up 
    the place with an impromptu up-tempo wailer,  TINA S WISH .  

                                TINA TURNER
                Paint me red, paint me green 
                Give me liberty, wash me clean 
                Make me over, make me nice 
                Cause when I'm done
                Lord, I wanna be right!

    Maureen and Janie walk through, flirting, laughing, martinis 
    in hand.  When Maureen steps into the piano den and sees 
    Tina, she stops, watches, captivated.  The words strike her. 

                                TINA TURNER (CONT D)
                Hey Lord, make me over (Ooooooo)
                I wanna be made over (Ooooooo)
                Hey, yeah, make me over (Ooooooo)
                I wanna be made over (Make me over!)
                                (MORE)                                                                                    60.

                                TINA TURNER (CONT D)
                (I wanna be made over!) 

                Make me smart, make me queen 
                Give a lot, give me steam 
                I want eternal beauty, spiritual things 
                Cause when I'm done, yes I wanna be a 
                good thing 
                Hey, yeah, make me over...

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (O.S.)
                You re slouching.

    Maureen turns to see Carol-Lynne next to her.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                The first rule of beauty is good posture.    
                Put your body weight on your right leg.  

    It s clear Carol-Lynne isn t being mean, just instructive.  
    Maureen hesitates, then does as Carol-Lynne says. 

                                  CAROL-LYNNE (CONT D)
                Point the toe of your right foot outward 
                and drop your left leg naturally into 
                position in front of your right foot.  
                Good.  Now both knees should touch so 
                your legs give the impression of one 
                smooth line.  Tuck your hips, arch your 
                back.  Shoulders back and squared.  Head 
                high, chin parallel to the floor.
                        (steps back, surveys her work)
                Bunny Perfect.

      Carol-Lynne winks, walks off.  Despite herself, Maureen 
    smiles.  She looks back to Tina...

                                TINA TURNER
                I wanna go places, I wanna do some things 
                I wanna be a star, I wanna have a big 
                name 
                But in my heart, let beauty reign 
                And when I'm done, I wanna have fame 

                Oh, make me over (Make me over!)
                I wanna be made over (Make me over!) 

    MUSIC CONTINUES UNDER as we hear the same confident, 
    swaggering voice we heard at the beginning of the show...

                                MAN (V.O.)
                Yes, it s a place where you can be anyone 
                you want to be, no matter who you were 
                  yesterday or who you ll be tomorrow...                                                                                    61.


    INT. MANSION -- MASTER SUITE -- SAME

    A flash of his robe.  A sip of his Pepsi.  Cigar smoke wafts 
    in front of his face.  The Charlie above his Bunny angels.  
    HUGH HEFNER (37).  We never see his face, but we see -- 

    HIS HAND -- drawing, with a pencil.  A scene from the Playboy 
    Club, an incredible sketch that looks a lot like Maureen 
    watching Carol-Lynne singing on stage from the opening. 

                                WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                That looks nothing like me.

    Says Carol-Lynne herself as she walks in, kisses Hef.  

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                  Everyone s asking for you downstairs. 

                                HEF
                Be right there, sweetheart.  How s the 
                new mother doing?

                                  CAROL-LYNNE
                She s tired.  She deserves a dip in the 
                pool.

      Carol-Lynne unzips the side of her dress, saunters out.  Hef 
    adds a few finishing touches to Maureen s face, eyes. 

                                HEF (V.O.)
                When you walk down the street, you can 
                look down at the gutter, or you can look 
                up to the sky.  Here, we only look up to 
                the sky...

      FLASH-CUTS: Hints, just hints, of the rest of the party, the 
    glamour.  Janie, in a champagne shower.  Kate and Brenda in 
    the pool with other naked Bunnies, MEN watching them as if at 
    Sea World, only much, much better. 

    Hef finishes the drawing, slips it into a plastic cover, adds 
    it to a BOUND JOURNAL filled with many drawings like these.  

                                HEF (V.O.)
                Anything is possible...

    PUSH INTO THE SKETCH, into Maureen s eyes, and MATCH TO:

    INT. MANSION -- PARTY -- SAME

    Maureen, still at the back of the room, watching as a 
    PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER snaps PHOTOS of Tina on stage.  
    FLASH FLASH FLASH FLASH FLASH!                                                                                     62.


                                TINA TURNER
                Make me nice, Lord, make me good... 
                Give me power, give me love...

                                HEF (V.O.)
                  Fantasize...

    PUSH CLOSER into Maureen s eyes -- the CAMERA FLASHES going 
    off in their glassy reflection, and WHIP TO HER FANTASY: 

    MAUREEN ON STAGE INSTEAD OF TINA -- as she s bathed in the 
    FLASH FLASH FLASH of the camera.  WHIP BACK TO REALITY:

    MAUREEN AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- watching Tina, smiling as 
    the words wash over her...

                                TINA TURNER
                Hey, yeah, make me over (Make me over!)
                I wanna be made over (Wanna be made 
                over!)

    Nick, shaking hands, kissing cheeks, but looking for Maureen.  
    When he finds her watching Tina, he smiles, watches her.  
    Lets her enjoy the moment.  Knows he lied to her, but he had 
    to.  If she knew she d killed the biggest mobster in Chicago, 
    well, she wouldn t be smiling right now.  And her smile is 
    perfect.  Just standing there, she s stunning.  His fantasy.

                                HEF (V.O.)
                Life could be a dream, sweetheart.

    THE SONG CONTINUES as Nick heads to the bar, glances at his 
    watch, double-takes when he realizes it s stopped.  He pulls 
    it off, winds it.  It won t start again.  Broken.  He goes to 
    pocket it, then turns it over, stares at the engraving he 
    knows is on the back:   Comitto, B.B. 

    EXT. CHICAGO RIVER -- NIGHT

    On the dark surface of the water, not far from where Nick and 
    Maureen dumped the body, something has risen to the surface. 
    PUSH IN... a HANDKERCHIEF, monogrammed... B.B.

    Across town at the Playboy Mansion, the SONG ENDS with a POW.
