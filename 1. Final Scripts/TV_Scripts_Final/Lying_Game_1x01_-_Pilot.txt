                                          TEASER

      EXT. VEGAS DESERT TRAIL - DAY

      Worn-out running shoes pad over a dusty trail on the 
      outskirts of Las Vegas.  The shoes belong to EMMA BECKER, 
      17, a natural beauty whose auburn ponytail bounces with 
      each confident stride.  

      Emma veers into a neighborhood of depressingly small 
      houses, turns down a driveway to her sagging home.

      INT. EMMA S FOSTER HOME - DAY

      Emma crosses down a hallway off the faded living room.

      INT. EMMA S BEDROOM - NEARLY CONTINUOUS

      ... Emma kicks off her shoes, starts to slip out of her 
      top... when she notices TRAVIS BOYLE, 19, her pea-eyed 
      foster brother, leering at her through an open window.

                                        TRAVIS
                      Hey,  sis.  Good run?

                                        EMMA
                      I m not your sister.

                                        TRAVIS
                      Okay, foster sister...  Like that 
                      better, anyway.  So many more 
                        possibilities.  

                                        EMMA
                      You are such a perv.

                                        TRAVIS
                      And you so read things into what I say.  

      Emma reaches to close the blinds.

                                        EMMA
                      I don t think so.  Now if you don t 
                      mind...

                                        TRAVIS
                      Only if you close those blinds.

      Emma BANGS the window shut, yanks the blinds, blotting out 
      Travis s toothy grin.  Emma falls back on her bed, gazing                                                                                       2.


      up at the ceiling.  She s painted the ceiling in dayglow 
      stars, the only decoration in an otherwise drab bedroom.  

      A sudden PINGING causes Emma to bolt up.  She opens her 
      laptop, immediately linked to Skype.  A face APPEARS on her 
      SCREEN -- a face identical to Emma s.  This is SUTTON 
      MERCER, 17, Emma s newly-discovered twin sister.  Sutton is  
      sitting in her upscale Phoenix bedroom. 

                                        SUTTON
                      There you are.  We just got back... 

                                        EMMA
                      Wait.  Let me look at you.

      Emma drinks in Sutton.  Sutton does the same.  Like looking 
      in a mirror.

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      It still... amazes me...

                                        SUTTON
                      Even after two months?

                                        EMMA
                      You know I can t wait for it to be face-
                      to-face.

                                        SUTTON
                      Me, too...

                                        EMMA
                      So now that you re back home...  

                                        SUTTON
                      Emma, you know I want us to be 
                      together.  But you get why we have to 
                      wait...

                                        EMMA
                      You re searching for our real parents. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Which means being careful with my 
                      adopted ones...    

      Emma looks off, hesitating.  Sutton twin-senses there s 
      something on her mind.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      What?                                                                                        3.


                                        EMMA
                      It s just -- the people who adopted you 
                      -- they sound pretty cool.  I mean, 
                      they must love you...

                                        SUTTON
                      Then why did they lie to me?

      Sutton, noticeably disturbed, has leaned back.

                                        EMMA
                      Maybe they want to protect you. 

                                        SUTTON
                                (flaring)
                      They re protecting themselves, okay? 

      Sutton suddenly gets up, paces away.  Emma can t see her.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT'D)
                      Sure, on the surface, they gave me this 
                      perfect life, and it s been great...  
                      But now I find out most of it was just 
                        a cover-up... 

      Sutton returns to the WEBCAM, switches on a warm smile.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      But, hey, I m back on it now.  Won t be 
                      long, I promise.  

      Sutton smiles.  Emma returns an identical one.

                                        EMMA
                      Well, like I always say,  hope is 
                      grief s best music. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Wow, Emma, that s brilliant.  You 
                      really got the smart half of the 
                      embryo, didn t you?  

                                        EMMA
                      Actually, it s stolen from a book.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah, well, so when we do get together -
                      - guess who s going to do my homework 
                      for me?

      Both laugh an identical laugh, interrupted when Emma s door 
      FLIES OPEN!                                                                                        4.


      Travis is standing there, hoping he s walked in on 
         something. 

                                        TRAVIS
                      Who you talking to?

                                        EMMA
                      None of your business.  

      Emma SLAMS her laptop shut... as we... 

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. EMMA S FOSTER HOME - GARAGE AND ALLEY - EVENING

      ... Emma smashes a tennis ball against a blistered garage 
      door.  She s so focused on her shots, she doesn t see 
      Travis sitting down on a stoop to watch her.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      Kind of a waste of time, isn t it?

      Emma doesn t look back.  

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      Your school doesn t even have a tennis 
                      team.  And even if it did...

      Emma misses a shot, the ball bouncing to Travis.  He 
      catches it in his fist, proffers it to Emma. 

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      What s the idea -- bash it hard enough, 
                      you escape your messed up life?

      Emma grabs for the ball, but Travis seizes her wrist with 
      his free hand.  He yanks her closer, hoping to kiss her...  
      Emma pushes him back with such ferocity even Travis is 
      surprised.  

                                        EMMA
                      Don t touch me.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      Why not?  Emma, you need to, like, 
                      accept your situation here.  In my 
                      mind...

      Travis starts to advance.  Emma explodes --

                                        EMMA
                      You don t have a mind, okay?  There s 
                        five-and-a-half inches between your 
                      ears and it s basically empty...  So 
                      just stay the hell away from me, okay?

      From inside the house --

                                        CLARICE (O.S.)
                      Emma!  Travis!  Get in here!  

      SLAM TO --                                                                                      6.


      INT. MERCER HOME - FOYER - EVENING

      DOORBELL RINGS... and we find LAUREL MERCER, 16, racing for 
      the front door across this marble-decked foyer.  Laurel, 
      Sutton s sister, is all sassy spunk and sarcasm.  She opens 
      the door to handsome-sexy-confident LUKE COBURN, 17.  Luke 
      has always been the boy all the girls crush on.

                                        LUKE
                      Hey, Laurel, welcome home.  Sutton 
                      here?

      Laurel puts on a faux serious face --

                                        LAUREL
                      Luke, I m afraid I have bad news.  
                      Sutton was killed in a tragic boating 
                      accident off Bora Bora, making me the 
                      last available Mercer female.  

      KRISTIN MERCER, 40s, races into the foyer, having heard --

                                        KRISTIN
                      Laurel, stop!  Luke, don t listen to 
                      her...

                                        LUKE
                      Wouldn t think of it, Mrs. Mercer.  
                      Welcome home.  How was the South 
                      Pacific?   

                                        KRISTIN
                      Wonderful time, but glad to be back.
                                (then)
                      Do you believe Sutton turned me down 
                      for our girls night out...?

                                        LUKE
                      Thought you guys had a tradition.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      So did I.

      Sutton is hurrying in on this --

                                        SUTTON
                      Don t start, Mom.  Hey, Luke...

      Sutton gives Luke a quick kiss.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                              (to Kristin)
                      People grow out of things, Mom.  Why 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                      7.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      don t you take Laurel -- she s been 
                      screaming to go for years.

                                        LAUREL
                      This is true.  Besides, I m sure Sutton 
                      and Luke have a lot of, you know...
                              (airs  quote marks )
                      ...  catching up  to do...

      Laurel quickly spins from Sutton s look-that-could-kill, 
      passing entering TED MERCER, 40s, on her way out.  Ted s a 
      plastic surgeon.  Handsome, athletic, very confident.  

                                        TED
                      Hey, Luke.  Good summer?

                                        LUKE
                      Pretty boring without Sutton around.

                                        SUTTON
                                (quickly)
                      I m out of here.  Char s got a  welcome 
                      home  thing going for me.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Everything unpacked?

      ... BANG, the door closes behind Sutton and Luke.  Ted 
      turns to Kristin.    

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      My mistake.  Discussing things in front 
                      of the boyfriend.  
                                (then)
                      I was just so hoping the trip, getting 
                      away...

                                        TED
                      Daughters pull away from their mothers.  
                      It s a natural part of growing up.

                                        KRISTIN
                      No.  It started when we lied to her.  
                      That s when she pulled away... 

      Real fear in Kristin s voice.  Ted eases Kristin into a 
      warm embrace.

                      We did the right thing.  Never doubt 
                      that.

      believe him.

      EXT. MERCER HOME - EVENING

      Sutton and Luke cross to Luke s Mustang, parked just inside 
      the ornate gates.  Luke suddenly sweeps her into a steamy 
      kiss.  When they come up for air --

                                        LUKE
                      I missed you.

                                        SUTTON
                      Me, too.

                                        LUKE
                      Really?  I barely heard from you.

                                        SUTTON
                      Sorry.  We were crazy busy, and I got 
                      distracted.

                                        LUKE
                      But even before you left... you were 
                      acting weird.

      Sutton stares at Luke a moment, then looks away --

                                        SUTTON
                      Look, it s something I ve got to work 
                      out on my own.  You get that, right?

                                        LUKE
                      Guess I have to. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Thanks.  

      Sutton leans in, tenderly kisses him.

                      So if it s okay -- right now, I need a 
                      girlfriend fix.  See you tomorrow?

      Sutton is already hurrying off toward her BMW, leaving Luke 
      a bit unsettled.

      INT. EMMA S FOSTER HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

        Blackjack-dealer foster mother, CLARICE BOYLE, 52, is 
      shaking a hollowed-out book at Emma and Travis.                                                                                        9.


                                        CLARICE
                      ... Five hundred dollars, including a 
                      hundred dollar tip signed by none other 
                      than Mister Bruce Willis himself...  
                      Now who got into my kitty?

                                        TRAVIS
                      Ma, I didn t even know you had a kitty.

                                        CLARICE
                      Emma?

      Emma hesitates.  It s as though she knows what s coming.  

                                        EMMA
                      Travis took it.  He stole your money.  
                      I saw him do it.

                                        TRAVIS
                      I got my own job, what would I need 
                      with Mom s tip money?

                                        EMMA
                      I dunno.  Buy more pot.  He s been 
                      coming on to me every chance he gets...   

      Clarice hasn t even looked at Travis.  

                                        CLARICE
                      Emma... I took you in... when no one 
                      else would have you...  

                                        EMMA
                      You took me in because the state of 
                      Nevada pays you...

                                        TRAVIS
                      Check her backpack.  Go on, look...

                                        CLARICE
                      Think I will...

      Clarice grabs the backpack, rummages, comes out with a wad 
      of bills.  She unfurls a particular c-note.

                                        CLARICE (CONT D)
                       To my lucky penny, Clarice.  Love, 
                      Bruce Willis. 

      Emma thrusts a finger toward Travis.

                                        EMMA
                      He did this.  He set me up.                                                                                      10.


                                        CLARICE
                      Social Services said if anything like 
                      this happened, I m supposed to call the 
                      cops... and that s just what I m going 
                      to do.  Watch her, Travis.

      Clarice heads for the kitchen phone.  Emma, worried, spins 
      away from Travis s smug smile...

      EXT. CHAMBERLIN ESTATE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

      ... Sutton is hugging CHARLOTTE  CHAR  CHAMBERLIN, 17.  No 
      one is as cheery and perky as Char unless they re hiding 
      deep pain somewhere.  It s certainly not in this palatial 
      back yard.  Sweeping lawn.  Pool.  Glowing fire pit.   

                                        CHAR
                      ... Love it!  The dress, the hair...  
                      Good old Sutton.  We barely survived 
                      without you, right, Mads?

      MADELINE  MADS  VEGA, 17, is approaching.  Mads carries a 
      definite  anti  air about her.  Nearly-retro.  Too cool to 
      gush about anything.

                                        MADS
                      Somehow we managed...

                                        CHAR
                      We just missed having our -- what did 
                      you call it, Mads?

                                        MADS
                      Our  oracle. 

                                        SUTTON
                      I m sure you guys did great without me.  
                      How s your mom, Char?

                                        CHAR
                      Oh, great.  Out of rehab.  Getting lots 
                      of sleep.

      Sutton sees right through Char s perky, upbeat smile --

                                        SUTTON
                      No change, in other words.  

                                        CHAR
                      See for yourself.  

      Char indicates a window high up in the mansion -- where 
      PHYLLIS CHAMBERLIN, 50, stands, looking down on them.  A 
      wisp of a silhouette and not much more.                                                                                    11.

                      She s not really looking at us.  She 
                      just stares.  I have no idea at what...
                                (quickly)
                      But hey, I am not going to let it get 
                      me down.  School s about to start, 
                      Sutton s back, all s right with the 
                      world.

                                        SUTTON
                              (to Mads)
                      How s Thayer doing?  You talk to him, 
                      right?  

                                        MADS
                        Occasionally.  What about you?

                                        SUTTON
                      Same.  He seems to like L.A.

                                        MADS
                      Yeah.  Time with our mom...  Weird 
                      being the only kid now... I mean, with 
                      my dad...

                                        CHAR
                      Well, freaks me out Thayer would just 
                      leave like that.  I mean, I get that he 
                      wants to be with your mom.  But you and 
                      your brother were so close, Mads.  And 
                      Sutton... you three were like the 
                        Mouseketeers.  

                                        SUTTON
                      I think you mean  Musketeers. 

                                        MADS
                      No.  She means  Mouseketeers. 

      A VOICE calls to Char from inside.  It could be her mother 
      or someone else...  

                                        CHAR
                      Great.  Be right back.

      Char hurries off toward the house.  Mads has pulled a PHOTO 
      STRIP out of her jeans pocket.  

                                        MADS
                      Thayer left this in a drawer.

      It s a succession of FRAMES taken several months ago -- 
      THAYER VEGA, 18, with Mads and Sutton mugging in one of                                                                                     12.


      those photo booths.  The girls are laughing it up, but 
      there s a sadness in Thayer s eyes.

                      So I gotta ask... you and Thayer were 
                      never more than just friends, right?

                                        SUTTON
                      Please.  He s your brother.  He s like 
                      my brother.

                                        MADS
                      Sorry.  Just curious.  Hey... I m 
                      really glad you re back, Sutton.  
                      Char s right -- summer sucked without 
                      you.

      Sutton returns her warm smile.  WIPE TO --

      EXT. EMMA S FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

      ... HEADLIGHTS sweep into the front driveway.  A Vegas 
      Police Cruiser is arriving.  A  Juvenile Division  decal is 
      just below the county seal.  Clarice trundles out to the

      Travis has the drapes pushed back, looking out the front 
      window.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      That didn t take long.

      Travis turns.  Emma is standing there, hands behind her.

                      action, I can make those cops go 
                      away...

      He slides a hand down her arm... moves closer...

                      I mean, aren t you getting kind of 
                      close to three strikes?                                                                                    13.


      Emma swings the tennis racket out from behind her back!  
      She hits him hard in the face, sending him reeling...

                      Bitch...   

      He lunges for her, but she swings the racket baseball-
      style, smashing him in the mouth.  He SCREAMS in pain, 
      falling into an end table, knocking over a lamp... plunging 
      the room in darkness.  Travis, bleeding badly, groans in 
      pain... as the door flies open and the officers burst in...

      ... Emma, backpack in hand, flies out through the back 
      slider, vaulting the gate, racing down a back alley.  She 
      can see FLASHLIGHTS and HEAR the cops trying to chase... 

      STAY WITH Emma as she jumps a wall, landing in a vacant 
      lot.  She weaves through tumbleweeds, finds a dumpster to 
      hide behind -- just as red-and-blue POLICE FLASHERS light 
      up the alley.  

      A SPOTLIGHT narrowly misses Emma.  She waits until its 
      clear, then runs off... enveloped in inky darkness.

      Meanwhile, Sutton s PHONE has TONED.  She checks it.

      Sutton slips off across the back lawn.  Char looks at Mads.

                                        CHAR
                      Sounds like family stuff.

      Mads is thinking of her own life --

                                        MADS
                      It s always family stuff.  

      ACROSS LAWN, NEAR POOLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Sutton s just answered the phone.  She keeps her voice low. 

                                        SUTTON
                              (into phone)
                      Emma?  What s up?

      INTERCUT TWO-WAY with Emma outside a Vegas bus station.

                                        EMMA
                      I m coming to Phoenix.  Tonight.  
                      There s an all-night bus.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Whoa.  Back up.

                                        EMMA
                      My pervy foster brother set me up.  He 
                      said I was stealing and... look, I m in 
                      a really bad situation here...  

      Sutton glances around, then slips into --

      INT. POOL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                        EMMA
                      Sutton?  Sutton, you still there?                                                                                    15.


      Sutton paces in the dark pool house.

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah.  Just thinking.

                                        EMMA
                      I know you don t want to spring this on 
                      your adopted family...

                                        SUTTON
                      No, it s okay.  We ll work it out. 
                                (beat)
                      What time does your bus get in?

                                        EMMA
                      Eight-fifty AM.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Okay.  I ll meet you at the station.

      Relief washes over Emma.  A bus COUGHS EXHAUST across the 
      lot.  Her bus.  A nearby TRANSIT OFFICER makes her nervous.

                                        EMMA
                      Gotta go.  

      And Emma mad-dashes for the bus.  

      BACK TO -- Sutton hears the LINE GO DEAD.  Door to the pool 
      house suddenly BURSTS OPEN!  Sutton spins and squints into 
      a BLINDING FLASHLIGHT.  MATCH CUT TO --

      INT. GREYHOUSE BUS - SCOTTSDALE - NEXT MORNING

      ... BRIGHT SUNLIGHT in Emma s eyes, waking her.  She 
      squints at a passing highway sign:  NOW ENTERING PHOENIX, 
      ARIZONA.  

      EXT. PHOENIX BUS STATION - DAY

      The Greyhound pulls into a slot.  Emma is one of the first 
      off the bus.  No sign of Sutton.  Emma crosses toward the 
      depot.  She d go inside, but SEES a TRANSIT COP inside the 
      door.  She subtly eases off in the other direction (just in 
      case the guy is looking for her -- which he isn t).  
      Suddenly, a mysterious hand grabs her and pulls her into --

      PUBLIC RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Emma realizes it was Sutton who grabbed her.  They stand 
      for a moment, looking at each other in amazement. 

                                        EMMA
                      It s you.                                                                                    16.


                                        SUTTON
                      It s me.  In the flesh.  

                                        EMMA
                      On the computer, it never felt... real, 
                      you know?

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah.  If I hadn t always had that 
                      feeling... someone else was out there.

                                        EMMA
                      God, everything about us... it s the 
                      same.  Hair, eyes...

                                        SUTTON
                      And sizes, looks like.  

      Sutton suddenly wedges a mop under the restroom s door 
      handle, jamming it closed.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      We don t have a lot of time.

                                        EMMA
                      What do you mean -- for what?

                                        SUTTON
                      I can t go into detail.  But last 
                      night, after you called, I got a lead -- 
                      on our real parents.

                                        EMMA
                      You found them?

                                        SUTTON
                      I don t know.  There ve been a lot of 
                      dead-ends till now.  But here s the 
                      problem -- this lead, it leads to Los 
                      Angeles.  

                                        EMMA
                      I don t get it.  You want me to go to 
                      L.A.?

                                        SUTTON
                      No.  I m going to L.A.  You re going to 
                      stay here.  

      Sutton strips off her jacket, slips off her t-shirt.                                                                                    17.


                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      We ll change clothes.  And I m prepared 
                      for the hair.  Yours is longer, it 
                      looks like.  

                                        EMMA
                      You want me to take your place?

      Sutton now helps Emma off with her jacket, t-shirt.

                                        SUTTON
                      Two days.  Just hang out, kick back and 
                      enjoy.  You said you envy everything 
                      I ve got...

                                        EMMA
                      I never really said  envy... 

                                        SUTTON
                      You didn t have to.

      Sutton slips her t-shirt over Emma s head.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      It s going to be easy.  Like I told you 
                      this summer -- my sister s totally 
                      annoying and my parents lied to me.  
                      Anything else you need to know about me 
                      is on Facebook.  Oh, and take this...
                                (hands over her 
                                iphone)
                      The key to  me  -- my phone.  

                                        EMMA
                      I have so wanted one of these.  Okay -- 
                      that was envy.

      Sutton, meanwhile, has pulled out some scissors.

                                        SUTTON
                      I m thinking about three inches off the 
                      ponytail.  Oh, and I do this flip 
                      thing...  

      Sutton demonstrates, flipping her hair back.  Then she 
      begins to shore away at Emma s locks...

                                        EMMA
                      I don t even know your address...

                                        SUTTON
                      My BMW s in the parking lot.  Nav 
                      system has my address.  Push pre-set 
                       one,  she ll take you right home.                                                                                      18.


      Emma and Sutton s eyes meet in the mirror.

                                        EMMA
                      So I just... be you.

                                        SUTTON
                      And don t say anything to anyone.

      Sudden BANGING on the door -- someone wants to get in!

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                                (toward door)
                      One second!
                                (then, to Emma)
                      What better place to hide out?  You re 
                      a smart girl, you ll do great.  

      Sutton tosses her the BMW key.  

                                        EMMA
                      If I had even a day with you... to 
                      study up... practice...

                                        SUTTON
                      This L.A. thing can t wait.  Oh!  The 
                      boyfriend sitch.  It s a little 
                        complicated...  

      BANG, BANG, BANG!  

                                        TRANSIT COP (O.C.)
                      Transit Authority!  Open this door!

      The mop against the handle begins to give way...

                                        EMMA
                      Oh crap.  Cops.

      Sutton has interlocked her fingers, creating a step... so 
      Emma can reach a window.  As Emma starts to climb up...

                                        SUTTON
                      I ll be back in two days with amazing 
                      news.  We ll meet at the lake house.
                              (to her confusion)
                      Pre-set  four  on the nav system.  Ten 
                      PM.  Two days only.  I promise.

      Door CRASHES open!  But Emma is already out the window.  
      The transit cop fills the doorway.  Sutton puts her hands 
      on her hips.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      Dude... a little privacy?                                                                                    19.


      EXT. PHOENIX BUS STATION PARKING LOT - NEARLY CONTINUOUS

      Emma gulps at the full lot of cars.  She hits the remote.  
      A silver convertible BMW s alarm SQUEAKS, headlights FLASH, 
      signaling its location.  Emma looks back at the bus 
      station, mulls for only a moment, then jumps over the door 
      and into the driver s seat.

      Wheels SQUEAL and the BMW rockets off toward Emma s new 
      life... as Sutton.  

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. SCOTTSDALE - CAMELBACK ROAD - DAY

      Emma is loving Sutton s wheels and the sights, as 
      Scottsdale, in all its opulence, whizzes past.  Truly a 
      place untouched by the recession.    

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      In six hundred feet, turn right...

      Emma, hair blowing, cranks the wheel...

      EXT. MERCER HOME - FRONT CIRCLE - DAY

      Emma eases the convertible to a stop in the circular drive.

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      ... You have arrived.

      Emma, gulping, takes in the sprawling house and grounds.

                                        EMMA
                      Oh my God.

      EXT. MERCER FRONT DOOR - NEARLY CONTINUOUS

      Emma s finger pauses over the doorbell.  She quickly 
      withdraws it.  Instead, she gingerly reaches for the brass 
      door handle.

      INT. MERCER HOME - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      Emma steps inside the marble foyer.  A far cry from Vegas.  
      A far cry from anywhere she s lived.  Kristin Mercer -- 
      Sutton s mom -- is passing through with an enormous potted 
      plant.  She can barely see through the thick fronds.

                                        KRISTIN
                      There you are.  Sure got home late last 
                      night.  Then out again first thing this 
                      morning...
                                (teetering suddenly)
                      Whoa...

                                        EMMA
                      Here, I ve got it...

      Emma rescues the pot from Kristin.  Kristin looks at Emma, 
      a little surprised..  Emma looks away nervously.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      Where should I put it?                                                                                    21.


                                        KRISTIN
                      Living room, where it always goes.  
                      Thank you, Sutton.

      Emma descends a pair of steps into the living room.  A 
      matching pot is her best clue as to where to put this pot.  

      Laurel is lying on a couch in a window nook, skimming a 
      teen rag on her ipad.  

                                        EMMA
                              (to Kristin)
                      Sorry about this morning.  I had some 
                      stuff to do.

                                        LAUREL
                      What -- pawning Grandma s necklace?

      This is the first time Emma sees her  sister,  Laurel.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Sutton?  Oh my God, where is it?  I 
                      don t think I ve ever seen you without 
                      it.

      Emma s hand instinctively goes to her throat.

                      Luke probably took it off last night, 
                      so he could give you a proper  welcome 
                      home hickey.   By the way, Mads asked 
                      me to swim with you guys.  She can t 
                      wait to see our new bikinis.  Don t 
                      suppose I can have a ride.

      Laurel is expecting a summary  no,  shocked when --

                                        EMMA
                      Sure, I guess.

                      Cool.

                              (to Kristin)
                      Look, I m sure I ll find the necklace.

                                        KRISTIN
                      I hope so.  Something ever happens to 
                      it, your grandmother will be 
                      devastated.

      Ted Mercer, Sutton s dad, is coming through, on his way to 
      the golf course.  Emma takes a long look at Ted as he 
      collects his keys.

                                        TED (CONT D)
                      Anyone going by the dry cleaner s?  
                      I ve got a bag of shirts from the trip.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Might have to wait till Monday.  Unless 
                      Sutton... on your way...

      Kristin is anticipating rejection, but instead gets --

                                        EMMA
                      Sure.  No problem.

                      Oh my God.  That s twice.   Sutton 
                      pitching in. 

                                        KRISTIN
                      Laurel... leave her alone...

      Emma meets Kristin s warm smile with a smile of her own.  
      She instantly likes this woman -- the mother she might have 
      had.

                                        EMMA
                      Is there... anything else I can do?

      Ted puts down the mail he s been going through.

                                        TED
                      Okay, that s it.  Who are you and what 
                      have you done with my daughter?

      Emma s jaw goes slack, but everyone s CHUCKLE overtakes her 
      panic, and she opts just to smile along.

      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - A MINUTE LATER

      ... Emma closes the door behind her, leans her head back 
      against the Lady Gaga poster hanging there.  When she opens 
      her eyes, she takes in Sutton s room, remembering it from 
      the webcam tour.  Sutton s MacBook is on the desk.  Emma 
      touches it as if it s the Holy Grail.  She opens it, 
      Sutton s Facebook POPPING UP on the SCREEN.  She SCROLLS 
      recent comments...  Swimming at my house.  Don t be late.  
      Wear that bikini.  Emma turns, sees a string bikini on a 
      hangar by the closet.  She holds it up to herself in the 
      mirror.  Gulps.  Timid KNOCK at the door, then Kristin, 
      watering can in hand, nervously enters.                                                                                    23.

                      They barely watered while we were away.  
                      Okay if I get yours?

                                        EMMA
                      Sure.

      Kristin suddenly turns to Emma.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Last night with Luke, I shouldn t have 
                      pulled him in that way...  I was really 
                      looking forward to us having our girls-
                        night-out...  This summer, I was so 
                      hoping you and I could get back what 
                      we d lost...  Maybe now that we re 
                      home...   

                                        EMMA
                      I ll go...

      Emma realizes she s straying from Sutton s playbook --

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      I mean, if it means that much to you...

                                        KRISTIN
                      Everything.  It means everything.

      Emma nods, smiles.  Kristin s eyes grow misty.  Laurel, in 
      a cover-up, bursts in.

                                        LAUREL
                      We better get going.  If you re still 
                      taking me...

      Emma turns back to Kristin.  Kristin smiles, waves her off.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Go.  Have a good time.

      EXT. MERCER HOME - FRONT CIRCLE - DAY

      Laurel and Emma are heading to the car.

                                        LAUREL
                      ... So I just heard I made cheer team.  
                      Char and I are  flyers.   I know she s 
                      like one of your best friends, so 
                      you re going to be pissed... Get it

      Emma suddenly tosses Laurel the keys.

                                        EMMA
                      You drive.

                      know the way to Char s house...

      Because obviously Emma doesn t.

                      I know I probably said I d never let 
                      you drive my car...

      Laurel holds up a hand before Emma can say anything.

                                        LAUREL
                      Actually, you said  never sit in it.   
                      But not arguing.  Not saying a word.  

      EXT. VEGA BACKYARD - DAY

      SPLASH!  Luke, Sutton s boyfriend, dives into the pool, 
      swims underwater, breaking the surface with great finesse.  
      He sees Laurel s just arrived.

                                        LUKE
                      Laurel...  Where s Sutton?

      Mads is in a lounge chair next to Char.

                                        MADS
                      Right over there.

      Emma is coming outside, a cover-up over her bikini.  She 
      can t hide a tad of embarrassment.  

                                        CHAR
                      Come on, let s see it.  Show us the

                      No time for  modesty. 

      Emma lets the cover-up drop as Luke hops out of the pool.

                                        CHAR
                      Whoa, girl.  I was expecting a Bora 
                      Bora tan?                                                                                    25.

                              (to Sutton)
                      You look great.

      Luke takes hold of Emma, dragging her, SCREAMING, into the 
      pool!  

      When they come up for air, Emma gets her first real look at 
      Luke.  It s nearly love at first sight.  Her knees go weak, 
      but at least they re underwater.  Until this moment, Emma 
      has only dreamed about guys like this.

                                        LUKE (CONT D)

                      You had a good summer?

                      Right.  Last night.

                      I ve been  a little worried, actually.  
                      You kind of left me standing there.

                                        EMMA
                      Well... I ve been a little distracted.

                                        LUKE
                      I know.  That s what you said last 
                      night.  

                                        EMMA
                      See that?  I m so distracted -- I 
                      forgot I said that.  

      Luke smiles, kisses her, then whispers in her ear --

                                        LUKE
                      You need sunscreen.  

      Luke dips below the surface, swims away.  Meanwhile, from 
      the lounge chairs --

        What was that?What did he say?

                      Right where it s always been.  

      INT. VEGA HOME - DAY

      Emma, alone, steps into the coldly modern house from the 
      patio.  Very masculine environs.  She heads for where she 
      thinks the bathroom might be.                                                                                      28.


        HALLWAY/THAYER S ROOM

      Emma, on her way to the bathroom, pauses at an open door.  
      A bedroom.  A boy s bedroom.  Thayer s bedroom.  PHOTOS 
      cover his ego wall.  Champion Little League player, high 
      school track team.  Trophies and certificates and a 
      bulletin board of SNAPSHOTS.  His hair is longer, wavy... 
      very different from Luke s...  A SHOT of Sutton and Thayer 
      seems to capture Emma s attention.  From the doorway, the 
      smooth VOICE of ALEC VEGA, 44, Mads and Thayer s divorced 
      dad --

                                        ALEC (O.S.)
                      Been over two months...

      Emma turns to this brooding, but handsome divorced man.  
      There s a sheen to his ivory locks.

                                        ALEC (CONT D)
                      ... Feels like he was just here.

      Emma nods, silent as Alec moves around the room.

                                        ALEC (CONT D)
                      You were like a second sister to him, 
                      Sutton.

                                        EMMA
                      I don t know about that.

                                        ALEC
                      I do.
                                (then)
                      When he left, he said he d call.  He 
                      calls Madeline, but not me.  Does he 
                      call you, Sutton?  

                                        EMMA
                      A few times.  When I was away.  He 
                      seemed okay. 

      Alec stares at her.   

                                        ALEC
                      Sutton, why do I feel like you re not 
                      telling the truth?

                                        EMMA
                      I don t know... I...

      Mads is suddenly bolting into the room.

                                        MADS
                      Hey -- what s going on?                                                                                    29.


                                        ALEC
                      Just what I was wondering.  

      As a volley of looks pass between Mads, Alec, and Emma...  

      INT. VEGA BATHROOM/VIEW OUTSIDE - DAY

      ... Emma locks the bathroom door once she s inside.  
      There s a small window LOOKING OUT on the backyard.  

      Emma can SEE into the patio area where Mads, Char, Laurel, 
      Luke, Nisha, and now GARRETT MATHEWS, 17, are gathered.  
      Garrett has that edgy  bad boy  vibe, a healthy dose of 
       urban  in the  suburban.  

      OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

      ... Luke and Garrett are faced off.  

                                        LUKE
                      Just go.  No one wants you here.

                                        GARRETT
                      Is this your house... your party?  

                                        MADS
                      Guys, come on...  Garrett, you really 
                      need to go...  Sutton doesn t want to 
                      see you.  I doubt she even wants to 
                      talk to you...  

                                        GARRETT
                      You know this for a fact?

                                        LUKE
                      Yeah, we do.

      Garrett gives them a look, nods darkly, then starts off...

      INSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ... Emma watches as Garrett stops at the gate.  He looks 
      back toward the house and Emma could swear he s looking 
      right at her.

                                        LAUREL (V.O.)
                                (PRE-LAP)
                      That Garrett dude gives me the creeps.  

      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Laurel is painting her nails on the bed, while Emma stares 
      at Sutton s computer SCREEN... one fuzzy PHOTO of Garrett 
      taken the year before...                                                                                    30.


                                        LAUREL
                      ... The way he always just shows up out 
                      of nowhere.  And that stare...  He s 
                      like those homeless dudes in the park.  

      Emma shuts off the computer, gazes at the wall.

                                        EMMA
                      Have Mom and Dad ever talked about my 
                      adoption?

      Laurel looks up from her toes.  

                                        LAUREL
                      You re kidding, right?

                                        EMMA
                      ... I mean, anything more than what 
                      they always say.

                                        LAUREL
                      Right... that they  chose  you and that 
                      makes you special.  Me -- the big 
                      surprise -- comes along like seven 
                      months later to nibble on the scraps.

       Emma stares at her a moment, ingesting this information.

                                        EMMA
                      I just think... our parents aren t 
                      telling us everything.

                                        LAUREL
                      Of course they re not.  They re 
                      parents.

      Laurel swings her finished toes and feet off the bed.

                                        LAUREL (CONT D)
                      I m getting a distinct sense of deja 
                      vu.  
                              (off Emma s look)
                      That conversation on the plane home...  
                      You asked,  Who has a child and just 
                      gives it away? 
                                (beat)
                      Obviously you were talking about who 
                      gave you up.

                                        EMMA
                      I m sure I was.

      Laurel frog-walks toward the door...                                                                                    31.


                                        LAUREL
                      Well I d imagine it was someone who 
                      could see into the future, and knew 
                      what a nightmare you d turn into...

                                        EMMA
                      Snap.

      Meanwhile, a phone is TONING.  

                                        LAUREL
                      Changed your ringtone.  I like it.  

      Laurel goes into her room, closes the door.  Emma spins to 
      Sutton s iphone -- it s silent.  Emma realizes it s her 
      phone.  She retrieves it from a drawer.

                                        EMMA
                              (into phone)
                      Sutton?

                                        TRAVIS (O.C.)
                      No.  It s your  brother,  Travis.

      INTERCUT TWO-WAY -- Travis is on the back patio of Emma s 
      old foster home.  His face is a puffy, purple mess.   

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      You re really in some trouble around 
                      here...  Ma s pushing the assault 
                      charge.  Not smart running the way you 
                      did.   Cops took like a million 
                      pictures of my face...  And who the 
                      hell is Sutton?  

                                        EMMA
                      None of your business.

                                        TRAVIS
                      Maybe not, but I heard they re talking 
                      real jail time, Emma...  

      Emma quickly hangs up, stares at the blank computer screen.  
      Suddenly -- in the computer screen s REFLECTION -- she SEES 
      someone in the window behind her!  Emma SCREAMS!

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                      ACT THREE

      EXT. MERCER HOME - BACK YARD - SAME NIGHT

      Ted Mercer is SHINING his FLASHLIGHT around the Mercer 
      backyard.  Emma watches nervously from just behind him.  

                                        EMMA
                      Anyone there?

                                        TED
                      Doesn t look like it.  You re sure you 
                      saw someone?

                                        EMMA
                      A... a guy, I think...

                                        TED
                      But you didn t get a look at his face.

                                        EMMA
                      No...  It was so fast.

      OTHER SIDE OF MERCER WALL

      Garrett Mathews, the obvious intruder, has dropped into 
      some bushes on the street-side of the wall.  He leans his 
      head back against the stucco.

      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - A BEAT LATER

      ... Ted closes the slider behind Emma as they come back 
      inside.  He snaps the lock into place.

                                        TED
                      You okay?

                                        EMMA
                      Yeah.  I m fine.  Maybe I imagined it.

                                        TED
                      I was kind of talking in general.  
                      You ve been different since we got 
                      home.

                                        EMMA
                      So everyone keeps telling me.

                                        TED
                      Well, if it matters or not -- I like 
                      it.

                                        EMMA
                      You do?                                                                                    33.


                                        TED
                      And your mom is actually kind of 
                      hopeful.

      Emma studies this stranger who thinks he s her father.  

                                        TED (CONT D)
                      It s nice to know we have each other... 
                      to rely on.  God, how  Brady Bunch  was 
                      that?

                                        EMMA
                      I loved that show.

                                        TED
                      You hated it.

                                        EMMA
                      Hey.  I m allowed to change my mind -- 
                      I m a teenager.

      Ted smiles.  Emma smiles back.  

                                        TED
                      But you know what I mean, right?  A 
                      family s a great thing.

                                        EMMA
                      ... What I ve wanted my whole life.

      The irony lingers -- as well as the moment -- as Ted starts 
      to the door, turns back --  

                                        TED
                      When you were a kid... right about now 
                      you d ask for a hug.

                                        EMMA
                      So am I too old... now?

      Ted smiles and crosses back to embrace her warmly.  Emma 
      closes her eyes against his broad shoulder, makes sure he 
      doesn t see the tear in her eye when they part.

                                        TED
                      Good night, honey.  Sleep tight.

      Ted goes out into --

      HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      A little stunned, Ted looks back at the closed door...                                                                                     34.


      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

      THUNK!  A pillow hits Emma.  She rolls over, the FACE in 
      front of her COMING INTO FOCUS -- it s Laurel in her 
      cheerleader outfit.  

                                        LAUREL
                      First day of school -- I ve got to wear 
                      this, but the whole school s going to 
                      be dying to see what Sutton Mercer is 
                      wearing.   Little curious, myself.  
                      Better hurry.

      Laurel bolts out of the room.  Emma jumps up, throws open 
      the closet, gazes on rack upon rack of trendy threads.    

                                        EMMA
                      You said this would be fun, Sutton...
                                (slowly smiles)
                      And it finally is.

      She dives into the closet...

      Emma makes her grand entrance, and everyone -- Laurel, Ted 
      and Kristin -- turn.  Emma looks very, very Sutton.    

                                        TED
                      Can a kid get suspended for looking too 
                      good?

      Emma is already diving into a platter of eggs.  

                                        EMMA
                      These are amazing...   

      She looks over to her  family.   All are staring at her.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Last time I made you eggs, you refused 
                      to touch them.  You said,  What, you 
                      want me to get fat? 

                                        LAUREL
                      Eggs.  Strictly verbotten on the Sutton 
                       starve yourself to death diet. 

                                        EMMA
                      I guess eggs are my new tofu.  Okay if 
                      I take some bacon, too?

      Laurel gasps --                                                                                    35.

                      Don t worry -- I won t tell anyone.  
                      Obviously you need the protein for your 
                      big match with Nisha. 
                                (starts out)
                      Me?  I ve got to go purge and brush my 
                      teeth.

      Laurel ducks out.  Emma, meanwhile, pauses by a small 
      gallery of family photos on a shelf in the breakfast nook.  
      Exotic vacations.  Elaborate birthday celebrations.  All 
      the fun Sutton experienced -- and Emma didn t.  Emma lifts 
      a photo of Kristin holding Sutton as a baby.  Kristen 
      appears at her side, looks over her shoulder.

                                        KRISTIN
                      The miracle was getting you to sit 
                      still long enough to take a picture. 

                                        EMMA
                                (assuming)
                      I was a fussy baby...

                                        KRISTIN
                      Very defiant.  I used to hold you and 
                      stare into those big eyes and wonder...

      Kristin trails off.  Emma can tell she wants to say more.

                                        EMMA
                      So I don t know if I ve ever asked you 
                      this, but did you guys want just one 
                      kid, or two?  

      Kristin, taken aback, looks at who she thinks is Sutton.

                                        KRISTIN
                      I don t...

                                        EMMA
                      I mean... was I supposed to be an only 
                      child?

                                        KRISTIN
                      Yes, actually...  Your dad was an 
                      intern at UCLA...  We re in this little 
                      apartment in West L.A., no money.  One 
                      baby seemed like all we could handle. 

      Ted glances up from his paper during the ensuing silence.  
      Kristin is suddenly misty-eyed.

                                        EMMA
                      I m sorry...  I just...                                                                                    36.


                                        KRISTIN
                      It s okay.  I ll see you after practice 
                      for our night out.

      Kristin waves a hand and hurries out of the room.  Ted 
      gives Emma an uneasy smile.

                                        TED
                      She s fine.

      Ted quickly goes after Kristin.  Emma can SEE them through 
      the door into the dining room...

      EMMA S P.O.V. -- Ted holds an emotional Kristin, silently 
      caressing her back.  He whispers something in her ear, but 
      we can t hear what.

                      were adopted into some other family?

      EXT. SCOTTSDALE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

      ... Emma and Laurel have parked the BMW, heading toward the 
      modern, desert-themed high school.

                                        EMMA
                      ... All the time.

                      I think I did okay... considering the 
                        alternative.
                              (off Laurel s look)
                      I mean, if no one adopted me.

      Laurel nods, pensive a moment.

                                        LAUREL
                      Really?  Are there still orphanages?

                                        EMMA
                      No... I mean, probably not...  They ve 
                      been replaced by foster families.  I m 
                      guessing most are pretty awful... 
                                (then)
                       Least that s what I ve heard.

      Emma is looking off.  A police car is pulling up.  Garrett 
      Mathews is getting out, leaning back in to say goodbye to                                                                                     37.


      the cop driving the car, his father, DAN MATHEWS, 47, a 
      sergeant with the Scottsdale P.D.  Garrett steps away from 
      the car and his eyes catch Sutton s.  He looks away and 
      walks off toward campus.  Laurel has seen the look.  

                                        LAUREL
                      Garrett Mathews.  Most likely guy in 
                      high school to get in serous trouble... 
                      and most unlikely guy to have a father 
                      who s a cop.  
                                (looks off)
                      Later, sis.  If I don t see you -- good 
                      luck against Nisha.  

      Laurel veers off.  Emma, alone, continues on, past the 
      patrol car.  She feels Garrett s father, Dan, watching her. 
      Dan slowly drives the car along next to her, unnerving her.  

      Emma quickly turns a corner.  Out of sight of the patrol 
      car, she leans against a wall to catch her breath.  She s 
      definitely creeped by the encounter with the cop.  

      Meanwhile,  a parade  of KIDS is passing Emma. Hi, Sutton.  
      Hey, Sutton.  Looking good, Sutton!  The AD-LIBBED 
      greetings RING in Emma s head, though she still manages to 
      meet each salutation with a beatific smile.  JUMP TO --

      NEAR THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

      Mads and Char have sidled in on either side of Emma as she 
      heads into the picturesque quad area of the high school.

                                        CHAR
                      ... So out of the blue, my mom has like

      SCHOOL LOCKER AREA (OUTSIDE) - NEARLY CONTINUOUS

      ... Emma is absorbing everything Char and Mads are saying.

                                        MADS
                      The key is not to get stuck... stuck 
                      here, stuck in a rut... like our 
                      parents...  Like Thayer, when I go, I 
                      go...

      Mads and Char stop, but Emma keeps going.  When Emma 
      realizes they ve stopped, she turns back.

                                        EMMA
                      What s wrong?

                                        CHAR
                      Like, you just walked past your locker.

      Emma shrugs it off, returns to the locker between them.

                                        EMMA
                      Oh.  Wasn t thinking.

                      of your backpack.

                      I ve got to pick up my class schedule.  
                      See you guys later.

      Char continues off.  Mads and Emma spin the tumblers on 
      their locks.  Emma has to check her backpack flap.

                                        MADS
                      Do you believe it?  They ve got Char in 
                      Special Ed English.  That s got to be 
                      so embarrassing.

      Emma opens Sutton s locker.  The inside is plastered with 
      PHOTOS OF LUKE.  One is crooked, pulling on the yellowing 
      tape holding it in place.  Emma starts to refasten it.  It 
      falls off, REVEALING a PHOTO OF THAYER underneath.  He s 
      sitting in an Adirondack chair in front of a glistening 
      lake, a shack-like house behind him.                                                                                      39.

                      I don t know.  Some house by the lake.

      Mads regards Emma for a moment, then moves off.  

      ON A NEARBY WALL

      Garrett is sitting on a wall.  Emma looks over and finds 
      him staring at her.  Even though the BELL RINGS, neither 
      looks away.  Emma finds herself very unsettled.  JUMP TO --

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - NOON

      Emma s about to sit down at a lunch table.  Luke swoops in, 
      takes her arm.

                      No... I...

      He takes her by the hand, leads her to a small, shady, 
      special table.  He rips into a sandwich.  Emma is intently 
      staring at him.  He s easily the handsomest guy she s ever 
      seen.  She looks away.

                      I guess...  

      Luke is quiet a moment.                                                                                      40.

      Emma looks around.

                                        EMMA
                      How do you know that?

                      Just... stuff I ve heard.  So... are 
                      we, still a couple?  Because sometimes 
                      I think I kind of take it for 
                      granted...

      Emma stares at him.  Then --

                      Luke... I really appreciate you... and 
                      this.  I d be crazy to take it for 
                      granted.

      She drifts off before she reveals too much of Emma...  Luke 
      rescues her with a smile.

                                        LUKE
                      Come on!

      And they kiss again.                                                                                      41.


                                        LUKE
                      It s really weird, but I keep thinking 
                      there s something you re not telling 
                      me.

      Emma looks away for a second.  When she looks back, she s 
      fully Sutton again --

                                        EMMA
                      Actually, there s something you can 
                      tell me...  How the hell I m going to 
                      survive against Nisha today?

                                        LUKE
                      Stay clear of her drop shot...  and 
                      don t forget -- you re better than you 
                      think you are.

      Off Emma s growing feelings for this prince she knows 
      she ll soon have to give up...

      EXT. TENNIS COURTS - DAY

      ... as a tennis ball spins in SLOW MOTION against a dark 
      blue sky, DESCENDING to the taut strings of a racket -- 
      THUNK -- a puff of dust and the ball rockets away...

      REAL MOTION -- as we realize the ball was off Nisha s 
      racket.  It blasts past Emma, who is dressed the part, but 
      very nervous.  Can she really play at this level? 

      A female COACH is off to the side.  All the courts are 
      filled with practice rounds.

                                        COACH LEE
                      Nisha!  I said, easy.  We re working 
                      our way back, ladies.  I want nice long 
                      rallies...  Sutton!  Ready position...

      Nisha punches a slow serve to Emma, who hits it back.  
      Nisha plays with an ease and confidence that Emma meets 
      with streetwise hustle.  The rally goes on and on, Nisha 
      running Emma around the court with perfectly placed shots.

      IN THE BLEACHERS -- Luke, just coming off his own court 
      (boy s tennis practice), is impressed with Sutton s 
      determination.

      ON A DISTANT WALL -- Mysterious Garrett Mathews watches.

      ON THE TENNIS COURT -- Nisha and Emma s marathon rally is 
      drawing some attention.  A few of the players have come to 
      the fence to watch.  Nisha s barely broken a sweat, but 
      Emma is near-collapse, though far from giving up.                                                                                     42.


      Nisha draws Emma to the net with a pair of wicked drop 
      shots, then attempts to finish her off with a cross-court.  
      Emma dives for the volley, edge of the racket just tipping 
      the ball.  

      THE BALL --  in SLOW MOTION again -- dances along the edge 
      of the tape, finally falling onto Nisha s side.  Not 
      playable for Nisha, and the victory goes to Emma.

      Emma watches from the ground, exhausted, knee scraped, but 
      mustering a victorious smile as a CHEER rises from the 
      gallery.

                                        COACH
                      Well.  Looks like Sutton s back.

      Luke is clapping and WHISTLING wildly.  And Nisha, with a 
      scathing look to Luke, storms off the court.

      EXT. GYMNASIUM PARKING LOT - LATER

      As Emma heads to her car, she spots Garrett perched on a 
      wall a short distance away.  Emma suddenly stops, spins, 
      and marches right over to Garrett. 

                                        EMMA
                      Who re you -- Humpty-Dumpty or 
                      something?  Every time I see you, 
                      you re sitting on a wall.

      Garrett regards her curiously.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      You know, if I tell Luke you re 
                      stalking me, he s going to be really 
                      pissed.

                                        GARRETT
                      Stalking you...

                                        EMMA
                      What else would you call it?

                                        GARRETT
                      I guess just about anything else.

      Garrett starts to stroll off.  Emma calls to his back --

                                        EMMA
                      That was you outside my window last 
                      night, wasn t it?

                                        GARRETT
                      Of course it was.                                                                                      43.


      This sends a shiver down Emma s back.  Garrett s subsequent 
      smile is even more unnerving.  He continues off, as Emma, 
      flustered, stomps back toward her car, rummaging in her 
      purse for her keys.  She doesn t see Laurel approaching --

                                        LAUREL
                      Probably left them in your gym locker.
                              (when Emma looks up)
                      That was like every day last year...  

      EXT. GYMNASIUM LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER

      Alone, Emma is walking back toward the gym to fetch her 
      keys.  She rounds a corner, passing bleachers.  Suddenly, 
      she stops dead.

      HER P.O.V. -- Luke is back in the shadows of the bleachers 
      in a wildly passionate kiss with Nisha!  

      Emma turns away... blown away...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. BOUTIQUE SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

      A chic sidewalk establishment.  The sun is low in the sky.  
      Three chairs at Kristin and Emma s table; one has all the 
      shopping bags on it.

                                        KRISTIN
                      That s horrible.  Actually kissing...?

      Kristin is just as surprised that  Sutton  is sharing this 
      with her.

                                        EMMA
                      I know you really like Luke... and so 
                      did I...  I m just not sure...  I mean, 
                      do I confront him?

                                        KRISTIN
                      Do you want to?

                                        EMMA
                      Well... I... I think I like being his 
                      girlfriend.

                                        KRISTIN
                      That s interesting, because last year I 
                      wasn t always sure...   

                                        EMMA
                      But you think I should...

                                        KRISTIN
                      Confront him?  Heck, yes.  You can t 
                      let a guy do that to you...  The 
                      alternative would be to pretend you 
                      didn t see anything...

                                        EMMA
                      And... leaving something out... isn t a 
                      lie.  

      Kristin seems a little uncomfortable with this. 

                                        KRISTIN
                      People say that.

                                        EMMA
                      I think a lie s a lie.  But if the 
                      reasons are... reasonable... then maybe 
                      you can forgive the lie.                                                                                    45.


      Kristin blinks, looks off.  Emma waits -- hoping she ll get 
      some answers from Kristin.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      Sometimes things have nothing to do 
                      with reason.  

      A silence.

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      Your father and I love you very much.
                      We chose you, Sutton.  We picked you.  
                      And we d do anything for you.  Those 
                      are the only  circumstances  that 
                      should matter.

      Another silence.

                                        EMMA
                      I... I m sorry.

      Kristin nods, then looks away.  Emma realizes she pushed 
      too fast, too hard -- and she s angry at herself.


      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

      ... START CLOSE on the PHOTO of Thayer, on the deck of the 
      lake house.  Emma puts the photo aside.

                                        EMMA
                      What s the point -- ten PM, it s all 
                      over.

      Laurel, dressed up, is at the desk, putting on make-up.

                                        LAUREL
                      What happens at ten PM?  Is this a 
                      Cinderella thing? 

      Emma stares at Laurel for a long moment, then --

                                        EMMA
                      I should just tell you...

                                        LAUREL
                      Tell me what?

      Char and Mads suddenly scramble in through the slider, 
        interrupting --

                                        CHAR
                      You re not dressed!  Don t say you re 
                      not going.  All of Scottsdale High 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    46.

                                        CHAR (CONT'D)
                      knows you kicked Nisha s ass.  They 
                      want to see the fireworks.

                                        LAUREL
                      Wait.  Sounds like she s got some place 
                      else to be...

      Char has thrown open the closet, rummaging for something 
       Sutton  can wear.  

                                        CHAR
                      What is wrong with you guys?   So what 
                      if it s Nisha-Lucretia, it s still a 
                      party.    

      Emma studies Char and Mads.  Soon the real Sutton will be 
      back and everything will change.

                                        EMMA
                      You guys are amazing, you know that?  

      In Emma s whole life, she s never had friends like these.

                                        CHAR
                      You re really scaring me, Sutton.  Now 
                      get changed, so we can go.

                                        EMMA
                      You guys pick something for me.  You 
                      know more about what s in that closet 
                      than I do.

      Char has spotted a garment bag to the side.  

                                        CHAR
                      New stuff!  Perfect!  

      EXT. NISHA S BACKYARD - NIGHT

      Our four girls -- Char, Mads, Emma and Laurel -- make a 
       Charlie s Angels  entrance into this raging party.  Emma 
      is in the middle, and -- in the amazing dress -- has come 
      full circle, looking remarkably like Sutton... and feeling 
      like her, too.  She flips her hair back -- pure Sutton.

      Nisha s backyard is all lit up like daytime.  Shakira s 
       Give It Up To Me  THUMPS over rock speakers.

      Emma takes a long drink from a plastic cup of punch, reacts 
      to the obvious-alcohol in it.  She s checking the time when 
      Luke slides in next to her.                                                                                      47.


                                        LUKE
                      Thought we were coming together to 
                      this.  

                                        EMMA
                      I came with my friends.

      Emma s cool to him because of the kiss with Nisha.

                                        LUKE
                      Okay...  you want to explain this?

                                        EMMA
                      What?

                                        LUKE
                      ... The cold shoulder?  

                                        EMMA
                      Sorry, Luke.  Guess I m just having a 
                      little trouble trusting you right now.  

      ASIDE -- Nisha watches Luke and Emma closely.  

      MINUTES LATER - OFF TO THE SIDE

      Mads, alone, is off to the side.  Emma moves up to her.  

                                        EMMA
                      You okay?

                                        MADS
                      No...  I miss Thayer... I m jealous... 
                      that he got to go and I didn t...  And 
                      a little pissed, too.  

      Mads runs a hand through her hair.  Emma notices bruise 
      marks on her arm.  Emma catches her wrist.

                                        EMMA
                      What happened?

                                        MADS
                      I dunno.  Banged it in field hockey.  

      Emma, unlike Sutton, is well-versed in signs of abuse.

                                        EMMA
                      Okay...

                                        MADS
                      I m telling the truth.                                                                                    48.


                                        EMMA
                      Right.  Like everyone is.  Luke.  My 
                      mother.

                                        MADS
                      I just don t want to talk about it -- 
                      is that okay?

      Emma calms down, looks at her.  

                                        EMMA
                      I get it.  Even best friends don t tell 
                      each other everything.

                                        MADS
                      Close, but never too close.

                                        EMMA
                      Guess that s why you haven t noticed.

                                        MADS
                      Noticed what?

      Emma would love to say,  That I m not Sutton.   Instead --

                                        EMMA
                      How much I really care about you.

      LATER - BY THE POOL

      Emma s iphone displays  9:30 PM.   Emma starts to secretly 
      look for a graceful exit.  Sutton s going to be waiting.  

                                        LUKE
                      You keep disappearing...    

      He s obviously tipsy as he moves in for a kiss.  Emma 
      shoves him back.  She s all Emma now, no Sutton.

                                        EMMA
                      You know what -- you can forget this.  
                      I saw you with Nisha, okay?  The 
                      bleachers?  So how long s it been going 
                      on?

                                        LUKE
                      Sutton...

                                        EMMA
                                (overlapping)
                      ... All summer?  Or just since I got 
                      back?  I vote  all summer.                                                                                       49.


                                        LUKE
                      You were avoiding me -- you were 
                      distracted.

                                        EMMA
                      So what was that today -- your lips 
                      just accidentally ran into Nisha s?

                                        LUKE
                      She kissed me!

                                        EMMA
                      Oh, please...

                                        LUKE
                      ... I told her it s over, and it was a 
                      summer thing, and that you and I had 
                      talked...  Remember?  The auditorium?  

      Nisha is suddenly there, in Emma s face.  

                                        NISHA
                      He doesn t give a crap about you.

                                        LUKE
                      That s not true...

                                        NISHA
                              (to Emma)
                      You won nothing today.  You got lucky.  
                      You ve never been in my league and you 
                      never will be...

                                        EMMA
                      You know what, Nisha?  I ve known 
                      people like you my whole life.  Even 
                      wanted to be like you at one point...  
                      But all you do is put people down... 
                      like somehow that makes you better...  

                                        NISHA
                      At least it doesn t make me a poser.  

                                        EMMA
                      What?

                                        NISHA
                      Truth is, you were abandoned, Sutton...  
                      Even your real mother didn t want you. 

      Emma snaps, hauling off and slapping Nisha as hard as she 
      possibly can!  The blow rocks Nisha off her feet.  Mads 
      grabs Emma s arm before she can pounce.                                                                                      50.


                                        NISHA (CONT D)
                      Get her out of here!  Now... or, swear 
                      to God, I call the cops...

      EXT. NISHA S HOUSE - FRONT DRIVE - MINUTES LATER

      Mads is coming out with Emma.  Mads is laughing...

                                        MADS
                      That was beautiful...  Stomped Nisha 
                      twice in one day.  Hey, where're you 
                      going?  I ll come with.

                                        EMMA
                      No.  I m good.  Just... going home.

      Emma heads up the street.  Mads goes the other way.  

      FEET begin to shadow Emma from an adjacent lawn.  Closing.

      AT EMMA S CAR

      ... Emma sits into the driver s seat.  She hits  four  on 
      the navigation preset.  DIRECTIONS to the Lake House 
      APPEAR.  Suddenly, Garrett jumps into the passenger seat.  

                                        GARRETT
                      I m really tired of this game.

                                        EMMA
                      Get out... get out of this car.  I...
                      I didn t even know you were here...

                                        GARRETT
                      You didn t look up.   Humpty  was on 
                      the wall. 

      When Emma doesn t say anything, Garrett suddenly leans in 
      and kisses her.  Serious liplock.  When they finally part --

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      I knew it.  You re not Sutton. 

      Off a flummoxed Emma... caught...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    51.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE NISHA S - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      Emma has gotten out of the car, pacing in a circle as 
      Garrett jumps out as well.

                                        GARRETT
                      I m right, aren t I?  You re not 
                      Sutton.  You re someone else.

                                        EMMA
                      And you re a pain in my ass... 

                                        GARRETT
                      See, Sutton wouldn t say that...

                                        EMMA
                      Shut up!  Go away!

                                        GARRETT
                      Or that.  Or that.

                                        EMMA
                      I m Sutton, okay?  See?
                                (flips hair)
                      Sutton.  S-u-t-t...  Oh, forget it.

      Garrett gets in Emma s way.

                                        GARRETT
                      Prove it.  Prove you re Sutton.  Answer 
                      one question -- who s your boyfriend?

                                        EMMA
                      Luke.  Luke Coburn is my boyfriend.  Or 
                      was.

                                        GARRETT
                      Or never was.  I m your boyfriend, 
                      Sutton.

      Emma stops, agape, turns to him.

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      Luke was for appearances.  Your parents 
                      don t like my parents... and never 
                      would have approved of me.  Luke was 
                      easy.  He liked you, your parents love 
                      him... on the surface, it was perfect.  
                      But you and I have been seeing each 
                      other for nearly a year.  We texted the 
                      entire time you were in the South 
                      Pacific.  And skyped.  And talked.                                                                                    52.


      Emma just stands there.

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      I got suspicious when I saw you on the 
                      court with Nisha.  More suspicious when 
                      you accused me of being a stalker.  And 
                      that kiss just now -- final 
                        confirmation...

                                        EMMA
                      You done?

                                        GARRETT
                      When you tell me where the real Sutton 
                      is.

                                        EMMA
                      Okay.  I will.  She s right behind you.

      When Garrett instinctively turns, Emma suddenly bolts for 
      the BMW, jumping in and locking the door before Garrett -- 
      who s chasing her -- can jump in.  Emma nearly runs him 
      over as she peels away!

      EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

      Emma pulls up in the BMW, stops in a cloud of dust.  The 
      deserted lake house is just ahead.  The placid reservoir 
      reflects a full moon.

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      You have arrived...

      Emma checks the dashboard clock.  10:00 PM.

      INT. LAKE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER

      The front door CREAKS open.  Emma steps into this deserted 
      rental, tries a light switch.  Nothing.    

                                        EMMA
                      Sutton?  Are you here?

      No answer.  She walks further into the house, her only 
      light source the MOONLIGHT in a window.  There s a living 
      room... dining area.  The back of the house beckons next. 

      INTERCUT -- a SEDAN, headlights off, rolls in next to 
      Emma s BMW.

      IN A BACK BEDROOM -- Emma stops when she notices a little 
      SPARKLE on the floor.  She bends down, finds a necklace -- 
      apparently the one Sutton lost.                                                                                      53.


      INTERCUT -- mysterious, dark FEET start up the porch steps.

      IN THE BACK BEDROOM -- Emma hears a faint CREAK.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      Sutton?!

      She pockets the necklace, runs back to --

      LIVING ROOM - Emma stops in her tracks.  A FLASHLIGHT S in 
      her eyes.  A second later, it snaps off.  It s Garrett 
      again.  

                                        GARRETT
                      So you ready to tell me who you are, 
                      where you ve come from, and what the 
                      hell you ve done with Sutton?

      Emma, nervous, stays silent...

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      ... Fine.  If you want, I can go to 
                      Sutton s parents.  Or my father... the 
                      cop?  

                                        EMMA
                      Okay!  All right...
                              (deep breath)
                      I m not Sutton.  I m her twin sister.  
                      My name is Emma.  Emma Becker.  
                                (exhales)
                      God, you have no idea how many times in 
                      the last two days I ve wanted to say 
                      that.  We switched places... when I got 
                      here...
                                (then)
                      Look, Sutton will be here any second.  
                      This was where we agreed to meet.  Ten 
                      o clock.   I ll let her explain.  

      Garrett still regards her with a healthy dose of suspicion.

                                        GARRETT
                      Man.  Two whole days.  You fooled 
                      everyone.

                                        EMMA
                      Except you.

                                        GARRETT
                      Sometimes all it takes is a kiss.
                                (studies her)
                      So you haven t answered my questions.  
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                        GARRETT (CONT'D)
                      Starting with -- where did you come 
                      from?

                                        EMMA
                        Unfortunately a place I can t go back 
                      to.

      TIME CUT --

      EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Emma and Garrett walking out onto the back dock.  Emma is 
      staring at Sutton s necklace while Garrett holds the 
       Thayer on the dock  photo.  

                                        GARRETT
                      ... So you re running from the law... 
                      in Nevada.  That explains why you re 
                      here.

                                        EMMA
                      I told Sutton I wouldn t say anything 
                      to anybody...

                                        GARRETT
                      This has to do with her search for her 
                      real parents, doesn t it?  

                                        EMMA
                      She told you?

                                        GARRETT
                      I know Sutton s been looking into it.  
                      And I m guessing, except for you, I m 
                      the only other person who knows.

                                        EMMA
                      Do you know what s in L.A.?

                                        GARRETT
                      Besides Disneyland, no idea.  

                                        EMMA
                      It s where she went.  And she was 
                      supposed to get back tonight... and 
                      meet me here.

      Garrett looks off, thinking.  Finally --

                                        GARRETT
                      It s weird.  The night before you got 
                      here, Sutton and I had this strange 
                        conversation in Mads s poolhouse.  She 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                        GARRETT (CONT'D)
                      said she had to go -- something 
                      important -- and just ran out. 

                                        EMMA
                      Maybe she came here...

      Emma dangles the necklace on a finger...  He studies it in 
      the moonlight for a moment.

                                        GARRETT
                      So, what s it like -- being Sutton?  

                                        EMMA
                      Garrett -- I m serious -- it s only 
                      been two days and  I think I ve screwed 
                      up her whole life.

      INT. MADS  HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Mads  father, Alec Vega, is washing his hands in the sink.  
      Mads comes in through the back door, home from the party.  
      Alec -- perspiring -- is dressed in dark clothes.  

                                        MADS
                      Hi, Dad.  I know it s late...  I was at 
                      a party.

                                        ALEC
                      Have any fun?

                                        MADS
                      Not really.  Way too much drama.

                                        ALEC
                      Thought you liked that stuff.  Good 
                      fodder for that big novel you re going 
                      to write some day.

      There s just a little bit of ridicule in Alec s voice.

                                        MADS
                      I guess...
                                (then)
                      It s weird -- I keep expecting Thayer 
                      to show up.  Today at school.  Tonight 
                      at the party.  Remember how he d shoot 
                      baskets out there... sometimes till two 
                      in the morning. 

      Alec looks out through the kitchen window.  The garage 
      backboard and basket stand idle in a flood light.                                                                                    56.


                                        ALEC
                      I don t really want to talk about that 
                      right now.
                                (then)
                      Go to bed, Madeline.  You have school 
                      tomorrow.

      HALLWAY AND THAYER S ROOM

      Mads pauses by the open door to Thayer s room, looks in on 
      his things.  A haunting, moonlit glow to the place.  Her 
      cell TONES.  Mads quickly answers --

                                        MADS
                      Sutton?

                                        KRISTIN (O.C.)
                                (filtered, on phone)
                      Madeline?  Thank God you picked up...  
                      It s Kristin...  I need to know the 
                      last time you saw Sutton...

      EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - NIGHT

      Emma is a wreck, unloading to Garrett in a cathartic aria --

                                        EMMA
                      ... I broke up with her fake boyfriend.  
                      Accused her real boyfriend, you, of 
                      being a stalker.  And with her 
                      parents...  I tried to help, but only 
                      made it worse...  At least with her 
                      sister Laurel, I might actually have 
                      fixed something.
                                (then)
                      Maybe I should just tell them.  Go back 
                      to that house and confess the whole 
                      thing.

      Garrett is gazing off, turns back to her.

                                        GARRETT
                      You can t tell them.  You promised 
                      Sutton you wouldn t say anything.
                                (then)
                      It s weird.  I don t like any of this.  
                      She didn t tell me.  She could have 
                      picked up the phone...

                                        EMMA
                      Yeah, and she could have told me that 
                      we... I mean, the two of you were 
                      involved...                                                                                    57.


      Garrett looks at her.  

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton is everything to me.   

                                        EMMA
                      To me, too.  It s why I ve done 
                      everything I can to make this work.

                                        GARRETT
                      Then you have to keep doing it... keep 
                      up the... deception.  We both do.  

      Emma nods, looks at Garrett -- in this moment, she sees 
      what Sutton sees in him.  Someone who feels intensely -- 
      someone of extreme loyalty.  She looks away from his 
      intense stare.

                                        EMMA
                      She promised she d be here right at 
                      ten.  Why wouldn t she call if she got 
                      delayed?  I have her phone, but...  

      Emma realizes she can t find the iphone.  Garrett flashes a 
      warm smile --

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton was always losing it, too.

      JUMP TO --

      EXT./INT. SUTTON S CAR - NIGHT

      Emma lifts the phone off the car seat, checks the screen.

                                        EMMA
                      Seven missed calls.

      As Emma scrolls them --

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton in there?

                                        EMMA
                      Everyone but.  

      STRANGER S P.O.V. -- FROM A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY

      ... SOMEONE is hiding in some brush, watching as Emma says 
      something to Garrett, jumps into the BMW, and drives off. 
      As the P.O.V. focuses on Garrett watching after her...                                                                                    58.


      INT. MERCER FOYER - NIGHT

      Sgt. Dan Mathews, Garrett s father, is talking to Kristin 
      and Ted in hushed tones.  Mads and Laurel look on.  Another 
      pair of cops are moving through with evidence kits.  

                                        TED
                      ... Alarm company said it went off at 
                      exactly ten-fifteen.  

      A familiar voice from the open front door causes them all 
      to turn --

                                        EMMA
                      What s going on?

                                        KRISTIN
                      Oh thank God...

      Kristin runs to Emma, pulling her into an embrace.

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      We d worried they d taken you...

                                        EMMA
                      Taken...?

                                        TED
                      Someone broke into the house... into 
                      your room...

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      Would you know if anything s missing?

      JUMP TO --

      INT. SUTTON S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      START on the ransacked bedroom.  WHIP BACK to Emma as she 
      walks in, her parents, Mathews and Mads and Laurel right 
      behind.  Laurel and Mads linger in the doorway.

                                        LAUREL
                      I got home first.  The alarm was going 
                      off.

      There s glass from the broken slider on the floor...

                                        TED
                      We think maybe Laurel scared them away.

      Emma stops over the desk, turns to them.                                                                                    59.


                                        EMMA
                      My laptop s gone.

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      You didn t have it with you?

      She looks at them.  She s close to telling them who she 
      really is...

                                        EMMA
                      No...  I didn t...

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      According to Madeline Vega and Laurel, 
                      you left the party early.  Where were 
                      you, Sutton?

      Emma still hesitates...  Kristin crosses to her, takes her 
      in her arms, and holds her closely.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      ... I don t care where you were.  It 
                      doesn t matter.  So long as you re 
                      safe.
                                (holds her at arm s 
                                length)
                      Sutton, I... I m sorry about before...  
                      From now on, nothing but the truth.  I 
                      promise.
                                (embraces her again)
                      God, what would I ever do without my 
                      Sutton?

      As Emma is enveloped in a mother s arms, a mother s 
      warmth...

      EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

      P.O.V. SHOT -- arms rowing out into the middle of the 
      lake... a gloved hand reaching down... taking Sutton s 
      laptop out from under oily rags... tossing it into the 
      water with a SPLASH.

      UNDERWATER

      ... as the laptop sinks into the murky blackness...  the 
      reflection of the full moon rippling on the surface...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.
