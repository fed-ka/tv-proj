A darkened casino, gamers long gone.  Wires dangle, tables 
overturned, the place destroyed.  A tomb.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM 
sweeps through the wreckage.  A MAN steps through the debris, 
followed by his sharp eyed Jack Russell, ELI.

The man wears a blue uniform, a CROWN OF LAUREL LEAVES 
emblazoned on one arm, below it a small set of WHITE WINGS.  
 strangely, and back, his on shotgun a armed, heavily He s
incongruous with the period, a short sword strapped to his 
upper thigh.  

This is ALEX LANNEN (25), handsome rebel, a Cool Hand Luke 
among the ruins.  Alex has a mischievous glint to his eyes, 
but underneath a hard earned seriousness, as if his lot has 
always been a conflict between dealing with what life has 
given him versus doing what he wants.  

Alex moves cautiously, a pack slung over his back, a man on a 
mission.  He enters the ruined showroom floor of a Range 
Rover dealership, the cars all gone.  4.


Alex walks to the back and pushes aside a giant tarp; a RANGE 
ROVER is parked in an office, blocked from view, a hidden 
secret.  His secret.  

This is something Alex doesn t want anyone to know about and 
 with filled It s  gate. back the opens he when why see we
SUPPLIES: weapons, extra gas, food, stacks of batteries, 
clothes.  He s planning on going somewhere.  

Alex takes more supplies from his pack, loads them into the 
truck.  He contemplates his stash.  The dog whines. 

ALEX
Soon, Eli.  Very soon. 


Alex heads back through the casino toward the open exit doors 
when he freezes, sensing something.  A presence behind him... 

He slowly turns to see the fading light from the doors 
illuminating a poker table, and four ragged PLAYERS playing, 
 army green soldier s a in dressed MAN a CREW: motley a
uniform, a STRIPPER, heavy face make-up cracked and dry as if 
it had been applied years before, a CHILD in pajamas, and a

The PLAYERS turn, revealing distorted mouths, grotesque, 
disfigured with sharp rotting teeth, their eyes BLACK.  Fat 
Momma grins.

FAT MOMMA

join usssss.

Without hesitating, Alex opens fire, catching the Stripper in 
the head.  Alex bolts for the doors.  And something shocking 
happens... the Soldier unfurls WINGS and leaps after Alex,

Alex and Eli sit in back of a military HUMMER.  As they are 
driven down the strip we get to see VEGA as ALEX sees it...

Vega is much as we know it now: spotlessly maintained, 
bustling, energetic, vibrant and most of the iconic symbols 
we know and love are there, but ALL uniquely changed and 
modified for permanent housing and to defend against the 
constant threat of angel attacks. 

It is more densely built-up than Hong Kong, but better 
organized.  There are modern factories, open-air markets, and 
intense human productivity.  

Giant VIDEO SCREENS announce a citywide EVENT -- the VEGA 
JUBILEE, an annual celebration of humanity coming back from 
the brink of extinction to fight against the angels.

At various checkpoints, there are more high tech TSA body 
scanners, manned by soldiers in BLACK UNIFORMS.  Life in Vega 
relies on absolute vigilance and rule of law, but there are 
those that disagree...     9.

In stark contrast to the people below, the high walls are 
armed with heavy artillery and modern missiles, the Statue of 
Liberty a watchtower, the city no longer focused on gambling, 
the lights judiciously used to light and not entice. 

A fortified nondescript building stands in the center of 
town, heavily guarded.  Forty-story AGRI-TOWERS, each level a 
different crop, abundantly grow the food that easily feeds 
VEGA.  Animals are bred and housed below ground, in 
artificial environments.

There are a number of murals, paintings and statues of a 
BABY.  One mural is 100 feet tall on the side of what was 
 like look others representations, modern are some BALLY S;
they could be Michelangelo s work.  And all are different, no

Strange RUNE SYMBOLS, like a language, are painted below the

Claire leaves one guard at the elevator to her floor.   ALEX 
follows her to her quarters, leaving the third guard by the 
door.  Her security detail moves with military precision.

What once were guest rooms are now modern barracks, walls 
removed, housing thousands of soldiers.  Tightly packed like 
the interior of a submarine, the bunks are stacked.  

A number of solders both male and female, read, sleep and 
play games.  Alex enters with Eli and goes to his bunk.  Eli 
curls up, exhausted from the day.  

Alex sits painfully, his back sore from the whip.  Alex

In an enormous room with the RYSEN SYMBOL painted on one 
wall, the kind of office Saddam Hussein once had, Rysen goes 
over paperwork.

has never been a true ally to us. 25.

He lives in one of the restaurants, empty save for a desk, a 
bed and stacks of books.  One of the windows removed. 

Michael sits cross-legged, alone, his eyes closed,

praying. 

Suddenly, he stops, his eyes snapping open, sensing.  The 
numbers on the elevator start rising.  DING.  The doors open

MICHAEL
Jeep!

Jeep s covered in modern, glyphic tattoos on his arms, up his 
neck, his whole torso, exactly like the ones we saw written 
on the MURALS around Vega.  

And Jeep, like Rysen and Michael, was a hero of the 
Extermination War and like Michael he exudes warrior.  They 
embrace warmly, old friends. 

MICHAEL

Jeep sits.  Michael hands him a glass of water.

Other than the Vicor prayer of

ACT TWO


The boy Roan startles awake on a couch, the last vestiges of 
a nightmare still with him.  He looks around, fearful, sees 
the sleeping women arranged near him, the room full.      

Very carefully, he slips out of bed.  His movements silent as 
he leaves the room.


Inside a small ANTE CHAMBER, Claire, dressed for bed, kneels 
before an alter, set up as a place of worship, the CHOSEN 
BABY we saw earlier in murals the focus.    

She lights a single candle and then HEARS a bell and goes to

For a long moment, he stares at her as if saying goodbye, 
memorizing her face... then he exits.  

Claire watches after him, her mind spinning.


Arika sleeps alone in a large bed as a MAN enters in a cloak.  
He slowly approaches the bed, when suddenly Arika spin-sits, 
quick reactions of a soldier and points a gun at him. 30.

Roan has made his way to the 20th floor exterior stairwell, 
which is now fortified with GIANT ANGEL REPELLING SPIKES that 
point away from the building.  He reaches out and touches the 
SPIKES, OUCH, they re sharp and yanks his hand back.  Then he 
climbs up on the ledge for a better look...   

With a childlike curiosity he gazes out over Vega s walls, a 
killer view, breathes in deep, enjoying the fresh air, and 
takes in the sight of the city, the soft morning glow just

about to learn.

He exits and we watch Claire watching Alex and see her 
feelings pass over her face, so much love for him but worry 
   too. there etched


Alex saunters back to his station, walking on air and finds 
Michael waiting for him.  Ah shit!  

The other guards, like most people, are never at ease with 
Michael.  His intense gaze doesn t help.  He s comfortable in 
long silences.

 never he s but Alex, on effect that have doesn t Michael

Michael and Alex enter.  The space empty.  We can see forty

Just as Alex crosses to a window, a MAN jumps out of the 
shadows with a sword and attacks him.   Alex s reactions are 
those forged in war.  He s impressive, acting instinctively, 
as he dodges the first blow drawing his own sword, and 
immediately fights back.

Out matched, the man quickly withdraws, raising his arms up. 

JEEP
Okay, okay.  

Jeep nods to Michael. 33.


JEEP

Alex s shock turns to anger.

Alex storms out.  Jeep sighs, looks out the tall windows.  

JEEP

Michael nods. 

JEEP
Did I do the right thing for Alex? 

MICHAEL
That remains to be seen.  35.



Below the city of VEGA there are hundreds of miles of 
tunnels, and this is in the old days when it was just a 
casino town, now there is as much space below the surface as 
above.  

David and William walk alone together, Thomas the only guard 
with them, keeping his distance.

DAVID
How are you coming with ferreting 
out the angel worshipers? 

WILLIAM
My spies have been searching but 
making little progress.  
Considering angel worship is a 
capital offense, the Black Acolytes 
are incredibly secretive... For 
obvious reasons.  

DAVID
Keep searching.  

William nods as David stops at a DOOR. 

DAVID 
 I m Jubilee... the at Tonight,
going to give the city something 
special to remember.  

He opens the door and... 


...they enter a dark room.  

Something skitters within, nails on concrete, like a lizard 
shifting position.  A chilling VOICE whispers from the 
darkness.

VOICE OC
Is that you David? 

David points a flashlight, the beam revealing the FAT MOMMA 
from the teaser, still in her muumuu, chained to the wall, 
dirty, limbs long and twisted, her hair matted and filthy. 

She turns to look at the light, her mouth black and rotted, 
her eyes JET BLACK.

She hisses, and faster than should be possible... lunges at 
them.  36.


The Eight-Ball is yanked back hard as she reaches the end of 
her chain; William falls back, startled, David doesn t move. 

DAVID

  morning.

END ACT TWO37.


ACT THREE


The city s population is excited, the energy palpable, all in 
anticipation of the big show.  Crowds slowly move down the 
strip towards the MGM Grand, a giant block party as they go. 

On large video screens, placed over the main drag to make 
announcements and disseminate news we see images of THOMAS 
 many the of one Guard, Weel s Senator of Captain FORD,
presentations for this years Jubilee.   

The show is being billed as something extra special.

David turns and exits leaving his words hanging in the air, 
everyone in the room weighing what they believe.  

Rysen stands and exits behind him...   


On the way to the show, Claire sits in the back of her car. 
Alex is one of three guards with her.  

The lovers make furtive eye contact, both anticipating their 
escape.


The Arena is much as it is today, but it has been rebuilt to 
hold more people and to have an exclusive, ROMANESQUE VIP 
area above the performance area (like the Staple Center 
 cooler). but Boxes,

In the center of the crowd on the floor is a large CAGE, like 
an Ultimate Fighting stage.  

People are excited, an ebullient air, filling the seats all 
over the Arena.  This is a treat for people who work hard.


David Weel sits with William overlooking the crowd.  The GOLD 
LION BANNER prominently displayed over the box.  

David flirts, a charming host to Arika, who sits with her 
female entourage, his honored guests.  Roan sits behind them,

the eyes of the crowd.  

Michael makes eye contact with WYNN, who sits in a small box 
on a lower tier.  Wynn is frightened by what they just 
learned from Jeep in the Council meeting, but forces a smile.

Jeep moves and stands next to Alex.  Alex won t even look at

Jeep s not a communicative man, this is the most he can do.  
Father and son share a beat, then uncomfortable with the 
intimacy, Jeep abruptly goes back to his position next to 
Michael.

Alex gently places the photo in his pocket.


A dark cramped space.  The only light, thin shafts shooting 
down from the close ceiling above.  Within those shafts we 
make out the shape of the Eight-Ball Fat Momma.  

She shifts position and we hear the clankle of her chains.  
SOUNDS filter down, muffled.   

She begins to cough and lurch, hacking, her head thrown 
forward as if she is trying to expel something caught in her 
throat, a regurgitating bird.  

It s hard to watch, but finally she produces a shiny object, 
holds it up, turns it over in her hands... 


The Arena is finally full.  David stands, holds out his 
hands.  The crowd quiets. 

We note that all the guards have communication mics, like 
secret service agents, including Michael. 

David speaks into a microphone and we see he s a born leader, 
a charismatic speaker. 

DAVID
Welcome Vega!  

The crowd goes wild, then calms down as he lifts his arms.   45.


DAVID
Tonight we celebrate our 
resilience, our fortitude, our 
collective courage.  Every year we 
use this, our Jubilee to be 
reminded of the past... but also to 
look forward.  And in that spirit 
of looking forward I have an 
announcement of incredible 
importance to our beloved city... 
to Vega.    

Again, huge cheers.

DAVID
Tonight our city will become 
stronger, more unified...

Tonight... It is my pleasure to 
announce the engagement of Claire 
Rysen to William Weel.  Through 
 two Vega s join we marriage their
greatest houses... the house of 
Rysen and Weel, thus securing the 
safety and future of our wondrous 
city.    

The crowd goes crazy as William stands, beaming and looks 
across the way to Claire who sits, flabbergasted, fighting 
back tears.  

Alex stands, rigid, shocked, a hot knife plunged into his 
heart.

Claire looks at her father accusingly, knows now what he was

Michael knows about the two lovers and understands his pain.  
He gives Alex a slight nod of strength.

David lets the crowd enjoy the moment and then moves on to 
the main event.  46.


DAVID
As is our tradition at the Jubilee, 
we celebrate the soldiers who stand 
on our walls, who protect us and 
keep us safe so that we can enjoy 
this life.  But tonight we have 
something extra special.   


THOMAS FORD rises up into the CAGE on a platform and the 
crowd goes wild.  

DAVID
 Vega s of one is Ford Thomas

killing twenty two Eight-Balls in 
battle with nothing but his 
knife... 

On the other side of the cage, a platform begins to rise from 
below... and on it is chained the FAT MOMMA.  

 grey mottled horrific: more even she s light bright the In
skin, black eyes, too long limbs.  

The crowd goes completely silent in shock and horror, the 
only SOUND in the entire arena the hissing of the wicked 
angel and the jangle of her chains.

Thomas draws his sword.

DAVID
There s nothing to fear.  We are in 
control, but it is good, always 
good, to be reminded of what we 
face.  What is out there waiting 
for us.  The thing that asks 
nothing and takes all.  Why we must 
be diligent and disciplined in all 
we do.

A MASSIVE PANIC ensues as the crowd tries to get out of the 
packed arena.  Thomas Ford can t exit the cage fast enough to 
handle Momma as she mauls more of the crowd. 

Guards rush towards the Eight-Ball to put her down, but she 
leaps deeper into the crowd blocking them with the panicking 
people behind her.

Alex grabs Claire and Rysen and with the other guards exit

Michael is ambidextrous, both swords come out in a blur and 
he cuts her down, but the place is out of control with 
terror, people getting crushed under foot.

And then fuel hits the fire.

THE ALL ALERT EMERGENCY SIRENS blare.  Other than practice 
drills, no one has heard these alarms in years.  

It means a full city wide attack is imminent. CODE RED.

Everyone is running for the exits to either escape or get to 
their designated posts.  Vega is like a ship; everyone has a 
job to do in an emergency.  Some do what they are supposed 
to, many panic.

Michael stands still, in the chaos of the crowd and listens. 
We have no idea what he hears, but it worries him.

They race through hallways that are quickly filling with 
people looking for a way out.

Suddenly, DOORS bust open and a thousand people rush into the

Rysen s guard goes with him; Claire is caught up in the crush 
and disappears through a stairwell double door, pushed along.

ALEX

Claire looks up, sees him.

He makes his way to her, reaches a stairwell just above her. 
Alex puts Bixby down and then reaches to Claire, reaching, 
reaching, she grasps his hands and he pulls her up to where 
he is and they embrace, relieved.  

Alex holds her for a moment, clearly an intimate embrace, and 
they look at one another.

David, William, Jeep, Rysen, Arika, her entourage, Roan and 
their guards are all glued to VIDEO SCREENS showing what is 
happening in the city, specifically the fight between Michael 
and Wiken at the reactor building.


They enter, Claire clutching at Alex, intimately, her heart 
breaking over what she just did... not sure if it was the 
right choice.

The room is shocked into silence.

The lights flicker and go off, the emergency power comes on.  
The room is bathed in RED LIGHT like the bridge of a 
submarine.

Soldiers rush out after him as everyone turns their attention

Jeep stands still and then goes down on one knee.  58.


Alex rushes to him and catches him just as he falls over.

As much as the distance of years has made him bitter, this is

Every person in that room stares at Alex and Jeep, frozen, 
not sure what to do or say.  

Alex slowly stands, confused by what Jeep just said, trying 
to process it.  What the hell was JEEP talking about?

David Weel fills in the blanks. 

DAVID
The last words of a dying brain.  
He was hallucinating.  Ridiculous. 

Rysen stares at Alex and then at David, William is 
flabbergasted.

Every single person in the bunker immediately decides if they

One.

Claire bows down before Alex.

David takes a close look at the tattoos, trying to discern 
how the trick was done, as if David Copperfield was involved.  

Then he glances around the room, taking an assessment of who 
is there, who has been a witness.  Claire, Rysen, Thomas (his 
personal guard), William... and Bixby? 

He stares at her.

David looks to Rysen.  Rysen nods his assent.

Through all this, William has still said nothing, can t take

And Michael stands there, bloody, dark soot covering his face

RYSEN
What happened? 

MICHAEL
They attacked the reactor.  I 
stopped them... but not before 
damage was done.  The core rods 
were exposed, but containment held.  
For now, there doesn t seem to be a 
radiation leak.  The engineers are 
working on it.  

Michael then sees Jeeps body, it stops him cold and he stares 
at it sadly, now devoid of tattoos.  Then he looks up at 
Alex, his shirt off, covered in them.

shakes his head, frustrated, feeling the crushing burden now 
upon him.  Michael steps closer.

It reads: beware those closest to you.

Alex looks up amazed and stares at Michael.
