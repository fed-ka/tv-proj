   down this wet and empty street.

PEROTTA
			I appreciate you going to bat for
			me, Danny.  I owe you.
			
YATES
			Forget about it.


2. CLOSER - MOVING

with TONY PEROTTA, handsome, mid-thirties, jeans, leather
jacket, boots, and a Brooklyn accent: and with DANNY
YATES, same age, all-American good looks, courderoy jacket
over a sweater. Perotta's got a nervous edge that's been
dulled a little by booze.  A car passes in b.g. with an
adhesive sound against the glistening pavement.  Yates
casually follows it's progress, as:

YATES
			Keller's on edge like the rest of us.


PEROTTA
			Yeah, well he lost it when I told
			him.
				(he exhales an ironic
				 laugh)
			All we have to do is return it
			to property.  They don't keep
			track.  They'll never know it was
			missing, and we can all wipe the
			slate clean.  Who needs that kind
			of pressure?

YATES
				(overriding; firm)
			I said, don't worry.  I'll smooth
			things over with Laine -- then
			we'll talk about it.	

Perotta smiles and nods his appreciation.  Beat.  Yates
buttons his jacket with the sudden realization:

YATES
			It's getting cold...



Yates slips on a pair of leather gloves as they move to
Perotta's late model Mustang.  Perotta fishes out his
keys, jingles them to isolate the right one.  He opens
the driver's door and gets inside.  Rolls down the window.

YATES
			You okay to drive?

PEROTTA
			I've driven worse.
				(then: nervous laugh)
			Listen to me: some cop, huh? So
			where'd you park?

YATES
			Couple blocks down on South
			Street.

PEROTTA
			C'mon.  I'll give you a lift.


YATES
			Thanks, but I'm gonna walk.


PEROTTA
				(nods)
			Sure.  See you tomorrow.

YATES
				(beat)
			Yeah. I'll see you.



Yates takes another casual glance around -- before we see
him pull a .44 Bulldog from the back of his waistband.
And as he raises the gun from behind his back:



3. PEROTTA'S POV

as Yates, neutral-faced, extends his arm and fires twice
at point-blank.



4. LONG SHOT

Yates arm remains extended, as the gunshots reverberate
through the empty streets.


5. REVERSE ANGLE

to reveal a seventeen year old girl crouched in the
shadows across the street, behind a garbage can, still
holding the crate of oranges that she had been carrying.
Her name is LAURA and her expression tells us that she's
seen everything.


6. YATES

lowers the gun and stares down at Perotta's motionless
body.


7. LAURA

quietly sets down the crate.  She backs up slowly,
inadvertently displacing the garbage can lid so that it
SCRAPES the pavement, and:


8. YATES

reacts, wheeling around.  He scrutinizes the darkness for
the sound's source, but sees nothing.  He cuts a diagonal
across the street, moving toward the sound, and:


9. LAURA'S POV

as Yates nears, sweeping the area.



10. CU - LAURA

trying to control her nervous breathing.  Moment of
decision: there's no choice.  She bolts out from the
shadows and takes off down the sidewalk, and:



11. YATES

empties his .44 at her running silhouette, until it
disappears down an adjacent alley.  He takes off after
her.



Laura runs, pumping her legs and arms with everything
she's got.  She glances back over her shoulder to find
Yates a hundred yards behind her.  But the distance
between them is decreasing.  Quickly.


Laura breaks out around the corner.  She stops in the
middle of the street.  Left or right?  With Yates
crescendoing footsteps, she chooses to go right.


14. CU LAURA - MOVING

with her as she runs, and doesn't look back.  Her eyes
tear with exhaustion and her face begins to show the ebb
of adrenalin.  Twenty yards more, and she stagger,
falling headlong onto the concrete.


15. LOW ANGLE - LAURA

her head bowed, her body heaving for oxygen -- as a pair
of spit-polished shoes step INTO FRAME.  Laura looks up.
startled:



16. ANOTHER ANGLE

a UNIFORMED COP regards her with a mixture of concern and
confusion.

COP
			You okay?

Laura exhales her great relief.  He helps Laura to her
feet.  She nods tentatively, still gaping, then looks
back.



17. HER POV

no sign of Yates.  They are in the parking lot of a run
down commercial corner consisting of a laundromat, a
hamburger shack, and a mini-market.  All closed.  A lone
streetlamp casts an oblong circle of pale yellow light.



18. RESUME SCENE

COP
			What are you doing in this
			part of town, anyway?

But Laura is strangely shy.  She regards the Cop in
grateful silence, then looks away, as we:

CUT TO:

where Cathy is waiting for Maxwell, who steps out.  MOVING
WITH THEM as they wend their way through office traffic
to the Press Briefing Room.  Unconsciously his hand
wanders up to check his tie.  And, as he catches a
reflection of himself in a glass cabinet, he runs his hand
through his hair.


CATHY
			You look fine, Joe.


Maxwell shoots her a gimme-a-break look.  Then:



MAXWELL
			I hate these guys.  They move in
			packs, like wolves... or sharks.

CATHY			
				(amused)
			It's only a roomful of
			reporters...

MAXWELL
			Easy for you to say.


CATHY
			Relax. It's not like you're
			running for office.


Maxwell's sideways-look at her betrays the political
aspirations he hides beneath his easy smile and manner. 


CATHY
			Or are you?


They stop before a door.  Maxwell's tone is serious.





MAXWELL
			Let's just say that putting a
			copkiller away won't hurt my
			career any.
				(then)
			Wish me luck.

Cathy smiles as she follows Maxwell into the room.


CUT TO:



A modest two-family house in Brooklyn.  All's quiet.  At
least on the outside.

KELLER'S VOICE (OVER)
				(exploding)
			He was my partner eight years,
			you son-of-a --


DAVIS' VOICE (OVER)
				(overriding)
			Hey.



Descending the slope toward the drainage duct.
 


The flag waves at half-mast.  Over this:

CATHY'S VOICE
			Excuse me, I'm looking for
			Detective Keller.


Cathy slides out of a cab and, heels clacking on the
pavement, crosses the sidewalk and enters her building.




Laura looks out over the jewelled city, her hair blown by
the cool night breeze.  As Cathy comes out from the living
room...

CATHY
			Laura, I've -

She breaks off and stops with the realization that Laura
can't hear her.  Cathy wears the evidence from the
previous night's attack:  discoloration under one eye, a
cut lip.  She approaches Laura, who now turns to face
Cathy.  (Note:  Cathy enunciates her words to Laura
carefully, but not condescendingly.)

CATHY
			Are you cold?

Laura shakes her head - then holds up her hand, thumb
and forefinger about an inch apart to admit that she is
a little cold.  Cathy smiles.




CATHY
			Come inside.  I made some hot
			chocolate.


Laura nods, and follows Cathy inside.



A clear, late-autumn morning -- and the flag, still at
half-mast.


CUT TO: 


53. A RASTAFARIAN

is hustled PAST CAMERA by a pair of UNIFORMS, and we are:



Cathy rushes down the stairs to street-level.  Her head
swings one way and then the other, surveying the
lunch-time crowd.  No sign of Laura.  CAMERA PULLS BACK
to show her bewildered and enraged in the human throng.

FADE IN:


Keller emerges from the house, and takes a hopeless look
over his shoulder before walking off into the moonlit
night.
