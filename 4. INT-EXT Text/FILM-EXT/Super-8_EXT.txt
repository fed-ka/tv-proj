Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
lifeblood of this late 70's town.
A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable
THAN COMFORTING:
JACK
I'll be home soon.
And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
5.
Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each
other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of
"Have a great summer!"
DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack
on shoulder.
Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:
CHARLES
That was the longest day ever--
here.
JOE
What's this?
CHARLES
New scene, check it out. Let's hit
the 7.
JOE
(as he reads)
You hear Martin barfed in the hall?
CHARLES
I know, does that guy ever not
barf? Keep reading.
JOE CHARLES
-- I am reading. -- Not carefully. Focus, this
is important.
-- Detective Hathaway has a
wife?
CHARLES (CONT'D)
I think it might help make my movie
better. I need two things: a better
story and production value.
They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is
there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:
CARY CHARLES
Martin booted all over his
locker, it was the grossest
one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading.
CARY CHARLES
After he ate two boxes of
Mike and Ikes-- never seen so
many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?
6.
JOE
Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?
CHARLES
No way -- did I tell you what she
did with my top hat?
JOE
Oh yeah, that was bad.
CARY
What wife?
CHARLES
Alice Dainard.
Joe stops. His friends don't. PUSH IN ON HIM --
As they head to the doors:
CHARLES
I was returning that book on codes
and ciphers-- she was in the silent
reading section -- I thought,
"Screw it." So I asked her if she'd
play Hathaway's wife.
JOE
You talked to Alice Dainard really?
CARY
You're not supposed to talk at all
in the silent reading section--
CHARLES CARY
Shut up. It's for "silent reading."
CHARLES
She said yes, we're filming tonight
and she's driving.
An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets
through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the
distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and
CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking
quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin
dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of
Twizzlers.
14.
CHARLES
I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit
my pants.
(THEY MOAN)
I debated telling you.
JOE
Thanks.
PRESTON
That's called a "sharteeze" by the
way.
CHARLES CARY
Well then I totally
sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm
talking about: the world is
crazy, there's a name for
everything...
CHARLES
Twizzler me.
Joe passes him a Twizzler.
MARTIN
So... people are turning into
zombies because of the chemical
factory, right?
CHARLES
Martin? I don't see how the guy
playing Detective Hathaway can ask
where the zombies are coming from.
CARY
Another classic from Smartin.
MARTIN
I told you, I don't like it when
you call me that.
CARY
I'm sorry, Smartin.
MARTIN
Shut up.
JOE
GUYS--
15.
All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys
stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE
DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-
year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe.
ALICE
Joe Lamb?!
JOE
-- yeah?
ALICE
What the hell's he doing here?
CHARLES
Make-up, sound and special effects.
ALICE
He's the deputy's kid!
CHARLES JOE
-- what? (touch flattered)
-- you knew that?
ALICE (CONT'D)
Charles, I don't have a license. I
can't drive with him!
CHARLES
You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?
ALICE
It's too late! He's seeing me in
this car right now.
JOE
You can trust me. My dad'll never
know. I won't tell him anything.
Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She
considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:
ALICE
Get in.
The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small
town, driving through a rural landscape.
16.
PRESTON (V.O.)
(TERRIFIED)
You're driving very well. I'm
impressed.
The Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car
dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars.
The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the
middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS
illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,
currently closed. No one around.
The kids get out of the car.
CHARLES
Guys, there's an electrical socket
up here.
MARTIN
Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have
more lines?
CHARLES
No. But you can pick up some stuff.
The boys carry many bags and the tripod.
PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he
creates with both hands.
18.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Guys, this is going to be great.
Get the lights and camera on that
end, we'll shoot this direction
first, like we talked about! Joe,
get the mike plugged in-- make sure
the new batteries are in the camera
before you do the make-up!
JOE
Okay.
Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that
Joe is Charles' lackey.
Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading
and memorizing his lines.
MARTIN
"-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I
have no choice." "That's nothing
you need to worry about..." "What
am I suppose to go to Michigan with
you..."
Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending
Martin running after it.
MARTIN (CONT'D)
No, no, no. Cary.
Charles writes in his notebook. He starts to get up...
CHARLES
Martin, I have a new line for you.
He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
He looks to her. A beat.
JOE
You mind?
Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
ALICE
My dad works at the mill.
And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
much for him to bear.
JOE
Close you eyes. Please.
He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe
starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes
closed. Then, PRE-LAP:
CHARLES (O.S.)
So this is very emotional.
The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and
camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a
coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both
look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.
20.
Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped
to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat.
CHARLES
Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't
want her husband to keep investiga--
ALICE
I know, we read it, we get it.
CHARLES
Okay, I'm just directing. Martin
get on your mark. Martin, you're
going to have to reassure her. Do
you know what "reassure her" means?
MARTIN
Yeah, I think so.
CHARLES
Okay-- we're starting on Alice's
side first-- Preston: a couple
seconds after "action" walk to the
pay phone, make it look like this
place is busy--
PRESTON
I know what that looks like.
POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has
just exploded a firecracker:
CHARLES
Asshole, could you stop blowing
shit up for two seconds and deal
with the camera?
CARY
Sorry man.
CHARLES
Let's rehearse this -- save your
real performances for when we're
filming, though.
Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the
camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-
height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the
actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Ready? Here we go... action!
21.
Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE
JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY:
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I'm going to stay here and
investigate. I think it would be
safer if you leave town.
MRS. HATHAWAY
John. I don't like it. This case.
These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
What am I supposed to do, go to
Michigan with you?
Preston walks past them, acting in the background.
MRS. HATHAWAY
Mackinac Island's beautiful this
time of year.
We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the
unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
Sweetheart. This is my job.
MRS. HATHAWAY
The dead, coming back to life...? I
think you're in danger--
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I have no choice--
MRS. HATHAWAY
You do have a choice. We all do...
And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs
her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
John, I've never asked you to stop.
I've never asked you to give up or
walk away.
Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily
transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes
galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
But I'm asking you now-- please.
For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
me.
(MORE)
22.
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
I need to know this isn't the last
time I'll see you.
(BEAT)
I just love you so much.
Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
... I... I love you too...
And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
ALICE
Was that okay? Or... not really?
Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as
he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --
CHARLES
-- uh, that was... I'm... that--
yeah, good. Just like that.
Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN.
PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:
CHARLES (CONT'D)
PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film
in the camera?!
CARY
-- I didn't put it in--
CHARLES
PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get
the mike ready. Go, go, Preston,
get in position. Costume, costume.
Martin, get that tripod set up.
Joe, help her with her costume.
Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't
miss the train. Preston, get in
position! Martin, you know you
lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE
CAMERA YET?!
As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.
ALICE
I love how calm he is.
JOE
Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
23.
Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW
SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:
CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:
CHARLES
Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud
when the train passes by! Oh God, I
hope it stops! You ready?!
They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in
her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --
CHARLES (CONT'D)
And... ACTION!
And they're shooting:
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I'm going to stay here and
investigate. I think it would be
safer if you left town for a couple
of days.
MRS. HATHAWAY
John. I don't like it. This case.
These murders.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
What am I supposed to do, go to
Michigan with you?
MRS. HATHAWAY
Mackinac Island's beautiful this
time of year.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
Sweetheart. This is my job.
Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,
looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he
notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile
away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the
train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe
turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --
LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the
GROWING DIN:
MRS. HATHAWAY
THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I
THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I HAVE NO CHOICE!!!
24.
MRS. HATHAWAY
YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!!
John, I've never asked you to stop.
I've never asked you to give up or
walk away.
Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very
odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON
JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks
back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
But I'm asking you now-- please.
For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
me. I need to know this isn't the
last time I'll see you.
(BEAT)
I just love you so much.
Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is
almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS
DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING
UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN!
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I love you too!!
And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
JOE CHARLES
GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
-- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF
YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT --
AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS!
JOE
Run!
THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM --
RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING
VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE
PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE
APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM!
THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES,
CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE
BUILDING.
JOE (CONT'D)
Alice!
CHARLES
Joe, we have to go.
25.
They run off.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!
AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER
BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT,
SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT!
And then --
IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-
SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But
what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe
BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then
AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --
THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE
SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS
-- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty
feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --
stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it
is GONE. Nothing.
TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A
CARTRIDGE OF FILM.
JOE (O.S.)
Guys?!
Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps
throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.
JOE (CONT'D)
Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is
that you?
PRESTON
I'm okay! Though I think I'm having
a heart attack! And I have a
scrape!
Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary
appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:
26.
CARY
Guys, did you see those explosions?
That was awesome.
JOE
Has anyone seen Alice?!
CHARLES (O.S.)
I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --
Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL
ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as
he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!
Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --
CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON
-- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
Martin, still sick, calls out:
MARTIN CARY
-- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of
DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
ALICE (O.S.)
-- what's all that blood?
Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --
shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
ALICE (CONT'D)
What's the blood? -- did someone
get hurt--?
But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches
below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --
KIDS (AD LIB)
Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't
touch -- what are you-- careful!
Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
JOE
It's my fake blood. It's fake!
CHARLES
What is this stuff?
27.
ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
PRESTON
Guys, what are these things?
Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads
off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
MARTIN
Hey, don't touch it, what are you
doing?
CHARLES
They look like white Rubik's cubes
or something. They're heavy like
metal or something. There's like a
billion of them.
It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train
cars, Cary calls out:
CARY
Guys, get up here. You can see
everything from up here.
They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
CHARLES CARY
Oh my God. ... Look at that...
PRESTON
According to my Uncle Seth, an
accident like this is exceptionally
rare.
JOE
It wasn't an accident.
(turns away, eyes on the
FIELD)
There was a truck. On the tracks.
CHARLES
What? Driving on the tracks?
Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
JOE
There.
28.
Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP
TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
grass.
MARTIN
How can a pick-up truck derail a
train? That's impossible.
PRESTON
Obviously it isn't.
BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at
the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --
they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:
CARY
... holy shit...
CHARLES
-- is that him?
ALICE
(covers her mouth))
-- yeah, it's him--
MARTIN
-- who?
PRESTON CHARLES
It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit.
MARTIN (CONT'D)
What? Who is that?
WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and
unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves
closer -- scared and sad for him --
ALICE
Dr. Woodward...?
No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO:
MARTIN
That's Dr. Woodward? The science
guy?
PRESTON
Biology.
CARY
Honors biology.
29.
MARTIN
Wow... I'm not in his class.
CARY
We know.
MARTIN
Shut up, Cary.
CHARLES
Remember when Old Man Woodward took
your Electronic Football?
CARY
Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon,"
never gave it back...
MARTIN
The dungeon?
PRESTON
That trailer Woodward keeps in the
school parking lot.
Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES
him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --
ALICE
... Dr. Woodward?
But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his
arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING
A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to
Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.
PRESTON JOE
Map of the contiguous United
States... -- what's the writing?
ALICE (CONT'D) CHARLES
-- dates and times. -- what's that line across?
JOE
It's a schedule for the train.
But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they
can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
DR. WOODWARD
-- who-- who are you?
30.
They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:
CHARLES
Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!
From fourth period! You've been in
an accident!
BUT WOODWARD HAS REACHED INTO HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN
-- THE KIDS JUMP BACK, STUNNED --
DR. WOODWARD
They will kill you. Do not speak of
this -- or you -- and your parents -
- will die.
We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him
turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,
FIGURES WITH FLASHLIGHTS APPROACH FAST --
JOE
-- guys, look --
The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them:
ALICE
(SCARED)
-- we shouldn't be here--
DR. WOODWARD
GOOOOOOOOO!!!
The kids start moving away --
PRESTON CHARLES
My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!
Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --
she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
ALICE
MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!
Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the
car, past a whining Charles.
JOE
GET IN THE CAR!!!
31.
As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the
front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car
into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then
RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps
to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the
disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND --
RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past.
The Buick SPEEDS AWAY...
33.
CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out.
They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles,
who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on
the tripod. Joe nods.
Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.
ALICE
Joe, this is yours.
Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He
takes it with:
JOE
-- oh, thanks,
ALICE
I should never have done this.
She just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston,
Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go.
Joe hurries across the street.
Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE,
the massive STEEL MILL in the background --
CHARLES
If any of the footage from last
night is usable, that means we need
Alice to play the wife again.
JOE
Yeah, I thought she was good.
CHARLES
She was mint, but she's never gonna
do it.
JOE
I think she will.
37.
CHARLES
There's no way. You heard what she
said.
JOE
But that was before the new pages,
right?
CHARLES
You honestly think she cares about
the scenes?
TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride
their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large
MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the
passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device.
CHARLES
Man, did you hear what she said
last night? "I never should have
done this!" Dude, she was totally
wigged!
JOE
Yes, she was, we all were.
CHARLES
Did you see her face?
JOE
Yeah, I saw her face.
CHARLES
Man, what's wrong with you?
JOE
Nothing. I think she's going to do
it.
They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.
INSERT - WHITE PAGES
The book opens -- Joe's finger goes down -- finds "LOUIS
DAINARD" and the phone number. We're in:
38.
Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with
Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved:
ALICE
I don't care what Charles wants-- I
said no on the phone.
40.
JOE
You totally did, that's true, I
know, but--
ALICE
And now you're at my house.
JOE
I am, which-- under normal
conditions I would nev--
ALICE
It's too weird after last night-- I
don't understand how you guys can
keep working on your stupid movie,
I really don't.
JOE
We have to-- while the crash is
still there.
(waits, anxious, then,
VERY SOFTLY:)
... please...?
ALICE
(she considers, then:)
No.
But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.
ALICE (CONT'D)
You should go.
Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got
arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery
bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches:
LOUIS
What's this?
ALICE
He was just inviting me to a party.
Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but
at the same time, can barely look at him:
LOUIS
She's not going to your party.
JOE
Yessir.
Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.
41.
LOUIS
You know better than this.
She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:
LOUIS (CONT'D)
You get outta her. You go home and
don't come back, I don't wanna see
you.
Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As
awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted:
ALIE
I'll do it.
JOE
-- what?
She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off
his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting
CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE
-- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE
BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL
OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find
CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out:
CHARLES
CUT! That was mint! So good! And it
looked huge with the train! Wow!
Joe: go reload the cap gun!
JOE
OKAY --
WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in
a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's
dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear
scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who
were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH
seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.
HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice,
who looks out at the crash. During all this:
CHARLES
We'll get the other direction next -
- Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go
a little faster next time.
42.
MARTIN
I'll try, but I'm still crying
about last night, I feel like I'm
crazy.
Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were
covering his closed eyes.
CARY
Did it really look good? My death?
CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the
train, haunted. Quiet:
ALICE
... what do you think happened...?
Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.
JOE
You mean why he crashed the train?
ALICE
I just got a horrible feeling.
Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:
MARTIN
Anyone else still shaking from the
crash?
PRESTON
I got in my parents' bed last
night. Haven't done that since I
was eleven.
Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
PRESTON (CONT'D)
... did I just insult him?
Joe grabs the camera, near Charles:
CHARLES
-- dude, what are you doing?
Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the
lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH,
ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat,
finally standing up, looking out at the crash:
43.
JOE
That whole thing's an Air Force
train.
ALICE
-- what?
The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of
MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA,
taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the
debris. Choppers land and take off in the background:
NELEC
Yes, I understand, this crash has
caused a whole mess of confusion.
46.
JACK
As you can expect, the local
authorities are trying to figure
out just what happened here as well
as how to help you out.
NELEC
It's under control. It'll be a very
fast clean-up.
JACK
Colonel, there isn't anything I
should know, is there?
NELEC
Not that I can think of, Deputy. I
understand you have concerns about
our cargo.
JACK
I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
NELEC
That's not going to be possible.
JACK
Colonel, I've got a lot of people
in my town that are gonna want to
know what's taking place.
NELEC
-- what town is that?
JACK
... Lillian.
NELEC
Deputy, if you're asking me if we
had any dangerous property on board
this train, I can assure you the
answer's no.
OVERMYER
Colonel.
NELEC
Excuse me.
Jack looks at Nelec -- not quite believing him...
47.
We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past
earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole
near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy
bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A
DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER.
CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the
gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE
REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is
TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS
GUN, BUT --
Gas PUMPING onto the asphalt, SCREAMS OF PRUITT, horrible,
CONFOUNDING --
Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly
glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car,
confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the
pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the
building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up --
sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his
feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER --
WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the
turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we
can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until
FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside
looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN
UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE
as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the
SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO:
A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and
she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are:
We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack,
EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here. We pass SMALL SHATTERED
PIECES OF RED AND BLUE PLASTIC and STOP AND RACK to the GUN
Sheriff Pruitt dropped.
52.
EDIE
-- Careful, there was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel
I've lost.
MR. BLAKELY
-- You don't seem to be asking a
lot of questions.
EDIE
-- Give this man some time, Mr.
Blakely.
MR. BLAKELY
He's just the Deputy, he's not the
Sheriff...
Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out
a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved
initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder
to check if it had been fired.
CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken
BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:
MR. BLAKELY (CONT'D)
I think this is most likely a bear
attack.
EDIE
Remember when I said you talk too
much? Well, this is the time.
JACK
Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt
this morning?
VOICE (V.O.)
Negative, still no word.
JACK
Vicky, I need you to have Dayton
send a CS unit out to Edie's. You
put out an APB on the Sheriff and
Breen Haskell -- send units to
their houses immediately. You copy
all of that?
VOICE (V.O.)
... copy. And Jack, we're getting a
lot of unusual calls.
JACK
... what kind of unusual calls...?
53.
Angry IZZY, 65, OPENS A NEW CAR HOOD: PIECES OF THE ENGINE
RIPPED AWAY, MESSY -- DOLLY WITH HIM, Jack follows:
IZZY
Never seen this kinda thing before.
Izzy opens ANOTHER CAR HOOD: PIECES MISSING.
IZZY (CONT'D)
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Insurance company thought I was
joking with him. Look at my
Bonneville here-- look at this. I
got a call about this car
yesterday. What am I going to tell
the customer?
ANOTHER HOOD -- PIECES MISSING.
JACK
Having trouble with anyone lately,
Izzy?
IZZY
I was thinking, you should talk to
Louis Dainard. I didn't help him
out with financing last year,
wouldn't be surprised if this was--
some sorta sick retribution.
As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him,
walk with him, AD LIB:
RESIDENTS JACK
-- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station
going on. My antenna's gone-- yet. You need to call the
our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report,
come home this morning -- before anything can be done
Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can
and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If
Jack. you do that for me, I promise
you, I'll handle it myself.
He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how
stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS
DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men
inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by
this.
54.
Joe rides along a hillside. Parks his bike. Walks toward the
edge.
JOE
Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!
He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.
Joe rides the street, calling out:
JOE
Lucy! ... Lucy!
WIDE SHOT as he DIPS down a neighborhood hill, sun LOW.
A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE
IT NOW IN CLOSE-UP. It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're
on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something
he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then
another... his eyes glued to the board.
Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING
THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING"
SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so
stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in
the background behind him.
WIDE SHOT: middle of nowhere wooded area as an OHIO POWER
CHERRY PICKER TRUCK drives up, parks beside a UTILITY POLE.
57.
The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE
YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in:
ROONEY
We got over a half mile of copper
missing.
VOICE (V.O.)
-- that-- doesn't sound possible.
ROONEY
Lines are back up at M-38.
In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He
begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare
utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets
to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past
the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE
YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,
Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small
METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
58.
Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,
this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the
middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,
FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.
Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A
tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.
Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP
-- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly
watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,
twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,
Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his
bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he
suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie
HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he
begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY
DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage
yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking
SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT
OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN
UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS
AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE
WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS
IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE
CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER
MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.
Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:
MRS. BABBIT (V.O.)
I wanna know who took `em.
Jack hurries from the town meeting to the station --
WOMAN
Jack, all the tools in the garage
are gone.
JACK
Patty, get in touch with Vicky.
David, have you seen Milner?
DAVID
No, sir, I haven't seen him.
MAN
There's a sink hole in my garage.
It almost sank a foot.
JACK
Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?
TOM
Have you tried his office?
JACK
Check his office.
MAN
The powers been out for days
Jack continues, into:
MILITARY VEHICLES parked everywhere. Personnel removing boxes
from the house, packing it all up. But out front, Joe is
dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the
detective.
Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a
SOLDIER:
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
I came as soon as I could, what's
happening here?
OFFICER JOE
Military police investigation. It
was a suicide.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
Suicide? Who was it?
OFFICER JOE
A former Air Force officer. He
called me last night, said he had a
secret that he couldn't keep any
longer.
Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.
66.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
What's this?
OFFICER JOE
He worked at Romero Chemical. He
found out some things the company's
been doing. After what you told me
at the bar, I thought you should
know.
Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:
CARY
(QUIETLY)
Are we gonna get in trouble here--?
CHARLES
(WHISPER-YELL)
Shhhh! Production value! It's for
the movie!
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
This proves it. They knew, the
company knew. Thank you so much for
the information.
OFFICER JOE
We just made the discovery
ourselves. You understand this is
top secret.
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
Of course.
OFFICER JOE
I would never have given you this
information if you and I hadn't
served together in Vietnam.
As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching
Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her:
Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves
toward Joe and his friends:
CHARLES
Joe.
(TO JACK)
Hey, Mr. Lamb!
Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from
Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
JACK
Get in the car.
Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --
he's taken back to the squad car --
CHARLES
Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,
but technically, that's my film--
68.
Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS
it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger
seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe
in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
NELEC
I would like to help you out
deputy. I really would. But we
operate on a need to know basis.
JACK
Why are your trucks sweeping the
town?
NELEC
We'll be out of your way shortly.
JACK
Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
contacting DC. Talk to some friends
about "Walking Distance."
This lands on Nelec.
JACK (CONT'D)
All right. We'll do it that way.
Jack heads off.
NELEC
Deputy.
(JACK TURNS)
Let's talk. Just not here.
Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.
The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE:
69.
Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.
Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN
LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But
then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the
distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls
out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,
toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another
INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON
WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then
ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:
Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.
71.
Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the
three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed
at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
JACK
Hello--?
And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming
WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
VOICE (V.O.)
Drop your weapons. Put your hands
on the car.
JACK
--I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He
told me to meet him here.
VOICE (V.O.)
You're under military arrest. Drop
your weapons.
JACK
WHERE'S NELEC?
Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT
FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front
door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable:
LOUIS
ALICE!!! WAIT!!!
But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his
BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her --
Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on
the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR
turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn --
Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals
hard, crying and hyperventilating --
LOUIS
ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!
Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS
INTO A PARKED CAR IN A VIOLENT, SUDDEN STOP!
Alice GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's
car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?!
Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE
THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she
decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on --
BUT SEES SOMETHING AND SCREAMS --
-- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car --
stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS
VOCAL CHORDS --
LOUIS
ALICE!!!
But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even
get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a
drunken, horrified, shocked, battered MESS. In a WIDE SHOT,
LOUIS is in the middle of the street, Alice's fallen bike on
the sidewalk.
In the great distance, the WATER TOWER. We BOOM DOWN in a
MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of a field at night. Then a LONG LENS SHOT
of SIX SOLDIERS standing in the field. But ONE stands out
front, wearing a FLAME THROWER. And suddenly the quiet is
broken by the ROAR OF FLAME. A WIDE, WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT as
the flames ARC in the tall, dry grass. Over the radio:
VOICE
Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation
Walking Distance is in effect. T-
minus four hours until evacuation.
Evacuation is T-minus four hours.
78.
The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an
ominous PLUME OF SMOKE -- a far-off SIREN is HEARD. Then:
JOE (V.O.)
Why are you not reacting?
As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows -- and we
BOOM UP along the WATER TOWER as they go --
JOE
What's your problem?
CHARLES
My whole movie's a disaster `cause
of you!
JOE
I know, my dad's being a turkey.
79.
CHARLES
Whatever.
JOE
We're still gonna finish your
movie!
CHARLES
It's not about the movie.
JOE
What are you talking about? Of
course it is.
CHARLES
Just forget it.
JOE
Why?
CHARLES
There's nothing wrong--
As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER
TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE --
unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE
SMOKE LOOMS --
As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:
JOE
I'll get the camera back, I know
where my dad put it -- We can still
make the festival.
CHARLES
It's not about the movie.
JOE
Then what is it about?
CHARLES
Jesus, you don't even get it do
you? It's obvious.
JOE
What's obvious?
CHARLES
Gawd, you're a dumb ass.
80.
Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows.
WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY
TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive. NEIGHBORS coming from their
homes in the MID-GROUND: confusion and talk, more VEHICLES.
Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO JOE AND CHARLES, trying to
make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult, MR.
HARKIN:
JOE
Mr. Harkin. What's going on?
MR. HARKIN
Evacuation! The fire!
Mr. Harkin POINTS -- Joe turns to look -- we PAN: THE DISTANT
SMOKE, BIG AND LOOMING.
VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS
ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all
the belongings they can. Others quickly LOAD UP CARS,
strapping belongings to the roof. Over all this:
83.
PA VOICE (O.S.)
-- Due to a wildfire that is raging
out of control and threatening to
reach the Lillian Chemical Plant--
Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
A LITTLE GIRL CRIES amid the madness.
PA VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
-- an evacuation has been called
for your safety. Please remain calm
and as you board the bus...
The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing
soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may
recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE
TRAIN ARE BEING MOVED INTO THE CENTER OF TOWN.
SUPER WIDE SHOT as an ENDLESS LINE OF BUSES, CARS and TRUCKS
makes its way from Lillian to...
The buses drive past the guard gate into the base -- into the
huge HANGAR that we were in earlier. Those who drove
themselves PARK THEIR CARS -- and are ushered to the hangar.
DONNY steps out of his 1972 PONTIAC CATALINA, carrying a
duffel. RACK FOCUS to see we're IN THE BUS with Joe, who has
seen Donny -- and they drive INSIDE THE HANGAR --
MOVING PAST as Donny moves through PARKED CARS, Joe, Charles,
Cary and Martin keeping up:
DONNY
So there are rules to being in my
car, okay?
CARY
Where the hell are we going anyway?
JOE
We're going to the school to open
the trailer Woodward had in the
parking lot. I bet that's where he
keeps his research.
The boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by.
CARY
What research?
JOE
We're gonna learn everything we can
about that thing so we can find it.
And that's how we're gonna save
Alice.
88.
DONNY
Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery
and no one touches the CB, gottit?
CHARLES
You think Woodward's got
information about that thing in the
dungeon?
JOE
Why else are there padlocks on the
door?
(TO DONNY)
We're going to the school.
DONNY
When did this one get so bossy?
A SOLDIER crosses to a vehicle, on his radio when KAFA-
BOOOOOM! The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST! The airmen
take cover, RUN TO MOVE NEARBY VEHICLES, GENERAL MAYHEM --
and our CAMERA BOOMS UP -- to the MILITARY JEEP THAT DRIVES
AWAY FROM THE AIRFIELD --
Jack drives up in the jeep -- comes to a stop in SHOCKED
CLOSE UP -- we see in the distance the MASS OF VEHICLES
driving from town --
Jack's mind races --
The jeep RACES past camera -- we PAN -- revealing as
APPROACHING CAR: DONNY'S CATALINA:
Donny's car pulls up, lights go off. The kids pile out --
DONNY
So what, I wait here like a douche?
JOE
Yes. Thank you very much. Do you
have a tire iron?
A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE.
They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A
PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON.
91.
Joe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it
doesn't budge.
CHARLES
Joe, let me try -- let me try.
Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing.
As Martin grabs the tire iron:
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Joe, this is impossible, man.
Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM!
CHARLES (CONT'D)
--I loosened it for you.
Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it
opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it
all: THE MOTHER LODE.
JOE
GUYS--
MARTIN CHARLES
Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here.
The BOYS are put onto the bus -- BOOM DOWN to DONNY'S CAR IN
THE FOREGROUND, where we realize that WE HAVEN'T BEEN THE
ONLY AUDIENCE TO THIS: Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding,
watches wide-eyed as the bus DRIVES AWAY.
DONNY
... oh shit...
His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining
military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9,
grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic:
DONNY (CONT'D)
Breaker breaker, requesting police
backup, over?! Breaker breaker, is
this the police channel?
The TRANSPORT BUS speeds on the road, the only vehicle here.
ANGLE ON THE DRIVER as a RADIO CALL come in:
VOICE (V.O.)
(FILTERED)
Base Fortress requests ETA.
Nelec arrives, grabs the radio mike:
NEWS REPORTER
Chief Master Sergeant, Dustoff-03
is twenty minutes out.
VOICE (V.O.)
Roger.
97.
PAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits
near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which
takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another
Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our
four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty,
wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
CHARLES
... what... what's gonna happen?
CARY
I think we're gonna die.
MARTIN
No. They'd never do that.
JOE
-- guys-- I forced you to come with
me... I'm... I'm so sorry.
(looks to Charles)
I'm so sorry...
CARY
I think they're gonna kill us.
CHARLES
(UNCONVINCING)
Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You
know why?
Joe is suddenly hopeful:
JOE
... why--?
But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM
SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF
GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt --
At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN
CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW --
The bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS
RIGHT TIRES --
The bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS! We
MOVE AROUND THE BUS -- JUST MISSING SEEING THE CREATURE --
HIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop.
The BUS IS PUSHED TWENTY FEET FROM SOMETHING ON THE OTHER
SIDE -- THEN IT TIPS OVER AND CRASHES TO THE GROUND:
Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his
MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace
from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.
CARY
Got my fireworks back!
CHARLES
(who gives a shit)
Congratulations!
They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies
the oncoming car, as behind him:
MARTIN
They're coming, man! I think we
should go!
JOE
No--!!! No, look!
The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-
and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:
DONNY
Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I
didn't know...!
(finally sees the bus)
... what the FUCK?!
JOE
We need to get back to town!
DONNY
Hop in, man! But you should know: I
am massively stoned right now.
JOE
You want me to drive?
Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
The Catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood --
SOLDIER
Sir, the weapons are misfiring!
Surface to air, radar -- all of
them! It's a mess out here, sir.
Soldier hurries off.
Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot
of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
SHIT in collateral damage.
An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves.
CARY
So what are we doing here?
JOE
Just follow me.
CARY
I've been following you for the
last five blocks. What are we doing
here?
Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the
CARETAKER'S SHED.
109.
They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows
CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.
Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
JOE
Help me!
CARY
Help you with what?
JOE
We need to get inside.
CARY
For what? What's in these windows?
JOE
Cary, help me.
CARY
It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
these windows?
JOE
Help me, on three.
JOE/CARY
One, two, three.... One, two,
three.... One, two threee.
The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
breath.
CARY
Whoa. This is scary.
JOE
You got any sparklers in there?
CARY
Are you kidding me?
Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
110.
But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
JOE
-- Alice is down there.
A JEEP roars past.
The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different
speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET
TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to
silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST
THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING
ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind
them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-
laughing at seeing it work --
CARY
-- what's he doing...?
JOE
... he's making a model.
AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT
IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE
FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE
SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
119.
BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS
OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE
STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT
FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES
OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
TOWER.
JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
JACK
-- I got you. I got you.
LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-
FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe
LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers
it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
-- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
ever. But then something happens.
Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
TO THE WATER TOWER!
AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and
that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE
WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS
IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT
COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
120.
THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,
OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as
the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING
SHIP seen in his windshield --
Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the
ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S
HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.
And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
