          FADE IN:


  11INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          BRUCE enters first.  Oddly, he takes a quick glance around
          the place.  JOHNNY enters behind him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just how I like to spend my Sunday. 
                        Driving up and down the coast,
                          haggling over antiques.

                                        BRUCE
                        I told you, they aren't for me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, yeah.  Your dear old aunt. 
                        Here's a notion -- next time take
                        her.  I'll stay here and watch
                        some paint dry, stick some bamboo
                        under my fingernails--

          Johnny notices a knocked-over knick-knack on a table and
          rights it -- WHOOOOSH! 


  22VISION 

          RICK WICKLIN, 30, a wannabe rock star with piercings,
          tattoos, dreadlocks and a scruffy beard, stands at the
          nearby window, looking out.  Intensely.

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        It's 'bout time.

          He calls to unseen people behind him:

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        The psychic has landed! 

          Rick rushes off -- but knocks over the knick-knack and...


  33BACK ON JOHNNY

          As he finishes righting it.  Bruce is about to step further
          into the house -- but Johnny stops him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's not right.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - TEASER - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   2.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

          Johnny MOVES past Bruce....

                                        BRUCE
                        Hang on, man--

          Johnny enters the main area of the house, and...


  44REVERSE ON A PARTY  --  A DOZEN OR SO PEOPLE

          With SARAH standing in front.  Everyone yells  "SURPRISE!"

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not my birthday.

                                        SARAH
                        That's the surprise.

          She motions to a banner going up -- "SCIENCE CLUB REUNION"
          and "CLEAVES MILLS HIGH."  The crowd is twentysomethings
          from science-related careers.  Doctors in short sleeve
          dress shirts and ties, corduroy-wearing geologists,
          computer game designers, engineers in shorts and sandals.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Sarah)
                        Your idea?

                                        SARAH
                        Group effort.  Something about
                        winning the State Science Decathlon
                        ten years ago.

          Johnny is approached by the piercing-laden Rick Wicklin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Richard Wicklin? 

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        Wicked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?











                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - TEASER - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   3.

    4CONTINUED:4

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        Ricky Wicked.  That's my stage
                        name, Mr. Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're an actor?

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        Rock 'n' roll band.  We call
                          ourselves 'Isosceles Squared'.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought you got your Ph.D in
                        laser optics.

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        It's a fall-back position, in
                        case the music thing doesn't fly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good thinking.

                                        STUDENT #1
                        Speech!

          The OTHERS AD-LIB for Johnny to say a few words. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to group)
                        Uh, well, I have to say this is
                        completely unexpected.  I've
                        thought a lot about you guys over
                        the years.  Glad to see you're
                        all doing so well. 
                                (points)
                          Henderson's face finally cleared
                        up.

            Henderson raises his hand, empty cups playfully tossed at
          him, ad-lib CHATTER and LAUGHTER.  In that instant, it's 
          a classroom in here.  A fleeting moment for Johnny.  A
          memory of another life.  Sarah notices Johnny's reaction.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quieting them down)
                        Seriously, guys.  This means more
                        than you'll ever --

                                        ALEX (O.S.)
                        If you ask me this is a complete
                        waste of time!

          All eyes shift to...  ALEX CONNERS, 28, a top-flight
          researcher (with a top-flight ego) who hasn't forgotten
          his inner geek. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - TEASER - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   4.

  4CONTINUED: (2)4

                                        ALEX
                        Haven't you geeks heard?  Mr. Smith
                        isn't about science anymore.  We
                        lost him to the mystical world of
                          soothsaying and prestidigitation. 
                        I'll prove just how far he's strayed
                        by using the...
                                (makes finger quotes)
                          'Scientific method.'  You remember
                        that one, don't you, Teach?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Vaguely. 

          Alex builds anticipation by reaching into a jacket pocket.

                                        ALEX
                                (milks it)
                        Ladies and germs, I, Dr. Alex
                          Conners, have in my possession an
                        object, borrowed from Mr. Smith's
                        desk some short ten years ago. 
                        If you believe the tabloids and
                        the gossip rags, the Wizard of
                        Cleaves Mills should be able tell
                        us what I have and why I took it.

          Johnny considers the challenge.

                                        ALEX
                        Just one touch, right?
                                (off Johnny's pause)
                        You aren't gonna punk out on me,
                        are ya?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't even have to touch you.

          An "Ooooooo" from the crowd... The gauntlet is down. 
          Johnny playfully touches his temple...

                                        ALEX
                        So what's the frequency, Kenneth?

                                        JOHNNY
                            Nineteen-thirty-eight Indian head
                        nickel.  It was a good luck charm
                        my father left to me.

          The look on Alex's face tells everyone that Johnny nailed
          it.  Alex lifts it out of his pocket and holds it high
          above his head.  APPLAUSE.

                                        ALEX
                          I surrender, oh mystic one!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Still disrupting class.

  4CONTINUED: (3)4

                                        ALEX
                        Sorry, Mr. Smith, but you drilled
                        it into us on that senior trip to
                        the science museum -- question
                        the status quo.  Push the edge of
                        reason and -- what was it?
                                (everyone joins)
                        "Be the vanguard!"

          Alex and Johnny hesitate, then grab each other in a
            heartfelt hug, but when they come out of it--


  55WHOOSH! (RESEARCH LAB - VISION)

          Alex BEGINS to burn alive.  His skin BLISTERS and CRACKLES! 

          He is consumed by SUPER-HOT BLUE FIRE.  Vision Johnny
          pulls back and they're suddenly standing... 


  66EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - DAY (GREEN SCREEN)

          Everything is CONSUMED BY BLOOD-ORANGE NUCLEAR FIRE.  

          It's Armageddon, just as Johnny as seen before...

          Only this is a new angle on a familiar old terror.  The
          FIRE comes at him in a WAVE, RUSHING OVER HIM, and taking
          Alex with it.  Johnny raises his arms to shield from the
            ALL-CONSUMING FIRE, only to FLASH....


  77BACK TO JOHNNY

          He gets his bearings.  Alex raises a cup of beer.

                                        ALEX
                          A toast.  To Mr. Smith!  For giving
                        each of us the key to the brightest
                        future we could ever imagine! 

          As the group APPLAUDS and CHEERS, Johnny forces a smile.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


  88INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Surprise party in full swing.  Alex finishes his beer. 
          Johnny is across from him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you up to these days? 
                        Besides busting on your old
                          teachers.

          Alex puts down the cup.  Johnny casually "moves" it --
          but he's really fishing for another vision.

                                        ALEX
                          Plastics. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Plastics?

                                        ALEX
                          Polymers.  I'm a research chemist
                        at Portland Chemical.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's a good place to be.

                                        ALEX
                        Got my own lab.  Assistant.  Whole
                          she-bang.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's great, Alex.  I'm happy
                        for you.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Who is he?


  99BRUCE AND SARAH - OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTY

          Bruce watches Alex.  Sarah munches on something.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex Conners.  One of Johnny's
                          greatest achievements.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm afraid to ask.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex came from a working class
                        family.  Johnny took him under
                        his wing, helped him get a
                          scholarship to M.I.T.

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        Spent more time with that kid
                        than he did with me.

                                        BRUCE
                        So our boy was into rescuing before
                        he got knocked on the head.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex was a prodigy.  Johnny was
                        the first one to recognize his
                        talent. 

                                        BRUCE
                                (eyes Alex)
                        Seems like a nice guy. 

          Sarah notices Bruce's uneasy look.

                                        SARAH
                        What is it?

                                        BRUCE
                          Nothing.


  1010BUT WE SEE WHAT BRUCE IS CONCERNED ABOUT: 

          As Alex is leaving, he leaves behind a paper plate.  Johnny
            nonchalantly touches it, fishing for another vision. 
          Bruce knows the drill nearly as well as Johnny.

          Alex puts on a leather jacket and gathers his motorcycle
          helmet.


          BACK WITH JOHNNY AND ALEX

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure you can't stick around?

                                        ALEX
                        Big day tomorrow.  I'm about to
                        crack something huge.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Love to see you in action.  Any
                        chance I might get a tour?

                                        ALEX
                        I'll talk to the boss.  She's
                        kind of a hard-ass, but hey, if
                        it wasn't for you I wouldn't even
                        be there.  Oh, almost forgot.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT ONE - 4/20/05 - GOLD      8.

    10CONTINUED:10

          Alex pulls Johnny's good-luck INDIAN HEAD NICKEL from his
          coat pocket and returns it.

                                        ALEX
                        All these years, you knew I had
                        it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where else would it be?

                                        ALEX
                                (hands it back)
                        I took it the day before the
                        Science Decathlon.  For luck. 
                        Didn't know it was your Dad's,
                        man.  Sorry.  Real dickweed thing
                        to do. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem.  You are a dickweed.

          Traded smiles, then Alex heads out, Johnny watches,
            concerned... he turns as his eyes land on Bruce.  Johnny
          knows he knows something is up.


  1111INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY - ON THE ARMAGEDDON WALL

          Johnny's collection of clippings, photos and facts about
          Greg Stillson, Armageddon, etc.  Johnny studies it closely,
          connecting the dots in his mind.  Bruce looks on. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure that's what you saw?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was Armageddon, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        But you said it was different.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Alex was there.

                                        BRUCE
                        Alex?  The only time you ever see
                        Armageddon is when you touch
                          Stillson.

          Johnny is standing in front of an image of Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why this doesn't add up.

          The PHONE BEGINS TO RING, but Johnny doesn't move from
          the board.

                        Maybe Portland Chemical is
                          connected to a defense contractor
                        that's going to work on a bomb.

                        Or maybe somebody on the inside
                        is dirty.

          RING.  Bruce glances at the phone, wondering if Johnny's
          going to pick it up.  He just stares at the board.

                                        BRUCE
                        I mean, how else could your former
                        student be involved with the end
                        of the world?

          RING.  Another glance.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you gonna grab that?

          Johnny looks back, snapping out of his focus on the board.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

          The MACHINE PICKS UP and we HEAR Alex Conners' voice...

                                        ALEX'S VOICE
                        Hey, Mister Smith, it's Alex. 
                        Good news.  Got the thumbs up on
                        you spending the day in my lab. 
                        You should pop by in the morning. 
                        It'll be like old times. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Old times -- or End Times?

                                                                                  CUT TO:


1212A NUCLEAR MUSHROOM CLOUD (RESEARCH LAB)

            Actually, it's digitized -- part of a game being played
          on a PC. 

          REVEAL TREY WALTERS, 21, prodigy, aspiring scientist but
          he dresses like a skateboarder.  Doesn't look a day over
          17.  Trey isn't angry at the world, just annoyed with it.

                        I've had warmer welcomes.

          Trey TURNS...

            REVEALING Johnny, a Portland Chemical "VISITOR" BADGE
          pinned on his jacket.  We realize we're in...


  1313INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          The place is advanced, but not sleek or science-fictiony. 
          It's real-world, industrial, workmanlike.  Beakers,
          burners, spin plates and mass spectrometers.  There are
          also pressurized tanks of fuel and other materials.  In
          one corner, a glass-enclosed TESTING ROOM.

          Trey goes back to playing his game. 

                                        TREY
                        You must be the legendary teacher-
                            turned-coma-patient-turned-
                            celebrated-but-slightly-notorious-

                          'Johnny' works.

          Trey glances up.  He likes this guy in spite of himself. 
          Alex slides a piece of paper across to Johnny.

                                        TREY
                        If you wanna hang, our boss says
                        you gotta sign this.  Non-
                          disclosure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You guys deal in top secret stuff?

                                        TREY
                        Worse.  Profit-making stuff.  The
                        suits guard it like pit bulls. 
                        Dr. Conners is upstairs right now
                        with Mrs. Peck.  

          Johnny finishes signing, steps toward the lab center. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Peck.  She the boss?

                                        TREY
                        Yeah, and I'm pretty sure she's
                        got acid for blood. 

          Johnny checks out some of the work stations, poking around
          like a true science geek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is a private company, right?

                        Dude, the check gets direct-
                          deposited every week.  Beyond
                        that, I'm clueless. 

          Johnny arrives at a table with POLYMER SAMPLES on it. 
          Advanced plastics.  Some are cubes, others are flat and
          can be stretched.  Various colors.  Johnny touches a few --
          the way Johnny touches things.  And then, on a dark black
          polymer, he feels a WHOOSH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's gonna end up in snow
                        tires.

          Trey looks up, then is quickly on his feet...

                                        TREY
                        Whoa!  Careful with that one.

          Johnny examines a SAMPLE POLYMER that resembles a thin
          silver-gray SHEATH, stretched across a metal device like
          a drum head.

                        This looks interesting.

          To Trey's shock, Johnny sticks his hand into it.

                                        TREY
                        Hey!

          It immediately GLOMS to the shape of his hand.  He can
          move his fingers freely.

                                        TREY
                        You are gonna get me so fired.

          Johnny is about to remove his hand, when.

                                        ALEX (O.S.)
                        Don't move!

          Enter Alex, moving down the steps behind them.

                                        ALEX
                        Let it process the data.  You can
                        monitor on the flat screen.

          Alex motions to a nearby LCD screen.

                                (removes hand)
                        Okay, now I'm officially impressed.

                                        ALEX
                        It's not perfected yet, but it's
                        close. 

          Alex motions to the polymer.  It has not sprung back.

                                        ALEX
                        It's adaptive, but the micro-
                          structure doesn't allow for
                          reactive formation of the macro-
                        molecules.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (instantly lost)
                        And the former science teacher
                        would be who?

                                        TREY (O.S.)
                        Yes!

          Trey just won on his PSP.

                                        ALEX
                        D'you finally break a level, Big
                        Guy?

                                        TREY
                        Be nice to me, I just vaporized
                        Cleveland.

                          ignoring me.

                        I don't understand.

                                        STILLSON
                        You've made some amazing strides
                        in recent months.  You've got,
                        what, three new transponders? 
                        That makes you a very powerful
                        man.  Dangerous, too.

                        My work is spreading God's message. 
                        That is a powerful calling.  The
                        only 'danger' is in failing to
                        reach all those in need of
                        salvation.

  1515INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - CHEMICAL LAB #348 - DAY

          Alex and Johnny work on a clear DRY ERASE BOARD covered
          in formulas -- intricate "chains" of chemical bonds used
          to map and create polymers.  They jot as they talk, already
          mid-way through an impromptu work session.

                                        ALEX
                        I'll never get the polymer to
                        reshape without the right series
                        of bonds.

          Alex laughs.  Science is hard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we cook up a new batch,
                        see what happens.  Like the old
                        days. 

                                        ALEX
                        Sounds good.
                                (to Trey)
                        Let's do this!

          Alex hits a BOOM BOX with his favorite MUSIC.  As they
          move off, Johnny can't truly enjoy this reunion knowing
          what he knows.


  1616MONTAGE - RESEARCH LAB CLEAN ROOM - DOING THE SCIENCE

          Alex's MUSIC CONTINUES under some of this.  This is the
          "clean room," where the precision stuff gets done.  There
          is also one computer and monitor in here.  Alex and Johnny
          are now in goggles, gloves masks and protective clothing
          (But again, nothing far-fetched).

          They mix SUPERHEATED liquids (monomers) in various beakers. 
          The liquids are extracted from PRESSURIZED TANKS in the
          testing room.  Each has a different chemical symbol and
          various industrial WARNING STICKERS.  Toxic, flammable.

          We get a sense of Alex and Johnny working well together. 
            Clicking.  They pour SUPERHEATED liquid plastic into an
          advanced metal FILTER DEVICE.

                                        ALEX
                        The idea is to capture what forms
                        underneath --

                                        JOHNNY
                        The precipitate.

                                        ALEX
                        You're getting the hang of this.

          Alex collects it, then spreads it over the wafer-thin
          palette.  It begins to cool.  As they work, Johnny catches
          an image "floating" on the computer -- Alex's screensaver.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT ONE - 4/20/05 - GOLD      16.

          It is a PHOTO OF ALEX and his FATHER.  On a boat against
          the water.  Holding up LOBSTERS.  (NOTE: If we have the
          extra playing the Mom, we should snap several combinations
          of the family, just to get some randomizing on the screen.)

                        Pop refuses to dock the boat. 
                        That man is gonna be lobsterin'
                        'til he croaks.  Mom is... mom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They gotta be proud of you.

                                        ALEX
                          I guess. 

          Johnny's fishing now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I mean, Portland Chemical's right*

          he'll have on in Act IV explosion.)

          And there are FLASHBULBS going off. 

          It's all very Fellini -- until Alex begins to SCREAM, his
          SKIN BURNING and CRACKLING like before.  BLUE FIRE begins
          to envelope him, rounded out when...

          The WASHINGTON MONUMENT suddenly appears outside the DOOR! 

          And the entire BUILDING BLOWS UP AROUND JOHNNY, caught in
            a tsunami of NUCLEAR CONFLAGRATION, a FIRE WAVE that just
          doesn't quit until all of OBLITERATED D.C. is exposed --


    1919JOHNNY'S BACK TO REALITY. (RESEARCH LAB)

          Trey eyes him as Johnny's clearly shaken by the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (covering)
                        Forgot how intense this could be.

          Off Trey's watchful eye, we...

          LATER

          Alex steps back in to where the board is.  Johnny comes
          up, gathering his coat.

                          I should be going.  If you need a
                        hand tomorrow...

                                        ALEX
                        Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex.

                                        ALEX
                        It was great seeing you, Teach.

          Johnny can take a hint.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Likewise.

          Johnny's about to go, but--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex.  I don't need psychic powers
                        to know you're letting this get
                        under your skin.
                                (then)
                        You're doing great stuff here. 
                          Remember that.

          Johnny reaches the door:

                                        ALEX
                        Mister Smith?

          Johnny TURNS...

                                        ALEX
                        How's 10 a.m. tomorrow?  You bring
                        the donuts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jelly, chocolate sprinkles.

          Alex nods, as Johnny leaves.


  2121INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

          Johnny takes apart the morning paper.  Bruce is here.

                                        BRUCE
                          Stillson, in a tuxedo.  Then,
                        nuclear hellfire. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        And flashbulbs. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT ONE - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   19.

    21CONTINUED:21

                                        BRUCE
                        This is why I'll never buy a ticket
                        to the theater of your mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These advanced polymers Alex is
                        working on, they seem harmless. 
                        Some of them could be used as
                        artificial skin grafts.  If
                          anything, they're gonna save lives. 

                                        BRUCE
                        But when you touch him...
                                (makes explosion sound)
                        KABOOM!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something strange about that,
                        too.  Before D.C. explodes, Alex
                        gets consumed by fire. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he's not the cause of the
                        blast.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's the flashpoint.

                                        BRUCE
                        My money's on the original Dark
                        Prince. 

          Bruce shows Johnny something he's found in the paper: A
          PHOTO of Greg Stillson waving through a group of reporters. 
          Off Johnny as he studies the photo...


  2222INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Start on a brand new POLYMER, GUNMETAL GRAY, sleek. 
            Stretched over a device.  Alex is at work -- and he clearly
          hasn't slept all night.  He's telling Johnny all about
          it, as Johnny sets down a box of donuts:

                                        ALEX
                        I kept running it through my mind,
                        then at about three this morning,
                        it hit me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You pulled an all-nighter?

                                        ALEX
                        Yeah, and this is what I got to
                        show for it.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT ONE - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   20.

    22CONTINUED:22

          Alex touches it.  It BENDS, but it doesn't quite give. 
          Not very pliable.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't seem right.

                                        ALEX
                        I need to soften it.
                                (hates this part)
                        In about two hours, it'll turn to
                        this.

          He shows a BRITTLE SAMPLE of the polymer.

                                        ALEX
                        It's cool, though -- the micro-
                          structure has significant molecular
                          extension and alignment.

          Trey sees that Johnny is lost.

                                        TREY
                        It's really strong.  I mean, we
                        hit it with everything.  Extreme
                        heat, high-tensile stress tests. 
                        Even that.

          He gestures towards a PRESSURIZED TANK.  A NUCLEAR SYMBOL. 
          Johnny reacts.

                                        ALEX
                                (stretches sample)
                        It's a neutron absorber.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not good news)
                        It's radiation-proof.

                                        ALEX
                        You have any idea what this means?

          Johnny touches the POLYMER --


    2323WHOOOSH!  (RESEARCH LAB - VISION)

            Suddenly, there's an AIR FORCE GENERAL standing next to
          Johnny -- and Alex is there, too (in Act IV wardrobe).

          The Air Force General looks off camera, not directly
          interacting with Alex.

                        We are making significant strides
                        in the defense of our nation. 
                        And we've got Portland Chemical's
                        amazing work to thank for it.

          During this, FLASHBULBS GO OFF again, recalling the
          previous VISION.


  2424BACK ON JOHNNY (RESEARCH LAB)

          His worst nightmare appears to be coming true.

                        Sounds important.

                        Important?  How about earth
                          shattering! 

          [NOTE: Possible Act I break here, OFF Johnny's reaction
          to the above line.  Come back as Alex continues:]

                        You could shield organs around
                        cancer cells -- people won't get
                        their healthy tissue fried during
                          radiation treatment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's incredible, Alex.

                        And a major find for Portland
                          Chemical...

          Enter JUDITH PECK, 45, a corporate taskmaster whose drive
          is only surpassed by her ego.

                                        TREY
                        Goes real nice with profit
                          participation, right?

          She regards Trey as a bug, barely looking at him.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Get me some coffee.

          Trey shoots Johnny a shrug and scampers away.

                          Portland Chemical could not have
                          expanded if you hadn't squeezed
                        those subsidies out of House
                          Appropriations.

                        If the Governator can bring stem
                        cell research to California, I
                        sure as hell can open a spigot
                        for my people.

          She likes him.  Maybe she's taken by him.  Maybe she wants
          to ride him like a wild monkey.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman, I'm not naive.  I
                        know why you're sending funding
                        my way.  You want my hard cash to
                        become your soft money.

                                        STILLSON
                                (plays innocent)

                                        BRUCE
                        You said Alex's work could save
                        lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Until the military gets a hold of
                        it, makes it part of a W.M.D. 
                          Probably a next-generation nuke.
                                (then)
                        I can't let him perfect the
                          process. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny.  Nothing's happened yet. 
                        What if Alex does save some lives. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I gotta believe stopping him will
                        save more.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen to yourself.  You're talking
                        about sabotaging his work.

          As Johnny studies the images on his board.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whatever's gotta be done, right? 
                        It's the Apocalypse.  The Four
                          Horseman are on their way.

          Johnny finds a thin HARDBOUND BOOK in one of the boxes. 
          He flips through it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why don't you just lay it down
                        for him.  Like you did with me. 
                        Tell him everything. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a scientist, Bruce.  Besides,
                        these polymers, they're like his
                        babies.

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, so what're you gonna do?

          Johnny finds the page he's looking for.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex trusts his teacher. 

                                        BRUCE
                                (gets the idea)
                        So you get close and you switch
                          something in the formula.  He'll
                        think it's a design flaw and
                        they'll eventually bury the
                          project.

          That's it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I wish there was another way to
                        do this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not the only one.

          Johnny TEARS OUT THE PAGE from the unseen book.  He TACKS
          it to the Armageddon wall, circles something then exits. 
          Bruce looks at what Johnny just added to the wall:


          A PAGE FROM THE CLEAVES MILLS HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK

          A PHOTO of the SCIENCE CLUB.  In the back: Johnny, the
          teacher.  There's a rambunctious kid off to the side,
          behind a lit bunsen burner: Alex, his face circled in red
          ink.

          Johnny contemplates the DRY ERASE BOARD, as if to steel
          himself for what he has to do. 

                                        TREY (O.S.)
                        Hey.  You mind?

          Trey, behind him, is working the keyboard on a desktop.

                                        TREY
                        Gotta make sure we get this right.

          He hits some keys and there's a FLASH of light, like a
          photo flash, from the dry erase board.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT TWO - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   26.

    28CONTINUED:28

          Johnny looks at TREY'S SCREEN.  A perfect image of the
          board has been preserved on the computer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's where all the formulas get
                        stored?

                                        TREY
                        Right onto 'Seven-of-Nine.'

          Trey shows a REMOVABLE HARD-DRIVE connected to the system.

                                        TREY
                        Seven terabytes.  The magic lives
                        here.

          We see the wheels spinning in Johnny's head, as Alex
          appears behind them.

                                        ALEX
                        How 'bout we make some?

          Boom box.  More tunes.  Johnny hates himself for what
          he's about to do.

          Johnny and Alex wear protective gear as before.  A new
          sample is mixed.  Alex comes by, checks some digital
            readouts.  Adjusts settings. 

          After he passes, Johnny changes the setting. 

          Johnny is already hating himself.

                          disciples that the greatest
                          commandment was to love your God. 
                        But equally important was a new
                          commandment: thou shalt love thy
                          neighbor as thyself.  Matthew
                        writes that on these two

  3131INT.  FAITH HERITAGE - CORRIDOR NEAR PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Purdy walks, an ASSISTANT (Male, mid-20s, clean-cut) talks.

                                (knowing, almost to

                        There could be something wrong
                        with the uplinks. 

          Purdy looks down the hall.  Through his partially opened
          door, Purdy sees...  MALCOLM JANUS fiddling with a
            paperweight.

                                        PURDY

                        down.  I have a feeling the problem
                        will fix itself.

          Off the confused assistant...


  3232PURDY'S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

          The knick-knack Janus holds is a FAITH HERITAGE paper
          weight, an acrylic ball with a GLOBE in the center.  "Faith
          Heritage - THE WORD, THE WORLD," it says.

                        posing and preening.  Over-sized
                        women holding leashes.

          Purdy is at a complete loss.

                          blocking the dish on the roof of
                        my house.  Just like that I'm
                        left sitting in the dark.  All
                        alone.

          Purdy now understands the subject of their conversation.

                                        PURDY
                        I did not reject Greg Stillson's
                          request.  I simply refused --

                        Thing about those satellite
                        companies.  Once you buy the
                        equipment, they make you sign
                        your life away.  Do I make myself
                          understood? 

          Janus spins the paperweight on the desk and looks up at
          Purdy:

                          I already have.

          Janus walks out as Purdy watches him go, then hastily
          catches the heavy paper weight just as it spins off the
          edge of the desk.  He considers it as the world rests in
          the palms of his hands.

                        The CEO says young Alex is onto
                          something big.  They could announce
                          something within the month.  That
                        means the stock price could
                        skyrocket.  There's just one

          Janus closes his cell phone, considers his next move...

          Alex, with goggles and gloved hands, tests a new sample
          of the SILVER POLYMER.  Johnny is next to him.  It gives. 
          It stretches.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's it look?

                                        ALEX
                        Good.  Very...

          But then, SNAP!  It's toast.  And Alex is pissed.

          Johnny knows it's his doing, but has to play against it.

                                        ALEX
                        I don't understand.  I went over
                        the numbers three times...

                        A fully pliable neutron absorber...
                        maybe it's not possible.

                          Whatever happened to pushing the

          And as Johnny despises himself even more, we HEAR the
          SOUNDS of CHAOS and EXPLOSIONS, putting us KNEE-DEEP in...


  3737INT. BANNERMAN HOME - NIGHT

          ...an X-Box game, MechAssault 2, a first-person shooter. *
          REVEAL Johnny and J.J. thrashin' each other.  Sarah's in
          the b.g. watching.  Johnny isn't that focused, so J.J.
          takes him out.

                                        J.J.
                        Come on -- you're lettin' me cream
                        you!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need a breather.  Wreak some
                        havoc on your own.

          Johnny heads into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes from a
          tension (and X-Box) headache.  He finds some TYLENOL GEL
          CAPS and pops them open.  Sarah gets him a glass of water.

                                        SARAH
                        He's right.  You were barely paying
                        attention.

          Johnny cops to nothing.  Sarah knows something's up.

                                        SARAH
                        That reunion was something else,
                        huh?  All those guys could talk
                        about was senior year at the Museum
                        of Science.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sometimes I wish the biggest thing
                        in my life was planning a lousy
                        twelfth grade field trip.

                                        SARAH
                        The world changed, Johnny.  Doesn't
                        mean you have to.

          A NOISE, and a dust-covered Walt lumbers through the
          basement door, carrying ripped-out wood and 2x4's.

                                        WALT
                        I'm gonna have to rent a bin for
                        all this stuff.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doin' down there?

                        Converting the basement.  We might
                        need the extra room.

          As Walt moves out, he fires a look at Sarah, who shoots a
          smile back.  Johnny catches it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah.  You aren't...

          Johnny makes a "pregnant belly" motion with his hand.

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Not yet anyway.

          The idea at first crushes Johnny, then he shakes off those
          old feelings and gives her a smile.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's great.  That's really great.

                                        SARAH
                        We don't want J.J. to be an only
                        child.  And besides, Walt and I
                        would love to have a child of our
                        own. 
                                (awkward beat)
                        That came out wrong.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's alright.  I understand.

          The awkwardness continues.  Johnny cuts it with:

                                        JOHNNY
                                (joking)
                        Hey, I could help you out if you
                        want -- tell you if it's a boy or
                        a girl.

          Johnny playfully reaches for her, but her reaction catches
          him by surprise:

                                        SARAH
                        No!

          She jumps back, surprising even herself.

                                        SARAH
                        I just don't want to find out
                        that way.

          Johnny feels like a total freak -- instead of handing her
          back the cup of water, he knows to just set it down.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I should get going.  Tell J.J. I
                        had to run. 

          Johnny heads to the door and looks back...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm really happy for you, Sarah.

          He leaves.  Sarah ponders the moment, as...


  3838INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          SNAP!  Another POLYMER SAMPLE fails in Alex's hands. 
          Johnny looks on.  We can tell he's just completed more
          sabotage -- and no, he's still not proud of it.

          Alex trades another look with Trey. 

                                        ALEX
                                (to Trey)
                        We get the same result?

                        What's the problem?

                                        ALEX
                        We've run five samples today. 
                        And every one -- every single one --
                        tanked because something was off
                        on your end. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        My end?

                                        ALEX
                        What is it?  Are you jealous? 
                        Can't stand to see one of your
                          students pass you by?

                        who can't teach -- sabotage.

          Alex, frustrated, tosses a busted piece of the FAILED
          POLYMER at him.  Johnny catches it, and--


  3939MATCH, MOVE, MORPH AROUND THEM (CHEMICAL LAB #348-VISION)

          And Alex, holding his own piece of the POLYMER, approaches
          the dry-erase board with Trey.  Vision Johnny observes.

                        map.

          They share a high-five.  Alex goes to the board and circles
          something.  When he circles it, he presses too hard and
          the BOARD slips, knocking some plastic beakers over. 
          Alex laughs at himself, rights the board.

                          Congressman Stillson was concerned
                        when I told him Johnny Smith has
                        been monitoring your work.

  4040BACK ON JOHNNY (RESEARCH LAB)

          He flashes out of the vision...

                        What's the matter?  Seeing things?

                        Your work's gonna be used in other
                        ways, Alex.  Ways you won't be so
                        proud of.

                                        ALEX
                        I don't believe you.

                          breakthrough.

          Two Portland Chemical SECURITY GUARDS arrive and "escort"
          Johnny out.  But he gets one more thing in:

                                        JOHNNY
                        And after that -- that's when
                        you're gonna meet him, Alex. 
                        You'll know him when you meet
                        him!  The man we have to stop! 
                        The man at the top!

          They take him away, and for a moment, it's easy to
          understand why some people see Johnny Smith as a madman.

                                        TREY
                        He still your hero?

                                        ALEX
                        I hope he gets some help, that's
                        all.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  4141INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why didn't you just tell him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They were dragging me out.  Only
                        thing they forgot was the
                          straightjacket.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you should grow a beard and
                        get a cardboard sign that says
                        'The end is near.'

          Not funny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, if you saw Alex laughin' it
                        up with the Dark Prince, then
                        that's your answer.  The future
                        connection with Stillson is giving
                        you the Armageddon vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But Alex is in the vision too. 
                        He's the first one to die.

          The VISION.  Alex, consumed by BLUE FLAME, then the
          ARMAGEDDON WAVE takes them.


  4343BACK TO SCENE

          As we reveal Johnny is holding the INDIAN HEAD NICKEL --
          the one Alex returned to him earlier.  Johnny is lost in
          thought, circling an emotional black hole about the kid.

          Bruce, also at a loss, searches for a way to help.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is crazy, man.  You cannot
                        keep living like this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You think I want this?  You think
                        I like the fact that I can't shake
                        somebody's hand without seeing
                        crazy things?

                                        BRUCE
                        That's not what I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (his blood is up)
                        What do you mean?

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe there's nothing we can do
                        to stop the end of the world. 
                        Maybe the prophets got it right,
                        you know?  It's just... supposed
                        to happen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not asking me to give up.

                                        BRUCE
                          I learned to stop doing that a
                        long time ago, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good. 

          Johnny exits.  Bruce is increasingly concerned about him.


  4444INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - CHEMICAL LAB #348 - DAY

          Alex shares a high-five with Trey.  Just like Johnny's
          previous VISION.  Alex makes a circle on the board.  It
          CLANKS and knocks over the plastic beakers.

          Now, things are NOT QUITE like the previous VISION.  The
          realization is hitting Alex...

                        over -- right after you have the
                          breakthrough.

          Security guards take him away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's when you're gonna meet
                        him, Alex.

                        at the top!


  4646BACK TO SCENE (CHEMICAL LAB #348)

          Alex takes in what just happened.  He tries to right the
          board, it makes another NOISE, then FALLS BACK.

                                        JUDITH PECK (O.S.)
                        The sounds of progress, I hope.

          Alex spins around.  Enter Judith Peck.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Dr. Conners.  I have someone I
                        want you to meet.   

          Enter Stillson.  The politician's smile on full.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman Greg Stillson.  Alex
                          Conners.

          Alex tries to get his mind what has just happened.  The
          ongoing realization that Johnny was right.  Unlike before:

                                        ALEX
                        Wow... this is a surprise.

          Stillson shakes his hand.

                                        STILLSON
                        And an honor -- for me.  I
                        understand you're a true Maine
                        success story.

                                        ALEX
                        I guess so.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman Stillson was concerned
                        when I told him Johnny Smith had
                        been monitoring your work.

                                        ALEX
                        Really?  You know Mister Smith?

                                        STILLSON
                        Our paths have crossed.  He's not
                        around, is he?

                                        ALEX
                        No.  We're, uh, finished.

          But Stillson, somehow, is not convinced...


  4747EXT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL PARKING LOT - LATER

          Stillson gets in his limo.  Janus is here.

                                        STILLSON
                        I want Smith kept away from here.

                                        JANUS
                        My sources tell me he was thrown
                        out yesterday.

                                        STILLSON
                        If Smith derails that kid's work,
                        he derails the money train.

                        I've got it under control.

                        Do you?  That freak is up to
                        something.  What if Smith's meeting
                        this kid outside the lab?  Follow

                                (unfazed)
                        It's under control.


  4848EXT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce pull up alongside a wall in Bruce's
          Murano.  They get out and move alongside the building.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure this is a good idea? 
                        They're just gonna toss you again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I'm right, my vision came true
                        and he's already met Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        So now what?

          Johnny motions to Alex's motorcycle.  Parked near the
          door.

                        I'm gonna wait for Alex.  Find a
                        way to convince him that what
                        he's doing is going to be very
                        bad for everyone.

                                        BRUCE
                        How you plan to do that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  Maybe you're right,
                        maybe I just need to lay it all
                        out.

          Johnny stops at the motorcycle, touches it. 


    4949WHOOOSH! 

          Alex is there.  Leaving work.

          Vision Johnny observes.  Alex walks past him...

          And Alex DOES NOT see the Dark-suited Man near the side
          of the building.  Just... watching.  Alex gets on his
          bike and leaves.  Dark-suited Man goes to a car, gets in. 
          He and his accomplice (Sidekick) follow.

          When Alex pulls out, the sedan cuts him off.  Alex
          innocently wonders who these guys are.  But when they get
          out, they move toward him, menacingly...


  5050BACK ON JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're coming for Alex.


  5151EXT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Alex walks to his motorcycle.

    51CONTINUED:51

          We notice a BLACK SEDAN in the corner of the parking lot. 
          Sitting there.  Dark-suited Man watches. 

          Alex rides off.  He does not notice the CAR follow him.


  5252EXT. PARKING LOT ENTRANCE - SECONDS LATER

          Alex stops, where Bruce's Murano is near the exit.  Bruce
          drives, Johnny rides shotgun. 

          Johnny rolls down the window, calls to Alex, who still
          has his helmet on.

                                        ALEX
                        Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're being followed.  Don't
                        look back!  Just keep going.

                                        ALEX
                        Where?

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Field trip.'  Twelfth grade.

          Alex gives a slight nod, takes off.  Johnny sits back in
          the passenger seat, hiding from the car behind them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hold on!

          When the BLACK SEDAN goes to follow, Bruce pulls into the
          middle of the street, cutting it off -- as if he were
          trying to make a wide right.  The Men HONK at Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                                (plays innocent)
                        Sorry!  My fault!  Just learned
                        to drive a stick!

          The diversion is enough to let Alex get away to...


  5353EXT. MAINE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE & NATURE - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce pull up and get out in front of the
          striking structure.  A sign reads: "Maine Museum of Science
          & Nature."  There's no one around.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he misunderstood you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or maybe he just didn't trust me.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT THREE - 4/20/05 - GREEN    42.

            Suddenly, Alex steps out from the darkness. 

                                        ALEX
                                (to Johnny)
                        It happened.  I had the
                          breakthrough, the beakers fell. 
                        Then Peck came in with that
                          Stillson guy.  Just like you said.

                                        BRUCE
                        Funny how that works, ain't it?

                                        ALEX
                        I'm a man of science, but I can't
                        find a rational explanation for
                        it.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's no explanation.  It's...
                        cosmic. 

                                        ALEX
                        You wanna tell me what my local
                          Congressman's got to do with it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Greg Stillson can't be allowed to
                        exploit your work. 

                                        ALEX
                        It's going to be converted, isn't
                        it?  Used in some kind of weapon. 
                          A W.M.D.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess there's a reason you're the
                        star pupil.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (you knew)
                        You knew?

          Alex pulls a POLYMER SAMPLE from his pocket (the one he
          tossed at Johnny earlier).

                                        ALEX
                        It's always been in the back of
                        my mind.  I knew my research could
                        exploited.  But there's more,
                        isn't there?

          Johnny hesitates, but his eyes give him away.

                                        ALEX
                        When you touch me, what do you
                        see?

          Johnny hesitates...

                                        BRUCE
                        Tell him, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I see fire.  I see the end of the
                        world.

          Alex tries to take it all in, but how?

                                        ALEX
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        BRUCE
                        That'a boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Alex)
                        It's too dangerous.

                                        ALEX
                                (re: the polymer)
                          I created this.  My mind, my hands
                        brought it to life.  Somebody's
                        gotta be the vanguard against
                        these bastards, right?  Might as
                        well be us, Teach.

          The mentor finds surprising inspiration from his student. 
          Johnny takes the sample from Alex, and-- WHOOOSH!


  5454INT. PORTLAND CHEMICAL - RESEARCH LAB - VISION - DAY

          Remember that AIR FORCE GENERAL?  He's still here, buried
          in the flashbulbs.  Alex is here, too.  WE PICK UP THE
          PREVIOUS VISION.  As before, the General looks offscreen.

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        And we've got Portland Chemical's
                        amazing work to thank for it...
                                (new from here)
                        Their advanced, next-generation
                          polymers have allowed us to contain
                        the core of a tactical nuclear
                        weapon.

          We arrive at a spherical WEAPON CORE -- constructed
          entirely of Alex's silver polymer.  The General holds it
          up for an O.S. audience. 

          VISION Johnny watches, nearby.

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Don't worry, people -- it's not a
                        live one.

          FLASHBULBS (not on Johnny).  And laughter, coming from...
            a coterie of SENATOR TYPES and low-level AIR FORCE STAFFERS
          (with digital cameras).  Among them is Judith Peck.  This
          is not a press conference, but a private showing of next-
          gen technology.

                        Pick your delivery system, folks.

          The General places the weapon core inside a next-gen
            artillery shell.  He sets the artillery shell next to a
          handheld rocket launcher. 

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Another reason for our enemies to
                        fear us.

          The General motions toward a door. 

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Now, I'd like to introduce the
                        man who helped spearhead these
                        and other achievements in our
                          nation's security.  We had to
                        pull him out of a fancy banquet,
                        but he insisted on coming by. 
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the President
                        of the United States! 

          Enter President Greg Stillson -- directly crossing Johnny.  
          In a tux.  Just like the previous vision.  FLASHBULBS.


  5555BACK AT THE MUSEUM

          Johnny can hardly believe what he's just seen.

                                        BRUCE
                        Talk to me, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Stillson.  He was different.

                                        BRUCE
                        Different?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was the President of the United
                        States.

  5656EXT. MAINE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE & NATURE - MORNING

          Bruce sleeps near the wooden buildings on the side. 
          There's a fire in embers.  Johnny, looking tired, stares
          out past the building, Alex joins him.

                                        ALEX
                        I've been thinking about it and 
                        it seems to me, we need to trash
                        the hard drive and burn the
                          samples.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  But I should go.

                                        ALEX
                        You?  After the other day, you
                        won't get anywhere near that lab.

          Johnny knows he's right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't let you destroy your life's
                        work.

                                        ALEX
                        First of all, I'm only 27.  Second,
                        you aren't my teacher anymore. 
                        You aren't 'letting' me do
                          anything.  We have to stop this.

          Johnny understands his former student's determination.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (thinking it through)
                        Go back to the lab.  Keep doing
                        what you're doing.  Tell them
                        it's just not working.  That'll
                        buy me some time. 

                                        ALEX
                        To do what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Make a deal.          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   46.

  5757EXT. STABLE - DAY

          Where we saw Janus setting up a Stillson event earlier. 
          A black limo has just pulled up near a sign reading:
          "UNITED MAINE CHARITIES, ANNUAL SHOWJUMPING EVENT."


  5858INT. THE LIMO - DAY

          START on Janus' distinctive ring, as he holds his cell
          phone.

                                        JANUS
                        Dr. Conners is in possession of
                          Portland Chemical's intellectual
                          property.  I want it returned.

          Janus hangs up the cell phone, and we REVEAL he's in the
          back seat with Stillson.

                                        STILLSON
                        Smith won't quit that easy.

                                        JANUS
                        Stay focused on the prize.  There's
                        someone I want you to meet.

                                        STILLSON
                        Another cash cow?

                                        JANUS
                        Just make sure you see Gene Purdy. 

                                        STILLSON
                        The Reverend's here?

                                        JANUS
                        He's going to introduce you.


  5959EXT. STABLE - DAY

          Stillson moves through the stable with Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm heartened by the fact that we
                        could work out our differences.

                                        STILLSON
                        Never doubted your enthusiasm for
                        the cause.

                                        PURDY
                                (sees someone O.S.)
                        Ah, here he is now.

          Purdy leads Stillson to senior SENATOR HARLAN ELLIS.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/20/05 - GOLD      47.

    59CONTINUED:59

                                        PURDY
                          Congressman Stillson, I'd like
                        you to meet--

                                        STILLSON
                        Senator Harlan Ellis.  Sir, it is
                        an honor.  You're a legend in
                        Maine politics.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        Christ almighty, am I that old?
                                (then)
                        Sorry, Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        You're absolved, Senator.

          An ND PURDY AIDE comes up, whispers in his ear.  He peels
          off as we linger on Stillson and Ellis.

                                        STILLSON
                        I've been wanting to meet you for
                        years, sir.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        We share the same constituents,
                        son.  It's a good thing for us to
                        meet outside the beltway, get
                        back to our people -- touch the
                        natives as it were.

          As Ellis goes on, Stillson spots a CAPTIVATING YOUNG WOMAN
          dismount from a beautiful horse.  She wears riding
            (showjumping) attire. 

          Sen.  Ellis catches Stillson watching the YOUNG WOMAN.

                                        STILLSON
                        Now that's a constituent worth
                        wooing.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                                (with a smile)
                        That's my daughter, Miranda.

                                        STILLSON
                          Senator--

                                        SEN. ELLIS

                        It's alright.  I was young once.

                        This is Greg Stillson.  Greg is a
                          Congressman.  A young man with a
                        very bright future.

                                        STILLSON
                        My pleasure.

          They shake hands.  Stillson is clearly taken by her.

                                        STILLSON
                        You look like you were born in
                        the saddle.

                        Are you a rider?

                                        STILLSON
                        No, but I'm a lethally quick study.

          Oh, yeah.  He likes her.


  6060EXT. LIMO - LATER THAT DAY

          Stillson is led to his limo door by the Driver.  Before
          he gets in, he tosses one last look toward the house.

          Miranda, headed inside, glances back.  A traded smile. 
          Greg gets in the limo, brimming with bravado, only to
          find...


  6161INT. LIMO - DAY

          Johnny waits inside.  Stillson is caught by surprise.

                                        STILLSON
                        Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to work on your security.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're like a wad of chewing gum
                        I can't scrape off the bottom of
                        my shoe.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we're connected by destiny.

                                        STILLSON
                        Scary thought.  What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want Alex Conners left alone.

                                        STILLSON
                        Do you now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want your people to back off
                        and let him walk away.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's so important about Conners?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't matter, I just want
                        your word he'll be safe.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm a politician.  My 'word' is
                        gonna cost you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You want a check -- like Reverend
                        Purdy?  Portland Chemical?

                                        STILLSON
                        You may find this shocking, but
                        unless there's some campaign
                        finance reform bill I don't know
                        about, I'm not doing anything
                          illegal. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of course not.  But you live in
                        the loop holes, don't you? 

                                        STILLSON
                        From what I understand, Conners'
                        work is going to save lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The research is flawed.  It's
                          useless.  I don't want a public
                        failure to ruin his career.

                                        STILLSON
                        And you are offering...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Myself.  Stay away from Alex
                          Conners, I'll stay away from you.

          Stillson considers this.

                                        STILLSON
                        You really think you should play
                        that card so early in the game?

          Johnny holds out his hand.  Stillson considers it again,
          then... Stillson shakes Johnny's hand.


  6262BRIEF VISION - A TASTE OF ARMAGEDDON

          We see FIRE in Johnny's EYES... then, we HOLD on STILLSON
          and only see the GLOW of fire and RAGING EXPLOSIONS,
          flashing instead BACK TO....


  6363JOHNNY

          As Stillson watches him have a VISION.  Stillson is taken
          aback by it.

                                        STILLSON
                        My God, you're a man possessed,
                        aren't you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do we have a deal?

          Stillson nods.  Johnny rushes out of there.  Stillson
          pulls his phone, hits a SPEED DIAL.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you find him yet?  Good, take
                        him in.


  6464EXT. MAINE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE & NATURE - DAY

          Bruce's Murano pulls up, Johnny gets out.  But as he
          approaches, he sees no one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex?

          He sees Alex's tipped over motorcycle and helmet.  Then
          he spots Bruce.  Beaten bloody.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm sorry, John...

          Johnny finds Alex's HELMET, picks it up and--


  6565VISION - MOMENTS BEFORE

          Alex puts the HELMET on and gets on his bike.  Headed
          back to the lab.  He waves so long to Bruce -- who is
          suddenly accosted by Dark-suited Man!  Bruce puts up a
          fight.  It takes the two of them to knock him out.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   51.

    65CONTINUED:65

          Alex runs toward his motorcycle.  He gets on.  Races away --
          but the second Man (Sidekick) is still in the car.

          He pulls it forward and cuts Alex off.

          Alex SPINS the bike around -- rooster-tailing sand and
          gravel behind him -- as he races the other way --

          But by then, the first Dark-Suited Man KNOCKS HIM OFF THE
          BIKE!  It slides to where Johnny just found it.

          Dark-suited Man reaches into his jacket... 

          Alex, on the ground, has nowhere to run.  Ready to die.

          But the Man only removes a MANILA ENVELOPE and tosses it
          at Alex.  Alex opens it.  Looks at something inside.

                                        ALEX
                        What do you want?

                        You. 

          Alex drops the envelope. 

          Filled with resignation, Alex goes with the two Men. 
          Willingly.  Gets in the car.  Drives away.  We FIND the
          manila envelope on the ground and FLASH BACK TO...


  6666JOHNNY IN THE PRESENT

          Bruce, conscious now, follows him, as they search the
          area.  Johnny finds the manila envelope half-buried in
          sand.  He flips it over to REVEAL...

          A PHOTO -- the picture of Alex and his FATHER (seen on
          the screensaver).

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

          Johnny's heart sinks as he hands the envelope to Bruce. 

                                        BRUCE
                        They threatened his family.

                        There's a shocker for ya.

          Johnny and Bruce pull up.  When Johnny gets to the door--

            WHOOOOSH!  We WHIP down the hall, directly into...


  6868INT. PORTLAND - CHEMICAL LAB #348 - VISION - DAY

          Alex and Judith Peck.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        I'm glad your back with us.

                                        ALEX
                        Never left, Mrs. Peck.  Honestly,
                        I don't know what all the fuss is
                        about.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Good to hear.

          Mrs. Peck exits.  

          And Vision Johnny watches her go.  As Vision Johnny turns
          back to Alex, he realizes his former student has made a
          decision...

          Alex bolts the door from the inside and heads straight
          for the REMOVABLE HARD DRIVE.  Tears it out.  He sets it
          in the center of The PRESSURIZED TANKS near the testing
          room.  He also wipes the DRY ERASE BOARD CLEAN and exits
          the lab.


  6969SERIES OF QUICK CUTS (RESEARCH LAB CLEAN ROOM AND
          ADJACENT CORRIDOR - VISION)

          Alex rigs a gas burner with a HOT BLUE FLAME to FIRE UP
          near a tubing beside the pressurized tanks.  The tubing,
          wrapped in metal, begins to heat up.   Vision Johnny
          watches.

                                        ALEX
                                (to himself)
                          Consider this my letter of
                          resignation.

          Alex makes a quick escape for the door.

          But as soon as he gets to the corridor -- there's Sidekick.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   53.

    69CONTINUED:69

          Alex moves back to another corner.

          Vision Johnny looks back -- THE BURNER begins to burn
          through the TUBING.  

          Alex bolts around a corner -- and Dark-suited Man stops
          him.

                                          DARK-SUITED MAN
                        I'll take that hard-drive now.

                                        ALEX
                        This is private property.  You
                          shouldn't be in here.

                        Call the Sheriff.

          Dark-suited Man shows him a gun and pushes Alex back into
          the lab -- right past Vision Johnny.  And into the ENCLOSED
          TESTING ROOM.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Alex, don't!

          Alex SLAMS the door on him, as the Dark-suited Man and
          Sidekick appear in the window at each door.  Alex, caught
          in a moment of rage and desperation, yells at them through
          the glass:

                                        ALEX
                        My work is not gonna be used to
                        kill people.  You got that,
                          assholes!  You hearin' me?!  I'd
                          rather...

          The BURNER eats through the tubing and it CATCHES FIRE,
          moving like a fuse to the tanks and --

          We don't see the explosion, just yet, all we see is--

          And there's a HUGE EXPLOSION.

          All the chemicals go up, creating a MASSIVE WALL of SUPER-
          HOT BLUE FIRE.

          And we understand, this was the death of Alex Johnny was
          seeing all along.

          Johnny is KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET, as the blast wave rocks
          the entire area.

          Johnny scrambles to his feet and hurries towards the lab. 
          He climbs through the shattered door and over some
          smoldering debris, until he locates Alex Conners' badly
          injured body.  Johnny lifts some debris off of him and
          cradles his bloody body in his arms.  Bruce appears in
          the shattered doorway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We need an ambulance!  Now!

          Bruce rushes off.  Alex comes to...

                                        ALEX
                        Did they get it?  They get my
                        work?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They didn't get it, Alex. 

          Alex struggles to sit up, but realizes he can't.  Johnny
          realizes Alex is fading. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang on...

                        Shoulda kept your old man's nickel.

          Alex dies in Johnny's arms.  Off this powerful moment of
          courage and sacrifice, we...

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:


  7272EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY

          MUSIC RISES as we are OVER Alex's coffin.  Among the
            mourners: ALEX'S PARENTS, working class, middle-aged. 
          Then Trey, and Bruce, and Sarah and Walt...

          And finally Johnny.  The ceremony wraps up as everyone
          begins to disperse.

          But Johnny stays behind.  He approaches the coffin.

          Behind Johnny, ALEX'S FATHER catches sight of him.

                                        ALEX'S FATHER
                        Mr. Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Conners... I'm... I'm sorry
                        about Alex. 

                                        ALEX'S FATHER
                        From what I understand, you did
                        everything you could to protect
                        my son.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure that's true.

                                        ALEX'S FATHER
                        Alex and I used to talk about
                        you.  He said you were the one
                        who inspired him to be great.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was the brightest student I
                        ever had.  But I like to think we
                        were friends, too.

                                        ALEX'S FATHER
                        I know that's how he felt about
                        you.

          Alex's Father shakes Johnny's hand.  He and his wife go.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   56.

          Johnny's about to go, when he reaches into his pocket and
          places something on the coffin.

          TILT DOWN to the coffin and REVEAL...

          His lucky INDIAN-HEAD NICKEL.  And...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  7373INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - ARMAGEDDON WALL - DAY

          Johnny sits in front of the board, still dressed in his
          funeral suit.  He holds a piece of paper in his hand, but
          we can't see what it is.  Bruce is here too.

                                        BRUCE
                        T.V. says the explosion was an
                          accident.  No mention of Stillson.

          But Johnny is elsewhere.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was so sure Alex was connected
                        to Armageddon.  

                                        BRUCE
                        He was.  You saw Alex die in that
                        fire.  From the very beginning. 
                        But it was his future connection
                        to Stillson that made you see
                          Armageddon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I hadn't said anything, he'd
                        still be alive.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't know that.  Maybe Alex
                        was destined to die the way he
                        did.  Only God knows what might
                        have happened if he hadn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what do I do now?

          Bruce puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder.

                                        BRUCE
                        You rest.  And you mourn your
                        friend.  There's still time to
                        figure it out. 
                                (re: Johnny's paper)
                        He's not going anywhere.

          Bruce squeezes Johnny's shoulder, exits.

          Johnny considers the paper in his hand, then RISES and
          pins it on the board.  As he walks away as the CAMERA
          REVEALS a photograph of Greg Stillson.  The SHOT PUSHES
          SLOWLY TIGHT on his face and...


  7474INT. JANUS' SUV - NIGHT

          SOMEONE holds a REMOVABLE HARD DRIVE, as we PAN UP to
          REVEAL MISTER JANUS...

                                        JANUS
                        You copied all of Conners' files?*

          REVEAL lab assistant Trey Walters, in his funeral attire.*

                                        TREY
                        It's all there.

          But then Trey gulps.*

                                        TREY
                        Um, except... *
                                (forced smile)*
                        Dude.  I, uh, hadn't totally backed*
                        up the last day's work.*
                                (off Janus' look)*
                        But, hey, you guys can find some*
                        genius to figure it out, right? *

                                        JANUS*
                        Sounds doable.*

                                        TREY*
                        This won't affect my fee, will*
                        it?  *

          Janus considers Trey, then nods to Sidekick, who hands*
          the kid a fat envelope.

                                        TREY
                        Do I need to count it?

          Janus doesn't think so.  But Trey is pushing it:*

                                        TREY
                        This wouldn't be happening if
                        they'd treated me with a little
                          respect.

                                        JANUS
                        Respect is earned, Mr. Walters.

          Trey feels the chill.  He OPENS the door to leave, then...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/20/05 - GOLD      58.

    74CONTINUED:74

                                        TREY*
                        I don't ever want to see you people
                        again.

          He gets out and shuts the door, as the Limo drives away
          leaving the kid rich and alone.  It's chilling to consider
          what might happen next...

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
