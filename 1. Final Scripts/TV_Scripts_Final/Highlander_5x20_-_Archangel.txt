      FADE IN:

18011801EXT.  STREET NEAR QUAI DE LA TOURNELLE - NIGHT

      Late night.  Foggy.  The sounds of police SIRENS echo in the
      air as MacLeod and Richie stroll home, dressed in elegant
      formal evening wear.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm sorry, Mac, but I just don't get
                    opera.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It would help if you spoke Italian.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's not that.  It's just what's the
                    point?  What's opera got to say about
                    today?

                                      MACLEOD
                    The same thing it had to say a hundred
                    years ago.  The world's not that
                      different.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't know.  I think things are
                    getting worse.  Just turn on the
                    tube.

      A POLICE CAR goes by, its light flashing.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                          (re the police car)
                    Or take a walk.

18021802EXT.  QUAI DE LA TOURNELLE - NIGHT

      An old man, JASON LANDRY, stands in the shadows watching the
      barge.  His breathing is labored and ragged -- he looks wild-
      eyed, frightened and desperate.  Above him, MacLeod and Richie
      are coming down the stairs.

                                      RICHIE
                    Watching some fat guy sing for four
                    hours about his lost love is not
                    only irrelevant, it's just plain
                    lame.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      2.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

1802CONTINUED:1802

      They approach the gangplank to the barge.

      LANDRY

      lurches from the shadows.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    Please, I have to know!  Are you
                    Duncan MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm MacLeod.

                                      LANDRY
                    Thank God... I've come to warn you!
                          (leaning closer)
                    The time is at hand... the millennium
                    is upon us... HE is coming!

      MacLeod and Richie trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (humoring him)
                    I'm sure he is.  But it's late, and
                    I think you're a little confused...

      Landry grabs MacLeod's jacket with a surprising strength.

                                      LANDRY
                    Listen to me while there's still
                    time!  You must stop him, MacLeod...
                    you alone!
                          (beat)
                    God help you, you're the only one
                    who can.

      As MacLeod moves to disengage himself  -

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE EMBANKMENT

      a man in a tuxedo, a RED scarf around his neck, stands at
      the railing, not moving, gazing down at MacLeod -- JAMES
      HORTON.

      MacLeod stares, not believing his eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You!

      And we FLASH TO:

      EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY (FOOTAGE FROM EP.  # 93222)

      Horton turns to face MacLeod.  He pulls a knife.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pointing to his neck)
                    You have one chance.  Right here.

      Horton charges MacLeod, who with one quick move, buries the
      blade in Horton's gut.

18031803EXT.  QUAI DE LA TOURNELLE - NIGHT - RESUME

      MacLeod shakes his head, thinking his eyes must be playing
      tricks -- but the vision is still there.

      HORTON

      smiles faintly.  He turns and steps back into darkness.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Horton.

      Mystified, Richie follows MacLeod's gaze to --

      RICHIE'S POV - THE EMBANKMENT

      empty.  Not a soul in sight.

                                      RICHIE
                    Who?

                                      MACLEOD
                    James Horton... he was right there!

      He starts for the stairs.  Landry tries desperately to hold
      onto him.

                                      LANDRY
                    No!  You don't know what you're
                    facing!

      But MacLeod pulls away, intent on this ghost from his past. 
      He hits the stairs at a run.  Landry grabs onto Richie.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    You have to stop!
                          (he calls after MacLeod)
                    He's here for you.

18041804EXT.  QUAI DE LA TOURNELLE - EMBANKMENT - SAME TIME - NIGHT

      MacLeod reaches the embankment to find...

      HORTON

      watching him.  He's not moving a muscle -- so still that
      it's eerie, unreal.  When his lips move, they're oddly slack. 
      It's as if he might be dead.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How?

                                      HORTON
                    The question you have to ask yourself
                    is...
                          (beat)
                    "... is he real?  Has Horton really
                    come back from the dead... or have I
                    gone insane?"

      His features twitch into a mocking smile.

                                      HORTON (CONT'D)
                    How many more times do you think
                    you'll have to kill me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just once.

      He pulls out the katana, but as he does...

      Horton is gone.  Then, as if coming from a great distance --
      a dry, mocking LAUGH, so faint that it might be imagined.

      MacLeod scans up and down the street in frustration as Richie
      catches up.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    He was here!

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, you killed Horton three years
                    ago.
                          (beat)
                    There's no one here but us.

      INTRUDER'S POV

      (NOTE: The POV will have our reddish tinge) as SOMETHING
      comes along the Quai towards Landry, moving over the ground
      with an eerily fluid SAWING MOTION, as if it could be FLYING. 
      As it draws closer to Landry...

      LANDRY

      feels the PRESENCE looming up behind him.  Filled with sudden
      dread, he turns to face it -- and SCREAMS.

      as Landry's cry reaches them.  LANDRY struggles as INVISIBLE
      HANDS circle his neck, squeezing the life from him.

      We SEE THE IMPRESSIONS on Landry's skin made by the grip of
      UNSEEN FINGERS.  The invisible hands slowly BEND LANDRY BACK,
      forcing him to his knees.

      MACLEOD AND RICHIE

      race down the stairs.

      LANDRY

      amidst the swirling, red-hued fog, topples over, dead.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      An EMERGENCY LIGHT strobes over a stretcher as two AMBULANCE
      ATTENDANTS slide Landry's body into the back of their vehicle. 
      MacLeod and Richie stand by, watching somberly.

                                      RICHIE
                    Dead.  And for what?  Fifty francs
                    and a couple pictures of his

                          (beat)
                    Maybe.

                                      RICHIE
                    Are you serious?  "HE is coming..."?
                    "The time is at hand..."?  He was
                    out of it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He was terrified.
                          (beat)
                    He knew my name.

      The ATTENDANTS shut the doors and get into the vehicle.  It
      pulls away into the night.

                                      RICHIE
                    Horton is dead.  It was dark, we had
                      champagne... you made a mistake.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It was Horton.
                          (beat)
                    That old man was trying to warn me.

                    You think he was a Watcher?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I checked his wrists.  No tattoo.

                                      RICHIE
                    Now what?

      and inscribed on its face -- JAMES HORTON -- 1947-1994.

      And below the stone -- an EMPTY GRAVE, fresh mounds of DIRT
      and CUT SOD piled beside it.

      MacLeod and Richie stand over the empty hole with an older,
      conservatively dressed CEMETERY OFFICIAL.

                    This was not done in my day.  A body
                    was meant to stay in one place, as
                    God intended.

                    That was him.  A nice man... but he
                    seemed in a great hurry.

                    I'm sure he did.

                    There must have been paperwork... an
                    official request to exhume the body.

                                      CEMETERY OFFICIAL
                    In France, monsieur, paperwork is
                    our national pastime.  The body is
                    to be shipped from Orly airport today.
                          (re: the grave)
                    If the dead cannot find peace, then
                    how can the living?

      MacLeod stares down at the OPEN GRAVE, yawning in the earth
      like a dark question waiting for a darker answer.

                                                                  MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

      THE MISSING CASKET

      rolls along, resting on a tractor-drawn CARGO-DOLLY, the
      heavy Empire-style ground-seasoned casket comes to rest in
      front of

      JOE DAWSON

      watching solemnly as a CUSTOMS MAN tests the SEALS on the
      casket, then hands Dawson a shipping-form.  Dawson isn't in
      the greatest frame of mind as he signs and returns the papers.

                                      DAWSON
                    Let's get this over with.

      As the CUSTOMS MAN walks off --

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    If I'd known, I would have sent
                    flowers.

      Dawson turns to see MacLeod and Richie watching him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    My sympathies.  Anyone we know?

      Dawson is taken aback to see them, then tries to recover his
      poise.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is personal business, MacLeod. 
                    It doesn't concern you.

                    I think it does.
                          (harder)
                    Anything to do with Horton concerns
                    me.

      Dawson sees he's caught.

                                      DAWSON
                    His daughter moved to Chicago.  She
                    wants her father buried there.  I'm
                    helping her out.
                          (beat)
                    It's a family thing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A family thing.
                          (beat)
                    Then why hide it from me?

                                      DAWSON
                    Because I know what Horton did to
                    you.  I know how you felt about him.

      MacLeod moves casually to the coffin.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very considerate.

                                      DAWSON
                    What's with you?  The guy was my
                      brother-in-law.  His daughter wants
                    his body brought home.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then she's going to be disappointed.

      Dawson looks at Richie.

                                      DAWSON
                    What the hell's his problem?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I saw him, Dawson.  I saw Horton.
                          (beat)
                    He's alive.

                                      DAWSON
                    What?
                          (beat)
                    Horton is dead, MacLeod.
                          (a low hiss)
                    You killed him yourself!  Remember,
                    I was there.

                    He looked pretty healthy last night.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is insane!  Whatever's left of
                    Horton is lying in that box!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Really.
                          (grim)
                    Then let's wish him bon voyage.

      He grabs a metal PRY-BAR from the DOLLY and starts to RIP
      OPEN the seals.

                                      DAWSON
                    MacLeod, what the hell are you doing!

      MacLeod moves around the dolly, WRENCHING the seals open,
      working his way along the lid.

      BYSTANDERS and MAINTENANCE WORKERS watch in horror, except
      for

      AN ENORMOUSLY FAT MAN

      who seems amused.  On his finger, a ring with a large RED
      stone that seems to GLOW in reflected light.

      A WHISTLE sounds and several SECURITY GUARDS approach.  The
      Customs Man grabs MacLeod's arm.

                                      CUSTOMS MAN
                    Monsieur!

      MacLeod shakes the man off, snaps the last seal, THROWS OPEN
      the casket lid -- and steps back in surprise.

      ANGLE - THE OPEN CASKET

      and the shocking reveal of the NEAR-MUMMIFIED REMAINS of a
      man in a faded suit.

      SECURITY GUARDS grab MacLeod's arms.  He doesn't resist as
      they start to pull him away, past the fat man with the RED
      ring.

      MacLeod moves down the steps from the Police Station, Richie
      at his side.

      MacLeod stops with a scowl -- Dawson is waiting for them.

                    convinced them to drop the charges.

      MacLeod steps up to Dawson.  The two face each other warily.

                                      DAWSON
                    Said you were a friend of the
                    deceased, overcome with emotion.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (not cutting any slack)
                    Nice touch.

                                      DAWSON
                    MacLeod, I don't know what's going
                    on, but I hope it's over.

      They start away.  MacLeod hasn't moved.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not yet.

                                      DAWSON
                    Right, he's down at the park with
                    Elvis and J.F.K., listening to Jerry
                    Garcia.  You think this is some huge

18101810INT.  CITY MORGUE - OUTSIDE VIEWING AREA - EVENING

      MacLeod and Richie wait outside the glass-walled VIEWING
      ROOM where a SHEET-DRAPED CORPSE lies on a gurney.  A bald,
      black, bizarre-looking male, in his thirties.  No visible
      trauma.

      The MEDICAL OFFICER frowns at MacLeod as he removes his
      gloves.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    A murder victim?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He was brought in late last night. 
                    I need to find out who he was.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    I'm sorry, monsieur... but there
                    were no murder victims last night.

      MacLeod and Richie trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There must be some mistake.

                                      RICHIE
                    A man, about sixty, medium height,

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then you did see him.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    He was identified just this morning.
                          (beat)
                    But there was no murder.  Death was

                      bruises... the man was strangled!

      The Medical Officer is losing patience.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    Monsieur, I examined the body myself. 
                    Jason Landry died of a stroke.
                          (cold)
                    There were no marks of any kind.

      MacLeod is starting to feel the walls closing in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Could I see the body?

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    I'm afraid not.  It was claimed by
                    his granddaughter for cremation.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (under his breath)
                    How convenient.

      He starts to turn away.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    Did you say something?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I was wondering if you had an address. 
                    I'd like to pay my respects.

      The Officer weighs this, shrugs.  He turns to a desk, bending
      to examine some forms.  As he bends down --

      MacLeod's gaze travels to the VIEWING ROOM.

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE CORPSE

      lying on the gurney.  As MacLeod watches, the corpse's head
      slowly SWIVELS TOWARD him.  Then the eyes SNAP OPEN.  They
      are blood RED and staring directly at MacLeod -- it is
      WATCHING HIM.

      MACLEOD

      starts back, his hackles rising.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Monsieur?

      A BEAT -- MacLeod realizes the Officer is holding a note for
      him, Richie is staring at him.

      MacLeod quickly looks back into the viewing room --

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE CORPSE

      the head is back where it was, the eyes closed -- all is as
      it was before.

      A wave of unreality sweeps over MacLeod.  He shakes it off.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's get out of here.

                    Twist my arm.

      Richie sees MacLeod's concern and reacts.  He grabs the piece
      of paper from the Medical officer and hurries after MacLeod.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)

18121812INT.  BARGE - NIGHT

      MacLeod moves to the bar and pours himself a drink, looks
      out the porthole at the Quai.  Wondering if he imagined all
      this.  Time to get a grip.

      Then, a REFLECTION in the porthole, over his shoulder:

      KRONOS

      in his Bronze Age Horseman garb and face paint, looking every
      bit the Ancient Evil that he is.

      MACLEOD

      whirls.  Kronos leans casually against the counter, regarding
      MacLeod.

                                      KRONOS
                    Did you really think you could kill
                    me, MacLeod?  I am the apocalypse.

                                      MACLEOD

      Kronos lifts his nasty-edged modern-day sword.

                                      KRONOS
                    Try me.

      MacLeod pulls his katana without looking.

      He feels something wrong in his hand.  He looks down and
      finds he is holding

      HORTON'S MUMMIFIED HEAD

      by the hair.  He throws it across the room.  But what hits
      the wall of the barge is not the head but his katana.

      There is the sound of mocking laughter from outside as MacLeod
      looks up to find Kronos gone.

      MACLEOD

      snatches up the fallen katana and races outside.

1812A1812AEXT.  BARGE - NIGHT

      MacLeod, sword drawn, races out onto the foggy Quai.  He
      turns quickly to the BUZZ, his blade leading.

                                      METHOS
                    It's me!

                    Did you see him?

                    Kronos.

      Methos gives him a look.

                          (careful)
                    Really.

      MacLeod hears the almost concealed doubt.  He pushes by
      Methos.

18131813EXT.  LANDRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

      An ornate older building, divided into private apartments
      with separate entrances.  The street is dark and quiet --
      it's the middle of the night.

18141814INT.  LANDRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

      ALLISON LANDRY, early 20's, sits over a cup of tea, in a big
      sweatshirt, torn jeans, her shock and grief written all over. 
      MacLeod paces, agitated.

                                      ALLISON
                    You're telling me you think someone
                    killed my grandfather?
                          (dubious)
                    The police said it was a stroke.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know what they said.  But I was
                    there.  Someone attacked him.
                          (beat; trying to do
                            this gently)
                    Did he ever mention a man named James
                    Horton?

      She shakes her head.  MacLeod sketches hastily on the back
      of a piece of paper, shows her a CRUDE SKETCH of the Watcher
      symbol.  The sound of a police SIREN echoes in the distance.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    What about this symbol?  Do you know
                    it?

      He watches her reaction.  Her denial seems genuine:

                                      ALLISON
                    No.

      She looks at him a moment, reacting to his intensity.  There's
      something she's not saying.

                                      ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    Before he died... did he say anything?

      She holds her breath, both anticipating and fearing his
      answer.  MacLeod reacts, sensing there's a revelation coming.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What kind of thing?

                          (evasive)
                    What did he say?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He told me the time was at hand.  He
                    said "he" was coming.
                          (off Allison's look)
                    Who did he mean?  Who was he afraid
                    of?

      Allison rises, starts pacing.

                                      ALLISON
                    You won't believe it.  No one would.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You'd be surprised what I'll believe.

                                      ALLISON
                    My grandfather was an archaeologist. 
                    No one in the world knew more about
                    all those weird ancient religions.

                    the fate of the world, where nobody

                    He traveled to India, and Egypt, and
                    Iraq, searching ancient texts for
                    some kind of warning, some hint of
                    how to defeat this great evil he

                    "You must stop him... you alone."

      Allison stares at him in wonder and shock.

                                      ALLISON
                    He said that to you?

                    He was desperate.

      MacLeod follows her into --

18151815INT.  LANDRY'S APARTMENT - STUDY - NIGHT

      A large room, shelved with books, decades of study and
      diligent collection.  On other shelves and on the walls STONE
      CARVINGS, fragments of CLAY TABLETS with ancient writing. 
      Against one wall, a TELEVISION and VCR.  The TV is on. 
      Pictures of the faces of African famine are in black & white,
      replaced by pictures of terrorism in the Middle East.  In
      both segments, we catch glimpses of something RED and glowing
      from a window or a passing car.

                                      NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    The United Nations High Commission
                    for Refugees estimates there will be
                    an additional eight million refugees
                    this year, more than half children.

                    In Jerusalem, a terrorist bomb
                    exploded on a busy street.

      As Allison turns off the TV, MacLeod is thumbing through
      various books on the table.

                                      ALLISON
                    I keep it on just for noise, but I
                    think the news just makes me more
                      depressed.

      There's a battered, leather-bound NOTEBOOK on the table. 
      Landry's journal.  MacLeod leafs through it, his eyes falling
      on various entries.

                      Zoroastrian myths of ancient Persia
                    held the truth about a cycle of evil
                    that visits the earth every thousand
                    years.

      MacLeod stops leafing through the book, staring at the final
      entry.

      INSERT - THE PAGE

      Landry's translation scrawled in the margins: "THE NEXT

      Light flickers eerily over the walls, highlighting STRANGE
      SCRIPT and RELIEF CARVINGS depicting WINGED BULLS and other
      fantastic animals.

                    He knows we're here.

      We hear the voice of the unseen British CAMERAMAN named FOSTER
      making a joke.

                                      FOSTER (O.S.)
                    I hope he's made lunch, because I'm
                    bloody hungry.

      As they reach a section of wall --

                                      LANDRY
                    You're a fool, Foster.  You make
                    jokes when the fate of the world is
                    at stake.

                                      FOSTER (O.S.)
                    Better a fool then a lunatic.  What
                    we have to be afraid of is the damn
                    Iraqi army.

      Landry raises his light to a section of WALL where we see --

        A RELIEF-CARVING

      of a HEAD, distorted and monstrous in the flickering shadows --
      in the center of its forehead is a third, almost glowing,
      RED EYE.  The demon holds a large barbed arrow in each hand.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      Landry and Foster stand in the dim tomb, lit only by Landry's

      Landry raises his light: on either side of the CARVED HEAD,
      there are rows of SYMBOLS resembling cuneiform script.  (This
      is the tablet that was drawn in the final journal entry.)

      Landry runs his hands over the symbols, deciphering as he
      does --

                    It's him, Foster.  It's him.

      Landry turns away from the carved demon and moves to a loose
      section of STONE inscribed with ancient writing, starts to
      pry it out with a chisel.  Foster follows him.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    Are you afraid, Foster?  We should
                    all be afraid.

                    The thousand years are up.  The demon

                    And the dead will rise.

                                      FOSTER
                    You got an vivid imagination, old
                    man.
                          (irritated)
                    C'mon, get what you want and let's
                    get the hell out of here.

      Landry fingers the carved symbols as he works the stone free.

                                      LANDRY
                    You're not the first one to doubt
                    me, Foster.
                          (beat)
                    But it's real.

      As Landry talks

      FOSTER

      suddenly screams in pain, the camera dropping from his hands.

      Landry whirls --

                                      LANDRY
                    Foster!

      He kneels over the stricken man who has a large barbed arrow
      in his chest, not noticing that the light from the fallen
      camera illuminates

      THE CARVED DEMON

      still grinning evilly, but now gripping only a single stone
      arrow.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                          (not buying it)
                    And he thought I was the one who
                    would defeat this thing.

                                      ALLISON
                    He was afraid it would kill him before
                    he found you.

      And off MacLeod's reaction, looking between Allison's earnest
      face and the telling journal in his hand --

                    this was all meant to happen.

      MacLeod looks at him a long moment.  Wants to laugh off the
      idea, but he can't.

18191819EXT.  HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND - 1625 - NIGHT

      The wind moans in the trees.  Mysterious shadows turn the
      benign forest into a tangle of unnamed threats.

      MacLeod, wild-haired, dressed in furs over tattered tartan,
      moves through the woods, head down against the chill wind
      and rain.

                                      MACLEOD (V.O.)
                    It was 1625.  I'd been Immortal almost
                    three years, but I still didn't know
                    what I was, why I was still alive. 
                    I'd survived two hard winters with
                    no Clan, no family.  No one had taught
                    me about the Game, about what we
                    are.

      Stumbling, clearly suffering from cold and hunger, MacLeod
      spots a sheltered bit of rock up ahead.  He moves to it, and
      finds the entrance to a --

18201820INT.  CAVE - SCOTLAND - 1625 - NIGHT

      A shelter hollowed from rock, a couple of thick BRANCHES
      hiding the entrance.  MacLeod staggers in, looking for
      shelter.  As he does --

      THE BUZZ

      MacLeod doesn't know what it is or what it portends.  He's
      only felt it once before, from Kanwulf.

      MacLeod moves deeper into the cave, drawn by the unnerving
      sensation of the BUZZ, and finds --

      THE HERMIT

      A leathery older man, silver-haired and lean.  He sits by a
      small fire, a rabbit roasting on a spit.  On the floor beside
      him, a casting circle, and inside it a scattering of
      KNUCKLEBONES.

      The Hermit looks up mildly as MacLeod enters.

                                      HERMIT
                    It took you long enough.

      MacLeod gives him a strange look.

                    Come by the fire.  It's not fit out
                    there for man nor spirit.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Aye.

      MacLeod moves forward hesitantly.  The Hermit gestures to
      the roasting rabbit.

                                      HERMIT
                    Help yourself.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Thank you.
                          (tearing off a piece)
                    I'd no idea anyone lived in these
                    parts.

                                      HERMIT
                    It's a good place for a man to lose
                    himself.
                          (beat)
                    They won't find you up here.  The
                    ones who call you demon.

      MacLeod stops mid-chew.  Staring at this strange old man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What d'ye mean?

                                      HERMIT
                    You've been clanless and homeless
                    for three years.  But that's over
                    now.  Soon, he will find you, the
                    one who will teach you what you need
                    to know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What one?  What are you talking about?

                                      HERMIT
                    Your kinsman.  Connor MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Connor MacLeod is a legend.

                    So are you, young Duncan MacLeod of
                    the Clan MacLeod.  So are you.

      MacLeod's hand edges toward his sword.

                    What we are is written in the wind,
                    long before we walk this world.  The
                    roads we take... and where they lead
                    us.

                          (spooked)

                                      HERMIT
                    For six hundred years, I have waited
                    in this place for you.
                          (beat)
                    You think I'm a mad old man, don't

                    Remember it well.  Sometimes the
                    truth sounds like madness.

      The Hermit reaches out and scoops up the BONES.  He shakes
      them and scatters them in the circle.

                                      HERMIT (CONT'D)
                    You are blessed and cursed.
                          (beat)
                    You will have time to prepare.  And
                    when your time comes, you must be
                    ready to face an evil beyond any you
                    can imagine.  And evil isn't black,
                    it's the color of blood.

      The words hang ominously in the air.  MacLeod is dubious,
      yet drawn in by the Hermit's intensity.  He rises to his
      feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What evil?  Tell me its name?

      The Hermit stands also, meeting MacLeod's gaze across the
      fire.

                                      HERMIT
                    It has no name.  None I can speak. 
                    Every thousand years he comes, and
                    he must be fought.

                    Listen to me, MacLeod.  My road is

                    No!

      The Hermit reacts swiftly, raising his own sword.

                    You must kill me, Highlander -- or
                    die.

      He attacks, driving MacLeod back with surprising strength. 
      MacLeod is on the defensive, hard-pressed.  And then, he
      sees an opening, and swings --

      The old man falls, beheaded.

      And MacLeod is engulfed in a Quickening.96518      "Archangel"      29.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97



18211821EXT.  CAVE - SCOTLAND - 1625 - FIRST LIGHT

      MacLeod steps from the cave into the forest, still shaky and
      confused from the Quickening.  As he does, he feels an
      unwelcome sensation -- THE BUZZ.

      Still not knowing what it means, he puts a hand to his sword
      and looks up to see --

      MAN ON HORSEBACK

      in a GAP between two great trees.  The rising SUN behind him
      casts a blinding halo, obscuring his face -- but we can make
      out long hair, a Scots warrior's dress, the MACLEOD TARTAN.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am Duncan MacLeod of the Clan
                    MacLeod.

      THE RIDER

      stretches a HAND down to meet MacLeod.  MacLeod looks up at
      the powerful figure looming over him --

18231823INT.  LANDRY S APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM - DAY

      Allison sits alone, turning the pages of a photo album,
      remembering better times.  She reacts as she hears voices
      from her grandfather's study.  She rises and moves toward
      them.

18241824INT.  LANDRY'S APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Allison enters the study to find the voice is her
      grandfather's and it is coming from the television.

                                      LANDRY
                          (on TV)
                    Are you afraid, Foster?  We should
                    all be afraid.

      She removes the tape from the VCR.  But the image keeps on
      playing.  It turns directly toward her.

                          (on TV)
                    That wasn't very nice.

      She backs away.  There is a sound behind her.  She turns to
      find

      LANDRY

      sitting behind her in his chair.  He pats the arms.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    I always liked this chair.

      ALLISON

      now stunned with fear, tries to back out of the room, only
      to have

      that crashes shut.  She screams.

      ALLISON

      moves back to the door, grabs hold of the knob.  She tears
      at it, her fear now hysteria.  She is screaming.

                                      ALLISON
                    Let me out!

                      Allison... Dear Allison... There's
                    nowhere to go.

      Allison turns back and sees her grandfather through a wall
      of flames.

                                      ALLISON
                    No!

      Allison pounds on the door.

      ON THE TV

      Landry laughs maniacally.  We see the reflection of the room
      on fire.  His laughter blends with her haunting screams in a
      crescendo of death and madness.

18251825EXT.  STREET - DAY

      Mid-scene.  Richie, Dawson and Methos walk and talk.

                                      METHOS
                    Millenium theory is nothing new, but
                    I'll tell you something.  I've seen
                    good years.  I've seen bad years. 
                    It doesn't have much to do with the
                    calendar.

                                      RICHIE
                    But you should see this guy's journal. 
                    It's pretty convincing stuff.

                                      METHOS
                    Most religions have some version of
                    the savior myth.  Demons come to
                    destroy the earth... Champions sent
                    to protect it.
                          (beat)
                    It's a comforting thought, but Richie,
                    I've lived five thousand years, I've
                    never seen a demon.

                                      DAWSON
                          (incredulous)
                      A Zoroastrian demon.

                                      RICHIE
                    Maybe you've got another explanation
                    for what's going on?

                                      DAWSON
                          (exasperated)
                    What's going on is that Duncan MacLeod
                    is losing it!

                                      METHOS
                    We'll talk to the granddaughter.

      Dawson shrugs, giving in.  They come around a corner and
      find --

18261826EXT.  LANDRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

      Gutted by fire.  STEAM and SMOKE hiss from the shattered
      windows as soot-faced POMPIERS drag hoses from the building.

      A POLICE CAR is parked on the curb, near a knot of NEIGHBORS
      and WITNESSES being questioned by a PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE.

                    You're sure this is the place?
                          (off Richie s nod)
                    Well, so much for good intentions. 
                    Anything that might have helped us
                    is toast.

      The Detective finishes with the Neighbors.  Seeing them, he
      steps over.  He takes out a notepad and a RED pen.

                                      DETECTIVE
                    You live in the area?

                    We just saw the smoke.  What happened?

      BEAT.  You could hear a pin drop.

                    Nobody we know.

      The Detective nods and moves back to the firefighters by the
      door.

      Dawson looks grim.  Richie can see where his thoughts are
      headed.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not a chance.

                                      DAWSON
                    Richie, I know how you feel...

      At that moment a bagged BODY is carried from the building on

      MacLeod enters the barge, looking like hell, moves to pour
      himself a drink.

                    Having a hard day?

      MacLeod looks up to find

      ALLISON LANDRY

      dressed seductively in a night gown and waiting in his bed. 
      She wears a gold chain and on it a RED stone that almost
      glows in reflected light.  She raises the covers seductively.

                    Isn't it obvious?

      She gets out of bed and moves toward him.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod picks it up.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)

                          (looking at Allison)
                    You're sure?

      He hangs up the phone.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You're dead.

                                      ALLISON
                    Does it matter?

      He closes his eyes tight for a moment as if to shut her out.

      He opens them again and sighs with relief to find

      empty.  Suddenly.

      reach up from behind him and cover his eyes.

                      Peek-a-boo.

      Revulsion and fear fills MacLeod as he tears her hands away
      and pushes her across the barge.  She falls into a large
      vase.  It breaks into pieces.

                                      ALLISON (CONT'D)

      off him.

                    So you agree with Joe.  You think
                    MacLeod's crazy.

      He looks to Methos and Dawson.  Neither says anything.

      Methos doesn't answer.  There's an uncomfortable silence.

      FADE IN:

18321832INT.  BARGE - NIGHT

      MacLeod leans on the counter.  Before him is Landry's book. 
      MacLeod is in a state of deep turmoil, unsure of his footing,
      not knowing what has happened to his world.  He holds the
      book in his hand.

      MacLeod moves to the fireplace.  Inside the fireplace --

      Flames.  Maybe the best thing would be to burn it.  He
      hesitates, the book in his hand, torn between wanting to
      destroy this thing, get it out of his life, and understanding
      it.  Finally --

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

      As he stands there, he gets the BUZZ.

      MacLeod reacts, instinctively reaches for his sword -- then
      he forces himself to wait as the door opens --

      Methos and Dawson step in.  There's a moment of awkward
      silence broken by --

                    We think you're in trouble, Mac.

      MacLeod stares at him.

                    Trouble.

      He starts to laugh at the absurdity.

                    You need help.

                          (into phone)
                    That's impossible.

                          (into phone)
                    It was him.  I think they headed
                    into the catacombs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do nothing.  Nothing.  Get back here
                    now.

                    Richie, you don't know what this is!
                    Stay right there, I'm coming after
                    you!

      He TOSSES the phone to Dawson as he grabs his sword.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie trailed it to the catacombs.
                    Talk to him.  Keep him there!

      He's already racing for the door.

      Dawson puts the phone to his ear.

                                      DAWSON
                    Richie?

                    Richie!

      Methos looks at him questioningly.  Dawson lifts the phone
      so they can both hear it clearly -- a DIAL TONE.  No one
      there.

18341834INT.  CATACOMB TUNNELS - NIGHT

      A dark tunnel filled with dripping water, flickering light.

      MACLEOD

      moves warily along it, tense, not knowing what he'll face,
      what form it will take.  Then ahead of him... the BUZZ.

      He steps carefully into the main catacomb chamber --

18351835INT.  MAIN CATACOMB CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

      Richie is there, sitting slumped on a rock.  His head is
      lowered, he's leaning on his sword.  He looks exhausted or
      wounded.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie?

      Richie doesn't answer.  MacLeod lowers his sword and moves
      to help him.  As he comes closer, bends to help him --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Are you all right?

      Richie suddenly straightens -- and SWINGS at him.

      MacLeod dodges back -- and the sword sings past his head,
      missing him by inches.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie, it's me!

      Richie moves back, taking a stance.  He holds MacLeod's eyes.

                                      RICHIE
                    I know.

      There's no apology there, no remorse in his eyes.  Just cold
      hate.  It's Richie's voice -- but subtly ALTERED (IN POST)
      into a rasp infused with a cold malevolence.  MacLeod knows
      instantly what it is.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's you.

      The "False Richie  smiles with contempt.

                                      RICHIE
                    "Me?

                    You don't even understand your place
                    in all this.

      He suddenly moves in, swinging, driving MacLeod back.  He
      fights with will and hate -- using Richie's skills, but
      sharpened and driven by an evil will.

      MacLeod backs off, trying not to engage.  Whatever his senses
      tell him, this looks like Richie he can't bring himself to
      swing.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      43.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

                    Having trouble?

      The False Richie feints and swings and --

      MACLEOD

      takes the blade in the shoulder.  He steps back, clutching
      the wound, the pain searing through him.

                                      RICHIE
                    Some champion.

      MacLeod's hesitation vanishes.  This is evil he's fighting,
      and he knows he has to win.  He charges and they lock swords. 
      As they fight through the catacomb chamber

                                      MACLEOD

      There's an eerie alteration in his voice.  In his face.  For
      a moment, he looks and sounds like Horton -- the man who
      originally said that.

      MacLeod attacks with renewed vigor, driving the False Richie
      back toward the wall.  He has the advantage -- and there's a
      moment of fear on the face of his opponent.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (adamant)
                    Everyone can die.  One way or another.

      He cuts the False Richie across the midsection and the demon
      reacts to the blow with a howl of pain -- he's not
        invulnerable after all.  MacLeod raises his sword to score a
      decisive blow --

      When he's suddenly alerted by the SOUND of another sword
      cutting the air behind him.

      He whirls, changing the cut to a parry, just in time to
      deflect the sword coming toward his neck.  He finds himself
      facing

      KRONOS

      Decked out in his Bronze Age gear, but with his nasty-edged
      modern-day sword in his hand.  Death incarnate.  He may not
      be real, but he's damn good with a sword.

      MacLeod is on the defensive, barely deflecting Kronos' attack. 
      Behind him, the False Richie is recovering, healing, raising
      his sword to rejoin the battle.

18361836INT.  TUNNEL - CLOSE BY - SAME TIME

      The REAL RICHIE heads warily along the tunnel, his sword
      out.  Then he hears it, coming from down the tunnel -- the
      CLASH OF SWORDS.  His heart drops.

                    MacLeod.

      He raises his sword and hurries down the tunnel.

1836A1836AINT.  CATACOMB CHAMBER - RESUME SCENE

      MacLeod manages to duck under Kronos' head shot and take
      cover behind a stone pillar.  As Kronos comes after him,
      MacLeod rears back and slices through the pillar, sending a
      shower of stone and dust down on his opponent, delaying him.

      Before he can celebrate his momentary reprieve --

      BANG!

      A bullet catches him in the side.

      JAMES HORTON

      emerges from the nearest tunnel, gun in hand.

      On MacLeod's other side, the False Richie and Kronos are
      emerging from the settling cloud of pulverized stone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What the hell are you?!

      He's got his back pressed to the wall, sword up, desperately
      trying to be ready to defend himself against the three armed
      opponents stalking toward him.

                                      HORTON
                    I am Set.  I am Ahriman.  I am

                    you cannot stop me.

      The False Richie feints at MacLeod.  MacLeod falls back
      against the wall.  The False Richie swings, and MacLeod dodges
      aside -- the sword strikes the wall where his head was.  The
      False Richie turns and slips away into the black tunnel.

      MacLeod charges after him.

18371837INT.  TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

      FOLLOWING MACLEOD

      as he races down the dark corridor, sword up and ready to
      swing.  He's in pain, desperate to catch this thing, knowing
      he must finish it -- that more rides on this victory than
      anything he has faced before.

      He reaches a CORNER in the tunnel, comes around it --

      RICHIE

      comes the other way, his sword raised and ready to swing --

      MACLEOD swings first -- and Richie falls.  Time stops.

      MacLeod looks down at the dead "demon."

      He should feel triumph -- but there is a wrenching, sickening
      sensation.  For a moment he thinks something terribly wrong
      has happened.  Then he sees --

      RICHIE, standing a few feet away at the mouth of the tunnel. 
      Watching him.

      MacLeod is flooded with enormous relief.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Richie....

      Then the other Richie LAUGHS.  It is a hollow, chilling laugh,
      and the truth hits MacLeod: the demon tricked him.  The demon
      won.  He has killed his friend.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    No! NO!

      Even as the QUICKENING starts to hit him, he staggers forward
      as if he's fighting through a storm, raises his sword and
      with a cry of rage, he SWINGS --

      But there is nothing there.  For a moment, we hear the sound
      of the things's mocking LAUGHTER echoing in the tunnel.

      As MacLeod's face fills with agony, he's hit full on by the
      QUICKENING -- an agonizing blast of energy that picks him up
      in its grip like a doll, and shakes him -- as images of
      Horton, Kronos and the False Richie look on, savoring their

18381838INT.  CATACOMB TUNNELS - LATER

      Methos and Dawson step slowly into the catacomb chamber.  It
      is eerily, utterly silent.  Ahead of them, in the center of
      the room

      MACLEOD

      kneeling over the body of Richie.  His katana lies beside
      him.  Whatever he feels is beyond expression, beyond words,
      unsharable.

      Dawson closes his eyes in pain.  They stay that way for a
      long moment, in silence.

      Methos moves slowly to MacLeod, gently places a hand on his
      shoulder.  There is nothing he can say.

      MacLeod doesn't acknowledge him.  He picks up his katana,
      holds it a moment -- then lowers his head, leaving his neck
      vulnerable and waiting.  Without looking, he hands the hilt
      to Methos.

      Methos knows what he wants.  Maybe what he needs.  He takes
      the katana, holds it a moment.  Then --

                                      METHOS
                    No.

      Methos draws the sword, and backs away.

      MacLeod waits that way a moment -- then seems to accept this. 
      His punishment is living.  He rises slowly, looks once more
      at Richie -- then he turns and walks out.

      His eyes are flat and lifeless, containing his pain, refusing
      to let it go.

      keeps walking.

      MacLeod turns and responds with an air of finality.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm done.

      He turns to walk away.

      Methos turns away, looking at nothing.

      Dawson watches MacLeod go.  Finally he looks down at Richie
      and he can't fight the tears any more.  He leans into the
      cold stone of the wall and lets them come.

      MACLEOD

      moves down the tunnel, away from them, framed in a dim halo
      of light, growing smaller in the distance.

18391839INT.  SECLUDED ROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY

      Spare, dimly lit, furnished with only a few rustic items --
      a low wood table, some quilted pillows -- it could be the
      quarters of a monk.

      A small OIL LAMP sputters on the table.  Seated on a rug
      before it --

      MACLEOD

      Motionless, he seems to be meditating.  On the table before
      him  - Landry s NOTEBOOK, tattered and yellowed with age.

      As he sits, he gets the BUZZ.  He looks up, but does not
      rise.  He waits calmly.  A moment later, POUNDING at the
      door.  Then from without --

                                      METHOS (O.S.)
                    MacLeod?

      MacLeod doesn't move.

                                      METHOS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I know you re there.  I'm not going
                    away.

      MacLeod closes his eyes, says nothing.  He pushes a button.

      THE DOOR

      opens upward pneumatically, into the ceiling admitting a
      shaft of light.  A shadowed figure moves into the room, behind
      MacLeod -- it is Methos.

      They stay that way a LONG BEAT.

      Not unfriendly, just disinterested -- a man keeping people

      As he says this, there's a LOW SCRAPING SOUND as someone, or
      something, enters.

      MacLeod finally opens his eyes.  He turns now, and we see --

      JOE DAWSON

      sitting in a wheelchair.  His hair is now SILVER -- we can
      see he's over sixty years old.  There's a CLOTH-COVERED OBJECT
      across his legs.

      Dawson looks at MacLeod quietly.  There's no recrimination,
      no accusation.

                                      DAWSON
