                                           TEASER

      FADE IN:

      ...FOOTBALL CLEATS grind into the turf.  

      Out from underneath their JERSEYS, bulging calf 
        muscles...veins in the forearms that look like 
        firehoses...biceps and triceps, thick SLABS of MUSCLE. 

      These aren t men...they re mountains on cleats.

      We re inside the huddle with the New York Jets.  Players are 
      intense.  It s all in their eyes.  CAMERA WHIPS to...

                                    QUARTERBACK
                    Round right, 687 fire hook fly on 
                    three.

      CAMERA whips over to WIDE RECEIVER TERRENCE  TK  KING as he 
      LICKS HIS FINGERS and we understand... ball s going to him.

      Everyone claps their hands, runs up to the line of scrimmage 
      where TK faces the opposing teams DEFENSIVE BACK.

                                  DEFENSIVE BACK
                    Gonna knock you back to Jersey, TK.  

                                  TERRENCE ( TK ) KING
                    Good.  Cause that s where I m 
                    banging your sister after the game.

      The Defensive Back spits on TK s feet.

                                    QUARTERBACK
                          (calls the play)
                    Black 80 black 80, yellow 23 yellow 
                    23.  Hut Hut Hut...

      The sound of the crowd has drained away, the voice of the QB 
      crystal clear...all sense heightened...TK shakes out his hands.

      ON THE SNAP

      TK runs ten yards, turns, cuts across the middle, turns to 
      look for the ball...

      ...all he sees, all we see is the ball coming towards him, 
      spinning in SLO MO, the Defensive Back right on him.

      Just as it s within his grasp...the BALL BOUNCES up off his 
      fingertips, starts bobbling...and SLIDES RIGHT THROUGH HIS 
      FINGERS to the ground.  And in an instant:                                                                            2.


      SMASH - the DEFENSIVE BACK slams TK from one side, two 
      SAFETIES crush him from the other in a wicked hit. 

      CAMERA CLOSES IN ON the pain, the sweat, the grief as TK s 
      body slams into the turf.  

      Off the cracking sounds of testosterone on testosterone, and 
      god knows what else... 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. DANI S BEDROOM - DAWN

      AN ALARM CLOCK goes off...6:50 am.  

      A pair of beautiful brown eyes POP OPEN. They belong to...

      DANIELLE SANTINO (39-ish) our leading lady.  Sexy in a Long 
      Island way, perfect french manicure, and a street toughness, 
      people perpetually underestimate her fierce intellect.

      She rolls over...her husband RAY SR s, already out of bed.  
      Garment industry exec, makes a good living.  Charming, but 
      don t cross him.

                                  RAY
                    Don t wait for me for dinner.  
                    Client meeting.

      He sweeps by, gives her a perfunctory kiss.  Hustles out.

      INT. DANI S KITCHEN

      Granite counter tops, state of the art kitchen.  No detail 
      overlooked.  Spotless. 

      Dani finishes whipping up breakfast...holds a plate out for 
      her son...RAY, Jr. (16, great-looking, relentlessly sunny, 
      maybe not too swift) as he hurries in.   

                                  DANI
                    Egg whites and steak protein scramble.

                                  RAY JR.
                    Thanks, Ma. 

      As he eats standing up...in rushes LINDSAY (14, sarcastic, 
      defiant, but wicked smart) in sweatshirt and jeans, grabs a 
      waiting bowl of LUCKY CHARMS.  She pours them into a THERMOS.  
      Anxious to go.

                                    LINDSAY
                    C mon, Ray Jay, let s go.                                                                               3.


                                  DANI
                    Lindsay, you re not going to school 
                    like that.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Like what?

      Dani unzips Lindsay s SWEATSHIRT...revealing a tight strappy 
      tank underneath that shows a lot of BELLY BUTTON.  Busted.

                                  DANI
                    When you re making a living as a 
                    hooker, you can pull this out of 
                    storage, until then...

      Dani points to the door.  Lindsay scowls, heads out.  Ray Jr. 
      chuckles.  Dani gives him a look, he stops laughing.

      EXT. STREET - MORNING

      We get a glimpse of the Long Island neighborhood.  Big new-
      home constructions of various sizes, but similarly shaped.

      The kids drive off in Ray, Jr s Mini Cooper.

      INT. MINI COOPER - MOMENTS LATER

      Lindsay pulls the tank top out of her backpack.  Ray Jr. 
      shakes his head.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Dani comes up the stairs, past the guest bedroom, something 
      catches her eye...she doubles back.  

      INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

      It s the THROW PILLOWS.  They re not quite right.  She 
      readjusts them.  But something s bothering her.  

                                  FAYE S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                          (emotional)
                    I can t stop thinking about it.

      INT. THERAPIST S OFFICE - DAY

      NOUVEAU RICHE HOUSEWIFE  FAYE , dabbing her eyes, weepy, her 
      Louis Vuitton bag clutched in her lap.  A moment, then, she 
      reveals her pressing problem:

                                  FAYE
                      I just...have to lose those six 
                    pounds.  I can t be fat at my 
                      daughter s Sweet 16.                                                                            4.


      A BOX of tissues comes into frame...

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    Do you think hypnotherapy can help, 
                    Dr. Dani? 

      REVEAL Dani... is Faye s THERAPIST.  She s empathetic on the 
      outside (we all know what she s thinking on the inside)....

                                  DANI
                    I do, Faye.  But you have to 
                    realize this is not about weight 
                    loss.  

                                  FAYE
                          (blows her nose)
                    It s not?

                                  DANI
                    No.  It s about loss of control. Do 
                    you feel out of control, Faye?

                                  FAYE
                    Yes.

                                  DANI
                    And why is that?

                                  FAYE
                          (confesses through tears)
                    Every time I m near a loaf of 
                    bread...I inhale it.  I don t even 
                    take time to masticate. I just 
                    swallow the damn thing whole.
                          (then)
                      Sometimes, I sneak in the closet... 
                    so my husband won t see me.  But 
                      yesterday, he confronted me... with 
                    the crust.

                                  DANI
                    The crust?

                                  FAYE
                          (deep shame)
                    He found a pile of them in the 
                    garbage -- I don t do crust. The 
                    worst part -- I told him they were 
                    someone else s.  Like I m cheating 
                    on him or something.  

      Dani offers her another tissue.  As she does, she FLASHES IN 
      HER MIND to those DAMN THROW PILLOWS on the bed.  Shakes it 
      off...                                                                             5.


                                  DANI
                    There are different types of 
                      addictions. Things that give us 
                    comfort when we feel out of control 
                    that become...habit forming.  Some 
                    people are addicted to alcohol, 
                    some to drugs. 
                          (then)
                    You, Faye, are addicted to...carbs.

      Faye nods, this resonates with her.  

                                  FAYE
                          (a liberating 
                            breakthrough)
                    Carbs are my... crutch.  

                                  DANI
                    Okay, then. Let s focus on getting 
                    rid of your crutch so you can feel 
                    back in control in your life.
                    Lie down, and look at a spot in 
                    front of you....  

      Dani FLASHES IN HER MIND again...to those THROW PILLOWS.   

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    As I count from one to twenty, each 
                    count you will drift deeper into a 
                    more relaxed state...yet more alert 
                    to my voice.  One... 

      Her voice carries us into...

      INT. DANI S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                  DANI S VOICE
                    ...you are going to see things more 
                    clearly.

      Dani, in bed in pajamas reading a book.  Ray enters (in a 
      SUIT, just coming home from work).

                                  DANI
                    How was your meeting?

                                  RAY
                    Ah, you know, clients -- impossible 
                    to please.

      He heads off towards the bathroom...barely kissing her hello.

                                  DANI
                    You re showering now?                                                                            6.


      She looks at the clock - 11 pm.  As she registers this.

                                  DANI S VOICE
                      Two...you re aware of your 
                      surroundings.

      INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

      ...where Dani re-examines the THROW PILLOWS.  Pulls back the 
      bedding and finds...hospital corners.  And from this tiny 
      clue, Dani knows, she just knows...

      FLASH in her mind to her husband RAY SR., on the bed with a 
      FACELESS WOMAN -- as they thrash around, the THROW PILLOWS 
      are tossed aside.

                                  DANI VOICE
                    ...three, your eyes begin to open.

      INT. DANI S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

      Dani SCROLLS THROUGH Ray s iPHONE...finds SEXUAL PHOTOS FROM 
      A WOMAN.  Her face registers shock and clarity all at once.  

                                  DANI VOICE
                    ...four, you are wide awake.

      She looks up, ashen, as Ray comes out of the shower with a 
      towel around his waist.

                                  RAY
                    What...?

                                  DANI S VOICE
                    ...five, your mind is clear and you 
                    are in charge.

      INT. DANI S HOUSE - NIGHT 

      CLOSE ON Dani - whose mind is clear and she is in charge as 
      she chucks Ray s clothes out the window.  

                                  DANI S VOICE
                    ...and you no longer need your crutch.

      REVEAL below the window in the...

      EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 

      ...where Ray tries to calm her, as he dodges clothing.

                                  RAY SR
                    Dani, c mon, that s a thousand 
                    dollar suit!                                                                            7.


                                  DANI
                    If you don t want me to pull a 
                    Lorena Bobbitt, you better run like 
                    the wind, Ray. Cause I have a ginsu 
                      collection in the kitchen that s 
                    begging me to do some dicing.

      Ray, Jr. and Lindsay pull up in the Mini Cooper.  They climb 
      out, see Dad s clothes all over the lawn.

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Dad, what the hell s going on?

                                  DANI
                          (shouts out)
                    Daddy s taking a trip, I m helping 
                    him pack!

      A SUITCASE comes flying out the window.

      She slams the window shut, disappears inside.  Lindsay turns 
      to Ray Jr, quietly.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Oh no, did you see Mom s angry neck 
                    vein.  That s not good.

      Now the FRONT DOOR opens...revealing Dani. 

      As the kids scurry inside exchanging looks.  Ray approaches.

                                  DANI
                    Next time you screw someone in the 
                    guest bedroom, remember -- I do box 
                    pleats, not hospital corners.

      As she starts to close the door on him:

                                  RAY
                    What the hell do you want from me 
                    Dani?

                                  DANI
                    I want a divorce.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. DANI S HOUSE - FOYER -  MORNING

      DOORBELL.  Dani, mussed up hair, answers the door in her 
      robe, having just woken up.  

      It s a CLOWN holding BALLOONS.

                                  CLOWN
                    Danielle Santino?

                          (confused)
                    Yeah....?

      He smiles, hands her an ENVELOPE.

                                  CLOWN (PROCESS SERVER)
                    You ve been served.

      As he walks off, she stares at the LEGAL PAPERS, incredulous.

                                  DANI
                    You could at least leave me the 
                    balloons!  

      Off her SLAMMING the door too hard...she grabs the back of 
      her neck - she s pinched a nerve.

                                  DANI   (CONT D)
                    OW.  

      Dani walks into....

      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      ...scans the LEGAL PAPERS as she walks into the kitchen: 

                                  DANI
                    Damn clown! 

      Dani is startled by an unexpected voice:

                                  VOICE
                    Watch how you talk about your 
                    husband.                                                                            9.


      It s Dani s mother ANGELA (60 s), drinking coffee and 
      circling her picks in the Daily Racing Form. (Angela is old 
      school Italian, no nonsense, in love with three things: 
      vodka, gambling and Jesus.)

                                  DANI
                    Jesus, Ma. What are you doing here 
                    so early?

                                  ANGELA
                    I was heading over to Aqueduct for 
                    the ponies -- didn t know I needed 
                    a special invitation to check in on 
                    my only daughter.

                                  DANI
                    You re the second reason I need to 
                    change the locks.

      Dani throws down the legal papers on the table.  As Angela 
      scans the papers....

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Ray wants full custody of the kids. 
                    Not to mention the house, and 
                      everything else we own.  He s 
                    already cut off my credit cards and 
                    cleaned out our joint bank account.  
                    I barely have money for groceries.

                                  ANGELA
                    Well, there s only one thing to 
                    do...
                          (then)
                    Take him back.

                                  DANI
                    Mom!?!  He cheated on me.  More 
                    than once. 

                                  ANGELA
                    But less than Tiger Woods.  Your 
                    father was a cheater, too.  
                          (beat)
                    But it was always with good clean 
                    Catholic women...

      She goes back to her Racing Form.   

                                  DANI
                    That s what he told you.                                                                            10.


                                  ANGELA
                    Hey! Don t make crap of your 
                    father, god rest his soul. 
                          (then)
                    Tough call in the fourth...Winter 
                      Wonderland at three to one or 
                    Charlie s Angel at five to one.

      Off Dani s annoyance...

      INT. HIGH END BAR - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON TWO APPLE-TINIS deposited in front of... 

      Dani and her best friend since childhood, JEANETTE FIERO, 
      straight out of real housewives of Long Island, sitting at the 
      bar.  The crowd features a lot of sexy women and hunky ATHLETES 
      (this is a jock hangout).

      As Jeanette points out hunky guys across the bar -- 

                                  JEANETTE
                    ...that guy with no neck, linebacker.  
                    And chisel chin over there -- he s an 
                    Islander. Ooh, and hot butt -- I 
                    think he just got traded to the Mets.

      But Dani s distracted...

                                  DANI
                    Jeanette, I don t need a man. I 
                    need a job.  Part-time hypno-
                    therapy practice in the back house 
                    doesn t even cover my car payments.  
                          (then)
                    It s like I m waking up from the 
                    Matrix -- I just discovered my 
                    husband s a complete and total 
                    prick. 

                                  JEANETTE
                    So what...Leo was a prick, too. 
                    Thank god he died so I didn t have 
                    to divorce him. Salud.

      She slugs back some of her drink.  Dani joins in.

                                  DANI
                          (sips her drink, winces)
                    Uck.  You ordered me an...

                                  JEANETTE
                      ...Apple-tini.                                                                            11.


                                  DANI
                          (rubbing her NECK)
                    Why can t I just get my Vodka 
                    Martini double olives?

                                  JEANETTE
                    Because Apple-tini says  fun!   
                    Vodka Martini says  bitter.   And 
                    those double olives... 
                      emasculating. 
                          (re Dani s  pain  face)
                    And don t make that scary face.

      As Dani rolls her shoulder around in pain.

                                  DANI
                    I pinched my neck when the clown 
                    showed up.  I can barely lift my 
                    Greenie Teenie or whatever the hell 
                    it s called.

      An unfortunate tipsy GUY IN A SUIT swaggers over to Dani.

                                  SUIT
                          (his best pick up line)
                    Hey, anyone ever tell you that you 
                    look like Barbie? 

                                  DANI
                    You mean that I look like an 
                    anorexic bimbo?  Or are you saying 
                    that I love shopping and think math 
                    is hard? Or that my boobs are too 
                    big for my freakishly tiny waist?  

      He s like a deer in the headlights.

                                  JEANETTE
                    You should see her when she s on 
                    the rag.

      He retreats, wisely. Jeanette makes eyes at a HUNKY, ATHLETIC 
      GUY across the room.  

                                  DANI
                    Jeanette, I ve been separated for 
                    six weeks.  I m not ready for this.  

                                  JEANETTE
                          (takes her hand)
                    Dan, who told you the truth when 
                    Susie Magliocco was talking trash 
                    about you in Girl Scouts?                                                                            12.


                                  DANI
                    You did.

                                  JEANETTE
                    Exactly. I ve been telling you the 
                    truth since we were seven, and I 
                    always will.  And truth be 
                      told...you need to pop your cherry 
                    into the next life.  The rest will 
                    follow. 

      Jeanette eats some NUTS from the a jar on the bar.

                                  DANI
                    You should really be writing for 
                    Hallmark.

      A WAITRESS approaches.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Ladies, that gentleman over there...
                          (indicates Hunky Athletic Guy!)
                    ...he wanted me to give you this.

      The waitress hands the NOTE to... Dani.   

                                  DANI
                          (reads, surprised)
                     I think I can help...with the 
                    pinched nerve. 

      Dani looks up.  Jeanette s already waving him over.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Jeanette!  

                                  JEANETTE
                    Too late -- it s on, baby.   

      MATTHEW (hunky athletic guy) approaches, drink in hand, 
      flashing a smile.  He exudes an irresistible, boyish charm.  

                                    MATTHEW
                    Hi, I m Matthew.  Hope that wasn t 
                    too forward...

                                  JEANETTE
                    It wasn t.  I m Jeanette, this is 
                    Dani.
                          (before Dani can scare him off)
                    So, what do you do, Matthew?  Are 
                    you a doctor?                                                                            13.


                                    MATTHEW
                    Actually, I m a trainer.  For the 
                    Hawks.    

                                  JEANETTE
                          (the motherlode)
                      A trainer.  For the NFL?

                                    MATTHEW
                    How about yourself?

                                  JEANETTE
                    I help friends transition to the 
                      afterlife. 
                          (then, spots a CUTE GUY)
                    Well, I ve got some work to do.  
                    Wish me luck.

      She drains her drink...gives Dani a  JACKPOT  look behind 
      Matthew. Disappears. 

                                    MATTHEW
                    I don t think she s going to need 
                    it.

      Dani has to laugh.  Matthew takes her bar stool.

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    So, how d you get that pinched 
                    nerve...

                                  DANI
                    Oh...uh.  From a clown.  Don t ask.  
                          (making small talk)
                    Look, I m sorry if Jeanette lead 
                    you on...for me.  Or something.  
                      I m...recently separated.  I 
                    haven t even talked to a guy in a 
                    bar in 17 years.  I m not sure I m 
                    ready to start tonight.  

                                    MATTHEW
                          (not hitting on her)
                    I was just offering...you look like 
                    you re in a lot of pain.

                                  DANI
                          (suddenly embarrassed)
                    Jesus.  It has been a long time.  I 
                    don t even know when a guy s 
                    hitting on me anymore.

                                    MATTHEW
                    To be fair, it s tempting.                                                                              14.


      Beat.  She smiles...

                                  DANI
                    So, a trainer for pro football 
                    players.

      He nods, thinking she s impressed.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    I hate football. 

                                    MATTHEW
                          (amused)
                    Okay.  I suppose you have a good 
                    reason... to hate.

      She sips her APPLETINI...which she hates.  Winces.  

                                  DANI
                    ...what little I know of the game 
                    involves my ex-husband not mowing 
                    the lawn and not taking out the 
                    garbage.  Not to mention my son 
                    getting a broken leg, fractured jaw 
                    and mild concussion.  

                                    MATTHEW
                    What about the poetry of the game, 
                    the seductive mystery of intense 
                      competition, the thrill of watching 
                    men pushed to their limits and 
                    beyond.  
                          (then, aware of his own bullshit)
                    Tight men s butts in spandex pants?

                                  DANI 
                          (she laughs)
                    That part - tolerable.  But, like I 
                      said...I m just not interested 
                      in...sports... right now.

      She makes a painful face again, re the pinched nerve.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Okay, message received.  But I m 
                    still offering my professional 
                    services, free of charge.
                          (she s confused)
                    I can make that... clown injury 
                    disappear in a few seconds.

      She looks at him, admittedly intrigued.                                                                            15.


                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    May I...(touch her?)

      She nods.  He stands behind her, feels her shoulders...

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    It s all about your shoulders... 
                    your muscles are out of alignment.  
                    Feel how tight you are in there.  
                          (as he uses magic healing 
                            fingers)
                    Your deltoid, front rear deltoid, 
                    going into your trapezius muscle, 
                    all ties into your rhomboids.  

                                  DANI
                          (this feels awesome)
                    Sounds like geometry.  

                                    MATTHEW
                    Geometry of the body.  Need to 
                    loosen the pressure here...

                                  DANI
                    Ohhh.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Releasing the pressure there, 
                    should take the pressure off the...

                                  DANI
                    Yes.

      Suddenly embarrassed.  She looks at him, much looser, a 
      little flush.  Amazed, almost to herself:

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Pain s... gone.  

                                    MATTHEW
                      Bartender...can we get my friend 
                    here a...
                          (susses her out)
                    Vodka Martini.  Straight up. Double 
                    olives.  Put it on my tab.

                                  DANI
                          (surprised)
                    How d you...?

                                    MATTHEW
                          (shrugs)
                    I ve always been good at knowing 
                    what a woman needs.                                                                            16.


      Dani doesn t know whether to blush or to fall off her chair.  
      He downs his drink, sets it on the bar.   

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                          (then, with a smile that 
                            could kill)
                    You take care of yourself...Dani.

      Matthew shakes her hand, and starts to walk away, when 
      suddenly...he feels a hand on his shoulder...

      It s Dani.  Surprising even herself.

      Seems he is pretty damn good at knowing what a woman needs.  

      INT. MATTHEW S BEDROOM - MORNING

      CLOSE ON Dani...as she opens her eyes in a bedroom that is 
      clearly not hers -- a sleek modern loft decorated with SPORTS 
      PARAPHERNALIA.

      As the memory of last night s activities flood back, Dani is 
      simultaneously appalled with herself and yet flush.

      The sound of the shower running draws her attention...she 
      sees the clock 9:30 a.m. and suddenly jumps up...as in  what 
      the hell did I do! 

      INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      QUICK SHOTS as she pulls on her bra, grabs one of her 
      SHOES...where the hell is her dress?

                                    MATTHEW O.S.
                    Was it something I said?

      REVEAL Matthew, dripping wet, towel wrapped around his waist.  

      Suddenly self-conscious, Dani instinctively grabs the SHEET 
      from the bed, wraps it around her bra and underwear. 

                                  DANI
                    No, no. My husband...ex 
                      husband...is dropping the kids off 
                    in an hour. I gotta get home. 
                          (then)
                    Look, last night was...great.  But, 
                    this (one night stand thing) isn t 
                    me....

                                    MATTHEW
                          (calm as always)
                    Well, whoever it is, tell her I had 
                    a great time.                                                                              17.


      He HANDS HER her clothes from off the bed (they were under 
      the sheets).  He kisses her gently...disarming her.  She has 
      to smile.

      His cellphone rings.  Takes it off the dresser. Recognizes 
      CALLER ID.

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  

      He answers the phone, motions for her to wait a sec.  

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Yo, this is Matthew.

      She slips into the... 

      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ...where Dani throws on her clothes, adjusts herself in the 
        mirror...smiles, liberated...did she really just do this?  
      She peeks out into the bedroom, sees Matthew pacing, catches 
      bits of his conversation.  

                                    MATTHEW
                          (on the phone)
                    Hey, he s got a bad wheel, got 
                    nothing to do with him going 
                      offsides...
                          (listens)
                    ...TK s wrist is fine, it s been X-
                    rayed, no broken bones or contusions.  
                          (then)
                    I have no idea what his problem is, 
                    Coach. I put him through all the 
                    stress tests...he s been clean for 
                    years.
                          (then)
                      I understand.  I ll handle it.

      Clicks the PHONE OFF.  She slips out of the bathroom.   

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Sorry about that.  Coach s daily 
                    chew out.

                                  DANI
                    What s he so grumpy about?

                                    MATTHEW
                    On paper, our guys are a playoff 
                    caliber team, but on the field, 
                    it s been a little like watching 
                    the Three Stooges. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                            18.

                                    MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    Fumbles, dropped passes, bone-
                    headed penalties...mental mistakes.  

                                  DANI
                    Maybe your guys need therapy.  
                          (re her dress)
                    Zip.

      He zips her up.

                                    MATTHEW
                          (has to laugh)
                    What do you know about therapy?

      She turns back to him.  

                                  DANI
                    Allow me to introduce myself. Dr. 
                    Dani Santino. Licensed 
                      Hypnotherapist.

      She fumbles on her OTHER SHOE, offers him a hand as if  to 
      shake.   Off his look...

      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Matthew sets some coffee down for Dani on the counter.

                                    MATTHEW
                      Hypnotherapy?  Sorry, I just 
                    picture some creepy guy swinging a 
                    watch back and forth:  you are 
                    getting sleepy...very sleepy.  
                          (susses her out)
                    Milk, no sugar?

                                  DANI
                          (nods, impressed)
                    Hypnosis is just a reduced state of 
                      consciousness -- you re awake, but 
                    highly susceptible to suggestion.  
                    Works wonders for phobias.  Weight 
                    loss.  Anxiety.  Even sports 
                      performance.  And you don t need 
                    years of therapy to see results.  

                                    MATTHEW
                          (game)
                    Okay.  

                                  DANI
                          (confused)
                    Okay...?                                                                            19.


      He tosses a pack of NICORETTE on the counter.

                                    MATTHEW
                    I been trying to quit smoking on 
                    and off for years.  
                          (then)
                    Heal me.

      Off her look...

      INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      ...where Dani props some pillows on Matthew s bed.

                                  DANI
                    It s not presto-chango. You have to 
                    be serious.  And you have to want 
                    to quit. And you ll probably need 
                    some follow up visits... to make it 
                    stick.

                                    MATTHEW
                    I think that can be arranged.

      He kisses her.  

                                  DANI
                      Okay...lay down.

      She lays him down on the bed.

                                    MATTHEW
                    I think I m going to like this... 
                    therapy. 

                                  DANI
                          (smiles, then serious)
                    Focus your eyes on one spot.

      He s playfully staring at her chest...she tilts his chin up. 

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Not that one.

      Off Matthew, as he stares at a spot on the ceiling... 

      INT. DANI S LEXUS - MORNING

      Dani rides home, Jeanette s on SPEAKER PHONE.

                                  JEANETTE S VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Geometry, bitch: I want shapes, 
                    sizes and relative position of the 
                    figures.                                                                            20.


                                  DANI
                    Put it this way.  I was in bed by 
                    eleven.  But I didn t go to sleep 
                    til six fifteen.

                                  JEANETTE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Oh my god, I rule!  I am a goddess!

      Dani s whole demeanor changes...

                                  DANI
                          (shit)
                    Goddess, I gotta call you back.

      DANI S POV: In her DRIVEWAY...RAY, Lindsay and Ray, Jr., get 
      out of his car.  She looks at the clock - 10 a.m.  And she s 
      wearing her CLOTHES from the NIGHT BEFORE.  Shit!

      She presses the garage door opener...

      ...SPEEDS past Ray, nearly running over his foot.  Into the 
      garage, hits the GARAGE DOOR BUTTON...

      INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

      As the GARAGE DOOR LOWERS, Dani jumps out of the car, Ray s 
      FOOT breaks the safety beam... the garage door goes back up.  

      Revealing Dani in her post-one night stand glory.

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Mom...? What are you wearing?

                                  RAY
                          (pointed)
                    Work out clothes?

                                  DANI
                    Go inside, kids.

      Lindsay and Ray, Jr. disappear inside.  

                                  RAY
                    Where the hell were you last night?

                                  DANI
                    Selling tupperware.
                          (then)
                    What do you want, Ray?

                                  RAY
                    I want to come home.  
                          (approaches her, gently)
                    I miss you, Dan.                                                                            21.


                                  DANI
                    You miss me so much you froze my 
                    credit card and threatened to take 
                    the kids?     

                                  RAY
                    That s just gamesmanship with the 
                    lawyers.  You know that.  
                          (he takes her hand)
                    Take me back, and all that stuff 
                    goes away. No financial worries.  
                    Poof.  Everything goes back to 
                    normal. 

                                  DANI
                    Normal?
                          (pulls away, disgusted)
                    I d rather work at Starbucks. 

                                  RAY
                    Suit yourself...I hear they re 
                    hiring.  

      As she heads inside, he calls after her:

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                      Everything you have I gave you.  
                    And I can take it away.

      She stops, turns to him:

                                  DANI
                    You try to take my kids, Ray, I ll 
                    kill you.

      She smiles, pushes a BUTTON...SLAMS THE DOOR.

      The garage door starts COMING DOWN ON Ray s head!  

      He scoots out from under it.  Bitch!  As the GARAGE DOOR 
      ROLLS DOWN...Ray on the outside now:

                                  RAY
                    Fine, you want the house and the 
                    kids?  Good luck supporting them, 
                    cause you re not getting a dime!

      Garage door closes... everything goes to BLACK.

      INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Dani looks out the window as Ray drives off... her demeanor 
      has gone from firm, to shaky.  She knows she s in trouble.                                                                            22.


      INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

      ...where Long Island Ladies Who Lunch get their hair bleached 
      and highlighted.  

      CAMERA FINDS Jeanette talking to two WOMEN with foils in 
      their hair, looking over a BUSINESS CARD she s handed them.

                                  JEANETTE
                    I used to weigh in around 200.  A 
                    couple of sessions with Dr. Dani-- 
                    voila.

      She motions that she slimmed way down.

                                  JEANETTE (CONT D)
                    So, if you want to lose those ten 
                    pounds, Shirley, or in your case 
                    twenty...

      The woman is insulted, but then re-thinks, surreptitiously 
      takes Dani s card.

      EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

      Jeanette jumps in Dani s waiting Lexus, Dani in the driver s 
      seat.

                                  JEANETTE
                    I think I drummed up some interest.

                                  DANI
                          (feels horrible)
                    This feels wrong, like you re my 
                    pimp or something.  

                                  JEANETTE
                    Well, I did get you laid.  We 
                    already have a working 
                      relationship.  

      Dani gives her a look...

      INT. DANI S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

      As they drive through affluent suburbia, nice shops, 
      expensive cars....  

                                  JEANETTE
                    I think we ve hit the whole drag.  
                    Should we go over to Massapequa?                                                                            23.


      SHOTS OF:

      Jeanette and Dani at boutiques...pet shops...handing out 
      cards, shmoozing.

      INT. HIGH END BOUTIQUE - DAY

      ...where Dani drops off cards at the CASH REGISTER, she 
      nudges Jeanette as she spots a BLEACHED BLONDE CLERK helping 
      a customer.

                                  DANI
                    Ohmygod, Jeanette...that s Mandi.

                                  JEANETTE
                    Sheesh. How the mighty have fallen.

      Mandi spots them...approaches.  Chip on her shoulder.

                                  MANDI
                    Hey Dan, Jeanette.  

                                  DANI
                    Hey, Mandi.  How long have you been 
                    working here at.... Fuzzy?

                                  MANDI
                    Welcome to my post-divorce cold 
                    shower. Eddie claimed we were 
                    broke. The judge believed him.  

      Off Dani s freaked out look--

      INT. DANI S CAR - EVENING

      ...as Dani drops Jeanette off in front of her MCMANSION.

                                  DANI
                    You re so lucky Leo died.

                                  JEANETTE
                    I know.   

      As Jeanette hugs her and jumps out of the car....

      INT. DANI S CAR - DAY

      ...where Dani is rock-bottoming in her Lexus.  Reveal she s 
      parked in front of...STARBUCKS. With a big sign that reads 
      BARISTAS WANTED.

      Just as we wonder if she s going in for a coffee or a job 
        application...her cell phone rings.  The Caller ID reads 
      HAWKS.                                                                              24.


      Off her look...

      EXT. PRACTICE FACILITY - DAY

        Establishing...Dani drives up to the SECURITY GATE.  The 
      guard checks his register, then raises the gate...

      INT. PRACTICE FACILITY - DAY

      Dani cuts across the practice field, where PLAYERS and 
      COACHES run drills.  A few players stop to scope out the hot 
      lady.  Watching her ass.  Dani is directed by a COACH over 
      to...

      ...Matthew spotting a huge LINEMAN on a weight machine.  
      Matthew sees her, waves.

      INT. PRACTICE FACILITY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      ...where Matthew and Dani stride down the hallway, towards 
      the offices.

                                  DANI
                    ...what was so urgent that it 
                    couldn t wait?

                                    MATTHEW
                    Patience, Doctor.

      INT. MATTHEW S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Matthew closes the door to his office.  

                                  DANI
                          (serious)
                      Matthew...I like you.  But I can t 
                    just drop everything for some 
                    afternoon booty call.

                                    PURNELL (O.S.)
                    I totally agree.

      The DESK CHAIR swivels AROUND revealing COACH PURNELL...a 
      meaty, red faced charmer with a Southern twang.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Dr. Dani Santino...meet Pat 
                    Purnell.  Head Coach.  My boss.

      Dani s speechless as Purnell moves to shakes her hand.  

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    Pleasure.  
                          (then, to Matthew)
                                  (MORE)                                                                            25.

                                  COACH PURNELL (CONT'D)
                    Well, she s certainly easy on the 
                    eyes.  That s good. 

                                  DANI
                          (her back up)
                    Good for what exactly?

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    Have a sit.

      Matthew tosses her a PACK OF MARLBOROS off his desk. 

                                    MATTHEW
                          (totally professional)
                      I explained to Coach that since our 
                      first...session, I haven t had a 
                    single smoke.    

                                  DANI
                          (thrilled)
                    Really?

      Matthew nods.

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    I ve known this fellow seven years.  
                    And that s damn near a miracle. And 
                    I don t know if you re aware of it, 
                    but this team needs some miracles 
                    right about now.

                                  DANI
                          (still confused)
                      Okay...what s that got to do with 
                    me?

                                  COACH PURNELL
                          (down to brass tacks)
                    Dr. Dani...how would you like your 
                    very first NFL client?

      As she exchanges a Holy Shit look with Matthew....

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Dani seems to be in a therapy session, taking notes. 

                                  DANI
                    Now the back-half does what?

                                  UNSEEN PATIENT (O.S.)
                    You re not even listening. 

                                  DANI
                    I am listening, it s just a lot of 
                      information for me.  All right??

      REVEAL unseen patient is... Ray, Jr. with a white board 
      covered in X s and O s...Football 101.  

                                  RAY, JR.
                    It s a Half-Back. Not a back-half.  
                          (then, suspicious)
                    ...why are you suddenly so 
                      interested in all this, Mom? 

                                  DANI
                    Ten bucks an hour does not include 
                    answering your questions.  Now, do 
                    your mother a solid, continue with 
                    the line up.

      Off Ray Jr s suspicion....

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Dani fluffs pillows, moves knick-knacks on her desk 
      so they are just so.  Double checks her hair, puts on a quick 
      slash of lipstick.  Heads out through the door connecting the 
      office to the main house....

      INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      ...where she finds Lindsay and Ray Jr. at the window, peeking

                    Big mouth.

      Beat.  Realizing...

                                  DANI
                    RJ, you looked in my book?! 

                                  RAY, JR.
                    You left it open on the desk.  You 
                    obviously wanted me to look.

                                  DANI
                    And you obviously want to be 
                    grounded.  You know the rules - I 
                    expect complete privacy for my 
                    patients!

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    So...TK wants to lose some weight?

      She turns around, it s...Angela, holding a LARGE CUTTING 
      KNIFE.  Dani looks at Ray Jr - you told her, too?

                                  RAY JR. 
                          (defensive)
                    She overheard.

                                  ANGELA
                          (waving the knife)
                    You need protection. Haven t you 
                    heard about  roid rage? 

      The DOORBELL RINGS.  Dani grabs the KNIFE from Angela.

                                  DANI
                    Okay, Mom... all of you, I am a 
                      PROFESSIONAL, he is a professional, and 
                      this...(the knife, the eavesdropping) 
                    is completely UNprofessional.  Now 
                    scatter, before I get a case of roid 
                    rage myself.

                                  ANGELA
                          (sotto)
                    It s the angry neck vein, kids, 
                    duck and cover.

      ...as everyone scatters.

      Dani deep breathes, opens the door to find...                                                                            28.


      Wide receiver TERRENCE KING, a tower of a human...wearing 
      leather shorts, a leather vest (nothing underneath it) and a 
      medallion around his neck that sports his number -- 32.  

      Dani is speechless...he sure doesn t look like he s here for 
      therapy.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Hey, Pretty Lady, my name s TK, but 
                    you can call me M.O.S... 

                                  DANI
                    MOS?

      He moves in real close, whispers in her ear.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Master. of. Seduction.

      As Dani gets a WHIFF OF HIS COLOGNE...

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, I m Dr. Dani Santino.  
                    And I m not a hooker...I m a 
                      therapist. 

      Terrence drops his seductive demeanor, pissed.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Say what?   

      On Dani, doing her best to remain utterly professional here.

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                    They want me to tell some white 
                    barbie doll my -- junk?  This here 
                    is some crazy shit.  

      He has to laugh as he heads for the door....

                                  DANI
                    I m told this is not a voluntary 
                    visit.  And I m guessing Coach 
                    Purnell is someone you don t want 
                    to piss off.

      That stops him.  Off his look...

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Terrence is seated on the couch now.  Dani s got pad and 
      paper.                                                                            29.


                                  DANI
                    So, they tell me you ve had eight 
                    dropped balls and two fumbles in 
                    the last couple of games.

                                  TERRENCE
                    How are you going to help, by 
                    catching the ball for me?

                                  DANI
                    I use hypnosis....  

      Terrence bursts into laughter.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                          (tries to hold her ground)
                    It s very effective.  

                                  TERRENCE
                          (still laughing)
                    Sorry, lady, this is just... a real 
                    trip all right.

                                  DANI
                          (continues, undeterred)
                    Here s the ground rules.  You re 
                    honest with me and honest with 
                    yourself.  In return, I promise 
                    complete confidentiality. Coach, 
                      girlfriend, god himself -- under no 
                      circumstances will I divulge to 
                    anyone what s said here.  This 
                    should feel like the safest place 
                    in the world.  Like a quarterback 
                    when he s in the pouch. 

                                  TERRENCE
                          (amused by her)
                    The pocket.  Not the pouch.

                                  DANI
                    Okay, admittedly, I don t know much 
                    about football.  What I do know is 
                    that at your level, sports is 
                    mostly mental.  Maybe this is about 
                    your junk. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    Hey, sometimes a fumble s just a 
                    fumble.  

                                  DANI
                    True, but you ve had several.

                    Along with two drug suspensions,

                                  DANI
                    ...and a charge of drunk and 
                      disorderly for running naked 
                    through Central Park.

                                  TERRENCE
                          (with a shrug)
                    It was St. Patrick s Day.
                          (flashing annoyed)
                    What do you want me to say?  My dad 
                    whupped me upside twenty years ago 
                    and that s why I coughed up the 
                    ball.  

                                  DANI
                    Is it?

                                  TERRENCE
                    Yes!  My eyes have been opened!  
                    Look at that, I feel better 
                    already.  I m cured.   

      He starts pacing, cocky with a juiced up energy that seems 
      almost threatening:

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                    Let me tell you something.  My 
                    mother died when I was a kid. 

                                  DANI
                    I m sorry to hear that--

                                  TERRENCE
                    Father disappeared.  Eight foster 
                    homes in ten years.  I was a 
                      throwaway.  No one wanted me.  And 
                    now look at me.  Last year I made 
                    eleven million bucks, plus bonuses.  
                    I signed with Nike...and I slept 
                    with thirty-nine different women.  
                    Life is good.

                                  DANI
                    But you keep dropping those balls.

      That shuts him up.                                                                            31.

                    What do you say we give this a 
                    whirl, worst case scenario...it 
                    doesn t work.  Best case...it does.

                          (flash of anger)
                    Look at me, Lady.  I m not afraid 
                    of anything.

                                  DANI
                    Good.  Then lay down.

        Reluctantly, he swings his legs up onto the couch.

      INT. DANI S KITCHEN -  CONTINUOUS

      Lindsay pulls open the pantry door, only to find... Gramma 
      Angela, ear to the wall. 

                                    LINDSAY
                      Gramma...what are you doing?

                    If TK is too messed up in the head 
                    to play, I ll lay a few bucks 
                    against the team this week. Then, 
                    Gramma can get that new love seat 
                    she wants. Shut the door.   

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Terrence is now on the couch, eyes closed, in a 
      relaxed hypnotic state.  

                                  DANI
                    ...when did this all start?

                                  TERRENCE
                    It started with... a roll of toilet 
                    paper.

      Off Dani s look, we go into Terrence s...

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

      ...where Terrence is on the TOILET.                                                                              32.


                                  TERRENCE  (V.O.)
                    It was right before the Cowboys 
                    game...I ran out of T.P.

      He realizes there s no toilet paper.  He spots a pair of 
      FAMILIAR SHOES a few stalls down.  Calls out...

                                  TERRENCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I called out to my man Enrico a 
                    couple stalls over...

      FROM THREE STALLS OVER

      ...the player tosses the toilet paper over three stalls and 
      as it flies through air, SLO MO, Terrence puts his hands out 
      to catch it...and it literally just slips through his 
      fingers, hits the floor, 

      ...ROLLS OUT from under the stall, all the way out across the 
      bathroom floor.

      Off Terrence s look of horror...

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      As Dani writes this down on her pad...

                          (genuinely confused)
                    Okay...so it s because you missed 
                    the toilet paper?

                                  TERRENCE
                    There s more...

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - FLASHBACK

      ...where mid game, Terrence runs down the field to receive a 
        pass...(THIS IS THE SAME SHOT OF HIM FROM THE TEASER). 

                                  TERRENCE V.O.
                    Now, every time the ball is coming 
                    towards me, all I see is...   

      TERRENCE S POV on the field:  A BIG ROLL OF TOILET PAPER 
      COMING HIS WAY...

      ...as it slips through his hands we come back to

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Dani...taking this in.                                                                            33.


                                  DANI
                    How do you feel when you drop the 
                    ball, Terrence?

                                  TERRENCE
                          (calm)
                    I want to rip someone s head off 
                    their shoulders.  

      Yikes.  That was...angry.  Dani clocks this, moves on:

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, the ball is not toilet 
                    paper.  It s a baby.  Your baby.    
                    No one can take your baby away; you 
                    won t drop the baby because you 
                    love that baby, you have to protect 
                    that baby.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    No one gets near my baby.

                                  DANI
                    Good.  You have become SO deeply 
                    relaxed, SO sensitive, SO receptive 
                    to this suggestion...this will make 
                    SO deep and lasting impression that 
                    NOTHING will erase it.  And you 
                    will catch your baby.

                                  TERRENCE
                    I will catch my baby.

      Off Terrence, still hypnotized, smiling at the mere 
      suggestion of it....

      EXT. DANI S HOUSE - DAY

      Dani watches from her doorstep as TK climbs into the back of 
      a waiting TOWN CAR.  

      As the car drives off, Dani spots a BLACK BMW with deeply 
      tinted glass parked across the street from her house.  What 
      the...?

      She boldly crosses over, knocks hard, the window rolls down.   

      REVEAL the driver: NICO CARELES.  Cool, a little dark.  Don t 
      fuck with this guy.  Former FBI?  Mossad?  Hard to tell.

                                  DANI
                    Can I help you?

      Nico points up to the upstairs of her house.                                                                             34.

                    Tell your kids to lay off the 
                      binoculars.

      She looks up in time to see the blinds settling. 

      Dani doesn t know who she s more pissed at -- her kids or 
      this asshole invading her space. 

                                  DANI
                    Excuse me, are you staking out my

                          (confused)
                    Doing...?

                                  NICO
                    Whatever needs doing.

                                  DANI
                    So you re security? 

                                  NICO
                    Something like that.

                                  DANI
                          (firm)
                    What happens here needs to be 
                      completely confidential....  

                                  NICO
                    Tell that to your kids, Dani. 

      He puts the car into gear.

                                  DANI
                    Wait, what s your--

      Too late.  He speeds off.  Dani looks up to the bedroom 
      window -- those kids are so gonna get it.

      INT. LINDSAY S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      She storms upstairs, goes into Lindsay s room - no one in 
      there.  She wheels, goes into 

      Ray Jr. s room - no sign of the kids.                                                                            35.

                    That s right, you better hide.

      She gathers up the dirty clothes piled next to the bed, when 
      something catches her eye in a half-closed drawer.  

      She pulls out...SOMETHING IN THE TRASH CAN...A REPORT CARD 
      with Lindsay s name on it, crumpled up.  

      She looks at it, her jaw hits the floor... 

      INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR S OFFICE

      ...where Dani meets with JOANNE, Lindsay s guidance 
      counselor.  Lindsay slouches in a chair, looking like she d

                    Why am I only hearing about this 
                    now?

                    Her teachers sent a note home each 
                    time.  And each one came back with 
                    your signature on it.

                    With my Mom and Dad separating... 
                    it s just been really...difficult.

      Lindsay tries to work up some tears.  Joanne, suddenly 
      sympathetic...

                                  JOANNE
                    I m sorry...I had no idea.

      Joanne hands Lindsay a box tissue, hand over her heart.  Dani 
      has to refrain from rolling her eyes.  Puts an arm around 
      Lindsay...

                                  DANI
                    She s a very sensitive girl.

                          (steaming)
                    I am not playing with you!  If you 
                    ruin my days...I will ruin your 
                    nights. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Loud and clear, Mom.  I get it.

                                  DANI
                    I don t think you do. Miss one more 
                    class this semester and you will be 
                    grounded forever.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What if I have a 105 degree fever? 

                                  DANI
                    I ll pack you on ice and drive you 
                    there myself.

      As Dani hits petal to the metal...

      INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE on ICE...POP goes the cork.

      The bubbly is poured into two GLASSES by a WAITER.

      REVEAL Dani and Matthew at dinner....as he hands Dani a glass 
      of champagne.

                                    MATTHEW
                          (to the waiter)
                    Thank you, sir.

                                  DANI
                    I thought this was going to be a 
                    business dinner.

                                    MATTHEW
                    It is.  Should we get down to 
                      business....?

      As he leans in to kiss her, she pulls back....

                                  DANI
                    Matthew.  I appreciate you sending 
                    me a client.  But I hope you didn t 
                    expect...

                                    MATTHEW
                      I expected you to be my sex 
                      slave...wasn t I clear?
                                  (MORE)                                                                            37.

                                    MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    I m joking, Dani.  

                                  DANI
                    What happened between us 
                      was...good.  Really good. But we 
                    have a professional relationship 
                    now.  And I can t do anything to 
                      compromise that.  I need to draw a 
                    line in the sand....

                                    MATTHEW
                          (understands)
                    ...we can see each other.  But we 
                    can t see each other...naked.

                                  DANI
                    Bingo.

                                    MATTHEW
                      Look...I d be lying if I said I m 
                    not disappointed.  But my priority 
                    is my players, and if you tell me 
                    the line needs to be drawn....

      Matthew puts a BREADSTICK on the table.  

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Nobody crosses this breadstick.

      She smiles.  Wishes he had fought a little harder...

                                  DANI
                    Good.

                                    MATTHEW
                          (switching gears)
                    So, how s it going with our problem 
                    child TK?

                                  DANI
                    We ve had two sessions.  So far, he 
                    seems receptive enough.  But, has 
                    he ever been evaluated for...anger 
                    issues?

      Matthew laughs.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Pro football is all about 
                      controlled anger -- harnessing that 
                    explosive power.  The last thing we 
                    want you to do is make him soft.  
                    TK s got bigger problems than that.

                                    MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    Fact is...he s been bounced from so 
                    many teams, had so many drops, he s 
                    in danger of being dropped.  
                      Permanently.  
                          (then)
                    You re his last best hope. 

      This is news to Dani -  she suddenly realizes this guy s fate 
      is in her hands.  Matthew raises his GLASS...

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    A Toast -- to our man TK having a 
                    good game.  His career depends on

      As they CLINK GLASSES...off Dani s uneasy look.

      INT. SILVER TOYOTA CAMRY - ACROSS THE STREET

        A WEASLY-LOOKING GUY uses a long lens snaps a PHOTO of 
      Matthew and Dani through the restaurant window clinking

                                  JEANETTE
                    C mon, you know I won t tell

                    Cesar Fontanini.  And then you 
                    blabbed to the Brizzolara twins.

                    They got me trashed on Long Island 
                    Iced Teas!  I was defenseless.
                          (then)
                    Those Brizzolara girls were bad 
                    news.

                          (shouting)
                    Go GO Go!

      Jeanette stops yelling when she realizes that Dani has leaped 
      to her feet, too, yelling at the TV:                                                                            40.

                    is your client.  

      Before Dani can protest...

                    Always some kind of antics with TK.

      on each arm. 

      People give him props, high-five...it s all good.  Until...

      A big DRUNK GUY at the bar starts mouthing off:

                                  DRUNK GUY
                    Yo, it s TK!  Congrats, dude.  Bout

                    Why don t you give it a rest, my

                    Dude, guess who just walked in.  
                    Terrence Freakin  King.  

      As Terrence starts walking away, the Guy calls out to him.

                                  DRUNK GUY (CONT D)
                    Hey, TK, my friend wants to know 
                    what s your favorite candy bar -- 
                      Butterfingers or Payday?

      As the Drunk Guy laughs... 

      ON TK s face: he does a slow burn, starts walking back 
      towards the Drunk Guy...                                                                            42.

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - DAY

      Dani has Faye on the couch under hypnosis.  

                                  DANI
                    You re listening to my voice only, 
                    blocking out all other sounds... 

      Interrupted by a KNOCK on the door.  She goes to check, 
      assumes it s one of the kids but it s...Nico.  

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    ..you are relaxing your body,

                    negative thoughts and feelings 
                    leave your body.

                    I m in with a patient.

                          (irritated)
                    That s not how it works.

                          (calm but intense)
                    I have Terrence in the car. 

                                  DANI

                                  NICO
                    Did you get the check? 

      She nods. 

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    You deposit it?

      The message is clear -- she s on their time now.  Not one to 
      be bullied...

                                  DANI
                    Five minutes.

      Dani shuts the door.  Starts bringing Faye out of her 
      hypnotic state...while dashing around turning the clocks 
      ahead five minutes so she ll think her session is over.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Okay, Faye, I m going to count 
                    backwards from five and when I get 
                    to one you will be perfectly 
                    relaxed and feel an urge to eat 
                    high protein, low carb foods....

      EXT. DANI S DOOR - DAY

      Dani escorts Faye out...Faye hugs her. 

                                  FAYE
                    Three pounds down, only three more 
                    to go, Dr. Dani!

                                  DANI
                    You go girl! Go. Go.

      As she shuts the door...she looks for Terrence... no sign of 
      him.  She hears whooping coming from the....

      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Dani comes in to find Ray, Jr. playing MADDEN NFL FOOTBALL 
      with.... 

                                  DANI
                      Terrence...?

      Ray Jr. is over the moon hanging out with a FOOTBALL STAR. 

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Hold on, Mom.  It s fourth and goal 
                    from the nine.  Here s where I 
                    stuff him hard.                                                                            44.


                                  TERRENCE
                    Dream on, little man.  I m gonna 
                    pass to me and me can t be stopped 
                    on a straight post.

      As Terrence and Ray madly push buttons on their X-Box 
        controllers, REVEAL Terrence is a CHARACTER in the VIDEOGAME.  

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                      Touchdown!!!! 

                                  JOHN MADDEN (V.O.)
                      Touchdown!  Terrence King cannot be 
                    stopped by mere mortals.

      VIDEO GAME TERRENCE does a showboating end zone dance.

                                  TERRENCE
                    That s right!  Look at me go!  

                                  RAY, JR.
                    You did that exact same end zone 
                    dance in a game against Cleveland 
                    last year.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    That don t touch the real thing.  
                    Not enough shake and too much bake.

      Terrence leaps up, demonstrates the  real  dance.  

                                  DANI
                          (firm)
                      Terrence....?

      Terrence shoots Ray, Jr. a look: Mom s mad.

                                  RAY, JR.
                          (sotto)
                    Uh oh, that s her angry neck vein.  
                    You better go.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Catch you later, Ray, Jay.  
                    Remember what I told you...when 
                    you re being rushed, shock  em with 
                    two hands out like this.  

      Terrence demonstrates.

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                    Buys you a couple of yards of space 
                    to make your move.                                                                            45.


                                  RAY JR.
                          (beaming)
                    Will do, TK.

      Terrence bumps fists with Ray, Jr., heads off with Dani who 
      is NOT smiling....

      EXT. DANI S HOUSE - DAY

      ...where Nico s in his car, when, in his rear view mirror he 
      spots the SILVER CAMRY that was watching Dani and Matthew at 
      dinner. 

      Parked down the block from Dani s house.  Hmmm.

      INT. DANI S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Dani closes her office door, livid, gets up in 
      Terrence s face.  

                                  DANI
                      Boundaries, Terrence. I m your 
                      therapist, not part of your posse. 
                    You show up at your appointment 
                    times -- not before, not after.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Hey, you don t want your son 
                    getting free advice from a four 
                    time Pro Bowler, that s fine...

                                  DANI
                    I don t.  But I would like to know 
                    why you smashed that cell phone 
                    into that guy s head.

                                  TERRENCE
                    How else do you turn off a cell 
                    phone?

                                  DANI
                    Is this...funny to you?

                                  TERRENCE
                    You just like the rest of  em. 
                    People always want to blame the 
                    famous guy.

                                  DANI
                    No. People always want to blame the 
                    guy who gave someone 12 stitches 
                    and a concussion.

      He s not used to being handled like this. She s engaged him.                                                                            46.


                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Anger is a defense mechanism, 
                    Terrence -- a response to being 
                    hurt. Who hurt you? 

                                  TERRENCE
                    Who didn t hurt me? 
                          (then)
                    My Mom OD ed when I was eight. My 
                    Dad put me in foster care. I was a 
                    throw away. You know what that s 
                    like? 

      She does.   But never mind that.

                                  DANI
                    So let s start with Mom.

                                  TERRENCE
                    She s dead and buried.  How the 
                    hell is that going to help?!  How 
                    the hell s any of this gonna 
                    help??!

                                  DANI
                      Acknowledging where our pain comes 
                    from is the first step to freeing 
                    ourselves from it.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Freeing myself from pain?  My whole 
                    career is about pain.

                                  DANI
                    Do you care about that career?  
                    Because from what I can tell, one 
                    more fumble -- on or off the field, 
                    and that s more than toilet paper 
                    slipping through your fingers....  

                                  TERRENCE
                          (erupts)
                    It s my career.  I ll trash it if I 
                    want! Hell, I ll trash your whole 
                    goddamn office.

      He towers over her as he smashes a picture frame against a 
      wall.  Dani doesn t FLINCH.  SHOWS NO FEAR.

                                  DANI
                    Fine.  But make sure you tear down 
                    that wall.  I ve been wanting to 
                    expand for a while.                                                                            47.


      He s approaches her FRUSTRATED...GLOWERS DOWN AT HER.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    Oooh, TK s crazy, TK can t control 
                    himself.  What makes you think I 
                    won t go all TK and pop you one 
                    right now?

      Is he going to hit her?  Dani holds her ground.

                                  DANI
                    Way I look at it, you ve got 
                    millions, I have shit.  You hit me, 
                    I ve got millions and you ve got 
                    shit.  So I m in a can t lose 
                      situation.

      He tears open the door and storms out. She stops him...

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                      Terrence...it doesn t have to be 
                    this way.  You re better than this.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    No, I m not.  

      And he s gone.  

      She closes the door, only then realizes... she's shaking.  

      Holy shit, that was scary.  


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                            48.


                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. PRACTICE FACILITY - DAY

      The guard waves Dani through.

      INT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

      Players run drills on the field.  In another area, Matthew 
      helps a huge linebacker with stretches.  Sees Dani 
        approaching.

      Whacks the player on the head to keep going, then heads over 
      to Dani.  As they walk...

                                  DANI
                    You going to tell me what s going 
                    on?

                                    MATTHEW
                    Not here.

      They disappear into a tunnel.  

      INT. HALLWAY/MEN S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

      Matthew pushes into the locker room.  Dani stops dead.

                                  DANI
                      Um...that s the men s...

      They push into...

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

      He leads her through the locker room -- just as a couple of 
      naked players come out of the shower.  Oh, shit. 

                                    MATTHEW
                          (amused)
                    Don t worry, they re used to it.

                                  DANI
                    Yeah, but I m not.
                          (to herself)
                    Eyes up.  Eyes up.

      They go back into... 

      INT. MEDIA ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ...where they find COACH PURNELL watching game films.  Nico 
      seated alongside him.  Purnell pauses the video.                                                                              49.


                                  COACH
                    Welcome to the inner sanctum, Dr. 
                    Dani.  Can I interest you in a 
                    coffee, soda, scotch?

      She sits down at the table.

                                  DANI
                    No, thanks.  I m good.

                                    MATTHEW
                    You ve met Nico, I assume.

                                  DANI
                    Nico, nice to put a name to the 
                    friendly face.   

                                  NICO
                    I m not good with introductions.

                                  DANI
                    Clearly. Does  Nico  come with a 
                    last name?  Or are you like Cher 
                    and Madonna.

                                  NICO
                          (amused by her)
                    Careles.  It s Greek.

      As Matthew and Coach takes their seats, Matthew clocks this 
      interaction with Dani and Nico (is it flirting?  Hmm)

                                  DANI
                    So, full court press here, what s 
                    going on?

                                  COACH
                    We ve run into a little bit of a 
                    hitch with our man TK. 

                                  DANI
                    I thought assault with a cell phone 
                    was a big hitch, but...

                                    MATTHEW
                    He s disappeared, Dani.

      Surprises her.

                                  DANI
                    What?  When?                                                                            50.


                                  COACH
                    Last seen he was coming out of your 
                    office. 

                                  DANI
                    Okay...so Nico lost him?

                                  NICO
                    No...he jumped out of my car.  
                    While it was moving.

                                  DANI
                    Wow.

                                  COACH PURNELL
                          (cuts right to the chase)
                    So, now, what all did you and TK 
                    talk about in your last session?

                                  DANI
                    Look, I can tell you he has anger 
                      management issues, but that would 
                    be insulting your intelligence.  If 
                    you re asking me where he went...I 
                    have no idea.    

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    What the hell did you say to him? 

                                  DANI
                    What did...I say to him?  Fellas, 
                    my conversations with Terrence King 
                    are privileged and confidential.  I 
                    can t disclose the content of our 
                    sessions without violating TK s 
                    privacy, not to mention breaching 
                    my ethical obligations...

      Purnell rises up, irritated.

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    What the hell is this horse shit.  
                    Who pays the bills young lady? 

                                  DANI
                          (taken aback)
                    You do... 

      Getting in her face:

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    That s right.  And he who pays the 
                    piper calls the tune.                                                                              51.


      Averse to intimidation, she stands up, too.

                                  DANI
                    That might work if I were actually 
                      a piper...but I have a PhD in 
                      psychology and I have taken an oath 
                    not to rat out my clients 
                      regardless of who pays their tab.  
                    My job is to...

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    Your job is to help my guy play 
                    better.

                                  DANI
                    I thought that was your job.  

      Close talking her:

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    Are we gonna have a problem you and 
                    me, little lady?

                                  DANI
                    If you re sending players to 
                    therapy to spy on them, then yes, 
                    we are going to have a problem.  
                    Big man.

      They are nose to nose in a stand off.  Nico and Matthew 
        watch...enjoying this spectacle.

                                  COACH PURNELL
                          (yelling at her)
                    Are you always this pigheaded?!

                                  DANI
                          (yelling back)
                    Only when it comes to protecting my 
                    clients and my children!

      Her phone rings.  She glances at the caller ID.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                          (coach yell)
                    I have to take this!  It s my 
                      daughter s guidance counsellor!  
                    Hello...?   

      She storms out.  Long beat.  Purnell clicks his tongue.

                                  COACH PURNELL
                    You telling me she knows what she s 
                    doing?                                                                            52.


                                    MATTHEW
                    Haven t had a smoke in weeks.

      INT. SCHOOL - DAY

      ...where Dani meets with Joanne and Lindsay...again.  

                                  DANI
                    How many?

                                  JOANNE
                    Two unexcused absences.

                                    LINDSAY
                    It was PE, Mom.   

                                  DANI
                    I don t care what class it was.

                                    LINDSAY
                    You don t?

                                  DANI
                    Nope.  Because after looking 
                    through your grades and test 
                    scores, Joanne here has determined 
                    that none of this is your fault. 

                                    LINDSAY
                          (relieved, but frightened)
                    It s not...?

                                  JOANNE
                    According to your standardized test 
                    scores, you have a bona fide 
                    learning disability.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What?

                                  DANI
                    Yeah, Linds.  You know what that 
                      means...you qualify for an IEP. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    IEP?  That s...

                                  JOANNE
                    Special Ed.                                                                            53.


                                    LINDSAY
                    WHAT? The only reason I do bad on 
                    tests is I get bored and fill in 
                    the blanks randomly.  Not because 
                    I m a retard!

                                  DANI
                    Of course you re not, honey.  But 
                    Joanne here has made arrangements 
                    so that you get all the assistance 
                    you need, god bless our tax dollars 
                    at work.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What kind of assistance?

      There s a KNOCK ON THE DOOR...

                                  JOANNE
                          (spots someone in the 
                            hall)
                    Oh, perfect timing.  Lindsay, meet 
                    Wally Sharp.  Your new shadow.

      Enter WALLY SHARP, (50) a short, sweaty, nerdy public ed 
      lifer with halitosis.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (horrified)
                    Shadow?

                                  JOANNE
                    Mr. Sharp will escort you to each 
                    and every class, and he ll go over 
                    each and every assignment with you.

                                  WALLY
                    Don t worry.  I m very low key, the 
                    other kids barely notice me.

      Wally takes a hit off his INHALER.  Off Lindsay s look of 
      abject horror....

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      As Lindsay and Dani push down the hallway, through throngs of 
      teens...

                                    LINDSAY
                    This is humiliating! You can t do 
                    this to me!                                                                            54.


                                  DANI
                    Get your grades up, we ll talk 
                    about rescinding your sentence.  
                    You ll thank me for this one day.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I ll thank you for classifying me 
                    as a retard?  In your dreams.

                                  WALLY
                          (wheezing)
                      Lindsay...wait up! If we hurry we 
                    can catch the end of sixth period!

      He runs to catch up with her.  Lindsay stalks off mortified.  

      Dani feels bad...but only a little.   CUT TO:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

      ...where Dani is walking towards a lit up FOOTBALL FIELD, 
      talking on her CELL.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, this is Dr. Dani.  Again. 
                    I m concerned about you...your 
                    whole team is. Please, call me 
                    back. Or call...someone...just to 
                    let them know you re okay.  
                    Okay...?   

      She snaps her phone shut, exhales.  She s clearly worried.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

      A football is snapped, players collide.  

      REVEAL we re not at a pro game -- this is high school 
      football.  In some ways even more intense.  

        Cheerleading squad (which includes Lindsay) cheers....

                                  CHEERLEADERS
                      BE...AGGRESSIVE!  BE-BE-AGGRESSIVE!

      ON THE FIELD: Ray, Jr. catches a pass for a first down.  

      IN THE BLEACHERS

      Dani and Angela cheering.

                                  DANI
                    Way to go, Ray!                                                                            55.


                                  ANGELA
                    Let s go, Syosset!  Run up the 
                    score!

                                  DANI
                    Please tell me you didn t.

                                  ANGELA
                    Just a friendly wager with a woman 
                    from church.  

                                  DANI
                          (appalled)
                    Ma!

      Ray, Sr. appears next to Angela...

                                  ANGELA
                    Look who s here!

                                  RAY SR
                    Hey, Ma.

      Angela gives Ray a big HUG.  Dani wants to slap her mother.

                                  DANI
                    You don t get to sit here.  And you 
                    don t get to call her Ma, either.

                                  ANGELA
                    It s fine, Danielle.  Sit. 

      She gives her mother a look...how could you??  

                                  RAY SR
                    Don t make a scene, Dan.  We re all 
                    cheering for the same team, right?

      Before Dani can respond, her CELL RINGS.  She checks caller 
      ID.  It s...

                                  DANI
                    Terrence?  Ohmygod, where the hell 
                    are you?

                                  TERRENCE (O.S.)
                    Right behind you.

      She turns around...

      A LARGE MAN with popcorn, wearing shades and a baseball cap 
      pulled down low, is sitting in the BACK ROW.  He waves, no 
      one sitting next to him on either side the wiser.                                                                             56.


      INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM ON THEIR PHONES

      Dani trying to keep anyone from hearing her call...

                                  DANI
                    What are you doing here?

                                  TERRENCE
                    I told Ray Jay I d pop by the game.  
                    He texted me the info.

                                  DANI
                    You re texting with my son?  
                      Terrence....?

                                  TERRENCE
                      Boundaries, I know. But did you 
                    catch that two handed chuck on the 
                    last play -- I taught him that.  
                    Good trick to put some space 
                    between him and the DB.  Boom.

      Off Dani s frustration...she nods for him to meet her.

      EXT. BLEACHERS - MOMENTS LATER

      Dani meets with Terrence behind the bleachers.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Sometimes a man needs to get up 
                    into the wind, do some thinking.

                                  DANI
                      I appreciate that, but you can t 
                    just disappear like that. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    I ve been thinking about what you 
                    said...

      ...a TEENAGE BOY passes:

                                    TEENAGE BOY
                    Hey, Mrs. Santino.  

                                  DANI
                    Hey, Joey.

      The boy keeps going, but then turns back.  His look says it 
      all -- was that Terrence King?                                                                            57.


                                  TERRENCE
                          (quiet, just for her)
                    -- about making peace with my 
                    mother.  I m ready.

                                  DANI
                          (genuine)
                    That s great, Terrence.  Good for 
                    you. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    I never went to her grave.  She s 
                    buried near Newark.

                                  DANI
                    That would be a big step, and it s 
                    not far at all.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Cool.  We ll be back in a couple of 
                    hours.

      Dani looks at him... Did she hear right?

                                  DANI
                     We ll? 

                                  TERRENCE
                    You ll have to drive.  I can t 
                    really drive.  I mean I can, but I 
                    had my license yanked for a couple 
                    of DUI s last year.

      She looks at him like he s nuts....

                                  DANI
                    Terrence.  I can t take you to 
                    Newark right now...   

                                  TERRENCE
                          (like a child)
                    Okay.

      She sees the look on his face...he s vulnerable.  This 
      opportunity may never arise again.

      EXT. BLEACHERS - MOMENTS LATER

      Ray Sr watches her as she grabs her PURSE and COAT from the 
        bleachers...

                                  DANI
                    Work emergency, Ray you got the 
                    kids covered?                                                                            58.


                                  RAY
                      Yeah...sure.

      As she rushes off...

      EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

      ...where Ray Sr has clearly followed Dani to the parking lot.  
      He watches as Terrence King gets into Dani s car with her.  
      Kids begin to mob the car as Terrence is SPOTTED.  Terrence 
      happily signs some quicky autographs before getting in.

                                  KID
                    That s Terrence King!

      Some more kids go running by...

                                  RAY SR
                    What the hell s he doing with my 
                    wife?  

      Off Ray s perplexed look...


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                            59.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      On the road: Dani driving.  Terrence fiddles with her radio -- 
      her preset buttons are all oldies rock or news.

                                  TERRENCE
                    You mind?

                                  DANI
                    Sure.  Just nothing with pimps and 
                    hos.

      He spins the dial to a station playing Miles Davis cool jazz.

                                  TERRENCE
                    Now don t you feel stupid.
                          (then)
                    Jazz and football are the same.  
                    There s a rhythm, a tempo and a 
                    plan, but you gotta be ready to 
                    improvise on the fly.  Seat of your 
                    pants.  Never boring.

                                  DANI
                    Nobody ever tore their ACL playing 
                    bebop music.

                                  TERRENCE
                    True, dat.

      They listen to the music.

                                  TERRENCE (CONT D)
                    So what s your deal, Dr. D?  
                    Where s the pain in your past? 

                                  DANI
                    Why do you assume there s pain?

                                  TERRENCE
                            (undeterred)
                    The only person I know more pissed 
                    off than me is you.  According to 
                    you, where there s anger there s 
                    pain.

                                  DANI
                    I m happy to share my pain...with 
                    my shrink.                                                                            60.


                                  TERRENCE
                    That s all right, I know the drill.
                    Ray was a dog, you kicked his sorry 
                    ass out, and now he wants to screw 
                    you on the cheese.  Why any man 
                    would cheat on a fine looking lady 
                    like you I don t get.

      She shoots him a look: how do you know that?

                                  DANI
                          (peeved)
                    Ray Jay s gonna be in the Guinness 
                    Book for world s biggest mouth.

      Beat.  Then: 

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    We got married very young... and 
                    very stupid.  Dad drank.  Mom 
                    gambled.  I...ran.  Ray rescued me.  
                    Took care of me...and a few other 
                    women along the way, apparently.

      Terrence clocks that.

                                  TERRENCE
                    I guess we re both throwaways. 

                                  DANI
                          (realizing he s right, 
                            painful as that is)
                    Guess we are.

      As they pull off the expressway in Newark....

      EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

      A small headstone: Loretta King.  Born 1963.  Died 1990.  

      Terrence stands over the grave, unsure how to proceed.  Dani 
      bundles up against the cold wind. 

                                  TERRENCE
                    How am I supposed to feel?  

                                  DANI
                    There s no playbook for this. 

      He nods, kneels in front of the grave...Dani takes a few 
      steps back to give him his space, watches as he mumbles 
      something barely spoken to his mother/to himself.                                                                              61.


      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Dani watches from a respectful distance, moved by the sight 
      of this HUGE HULK, kneeling over this worn, untended stone.  

      After a moment, she realizes...Terrence is sobbing.  

                                  TERRENCE
                    Couple of mistakes and the team s 
                    just gonna throw me away.  Just 
                    like they all do.

      Finally it all makes sense.  

      She quietly puts her hand on his shoulder, supportive. 

      Something he s just not used to.  He wipes away his tears, 
      pulls it together.  And throws his arms around her.  

      Dani embraces him with a maternal hug.  Something he s 
      probably never had.

      Off that breakdown/breakthrough tableau....

      INT. SCHOOL - DAY

      Lindsay and her cheerleader friends are hanging out on the 
      lawn with boys.  Lindsay is talking to a CUTE GUY when... 

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Lindsay Santino...yoo hoo.

      Lindsay turns around, mortified to see Wally Sharp, looking 
      for her.

                                  CUTE GUY
                    Who s that guy?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Oh...I have no idea.

      Lindsay goes over to her friend MAXINE...

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                      Maxine...quick, cover for me.

      Maxine goes over to Mr. Sharp.

                                  MAXINE
                    Are you looking for Lindsay?  She 
                    went that way....

      On Lindsay, going in the opposite direction.                                                                              62.


      INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      ...where Lindsay moves through crowded hallway...only to 
      realize Mr. Sharp is in hot pursuit.  He sees her, she ducks 
      quickly into the...

      INT. GIRL S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Lindsay enters, several girls are SMOKING.  

                                  GIRL
                    Hey, Linds.  What s up?

                                    LINDSAY
                          (casual)
                    Hey, Charlene.  Not a whole lot.

      And with that, Lindsay jumps up onto the WINDOW LEDGE.

      EXT. DANI S STREET - DAY

      ...where Dani s drives, on the phone, excited.

                                  DANI
                    I think Terrence had a big 
                      breakthrough last night....  

      INT. TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

      ...where Matthew talks on the phone, TK working out with the 
      other players in the background.

                                    MATTHEW (ON THE PHONE)
                    Well, he showed up for practice.  
                    So that s good.  We ll call it a 
                    victory if he can stay out of 
                    trouble for more than five 
                      minutes...

      INT. DANI S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Speaking of staying out of trouble...Dani s adrenaline surges 
      as she sees: a SQUAD CAR in the driveway of her house.  

                                  DANI
                    Jesus.  I gotta call you back.

      She jams the CAR into PARK...jumps out of her car, sees 

      Lindsay in the squad car backseat, looking hangdog.  

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Lindsay??                                                                             63.


      A COP approaches.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Officer, I m her mother, what s 
                    going on??

                                  COP
                    Your daughter here took the speaker 
                    off a McDonald s drive through box. 

                                  DANI
                    With what, her bike?

                                  COP
                    Her car.

                                  DANI
                    She doesn t have a car. 
                          (slow boil)
                    Or a license.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT - LATER

      ...a tow truck sets down a MINI COOPER, driver s side 
      thrashed, broken side mirror dangling sadly.  

      Ray Jr. gets out of the TOW TRUCK passenger side.

                                  TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    That ll be two hundred dollars.  We 
                    take cash or check.

      Dani looks to the upstairs window.  Lindsay ducks out of the 
      way, but not fast enough.  Dani burns.

      INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

      A ball of fire, Dani yanks open the front door, storms 
      through the foyer.  Ray, Jr. tries to slow her down.

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Mom, think twice before doing 
                    anything crazy.  Judges frown on 
                    parents killing their kids.

      ...and Dani wheels on him.

                                  DANI
                    And YOU!  Since when did you become 
                    the town crier?  Is there anyone 
                    you don t blab my business to?                                                                            64.


      As she motors upstairs, Ray Jr calls up to her:

                                  RAY, JR.
                    Teenagers feel a loss of support as 
                    the result of divorce and turn 
                    outwards to fill that gap!

                                  DANI (O.S.)
                    Stop reading my psychology books!  
                    You don t understand them!

      INT. LINDSAY S ROOM - NIGHT

      ...where Dani bursts into Lindsay s room.  

                                  DANI
                    What are you some kind of idiot?! 
                    You could have killed somebody! 

                                    LINDSAY
                    That shadow guy chased me into the 
                    girls bathroom, Mom, he followed me 
                    out the freakin  window!  I 
                    couldn t take it anymore, so I... 
                    got the car keys from Ray Jays 
                    locker and went to Mickey Dees for 
                    some fro yo.  To clear my head.

      To clear her head??  Dani s heard enough.  She calmly takes 
      LINDSAY S CELL PHONE from her.

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  DANI
                    Well, you re never leaving the 
                    house again, so you won t be 
                    needing this.

      Lindsay is outraged, leaps out of bed.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Mom!  What about cheerleading?? You 
                    can t do this!

                                  DANI
                    Unless you re out feeding the 
                    homeless or helping disabled nuns 
                    across the street, grounded means 
                    you are at home!  And you re going 
                    to help pay for the damage!  And 
                    the court costs!

      As Dani starts to exit...                                                                            65.


                                    LINDSAY
                    Fine!  I ll just fail out of 
                    school.  You can t make me learn.

      ...she turns back to Lindsay, genuinely sad:

                                  DANI
                    Why does such a smart girl refuse 
                    to take herself seriously? 

                                    LINDSAY
                    I had you as my role model.

      Bulls eye -- Dani snaps, picks Lindsay up by her BRA STRAPS, 
      eyes burning mad:

                                  DANI
                    For 17 years I was the perfect 
                    wife, the perfect mother. I packed 
                    lunches, went to PTA meetings...I 
                      sacrificed everything for this 
                    family.  And all I get in return is 
                    a bunch of LIES.  

      They re nose to nose....

                                    LINDSAY
                          (defiant)
                    You talking to me... or Dad?

      Dani raises a hand to slap Lindsay, when:

                                  ANGELA (O.S.)
                    Danielle!  

      Her mother has appeared in the DOORWAY.

                                  ANGELA (CONT D)
                    Go to your room!  

      Off Dani shaking... she s just pulled a TK.

      INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Dani sits on the floor under the window, head in her hands.   
      Angela comes in.  Waits.

                                  DANI
                          (shakes her head)
                    Seventeen years, I never raised a 
                    hand to my kids.

      As maternal as Angela can muster:                                                                            66.


                                  ANGELA
                    It happens.

      A long beat.

                                  DANI
                      I remember that.

      After a beat, Angela backs out, shuts the door.  

      Off Dani, tearing up for the first time.

      INT. LAWYER S OFFICE - DAY

      ...where Dani and her LAWYER sit across from Ray and his 
      lawyer.  It s tense.

                                  DANI S LAWYER
                    My client is entitled to half the 
                    money your client has earned during 
                    their seventeen year marriage, plus 
                    alimony.

                                  RAY S LAWYER
                    She would be entitled to quite a 
                    bit of my money, if my client still 
                    had any, but most of it sadly was 
                    lost in the economic downturn.

                                  RAY
                          (with a shrug)
                    Bad times in the garment business.    

                                  DANI
                    You are so full of it, Ray, the 
                    city should charge your mouth a 
                    sewer tax.

      Ray just smiles.

                                  RAY S LAWYER
                      Additionally, we will be asking the 
                    court to consider your client s 
                    fitness as a mother, given the 
                    dangerous nature of the patients 
                    coming into the home for 
                      hypnotherapy...

                                  DANI
                    The nature of my patients??  Is 
                    this a joke?                                                                            67.


                                  RAY S LAWYER
                    Terrence King is a known drug 
                    addict, currently charged in a 
                    felony assault.  And finally, we 
                    will be asking for limited alimony 
                    due to your client s disregard for 
                    the sanctity of the marital 
                      relationship.

      Off Ray s smug smile, and Dani, fuming....

      INT. MEN S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      ...where Ray is taking a leak.  Dani BARGES IN.

                                  RAY
                    What the hell...?

                                  DANI
                    Do you have a tail on me, Ray? 

                                  RAY
                    Should I?  

                                  GUY IN A SUIT
                          (also at the urinal)
                    Hello, this is the men s room.

                                  DANI
                          (eyes down)
                    More like the little boy s room.

      The Guy in a Suit zips up, high tails it out of there.   

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    You re challenging my fitness as a 
                    mother? 

      Ray zips up, turns to her.

                                  RAY
                    Stop playing the wounded wife card, 
                    all right? Fact is...you were a 
                    rescue mutt, I turned you into a 
                    show dog. Gave you everything. When 
                    you got bored with manicures and 
                    shopping for shoes, I let you go 
                    back to school, set you up with 
                    your little therapy practice...  

                                  DANI
                    You condescending cheating 
                      sonuvabitch.                                                                            68.


                                  RAY
                    You ve always known who I was, Dan.  

                                  DANI
                    I knew you were ruthless in 
                      business...

                                  RAY
                          (pointed)
                    Well, now you ve become business.

      As Dani takes that ominous reality in...he walks out of the 
      bathroom.  

      As some other MEN walk in...they do a 180, confused, leaving 
      Dani staring at her own reflection.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DANI S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      ...where Dani s asleep, but a SOUND causes her to open her 
      eyes.  A CAR DOOR opens and closes.  What the hell?  It s 4 
      am.

      She jumps out of bed, looks out the window, sees... Nico in 
      the driveway.  He motions hello with a two finger salute.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Irritated, Dani opens the front door, robe, hair mussed, 
      finds Nico waiting.  

                                  DANI
                    Nico, it s four in the morning.

                                  NICO
                    Your patient is in a crack house 
                    and he s got the Monday night game 
                    in fifteen hours.

                                  DANI
                          (omg, confused)
                      Terrence...?  I don t understand, 
                    we had a major breakthrough.

                                  NICO
                    Fine line between breakthrough and 
                      breakdown.
                          (then)
                    You re the only one he ll talk to.

                                  DANI
                      Okay...put him on the phone.                                                                            69.


                                  NICO
                    He s not picking up.

      Now she realizes what he s asking. 

                                  DANI
                    No. No. No. You don t 
                      understand...I m in the middle of a 
                    nasty custody battle here - if my 
                    husband finds out that I left my 
                    kids alone in the middle of the 
                    night to go to a crack house...

                                  NICO
                    I would never ask you to do that.

      He motions to the CAR -- out steps XENO, a huge Ving Rhames 
      looking character.  

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    That s Xeno.  He has a degree in 
                    early childhood development...

                                  DANI
                    You re joking.

                                  NICO
                    Yes.  He s ex-special forces, but 
                    he loves kids.   

      Dani tries to process her choices here.

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                          (serious, quiet)
                    We re talking about a man s life.

      Dani exhales...yes, they are. 

                                  DANI
                    What do you wear to a crack house?


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                            70.


                                        ACT SIX

      EXT. DANI S HOUSE - NIGHT

      ...where Dani quietly exits the house (dressed down -- jeans, 
      tennis shoes and sweatshirt.)  She climbs into Nico s car.

                                  DANI
                    I need to be back by sun-up.  I 
                    can t have my kids wake up and find 
                    Xeno in the kitchen....

                                  NICO
                    Not a problem.

                                  DANI
                    Is that a promise?

                                  NICO
                    When you know me longer you won t 
                    have to ask that question.

      As they drive away, they pass that SILVER CAMRY up the block 
      from her house, the Weasly Guy firing pictures with a long 
      lens.  Suddenly, Dani puts it all together...

                                  DANI
                    That s how he knows...Ray has that 
                    guy tailing me.  
                          (panics)
                    Ohmygod, I can t do this.  Turn the 
                    car around.  

                                  NICO
                    I can t do that.

                                  DANI
                    Fine, I ll just pull a TK, do a 
                    jump and roll...

      She opens the door...he never slows down.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    DAMN IT NICO!

                                  NICO
                    That guy s not going to cause you 
                    any problems.
                          (looks her in the eyes)
                    You have my word.

      Nico says it with such authority that she can t help but 
      believe in him.  Frankly, at this point, she has no choice.                                                                            71.


      EXT. RUN DOWN HOUSE - NIGHT

      A run down house with bars on the windows, two scary pitbulls 
      at the backyard fence barking.  

      At the curb in the car...Nico kills the engine.   

      Dani realizes how deep in she is in this moment.  

                                  DANI
                          (gallows humor)
                    I ve never been to a crack house, 
                    is there a special handshake?

                                  NICO
                    Start by getting out of the car. 

      She girds herself, climbs out of the car.  Strides up the 
      walkway -- freaking on the inside, but never showing it.

      She knocks tentatively on the door.  No response.  Turns back 
      to Nico (who s leaning against the car) for guidance.  

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Louder.

      She knocks louder.  She hears noises, tries to see through 
      the front window, spots what might be Terrence.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, I know you re in there.  
                    Unlock the door so we can talk. 

      Nothing.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Don t do this, TK.  You re better 
                    than this.

      The eastern sky begins to get light.  Her frustrations with 
      family, divorce, life boil over... she starts banging on the 
      door now: 

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    TERRENCE. I dragged myself out of 
                    bed, left my kids home with a 
                    complete stranger who probably is 
                    scaring the crap out of them right 
                    about now.

      Nothing.                                                                            72.


                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    I gave up my goddamn beauty rest 
                    for you, you selfish sonuvabitch! 
                      Fine...you re not coming out, I m 
                    washing my hands of you...don t 
                    call me at 4 am, don t show up at 
                    my son s football games, and lose 
                    my freakin  number.

      She starts walking towards Nico when...

      ...the sound of the locks being undone, the door cracks open, 
      Terrence comes out...all the bravado gone.

      Dani walks towards him slowly.  Holds out her hand...he 
      doesn t take it.  He sits down on the STOOP.

                                  TERRENCE
                    I m not better than this.  

      She sits down next to him.  Deliberates carefully before 
      choosing her words.  These words may be the difference 
      between TK coming home with her...or not.

                                  DANI
                    Terrence, I know what it s like to 
                    come from the wrong side of the 
                    tracks... what it s like to finally 
                    have something worth having, and to 
                    believe deep down, in a place you 
                    never look...that you don t deserve 
                    it. But Terrence, the people who 
                    threw us away, they re the ones who 
                    fumbled.  Our pain is our fuel, 
                    like it or not.  People like us 
                    either kick some ass, or get our 
                    asses kicked.  The choice is ours.    

      Terrence nods a smile of recognition.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    If you walk away with me right now, 
                    I promise I will never, ever give 
                    up on you, whether you like it or 
                    not. But if you go back inside...

      She shrugs as if to say...nothing I can do for you.

      A moment, then...he stands.  What s he going to do?  

      He reaches down for her hand.  He lifts her up.    

      And they walk towards the car...this giant man and this tiny 
      woman.                                                                              73.


      EXT. NICO S CAR - NIGHT

      They drive home.  Dani glances at Terrence, curled up asleep 
      in the back seat of the car. 

                                  DANI
                    I don t think he can be left alone.

                                  NICO
                    I ll sleep at his house.  He won t 
                    be out of my sight until the game.  

                                  DANI
                    Then he goes straight to rehab.

                                  NICO
                    I will drive him there myself.  

                                  DANI
                    I ll go with you.

      They drive in silence.  

                                  NICO
                      I couldn t do what you do.

      She looks at him, surprised by what appears to be a 
      compliment.

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Never understood what kind of 
                    person would want to be a shrink.    

      She hadn t thought of it quite like this...

                                  DANI
                    We ve all got our addictions.  Some 
                    people it s alcohol.  Some it s... 
                    bread.  I guess...I m addicted to 
                    being needed.  What about you?  

                                  NICO
                    I m addicted to not being needed.

      She has to laugh.  They exchange a smile for the first time.

      And we suspect that Nico and Dani have more of a spark or 
      connection than we might have initially surmised.  

      EXT. DANI S HOUSE - DAWN

      The sun is just peeking over the horizon as Nico pulls into 
      her driveway.  Dani climbs out of the car.                                                                            74.


      INT. DANI S HOUSE - DAWN

      As she opens the front door, Xeno passes her... 

                                  XENO
                          (really deep voice)
                    I made banana pancakes.

                                  DANI
                          (doesn t know what to say)
                    Thanks.

                                  XENO
                    So long, Angela.

      He shuts the door on his way out.  Beat.

                                  DANI
                          (confused)
                      Angela...?

      REVEAL, standing in the kitchen doorway, eating a plate of 
        pancakes....  

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                          (weakly)
                    Mom...?

                                  ANGELA
                    Good morning, Danielle.  Can I have 
                    a word with you?

      And she s not happy with her daughter right now.  

      Off Dani s look...


                                  END OF ACT SIX                                                                            75.


                                      ACT SEVEN

      INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

      Dani lays on the couch, a wet cloth on her head.  Jeanette 
      brings her over some TYLENOL and a GLASS OF WATER.

                                  JEANETTE
                    So Angela read you the riot act, 
                    huh?

                                  DANI
                          (imitating her mother)
                     A crack house!  In Brooklyn!  What 
                    kind of mother leaves her kids in  
                    the middle of the night?!   

                                  JEANETTE
                    Hey, she s one to talk.  She bet 
                    all your sweet sixteen money on the 
                    horses. 

                                  DANI
                      Yeah...and won.  That s how we got 
                    that microwave.

      They laugh.

                                  JEANETTE
                    How s the headache?

                                  DANI
                    Mezzo mezzo.
                          (then)
                      I promised myself I d make a better 
                    life for my kids.  What d I end up 
                    with...a cheating husband, ugly 
                    divorce, and a custody battle.

                                  JEANETTE
                    Hey, you re living the American 
                    Dream.   

                                  DANI
                          (she chuckles, then)
                    I can t be expected to drop 
                      everything and leave my kids in the 
                    middle of the night.  Lindsay needs 
                    me.  I don t want to ever look back 
                    and say I didn t do everything I 
                    could to help her. 
                          (then)
                    I have to give the money back, Jen.  
                    Find another way to make ends meet.                                                                            76.


                                  JEANETTE
                    I hear you.
                          (bummed, but supportive)
                    Maybe Fuzzy has another opening.

      The DOORBELL RINGS.  

      Dani gets off the couch (careful to put the wet cloth in an 
      ashtray, not on the wood table).

      REVEAL around the corner...Lindsay, who has overheard this 
      whole conversation.  And we see the guilt in her eyes.

      INT. FOYER -  CONTINUOUS

      A DELIVERY MAN holds a large FED EX BOX.

                                  DELIVERY MAN
                    Dani Santino?  

      Off Dani s surprise....

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Jeanette watches as Dani opens the box... it s filled with 
      Hawks paraphernalia -- Hawks cap, jacket, sweatshirt, cold 
      weather toque, even a Hawks blanket.  

                                  JEANETTE
                    Whoa this is some serious swag.

      Taped to the top of the box is an envelope marked DANI 
      SANTINO.  Dani reads the NOTE: 

                                  DANI
                          (oy, reading)
                     See you at the game.  This is not 
                      a request.  Coach Purnell. 

      She pulls out some TICKETS.  Jeanette s jaw drops as she 
      examines them.....

                                  JEANETTE
                    Jesus, these are SEASON FIELD 
                    PASSES.  This is like the golden 
                    Wonka Ticket times a thousand, Dan.  
                    The holy grail.

      Jeanette rubs the PASSES against her skin...smelling them.                                                                            77.


                                  JEANETTE (CONT D)
                    If you quit, can you at least keep 
                    these.

      Lindsay and Ray Jr enter...see all the paraphernalia.

                                  RAY JR
                      Whoa...what do you got there?  

                                  JEANETTE
                          (in pain)
                    Field passes. For the game today.

                                  RAY JR
                          (beyond psyched)
                    You re kidding?!  We re going to 
                    the game?!!  

      Sees the look on their expectant faces...

                                  JEANETTE
                          (so quiet)
                    We gotta go.

      Off Dani s look...

      EXT. HAWKS PRACTICE FACILITY - DAY

      Cold, blustery fall afternoon. The parking lot is crowded 
      with players, coaches, family, friends, equipment bags all 
      being loaded. 

      Dani parks nearby, Jeanette in the passenger seat.  Kids in 
      back.  They all get out of the car.  She spots Matthew, 
      loading players onto the bus.  He spots her, waves her over.

                                  DANI
                    I ll just be a minute.  Wait here.

      As Dani crosses towards Matthew...Lindsay pulls out her 
      confiscated CELLPHONE from her pocket.   

      INT. SILVER CAMRY - CONTINUOUS

      ...where Weasly Private Eye, parked nearby, takes pictures of 
      Dani.  Suddenly, the PASSENGER DOOR OPENS, NICO slides in.

                                  NICO
                    Hey, scumbag, how are you?

      PI reaches for a GUN under the seat.  Nico gently stops him.                                                                             78.


                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    You don t want to do that.
                          (then)
                    Besides, I brought you a gift.

      He dumps some PHOTOS onto PI S LAP.  PI s face turns ashen...

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Last time I checked, hookers were 
                    still illegal in New York.  

                                  PI
                    What do you want?

                                  NICO
                    It s more about what you want.
                    Here are the options: I could get 
                    your license suspended for some 
                    illegal wiretaps - the Callum 
                    divorce you worked on, particularly 
                    nasty.  Or I could send your wife 
                    some potentially embarrassing 
                    photos. 
                          (nods re the photos)
                    Or, I could just offer you these...

      He pulls out a pair of TICKETS from his breast pocket.

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Rest of the home games this year.  
                    50 yard line.  Comes with parking.
                    In return...you disappear.  Along 
                    with any unflattering photos you 
                    might have of a certain woman.

      The PI thinks long and hard about how to play this... then 
      snatches the tickets out of Nico s hand. 

                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    Pleasure doing business with you.

      Nico slides out of the car.  And we know Nico's kept his 
      promise to Dani - she will not be hassled again.

      BACK ON DANI

      As she blows on her COLD HANDS, waiting for Matthew, Dani 
      gets a TEXT on her PHONE.  She pulls it from her pocket. 

      It reads, simply:  DON T QUIT.  

      Taking Dani by surprise, because it s from....                                                                            79.


                                  DANI
                    Lindsay?

      Before she can even process this, Matthew approaches.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Hey, we have a rehab facility all 
                    set up to receive TK after the game 
                    today.  Coach thanks you.  We all 
                    do.
                          (senses her trepidation)
                    I hope last night wasn t too much 
                    for you...because we d like to send 
                    you some more clients.  If you re 
                    up for it.

      She pauses, looks back at Lindsay, leaning against the car, 
      watching, they exchange a brief smile.  And Dani realizes in 
      that instant: Lindsay is PROUD of her.  

      For maybe the first time.

      And she realizes...that opportunity to send a message about 
      taking yourself seriously, that opportunity is right now.

                                  DANI
                    I am.  Up for it.

                                    MATTHEW 
                    Good.

      He gently takes her FIELD PASS from her, hangs it around her 
      neck.  

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Hold on to your tights.  That 
                    there s a pass to a whole new 
                    world.

      She smiles.  He smells her hair.  

                                    MATTHEW (CONT D)
                    Guess I m gonna be needing a lot 
                    more of those bread sticks. 

                                  DANI
                          (nods, smiles)
                    For now.

      They have a moment.  Then, he gets up on the player s bus and 
      the door closes behind him....

      A light, dusty snow has begun to fall, the kind that freshens 
      the world.                                                                              80.


      Dani spots Terrence, on the players  bus, looking out the 
      window.  With a haunting sadness, he puts his hand up to the 
      WINDOW.  

      Dani responds by putting her hand up as if to meet his hand.  
      He nods ever so slightly, appreciative.  A powerful moment 
      broken by...Dani s PHONE RINGS...she sees the caller ID.

                                  DANI (CONT D)
                    Faye?  Everything okay?

                                  FAYE (ON THE PHONE)
                    I did it, Dr. Dani. I lost the six 
                    pounds!  You re a total lifesaver.

      As Dani watches Terrence drive off...she doesn t know whether 
      to laugh or cry.   

                                  DANI
                          (almost to herself)
                      Congratulations.  You should feel 
                    proud.

      FATBOY SLIM S  PRAISE YOU  kicks in.

                                  FATBOY SLIM
                    We ve come a long, long way 
                    together, through the hard times 
                    and the good...I have to celebrate 
                    you, baby.  I have to praise you 
                    like I should.

      QUICK SHOTS OF

      -- TK s face in the window.  

      -- Dani shuts her phone, watching him go.

      -- Lindsay watching her mother...proud.   

      -- Nico watching Dani from his car...a small trace of a smile 
      on his face.

      As the bus disappears from sight, she pulls her knit Hawks 
      toque out of her pocket, pulls it down tight, heads back 
      toward her car.  A beat, then:

                                  DANI
                          (re Lindsay)
                    How the hell did she get her cell 
                    phone back?  

      She smiles ever so slightly.  The MUSIC CARRIES US OUT                                                                            81.

                    like I should.

      And we....
