  SAKAR (32), fear on his face a complete contradiction to 
  his huge muscular frame. By his side is CHALAK (19) wiry, 
  taut and filled with dangerous amounts of adrenaline. 
  In rear of van: LEYLA (28) Composed in her beauty and 
  totally focused in her intent. The leader. Prayer beads 
  in hand are gently caressed. 
 
  IN BG: (V/O) Sound of over one hundred Kurdish women,

  SELAMET (22) and EBRU(23) identifiably sisters... 
  LEYLA nods to SELAMET and EBRU. 
  SELAMET and EBRU open duffel bag, containing AK47 s. 
  Rolls of black cloth lie lengthways down van.

                                      (Kurdish) 
            Today we will remind the world that all we 
                              want is our home.

            He owes our people a great debt and despite

                                One last thing. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        SONAY 
              Last week we found out you are pregnant. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    I m what? 
 
  Too late. OZAN has arrived. 
 
                                        OZAN 
                Sonay! You lied to me. You said she was 
                beautiful. She is so much more than that. 
              Quick, a woman in your condition must sit 
                                        down. 
 
  OZAN kissing ZOE s hand. ZOE finds SONAY politely smiling 
  back. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              (whispers to SONAY) 
                  I m just going to find the Ladies. 
 
 
  ZOE moves down corridor, checking no-one is behind her - 
  checks door - It s locked - lock picking tools out... 
 
 
  ZOE reaches the upper landing. She moves quickly, looking 
  around her at all times. She goes to a satellite socket 
  on the wall, kneels down and unscrews it. ZOE very 
  quickly checks the bug, then starts to screw it back 
  together. The glass lift slowly makes it way up towards 
  her... 
 
 
  LEYLA can see JOHNNY in the car behind. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                            (Kurdish. Calm. Proud.) 
            We are not alone. The blood of our ancestors 
              pumps through our hearts. A blood line we 
            must fight for, and if God wishes, die for.

  JOHNNY flashes his headlights - 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                        Today the world will listen. 
 
  (FORMERLY SCENE 37) 
 
  Loud Sufi music - ZOE enters room. She strides over to 
  SONAY locked onto OZAN and others, overselling his 
  company. ZOE sidles up and sits down between them, 
  smiling. OZAN in some discomfort. 
 
                                        SONAY 
              You will not find a more dedicated travel 
                              company in Turkey. 
 
  OZAN pulls out inhaler. Only enough for one hit. SELIN 
  comes to the rescue. 
 
                                        SELIN 
            That is the last one Ozan? I ll have someone 
                                      fetch.. 
 
                                        OZAN 
                      Stop fussing woman. I m fine. 
                              (Back to business) 
 
  SELIN turns back to ZOE. 
 
                                        SELIN 
                                  (Back to ZOE) 
            My husband is also stubborn. So, Emily, how 
                                  many months? 
 
  ZOE s handbag lodged between ZOE s feet - 
 
                                        ZOE 
                I told him not to tell anyone! He's so 
                                      excited. 
 
                                        SELIN 
            He'll want a boy you know. All Turkish men 
                                    want boys. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  You have boys? 
 
                                        SELIN 
                                        Six.

                                      (Painful) 
                                        Six! 
 
                                        SELIN 
                          You don't wear your ring? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                Had an MRI scan today. They don't allow 
                                        metal. 
 
                                        SELIN 
                            Nothing wrong I hope? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          No. Everything is fine. 
 
 
  Three MASKED-a-TEERS moving at speed- SAS style -- LEYLA, 
  SELAMET and EBRU deal with PC STEVE and a security guard. 
  Behind them, CHALAK and SAKAR, carrying black cloth, 
  struggle to keep up -- 
 
  On they move, up the beautiful marble staircase... 
 
    A security guard emerges from doorway - 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 19
 

  SAM renders him unconscious with a single blow. LEYLA 
  steps over him as on they go, signalling to SAKAR to 
  barricade the front door... 
 
 
  Waiter offers ZOE champagne -- ZOE goes to accept, but 
  then finds SELIN's look of concern. Declines the offer. 
 
  The main doors burst open -- SAM -- LEVI -- VICTOR the 
  first to enter -- Crashing -- Guns in hand -- pumping 
    adrenaline -- Everything executed as loud and as quickly 
  as possible -- 
 
                                        SAM 
            Get on the floor! On the floor now do it! Do 
                                      it now! 
 
  CLOSE ON: ZOE expertly grabs her mobile from handbag then 
  drops her handbag and kicks it as far across room as she 
  can -- 
 
                                        VICTOR 
                                      (Booming) 
            Everyone get on the floor - Get on the floor! 
 
  (SCREAMS) 
 
  ZOE -- professional calm - without looking -- punches in 
  numbers -- 
 
                                        SAM 
              GET ON THE FLOOR. DO IT! DO IT NOW! MOVE! 
 
  ZOE hits send --- 
 
  CLOSE ON: Mobile shuts down... 
 
  At same time - ZOE locks focus on --- 
 
  EXT CLOSE ON: SAM s Heckler and Koch -- his balaclava - 
 
  ON TO -- VICTOR UPS KOCK SEMI AUTO -- masked face -- 
  handgun - LEVI - same weapon - same mask - 
 
  ZOE has no pockets for her mobile - but SONAY does. She 
  begins to play the terrified hostage, grabbing SONAY for 
  comfort, while slipping her mobile into his pocket- it s 
  aerial just poking up out of his pocket. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 20
 

  SONAY is too busy shitting himself to notice, or be of 
  any comfort. 
 
                                        SONAY 
                                    Oh my god! 
 
  LEYLA, CHALAK, SAKAR, SELAMET and EBRU rush in, dragging 
  PC STEVE, security guards and waitress -- 
 
  ZOE now confused - 
 
  Five unmasked terrorists? - AK 47s in hand. SAKAR throws 
  down rolls of cloth - SELAMET and EBRU drop holdalls - 
  open them up - explosives inside --- 
 
  EXT CLOSE ON: ZOE. Oh shit! 
 
  SAM picks out SONAY, drags him away from ZOE - 
 
  ZOE can only watch. Observe the scene. Take it on board. 
  Ignore the fear and panic that has gripped her fellow 
  diners and is trying to grip her. 
 
 
  DANNY closes the box - it s done. He sees HARRY still 
  busy behind his desk -- time to leave -- he strides up 
  towards pods, as HARRY exits his office. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                We just got a flash message from Zoe s 
                                      mobile. 
 
  DANNY quickly turns on his heels. 
 
 
  SAM and his men violently divide up room. Men one side, 
  women the other -- VICTOR rains down blows on SONAY -- 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                        Leyla! What are they doing? 
 
                                        SONAY 
                                      Aghhh!!! 
 
                                        SAM 
                              Hands on heads --

  LEYLA is not in control -- and her men know it -- 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                I will do this. 
                                    (to LEYLA) 
                                        Leyla! 
                                  (back to SAM) 
                  This is not your fight, this is... 
 
                                        SAM 
            Til  we re out of here, stay out of my way. 
                                Is that clear? 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                    (Broken English, loud and proud) 
                                    OKAY OKAY! 
 
  LEYLA steps into the centre of the room. 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                              (shouts in English) 
                We are soldiers of the Kurdish Freedom 
                  Fighters. If just one person tries to 
                sabotage our actions, we will all die. 
 
  Every Turk in the room suddenly becomes passive. This 
  takes SAM and VICTOR by complete surprise. 
 
  LEYLA has the controls. 
 
 
  HARRY and DANNY transfixed by computer screen. An 
    annoyingly masked image being sent by a camera in ZOE s 
  mobile phone - from SONAY s pocket. 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                                      (Muffled) 
            Do as we say and you will come to no harm... 
 
  HARRY s phone and the Grid come alive with technological 
  activity. DANNY visibly concerned. HARRY assesses his 
  options. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Get Tom and Tessa in here. In twenty minutes 
            COBRA will be looking to us for answers, and 
            having to publicly explain to the cabinet why 
                    we re in there might be a little 
                                    embarrassing.

                                        DANNY 
                                What about Zoe? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We ll tell the Turkish we got a tip off from 
            an unreliable source, but thought it best to 
                put an officer in there just in case. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              If the terrorists get her, she ll be the 
                              first person they... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      I know. 
                                        (BEAT) 
            All the more reason to get you and Tom down 
              there. Scotland yard and the SAS will want 
              that building wired for sound. You already 
                          know the rough lay out. 
 
  DANNY goes to leave, dissatisfied. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              Danny? Of all the people in that room, Zoe 
                    will know how to handle herself. 
 
  DANNY rushes off. 
 
 
  DANNY in front of computer screen. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  This is coming in from Zoe s phone. 
 
  DANNY flicks a switch on his phone - 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                          My name is Leyla Bakuri.

  LEYLA is head of this class! 
 
  In the background, SELAMET and EBRU take a corner of 
  cloth each then run towards wall and up ladders without 
  stopping and with Cirque du Soleil-style acrobatics -- 
  Black cloth rolls out and rises up wall - SAKAR pulls out 
  staple guns and throws one each to SELAMET and EBRU! 
 
  CLOSE ON: ZOE clocking the stunning action!! 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            Today the people of the world will not close 
                it s eyes to the genocide of my people. 
 
  Pan around Turkish faces - 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                No longer will we suffer in silence or 
                tolerate oppression and we will not be 
              humiliated, and we will, we will fight for 
            the future of our children! We however are 
          not animals and wish you no harm. But we will 
          not hesitate to kill anyone who tries to stop 
                                        us.

            The police negotiator s only concern will be 
          how they can secure the safe release of every 
            hostage in that building, including Zoe. But 
            they need to understand who they are dealing

              The Kurdish were promised an independent 
            state by the Allies at the end of the First 
                World War. In 1923, the British Foreign 
              Secretary - and major shareholder of an oil 
            company - discovered the amount of oil in the 
                    area, and the treaty was suddenly 
              renegotiated. The Kurdish lost out to Iran, 
              Iraq and Turkey. Now they find themselves 
                  unwanted guests of these countries. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Yes, yes, but that s all in the past. The 
            point is that the Turks are as patriotic as 
              the British - even more so. They are not 
            about to give back their lands as easily as 
                      the Kurdish feel they should.

            Why would you be interested in Johnny Marks, 
                    in the middle of a bloody siege? 
 
  TESSA. Caught Red handed. But still cool as a cucumber. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          He was our man in Iran. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Is that right? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                  He worked in the middle east for us, 
                            recruiting clean skins. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            The only person Johnny Marks worked for was 
            himself. He procured information and sold it                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 34
 

            to the highest bidder. Anyway how does this 
                  help us, he died fifteen years ago. 
 
  TESSA hands HARRY the screen grab from the CCTV. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                He became sympathetic with the Kurdish 
              people, grew close with a Kurdish mountain 
            tribe. They probably helped him move through 
                the mountains from country to country. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Johnny Marks betrayed the entire British 
              intelligence community and most of the Arab 
              states. When he was done with them he tried 
                  dealing with the Irish, big mistake.

                                        TESSA 
                  The man in that car is Johnny Marks.

                                    (Leans in) 
              I identified his remains. What little was 
                                  left of him. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              It s him. I know it s him. At the Embassy. 
                                Today. He s back.

  Fuck! He grabs the photo and strides off. 
 
  TESSA watches with some relish.

            You should. It s very beautiful. You would 
              love it. I believe that one day we will be 
            able to share that land with the Kurdish if 
            our nations can put aside our differences. 
 
  CHALAK nudges SELIN in her back with gun butt.

                Great. The Government want a worst case 
                scenario. So if this goes down, they can 
              shove the blame on poor intelligence and 
                              halve our budget.

  Some of the hostages are crying. One of them, PC STEVE is 
  about to to be shot. SAKAR takes STEVE s arm and brings 
  him out to the middle of the room - SAKAR does not want 
  to shoot him. 
 
  LEYLA. Waits. Silence. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            I will kill this man, please don t let this 
                                      happen...

  CLOSE ON: PC STEVE, terror breaking through his brave 
  face. 
 
  LEYLA throws tablecloth over STEVE s head - SAKAR pushes 
  STEVE s head onto floor. 
 
  LEYLA places gun barrel against back of his head - 
 
  ZOE closes her eyes - silence fills the room - 
 
  -BEAT- 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    It s mine! 
 
  All eyes on ZOE as we... 
 
  PC STEVE starts breathing again - SAKAR removes cloth off 
  his head, to reveal STEVE s terrified face. ZOE turns to 
  face LEYLA... 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                    Thank you. 
 
  CLOSE ON: LEYLA holds up each item carefully from ZOE s 
  handbag. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              My sister s kids. Playing with my handbag 
                                        again. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
              Why did you not come forward when I asked 
                                        you? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                Because you are holding a machine gun. 
 
  LEYLA has lock picking wallet in her hand. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                What would a housewife want with these? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            A present for my husband. Thought they would 
                                      be fun. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                  (All smiles) 
              Fun for your husband? OK, let s have some                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 43
 

                                        fun. 
 
  Nods to CHALAK, who pulls SONAY away from the wall. 
 
                                        SONAY 
            No. Please, I just want to be left alone... 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            Your wife tells us she bought these for you, 
                                      for fun. 
 
  SONAY is sobbing. Again. 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
              Your wife? Useful if you get locked out of 
                  your house? Who does she work for? 
 
  SONAY shaking from fear. 
 
                                        SONAY 
              Please, I m just a travel agent, I don t 
                know, you know, I don t know about all 
                                      this... 
 
                                        LEYLA 
              You re lying! Your wife is a spy for the 
                              British Government. 
 
                                        SONAY 
                                  She s not... 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                She s not what? 
 
                                        SONAY 
            She s not my wife. I ve only known her for a 
                                    few weeks. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                  Not your wife? 
 
                                        SONAY 
              I only just met her. OK. I just needed to 
                  make it look like I was married. For 
                business, OK. I don t care for her and I 
                don t know her. She is nothing to me. 
 
  CHALAK takes SONAY back to the wall. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 44
 

  LEYLA takes out her mobile and dials a number - her eyes 
  never leaving ZOE... 
 
 
  JOHNNY s mobile: Ringing. He looks at the number, then 
  chooses to ignore it. Carries on working on his laptop. 
 
    1443(CONTINUOUS) 
 
  Pitch black - all we hear is sobbing as we... 
 
 
  Haunted HARRY. Stressed, still looking at the map. 
  Cornered. Unfamiliar territory. Makes the call he s been 
  dreading. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Sir, I need permission to make contact with 
                                        RW. 
                                  (This is bad) 
                      Yes, of the upmost importance 
                                    (Very bad) 
            To avoid the worst case scenario, yes Sir. 
 
  HARRY hangs up, then dials another number. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                  Roger? The line is secure, are you? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                        Roger? 
 
 
  TESSA. HARRY (the judge) behind his desk, ready to pass 
  sentence. The surveillance photos are on his desk. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      What else didn t you tell us? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  I was in love. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    And you think I didn t know that? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 45
 

                                        TESSA 
            Well clearly it didn t matter then, did it? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            No. But it does now. Did Johnny ever ask how 
                                  he was paid? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            What? Why? How he was paid? No! I don t, it 
                  was fifteen years ago. No. I mean... 
 
  TESSA remembers the conversation. 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT D) 
                                      Oh shit. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Jesus, Tessa? We re talking about Johnny 
              Marks for Christ s sake. He worked it all 
            out. He knew the British Government wouldn t 
            pay him direct. He also knew if he found the 
            bank we used as a cover to pay agents, that 
              information alone would be worth a fortune. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              Yes, but nobody knows what bank we use, no 
                                        one. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            I do. You ran Johnny Marks and you worked for 
              me. Follows you. You lead him on to me. I 
            lead him to an obscure private bank we were 
                                    setting up. 
 
  Tessa. Used, abused and hurt. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
            He s found the bank we use, and the only man 
                who has access to those accounts, he s 
                            kidnapped his daughter. 
 
  CLOSE ON: TESSA. Oh my god! 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
            So you can see the problem this country now 
                faces! Either way it s going to cost a 
              fortune or the lives of some of the most 
                      important informants we have.

  JOHNNY MARKS is watching the siege on the TV, with the 
  sound turned down. He smiles to himself. In the 
  background, TARA weeps quietly... 
 
 
  One of DANNY s men is up a ladder and he has audio. He 
  clicks his fingers at DANNY, and passes him earphones - 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                Emily Arlington? Who do you work for? 
 
  CLOSE ON: DANNY. He watches an indecipherable thermal 
  image. 
 
 
  TOM on phone - two officers enter - call them NICK and 
  MIKE!! Approach TOM, whisper in his ear. 
 
  IN BG: over speaker - van is listening to... 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
            My country and it s people are torn apart. 
 
  TOM is lead out of the truck, much to COLIN s surprise as

                                        LEYLA 
              Our people. Raped. Murdered. Our children 
            denied their heritage. We have nothing, but 
              we do have everything to fight for. This, 
            you, the Turkish, call it terrorism. I call 
                  it war and it s one worth dying for. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                This is not going to help your cause. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
          What are you talking about? The world s media 
          is out there right now, discussing our cause. 
              Your people are listening. We have already 
                            won a great victory. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                Why? Because you re holding guns to our 
                                        heads.

  LEYLA raises her gun and points it at ZOE. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                Would you be listening if we were not? 
 
  LEYLA moves in close to ZOE. 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                As you can see, we have not hidden our 
                identity. We have no way out. Nothing to 
            lose. You can help these people get out of 
                    here alive. Who do you work for? 
 
  All eyes on ZOE. Total silence fills the room - 
 
 
  MALCOLM and COLIN in van waiting, as are... 
 
 
  DANNY and his team... 
 
    1456(CONTINUOUS) 
 
  LEYLA. Waiting.

              I work for Her Majesty s Secret services. 
 
  En route, two or more officers standing guard - TOM taken 
  aback by the amount of security, but knows better than to 
  ask.

  LEYLA and ZOE.

              Swift codes are keys that unlock the bank

  SAM starts up banks of computers. 
 
                            ROGER (V.O.) (CONT D) 
              If someone obtained these codes and knew 
              where the main computer was, he could not 
                  only transfer millions of pounds -

              Bit too late for that. I see the SAS have 
            just joined the party. Get Danny back here,

  TOM sits down - in his own world - what the fuck does he 
  do? 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
              We are the Kurdish Freedom Fighters. We 
            demand the immediate release of Pejan Bakuri, 
              Zana Bakuri, Niyal Okcus and Shivan Izmir. 
 
                          POLICE NEGOTIATOR (V.O.) 
          Our primary concern is with the safety of the 
                                      hostages. 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
            Prisoners, not hostages, that would imply we 
          are terrorists. You have one hour to meet our 
                                      demands. 
 
  TOM grabs radio - 
 
 
  DANNY and his team sitting in silence listening to LEYLA. 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
            From this moment on, we will only negotiate 
              with the person responsible for the young 
                  intelligence officer I have here in my 
              possession. Not the Police. Do not call me 
              back and tell me he is on holiday. Is that 
                                        clear?

                Many Turks are on your side. Even the

            No, not just PR. This is only going to give 
                  more ammunition to your opponents.

                I believe I have something you want? The 
              Turkish Government definitely has something 
          we want. So, the Turkish government will free 
              the Kurdish prisoners in exchange for the 
                          lives of our prisoners.

  CHALAK, who has hold of the string, is looking through 
  curtain. 
 
                                        SELIN 
            Please help him. He is asthmatic! Please, he 
                              needs an inhaler.

                                  Shut up woman! 
 
  LEYLA shoots a withering look at CHALAK. 
 
                                    TOM (V.O.) 
            If anything happens to him, the Turkish will 
                give us nothing. Let us bring over the 
            medication he needs. No one needs to come in, 
            you just have to take it and give it to him. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            You will bring the medication, no one else.

  CHALAK pulls ZOE away from wall and over to LEYLA, who

                                        LEYLA 
            The lives of the people in this room rest on 
              you. If you try anything, Ambassador Cozar

            Pejan Bakuri, Zana Bakuri, Niyal Okcus and

  LEYLA. Stunned. 
 
  SAKAR lets go of the cord at seeing the prisoners walk 
  out prison gates - LEYLA hasn't noticed, but SAS men on 
  the next balcony have... 
 
 
  SAS run along the balcony, de-fuse OZAN, and storm into 
  the dining room through the windows. 
 
  LEYLA is stunned. As the SAS enter, she looks around to 
  her comrades, holds up her hands and closes her eyes. 
 
 
  VICTOR and LEVI lie wounded, with guns trained on them. 
  DANNY Stands over SAM, who is cuffed and lying face down.

  Moving in for the kill. 
 
                                        TESSA 
          How much will you get? How much are all those

                              give a shit do you.

                            dreams, the ambition? 
 
  He's a breath away. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              You know they'll hunt you down for this. 
 
 
  We re back in TOM s street. Only now there are no lights 
  on in TOM s house. 
  DANNY and ZOE sitting in front seats. Both totally spent. 
 
  ZOE checks ragged image in the mirror.. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                  Definitely more me. Wouldn't you say? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            I thought you looked stunning in that dress. 
 
  ZOE. Wow. 
 
  TOM, from the backseat, watches the warm light from his 
  house shining out. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        What you going to tell her? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I don t know, but I wish I hadn t turned down 
            the painkiller. It might have taken the edge 
                      off of telling her the truth.

  TOM exits car. DANNY looks over at ZOE. Her hair s a 
  mess. TOM s blood on her dress and she still looks 
  stunning. 
 
  ZOE manages a smile as TOM limps off towards his house. 
 
 
  JOHNNY and TESSA. Almost nose to nose. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
            You deserve so much more than this. You were 
                                    hungry. Why? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            You have the money, don't sell the names as

  TESSA searching JOHNNY's eyes. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              You really want to know? I was pregnant. 
 
  First time JOHNNY has looked surprised all night. He 
  checked the room, the photos, there were definitely no 
  kids. 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT'D) 
                  Found out -- a few weeks after they 
            discovered your body. I let it grow in me -- 
                and-- I've never felt so whole since. 
                              (Lets it sit on him) 
                          I had your life, in me. 
 
  JOHNNY is dumbstruck. More information than he can 
  handle. 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT'D) 
            After just five months, like you, she left 
                                        me.

              A girl. That's twice you broke my heart. 
 
  Tears build in TESSA's eyes. JOHNNY moves in to hold her. 
  TESSA fighting back the tears. A gentle hand greets 
  TESSA's tear. 
 
  PHONE RINGS - TESSA answers it -

                          Did you give her a name?

  JOHNNY makes his way out - 
 
  TESSA Stands at window... 
 
 
  TESSA at window. 
 
  JOHNNY and HARRY face to face in street below... 
 
  TESSA looks down and sees a floppy disk in the centre of 
  the coffee table, picks it up - looks back to see if he 
  has gone... 
 
  JOHNNY MARKS has gone... 
 
 
    Painfully, TOM takes a seat - pours himself a glass of 
  wine - Then becomes aware there is someone in the room. 
 
  Maisie is half asleep. She walks over to the dining room 
  table and scoops up present and card then waddles over to 
  Tom and places the card and present on his lap. She sits 
  by his side, snuggling into him. Instantly she is asleep. 
  Gently he strokes her head. 
 
  Ellie is in the doorway - watching - 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              You fixed it then.

              My mother always said, everything looks
