CLOSE ON the stoic face of a NATIVE AMERICAN, basking in the 
glow of a full moon.  

PULL OUT to reveal the carved figure of a DAKOTA INDIAN 
standing as sentry on the rooftop of an Upper West Side 
apartment.  But not just any apartment.  One of the most 
prestigious-- and infamous-- co-ops in all of New York...

THE DAKOTA.  

As the carved figure keeps a watchful eye high above the 72nd 
Street entrance, everything seems calm and quiet.  Until...

A THUMPING IS HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.  

THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS ACROSS the building's high gables, 
tracking the noise.  

IT PICKS UP SPEED as it climbs over the sloping roofs 
checkered with dormers.  The THUMPING GETS LOUDER as...

THE CAMERA LAUNCHES over the side of the building, onto a 
terrace, and into...


As Bridget and Malcolm exit, they re met by FBI AGENT VICTOR 
MACHADO, muscular and manicured, guarding the door.   

AGENT MACHADO
Ready to go?

BRIDGET
Just give us a minute.

As Bridget and Malcolm head to the parking lot, Machado 
trails them.  Bridget tugs on Malcolm s suit coat.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You re gonna melt.

MALCOLM
I have class tonight.  They re 
turning in their papers on the 
Mexican American War.4.


BRIDGET
Sounds riveting.

MALCOLM
(gesturing with his hands)
Believe it or not, I find grading 
papers therapeutic.

BRIDGET
Bullshit.

Off Malcolm s look:

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You talk with your hands when you 
lie.

Busted, Malcolm shoves his hands in his pockets.   

MALCOLM
(smiling)
You re right.  I hate grading 
papers.

As they approach a Buick LaCrosse, Agent Machado slips into 
the driver s seat. 

MALCOLM (CONT D)
Are you sure you don t want me 
there tomorrow?

BRIDGET
(nodding)
I ll call when it s over. 

Malcolm hugs Bridget, holding on a little too tightly.  As 
she pulls away, she snatches the cookie back.


Agent Machado escorts Bridget to her room at the back of the 
motel.  JIMMY, a local cop, stands outside the door, smoking. 

BRIDGET
Hey Jimmy.
(handing him a napkin)
Brought you a cookie.

JIMMY
Thanks, hon.

AGENT MACHADO
I ll pick you up at seven-thirty 
sharp.  If you need anything til 
then--

BRIDGET
(cutting him off)
Jimmy will protect me.

AGENT MACHADO
Get a good night s rest.  

As Agent Machado leaves:

BRIDGET
Guy s got a rod up his ass.6.


JIMMY
(smiling)
He d like that.


Agent Machado clips his nails, as he waits for Bridget 
outside the motel.  He glances at the clock on the dashboard, 
as it switches to  7:31 A.M. 

Annoyed, Machado pockets the clipper and exits his vehicle.  
As he walks to the back of the motel, a look of concern 
washes over his face.  REVERSE ANGLE to see...

BRIDGET S ROOM, UNGUARDED.  7.


Machado draws his gun and stealthily approaches the motel 
room.  He turns the knob.  It s locked.  So he takes a step 
back and...  


...to the bus station across the street.  As the Hampton 
Jitney pulls up, she picks up her pace.  She frantically 
waves, trying to get its attention.  But her waves go 
unnoticed.  The jitney slowly pulls away to reveal...

THE REAL BRIDGET, dishevelled in jeans and a T-shirt, duffle 
in hand.  We then realize that the chic woman isn t Bridget 
after all but...

SIOBHAN (pronounced Shavonne) MARX, her twin sister.  Aside 
from Bridget s hair being longer, they re nearly identical.

SIOBHAN
(disappointed)
I wanted to pay your fare!

As Siobhan rushes over to Bridget, they embrace.  Like they 
haven t seen each other in years.  

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
It s so good to see you!  

BRIDGET
It s good to see you, too.

SIOBHAN
(re: duffle)
Is that all you brought?

BRIDGET
I m traveling light these days.  

As the sisters finally pull apart, Siobhan takes in Bridget. 

SIOBHAN
I was wondering how you d look 
after six years.

BRIDGET
Not nearly as good as you.

SIOBHAN
Not true.  
(smiling)
It s still like looking in a 
mirror.9.



Bridget watches the massive Marx estate shrink in the 
distance, as Siobhan guns her speed boat away from the dock. 


As Siobhan helms the boat, smoking a cigarette, Bridget soaks 
up the sun.

BRIDGET
I thought you quit?

SIOBHAN
No.  That was you.
(re: helm)
Wanna give it a go?

BRIDGET
Oh god.  I haven t driven a boat 
since we were sixteen.  

SIOBHAN
It s like riding a bike.

BRIDGET
This is hardly Lake Tahoe. 

Bridget begrudgingly takes the wheel from Siobhan.  Within a 
minute, she s effortlessly steering the boat.  

SIOBHAN
See?  I told you it d come back.

Bridget smiles, bolstered.  As Siobhan opens a can of soda:    

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
So are you still, um... 
(delicately)
...stripping?

BRIDGET
No.  But I still work for tips.  
Just as a waitress.  And let me 
tell you, the money isn t nearly as 
good.  

Siobhan laughs.15.


BRIDGET (CONT D)
When I got sober, all bad habits 
went out the window. 
(smiling sadly)
I don t want to be the sister you 
have to pretend doesn t exist.

Siobhan takes Bridget s hand.

SIOBHAN
You re not.  And we re the only 
family we have left.
(sincere)
I love you.   

Bridget is visibly moved.  She thought she d never hear 
Siobhan say those three little words again.


The speed boat gently bobs in the waves, anchored in the open 
water.  Post lunch, Siobhan and Bridget sit on the stern, 
amid a pile of takeout containers.

SIOBHAN 
Wanna go for a swim?

BRIDGET
Yeah right.  I ll puke.

SIOBHAN
Well I m gonna take a dip.  It s 
getting hot. 

Siobhan ties her hair back with her Hermes scarf.

BRIDGET
I ll work on my tan.  
(raising a pasty arm)
Can t snag a Hamptons  millionaire 
gaunt and pale.

Siobhan laughs and dives into the ocean.  Bridget lays back 
and places a straw hat over her face.  TRACK UP to the sun 
beating down overhead, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:


The sun is now dimmer and closer to the horizon.  A BEET RED 
Bridget sleeps under her straw hat.  She stirs, then slowly 
awakens. 16.


BRIDGET
(groggy)
How long was I out for?

As Bridget removes the hat, she notices her sunburn.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Siobhan?

No response.  Bridget looks across the deck but doesn t see 
her sister.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Shiv?

Still no response.  As Bridget gets up, she scans the boat.  
Nothing.  Then the water.  Siobhan s nowhere in sight.  
Until...

A SPECK OF RED is seen floating in the distance.  Thinking 
that Siobhan may have drifted in the current, Bridget picks 
up a pair of binoculars.  Her face falls when, through the 
BINOCULAR S POV, we reveal...

SIOBHAN S HERMES SCARF UNDULATING IN THE WAVES.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(panicked)
Oh god!

Bridget rips up the anchor and starts the engine.  As she 
races in the direction of the scarf, she picks up her cell 
phone.  Mid-dial, she realizes she has no reception. 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Shit!

She tosses the phone aside and continues on course.  As soon 
as she s within swimming distance, she stops the engine and 
drops the anchor.  Without a moment s hesitation, she dives 
into the water.  She frantically swims over to the scarf, 
takes a deep breath, and goes under.  

Bubbles swarm about her as she thrashes her way through the 
murky Atlantic, trying to see something.  Anything.  But it s 
no use.  Bridget comes up for air.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(gasping)
Siobhan!17.


It s eerily quiet, save for a SEAGULL overhead.  Bridget 
takes another deep breath and goes back under, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:


When Bridget resurfaces, the sun is nearly set.  Completely 
exhausted, she s barely able to drag herself back into the 
boat.  As she stares at Siobhan s Hermes scarf, the grim 
reality of the situation sets in.  Bridget buries her face in 
her hands and starts to sob uncontrollably, as we...  

CUT TO:


A puffy-eyed Bridget docks behind the Marx estate.  As she 
exits the boat, Hermes scarf in hand, her cell phone reads 
 ENTERING SERVICE AREA.   As she starts to dial: 

NINA (O.C.)
There you are!

Bridget turns to see NINA FORTMAN, Siobhan s neighbor, 
holding a glass of wine.

NINA (CONT D)
I thought you were coming by at 
six?  I got shrimp from Claws on 
Wheels!

BRIDGET
I m sorry, but I m not--

NINA
(cutting her off)
Don t bother with excuses, sweetie.  
I already drank an entire bottle of 
Pinot waiting for you, so I m not 
upset.  We ll do it another night.  
 Kay?

Bridget forces a smile.

NINA (CONT D)
You alright?  You look a little 
puffy?  

Before Bridget can answer:

NINA (CONT D)
Did you get derma-filler?   18.


Bridget ignores her and heads inside the house.

NINA (CONT D)
Don t be offended, sweetie.  
Everyone does it.

Nina gulps the last of her wine, as we...

CUT TO:


As Malcolm and Machado walk across campus:

AGENT MACHADO
So what was your relationship like? 

Malcolm tenses, uncomfortable.

MALCOLM
That s one of the problems with 
being a sponsor.  You get close.  

AGENT MACHADO
How close?

MALCOLM
(reluctant)
Too close.  And I instantly 
regretted it.

Off Machado s look:

MALCOLM (CONT D)
I don t mean like that.  I mean it 
was a conflict of interest.  
Bridget s sobriety was the most 
important thing.  And I didn t want 
to jeopardize it.  
(shrugging)
(MORE)22.

MALCOLM (CONT D)
You know how it is when feelings 
are involved.  People can sometimes 
make bad choices.

AGENT MACHADO
Do you love her?

MALCOLM
Why are you asking?

AGENT MACHADO
Because I find it hard to believe 
that Ms. Cafferty would disappear 
without contacting you.

MALCOLM
(talking with his hands)
Well she hasn t.  And I m really 
worried about her.

Machado zeros in on Malcolm s hands... but doesn t call his 
bluff. 

AGENT MACHADO
You should be.  Without her 
testimony...  

Machado hands over a copy of the Rock Springs Rocket-Miner.  
The headline reads:  MACAWI CASE DECLARED MISTRIAL. 

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
...Bodaway s a free man.


Bridget exits the bus station a new woman.  She walks towards 
the Hampton Jitney but doesn t get on.  Instead, she walks 
around the bus to...

A PARKED LINCOLN TOWNCAR.  Looks like public transportation 
is a thing of the past.  A DRIVER opens the door for Bridget, 
as we...  

CUT TO:


Bridget steps onto the sixth floor balcony.  As she lights up 
a cigarette, she fights back a cough.  As she pretends to 
take a drag, she notices...

A MAN, standing on the street below, staring up at her.  The 
light from the lamp post casts a shadow across his face.  27.


Bridget turns away.  She takes another  puff,  trying to 
convince herself that he wasn t staring at her.  When she 
turns back, the man steps out of the shadow and it s 
unmistakable.  

HE S STARING DIRECTLY AT HER.  

An unnerved Bridget extinguishes her cigarette and heads back 
inside, as we...

CUT TO:


A fully clothed Bridget bolts up in bed, as the TELEPHONE 
RINGS.  She glances at the alarm clock.  It reads  8:30.   
Then at Andrew s empty side of the bed.  She groggily picks 
up the phone.

BRIDGET
(into phone)
Hello?

GEMMA (V.O.)
(from phone, British 
accent)
What are you doing home?!

BRIDGET
Um... sleeping.

GEMMA (V.O.)
(chiding)
Darling!  You were supposed to meet 
me at the apartment half an hour 
ago!  

BRIDGET
I was?28.


GEMMA (V.O.)
Don t tell me you didn t know.  I 
saw you write it in your book.

Bridget spots Siobhan s leather bound day planner on the 
desk.  She flips through it until she lands on today s date:  
 GEMMA.  8:00.  THE DAKOTA.  

GEMMA (V.O.) (CONT D)
Hello?  Did you fall back asleep?

BRIDGET
No, Gemma.  I ll be there.  Just 
give me twenty minutes.  

GEMMA (V.O.)
Make it thirty.  Now you owe me a 
latte from Zabar s.


Gemma leads Bridget out onto a terrace with a prime view of 
the city.  

BRIDGET
Pretty.

GEMMA
You don t seem that enthused.  
What s wrong?  I thought you lived 
for this stuff!

BRIDGET
I do.  I m just tired.  Andrew got 
back last night.

GEMMA
Uck!  You re skinny and you re 
having sex?

BRIDGET
We didn t--

GEMMA
(cutting her off)
The last time I saw my husband 
naked was right before the twins 
turned three... last year.

Gemma stares off, preoccupied.

GEMMA (CONT D)
I think Henry s having an affair.  

Bridget seems genuinely shocked, despite not knowing Gemma.  30.


GEMMA (CONT D)
(teary-eyed)
I can t stand to look at him, let 
alone sleep next to him.  I wish I 
could tag along with you and Andrew 
to Don Giovanni.  

BRIDGET
Don Giovanni?

GEMMA
Very funny.  I know I promised I 
wouldn t give you a guilt trip 
about not getting extra tickets.  
It is opening night.

BRIDGET
I can cancel.

GEMMA
(sniffling)
I ll be fine.  I ll just slag it up 
with one of the workmen.  I m sure  
contractors make more money than 
out of work novelists.

BRIDGET
I d go for the one with the man 
boobs.  Very sexy.

Gemma laughs through her tears.  PRE-LAP AN ARIA, as we...

CUT TO:


Bridget, in Siobhan s tennis whites, volleys with Andrew.  As 
her ball hits the net:

ANDREW
You re playing like my mother.

Bridget fetches the ball and makes another attempt... only to 
hit it off the court.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Jesus, Siobhan!

BRIDGET
(frustrated)
I m sorry.  I haven t played in 
awhile.

ANDREW
(annoyed)
Well you re acting like you ve 
never played.  Do you just want to 
call it quits?  I have to get back 
to the office anyway.

Bridget twirls her racquet and smiles flirtatiously.35.


BRIDGET
Why don t you come over here and 
give me a refresher course?

ANDREW
Are you kidding?

BRIDGET
C mon.  You ve got a killer serve.   

Andrew crosses the net to Bridget.  He steps behind her and 
gently pulls her right arm back.

ANDREW
Racquet up and turn to the side.  
Show your opponent that left 
shoulder.

BRIDGET
(teasing)
But you re behind me.

ANDREW
Do you want to be cute?  Or do you 
want to keep playing like shit?

Bridget obediently lifts her racquet.  

BRIDGET
Yes, sir.

ANDREW
And you re tossing the ball higher 
than you can reach.  

Bridget tosses the ball and swings.  It shoots right into the 
net.  Andrew walks around to face her and gently tilts up her 
chin.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Stop looking down.  If you look up, 
it won t hit the net.

Bridget stares right into his eyes.

ANDREW (CONT D)
What?

BRIDGET
Nothing.  It s just that... you re 
sexy.

Andrew laughs, loosening up.36.


ANDREW
You re just trying to distract me 
from the fact that I spent all that 
money on lessons and you can t even 
volley.

BRIDGET
(coyly)
Maybe. 

ANDREW
What s gotten into you lately?  

BRIDGET
What do you mean?

ANDREW
I don t know.  You re so... 
relaxed.  Agreeable.

BRIDGET
And you don t like it?

ANDREW
No.

Andrew stares at her.  A beat, then:

ANDREW (CONT D)
I love it.  Now let s go one more 
set.


A visibly shaken Bridget walks down the street.  As she 
reaches the entrance of The Dakota, she looks at the IMPOSING 
STATUE OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN staring down at her. 


As Bridget and Andrew exit their Towncar, Bridget notices...

HENRY, STANDING ACROSS THE STREET.

BRIDGET
Damn it!

ANDREW
What?

BRIDGET
(covering)
I meant to have the driver stop at 
Tasti D Lite.

ANDREW
Are they still open?

BRIDGET
Til midnight.  Trust me, a pregnant 
woman knows these things.

ANDREW
(laughing)
I ll run down the block.

BRIDGET
No.  I will.  Pregnant women also 
know how to cut to the front of the 
line.

Andrew smiles and enters the building.  Bridget crosses the 
street and stalks over to Henry.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You don t get it, do you?

HENRY
(obviously drunk)
Oh I got it.  A whole earful at 
dinner.51.


BRIDGET
I m sorry.  I didn t want it to 
come out that way.

HENRY
You know that s my baby.

BRIDGET
No I don t.

HENRY
Oh come on, Siobhan!  We ve fucked 
a thousand times!  And you ve 
thrown Andrew a bone, what, once?  
Twice, in the past few months?

BRIDGET
It only takes one time.

HENRY
That s my kid!  And I m not just 
going to sit across from you at 
dinner and pretend I m happy for 
Andrew.

BRIDGET
Well what do you want me to do?

HENRY
Leave him.

BRIDGET
And live off what?  Andrew supports 
me and Gemma supports you.

HENRY
Not for long.  I m going to finish 
this draft and then things will be 
different.

Bridget doesn t look too convinced.

HENRY (CONT D)
If you don t leave him, we re over.

BRIDGET
Excuse me?

HENRY
Make a choice.  It s him or me.

BRIDGET
You want an answer like that now?52.


HENRY
Yes.

Bridget takes a deep breath.

BRIDGET
Then I choose Andrew.

As Bridget walks away, we PUSH IN on a seething Henry.


CLOSE ON A LEATHERY HAND, with an onyx pinky ring, KNOCKING 
on an apartment door.  

As Malcolm cracks open the door, we PULL OUT to reveal... 

BODAWAY MACAWI, STANDING ON HIS DOORSTEP.

BODAWAY
Where is she?

Malcolm and Bodaway lock eyes, as we...


END ACT FIVE54.


ACT SIX


Machado exits a cab and approaches the Delta terminal.  As he 
hands his ticket to a SKYCAP ATTENDANT, his cell phone rings.

AGENT MACHADO
(into cell)
This is Machado.  

FBI AGENT (V.O.)
(from cell)
Don t go anywhere just yet, Vic.  
Something came up.   


Bridget steps out on the terrace to find a tear-stained 
Gemma.  

BRIDGET
Talk to me.

GEMMA
You were wrong.  The nanny s a 
dyke.  I asked her about Henry and 
she hit on me.  Not that it 
matters.  I know who it is.

Gemma looks at a nervous Bridget.  A tense beat, then:  

GEMMA (CONT D)
The bastard s fucking the twins  
preschool teacher!58.


BRIDGET
(relieved)
Come on.

GEMMA
I caught him flirting with her this 
morning.  He swears it was nothing, 
but as we know, he s full of shit.  

As Gemma begins to tear up again:

BRIDGET
You re going to get through this. 

GEMMA
(sniffling)     
I know, darling.  With the help of 
friends like you.

A guilty Bridget hugs Gemma, as we...

CUT TO:


Bridget steps back onto the terrace and grabs Siobhan s 
purse.  As she heads back inside...


CLOSE ON a graffitied pay phone, as it RINGS.  A WOMAN S HAND 
enters into frame, answering it.

WOMAN (O.C.)
(into phone)
Hello?

MAN (V.O.)
(from phone)
We have a problem.   

PULL OUT to reveal the identity of the woman talking on the 
pay phone.  Blood red lips, oversized sunglasses, and a 
Hermes scarf make it unmistakably...

SIOBHAN MARX, who s very much alive.  She purses her lips and 
lights a cigarette, as we...
