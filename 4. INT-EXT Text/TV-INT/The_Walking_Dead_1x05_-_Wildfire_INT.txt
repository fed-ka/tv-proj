      Jenner exits the prep room and stalks up the hall, REVVING 
      HIS CHAINSAW... 

      Other than the breather helmet, he's wearing only boxer 
      shorts, tatty robe, and cowboy boots...

      The song is flooding the facility with Karen Carpenter's pure 
      voice and those soaring violin overdubs...


      Designed with the idea that staff might be forced to occupy 
      this facility long-term: there's a bar, arcade games, ping-
      pong table, small karaoke stage, baby grand piano.

      Jenner enters the open doorway, shouts over the chainsaw 
      noise at the seemingly empty room:

                                  JENNER
                    YOU DON'T GET TO MOCK ME ANYMORE! 
                    NO MORE HIDING IN HERE ALL DAY 
                    WHILE I DO ALL THE DAMN WORK!   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 3.


      He turns, rams the chainsaw laterally through the doorjamb, 
      spewing splinters and drywall dust into the air...

      OUTSIDE THE ROOM (JENNER UNSEEN)

      The Carpenters' tune plays on, lovely and sweet, as:

      The CHAINSAW RIPS THE WALL TO SHREDS from the other side, 
      kicking so much drywall dust that it's hard to see.

      Horizontal swaths of wall get carved away from the doorframe 
      outward, destroying the wall in both directions, forming a 
      strange (though somewhat familiar) shape...

      The chainsaw dies. Silence now. Dust swirling. We hear grunts 
      of effort, the squeal of small wheels on flooring... 

      Now that the doorway has been raggedly reconfigured to 
      accommodate its removal from the room: 

      THE PIANO rolls out with its bench perched on top. Jenner 
      appears, pushing for all he's worth, guiding it...

      As he clears the swirling dust, he rips the breather helmet 
      from his face. The Carpenters MUSIC PLAYS ON, as:

      VARIOUS ANGLES 

      Jenner pushes the piano through the facility, past inactive 
      bio-hazard checkpoints, heaving and straining, maneuvering it 
      toward:


      The nerve center, computer stations arrayed around an open 
      central area, lighting dim to conserve energy. It has a 
      Mission Control vibe, but one designed by I.M. Pei. HUGE WALL-
      SIZED DISPLAY SCREENS face the room, dark.

      Jenner appears on a raised platform at the back of the room, 
      pushing the piano in, looking ready for a heart attack.

      A ramp leads from the platform down to the main area. Jenner 
      sets his feet, maneuvers the piano onto the ramp. 

      He tries to control it, but of course it gets away from him, 
      sails down the ramp, and: 

      Across the nerve center the piano goes, SMACKING into some 
      hardware with a CRASH! Jenner cringes.

                                  JENNER
                    My bad!   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 4.


      He hurries down the ramp, checks to make sure the hardware 
      damage isn't too bad (there's a big dent), then shifts the 
      piano to face the huge main screen. 

      The CARPENTERS SONG ENDS, echoing off to silence, as:

      Jenner sets the bench and sits down at the piano.

                                  JENNER (CONT D)
                    We were reviewing the mutability 
                    coding at the core protein level.

                                  VOX
                    Very well.

      Jenner launches into the BACH GOLDBERG VARIATION #5, eyes 
      riveted to the MAIN DISPLAY SCREEN. As a pianist, he could 
      give Glenn Gould a run for his money. It's obvious how much 
      playing helps him focus his thoughts, as:  

      A DISPLAY OF VIRAL MUTATION AT THE DNA LEVEL starts to unfold 
      on the wall-sized screen before him, the genetic strands 
      twining in a weird tentacled dance, as we

                                        ACT I

      FADE IN:


      Jim has been digging at the  holes again, widening them, *
      turning them into graves.  He s sore, hurt.  He looks around 
      discretely, then lifts his shirt.  He s been BITTEN.  He 
      drops his shirt, looks around again, then continues digging. 

      Daryl dispatches a DEAD SURVIVOR with his pickaxe.  *

      MORALES and JACQUI drag a walker body toward the grave.  
      Glenn stops them.

                                  GLENN
                    What are you doing, man?
                          (off Morales s look)
                    Geeks go over there.

      He indicates the pyre smoke.*

                                  GLENN
                    They re infected. 

      Jacqui and Morales drag the walker back down the hill, toward *
      the fire.  Daryl indicates the mayhem.

                                  DARYL
                    You reap what you sow.

      Morales glares at him.  The stress and strain of the last 
      twelve hours and now the smell of burning flesh is getting to 
      everyone.  

                                    MORALES
                    Shut up, Daryl.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 9.


                                  DARYL
                    You left my brother for dead.  You 
                    all had this coming. 

      He shoots nearby T-Dog a cold look.  Glenn, Morales, and T-
      Dog trade looks.  No one feels like fighting.  Seeing no one 
      takes the bait, Daryl moves off.  The others trade looks then 
      Glenn starts to drag the dead survivor toward the grave.  AS 
      Morales gives him a hand --


      Jim, sweaty and suffering chills, stares out the window at 
      the continuing camp clean up.  

      There s a KNOCK on the door.  It opens immediately and Carol 
      enters.

                                  CAROL
                    How you feeling?

      She looks at him compassionately.  He looks like shit.  She 
      feels his forehead, then his cheek.

                                  CAROL
                    You re burning with fever.  You 
                    need to lie down.

      She hands him a small water bottle, but his hands are shaking 
      so much, she must steady it for him to drink.  He does so 
      painfully.  

      OFF Carol, her patient dying -- 


      Jim looks wearily out the window of the RV, seeing people *
      returning from the burial.  He hangs his head, trying to keep *
      his shit together.*


      Jim lies on the bed, writhing in pain.  His clothes are 
      drenched with sweat.  Carol wipes his face with a damp cloth. 

      The door opens and Rick and Lori enter.   

                                  LORI
                    You need anything?  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 24.


                                  CAROL
                    His fever s worse.

      Lori and Rick pityingly take in Jim.

                                  LORI
                    Carol, you mind stepping out for a 
                    sec?

                                  CAROL
                    Sure.  Poor man. 

      She follows Lori out.  Rick sits beside Jim.  A beat, then 
      Jim painfully opens his eyes.  

                                  JIM
                    I thought there d be a grave ready 
                    for me.

      An awkward beat.

                                  RICK
                    Nobody wants that. 

      Jim starts to cough violently.  He spits some blood on the 
      floor.  Rick takes a step back.  Jim collapses back on the 
      bed.

                                  RICK
                    We re going to get you some help.

                                  JIM
                    It s too late.  The graves.  It s 
                    there.  Hands.  Armies. 

      Rick realizes he s delirious.

                                  JIM*
                    Amy s there, swimming.  Watch the 
                      mangroves.  Those roots ll gouge 
                    the whole boat. 

      Jim looks right at Rick and speaks lucidly.

                                  JIM
                    You ll watch the boat, right?  You 
                    said you would.

                                  RICK
                    I ll watch the boat.  Don t worry.

      Jim lies back and shuts his eyes peacefully.  OFF Rick, 
      keeping vigil --   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 25.



      Jim sits up and listens nervously.  He is rattled, his 
      breathing labored, his skin discolored.  His condition 
      deteriorating.   


      Jim screams in pain with every bump as he is tossed about.  
      Carol tries to comfort him, but he is in agony.  She calls 
      out --

                                  CAROL
                    Pick a smoother route, for God s 
                    sake. 

      UP FRONT --

      Dale drives.  Glenn s his co-pilot, the original map on his 
      lap.  They trade helpless looks.  


      Rick drives.  Lori sits beside him, Carl and Sophia in the 
      backseat.  Rick checks the rearview to make sure everyone s 
      in line.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 35.



      T-Dog drives, accompanied by Andrea and Jacqui.  Andrea 
      stares out the window, lost in thought. 


      Daryl drives.  A shotgun riding shotgun. 


      Shane follows Daryl.  He s alone. 


      As Sophia sleeps in the backseat, the Grimes family talk 
      quietly. 

                                  LORI
                          (to Carl)
                    How d you do shooting?

                                  CARL
                    I need more practice. 

      She cuts Rick a look.  He understands immediately.

                                  RICK
                    Your mother doesn t like guns.

                                  CARL
                    I have to learn how to shoot.

                                  LORI
                    I know, it s just... I don t like 
                    guns.

      Long beat. 

                                  LORI
                          (changing the subject)
                    Been awhile since we ve been on a 
                    trip together.

      Rick, grateful for the change in tone, pounces --

                    Never did do the Grand Canyon.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 36.


                                  CARL
                    Why not?

      A beat as Rick and Lori think.

                                  RICK
                    Just weren t big vacation people.  
                    Your mom always wanted to visit her 
                    family.

                                  LORI
                    And your dad always took extra 
                    shifts.

                                  RICK
                    We always figured we d get to it 
                    next year.  It s not like it s 
                    going anywhere. 

                                  CARL
                    I wanna see it.  Can we still take 
                    that trip?  See the Grand Canyon?

      Rick s smile fades but then he recovers it.

                                  RICK
                    Sure, buddy.  First things first.

      Carl sits back, content.  Lori and Rick trade looks.


      Dale drives, Glenn beside him.

                                  DALE
                    How d you do during shooting 
                    practice?

                                  GLENN
                    All right.

                                  DALE
                    It s one thing to shoot a tree, 
                    another a charging walker.

                                  GLENN
                    What are you telling me?

                                  DALE
                    I m afraid you might get that 
                    chance before this ride s over.

      He looks out the windshield.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 37.


                                  DALE
                    Ah, shit.  What is this?


      Jim lies on the bed, eyes open.  He s fading.  Carol keeps 
      vigil.

      Rick enters.  He s taken aback by Jim s condition but tries 
      to appear upbeat.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 38.


                                  RICK
                    Why don t you take a few, grab some 
                    air.

      Carol is hesitant to leave but finally does.  Rick sits 
      beside Jim.

                                  RICK
                    We should be back on the road soon.  
                    Hang in there. 

      Jim tries to catch his breath.

                                  RICK
                    You comfortable?  You need --

                                  JIM
                    Leave me here.

                                  RICK
                    Not a chance.

                                  JIM
                    I m done.  

                                  RICK
                    You can t give up. 

                                  JIM
                    Just lean me against a tree, in the 
                    shade.  I wanna be with my family. 

                                  RICK
                            (sympathetically)
                    They re all dead.

      Jim nods sadly. 

                                  RICK
                    All you gotta do is sleep.  Close 
                    your eyes and by the time you wake 
                    up we ll be --

                                  JIM
                    I can t -- this ride, it s killing 
                    me.  The pain... 

                                  RICK
                    Jim, the fever, you re not thinking 
                    straight.

                                  JIM
                    I am.  Now, I am.  And I want this.  
                    Leave me here.  That s on me.

                                  JIM (CONT'D)
                    I know what I m asking.  My 
                    decision.  Not your failure.  

      Rick wrestles with Jim s request.*

                                  RICK*
                    If we give up, it s over.  No one *
                    can ever count on anything. *

      Jim forces himself to sit up and look Rick in the eye.*

                                  JIM*
                    You can t save me.  And you know *
                    it. *

      OFF Rick, torn -- 


      Jenner in HazMat gear standing alone in the middle of a 
      pristine lab.  He works carefully at a lab table. 

      He opens a freezer drawer and removes a specimen container 
      labeled:  TS-19   

      He lifts the lid of the container to reveal a sample of 
      necrotic tissue.  He delicately places it on the workspace.

      He picks up a pair of dull, plastic scissors and carefully 
      cuts off a sample.  It s slow going. 

                                  JENNER
                    Vox, can t I get some decent 
                    scissors?

                                  VOX
                    It is for your own protection.  

                                  JENNER
                    You d miss me?

                                  VOX
                    Do you need to take a break, 
                    Doctor?  You re anthropomorphizing 
                    me again. 

      Jenner blinks his eyes a few times then tries to focus.  He s 
      exhausted.

                                  JENNER
                    No, I m fine.


        A centrifuge spins.  

      Jenner watches it.  His eyes close then snap open. 

      The centrifuge stops. 

      Jenner opens it then removes the sample.  He places it on the 
      workspace and examines it carefully.  He notices something 
      and reaches out to touch it.  He then stops himself and while 
      still inspecting it curiously, reaches for an instrument 
      without looking.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 43.


      He knocks over a beacon of fluid, which spills on the larger 
      sample.  It starts to dissolve.

                                  JENNER
                    No!

      He instinctively brushes the sample to protect it then stops.  
      He looks at his hand, horrified.

      His glove is dissolving. 

      He frantically rips his glove off but --

      His second pair (below the top pair) is also being eaten 
      through.

                                  JENNER
                    It s eating through.

      He runs to a decontamination shower and pulls the chain.  An 
      ALARM rings.  Water floods down on his HazMat suit.

      He looks at the large sample -- ruined.

                                  VOX
                    Lockdown procedure initiated.

      Jenner runs for the door.

                                  JENNER
                    Let me out.  Let me out, Vox. 

      He exits and the door locks behind him.  A steel door slams 
      down.

                                  VOX
                    Should I proceed with full 
                      decontamination, Doctor?

      Jenner heads for another shower. 

                                  JENNER
                    Yes, damn it.  

      He removes his HazMat gear, then his secondary gear, then his 
      underwear.

      Jenner steps into the shower and is blasted by a chemical 
      wash.

      He examines his hand carefully.  It seems unharmed.

                                  JENNER
                    No, don t!  

      He looks up from the shower and into the lab.  TS-19 sits on 
      the workspace.

                                  JENNER
                    Wait!  Stop!  Don t burn -- 

      BOOM!  A FIREBALL rips through the lab, incinerating it. 

      Jenner hangs his head and lets out a deep, anguished moan. 

                                  VOX
                    Full decontamination sequence

      Glenn studies the map then points.

                                  GLENN
                    Should be that way.

      Dale puts on his blinker.


      RICK S POV --

      Dale s blinker signals left.  The RV starts to turn.

      Lori and Carl lean forward enthusiastically as Rick follows.

                                  CARL
                    Are we close?

                                  LORI
                    I think so.

      Rick smiles, nods, relieved. 


      T-Dog turns to Andrea.

                                  T-DOG
                    Jim could have made it.

                                  ANDREA
                    He did what he had to.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 45.



      Rick and Lori peer through his windshield.

                                  LORI
                    Oh my god.

      He pulls to a stop. 


      Jenner, his eyes red, paces furiously.  He drinks from a full 
      glass of wine, two open bottles before him.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 46.


                                  JENNER
                    You callous, thoughtless, idiotic 
                    abacus.  That was the last sample 
                    of TS-19.  You know what we did to 
                    get that.  It was everything.  And 
                    now it s gone.  GONE!

                                  VOX
                    You initiated the decon sequence.

                                  JENNER
                    I didn t mean destroy her --

      An ALARM sounds as white lights flash sequentially.

                                  JENNER
                    What is it?

                                  VOX
                    There are people outside the main 
                    entrance.

      Jenner reacts anxiously.  He s been alone far too long. 

                                  JENNER
                    People?  What sort of people?

                                  VOX
                      Civilians.  Unclassified.  

                                  JENNER
                    They re alive?

                                  VOX
                    Without full diagnostics, I cannot 
                    determine if they re infected.  

                                  JENNER
                    What are they doing here?  What do 
                    they want?

                                  VOX
                    They are seeking entry.

      OFF Jenner, terrified -- 


      Jenner watches Rick looking right at him. 

      BACK TO RICK AND THE OTHERS -- 

      Rick bangs on the door again.

                                  T-DOG
                    Man, there s nobody here.

                                  CAROL
                    Let s get out here, we have to find 
                    someplace safe. 


      Jenner watches Rick on the security monitor. 

                                  RICK
                    If you can hear me... Please, help 
                    us.  We have women, children, no 
                    food.  Nowhere else to go.

      Jenner sweats profusely.  He drains his glass, then continues 
      watching.

      Rick hates to say this in front of everyone --

                                  RICK
                    If you don t let us in, you re 
                    killing us... Please.

      Still no answer as Shane appears on the monitor next to Rick.

                                  SHANE
                    Maybe the camera s still working 
                    and everybody s dead.

      Rick, with no other choice, is about to give up hope.  He 
      turns and starts down the stairs when ---  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 49.


      THE DOOR 

      Opens behind them.

      They turn and ready their weapons.  They trade cautious looks 
      as they approach the entrance.  

      Rick and Shane pull the corpses away that block the entrance.

      Carol, Daryl, Jacqui, climb over the bodies faster than Rick 
      and Shane can clear them.  The group scrambles its way into -- 


      And looks around, amazed.  Lori smiles with relief when she 
      feels the blast of air conditioning.  

      They ve made it.  Dale slaps Rick on the back.  

      The group exchanges looks with Rick, acknowledging he was 
      right.

      Jenner studies them on a monitor then runs his fingers 
      through his hair and straightens his clothes, trying to make 
      himself presentable.  AS he braces himself for his guests -- 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
