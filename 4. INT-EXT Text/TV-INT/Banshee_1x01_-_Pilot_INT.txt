      Lucas roughly pulls the bartender s tank top over her head. 
      She s wearing nothing beneath it.  She kisses him as he moves 
      her back against a stand of beer kegs.

      He pulls off her skirt and panties and then he s fucking her 
      up against the kegs.

      CLOSE ON Lucas s hungry expression: he hasn t touched a woman 
      in years.



      Techno MUSIC.  Flamboyant haircutters work and gossip.  Lucas 
      takes in the scene, then moves with purpose toward the back.                                                                                      2.


      An ATTRACTIVE ASIAN STYLIST (35) in a tight leather miniskirt 
      sees Lucas through the mirror as she cuts a woman s hair.  
      Only when she speaks do we realize she - JOB - is a  he. 

                                  JOB
                    Fuck me...



      Job comes downstairs to find Lucas standing at a workstation 
      full of state-of-the-art computer monitors and equipment.

                                  LUCAS
                          (not turning around)
                    Hi, Job.

      He runs his finger across a monitor and the screen comes 
      alive with files.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Cool.

                                  JOB
                          (nervous)
                    You re out.

                                  LUCAS
                    I m out.

      Lucas turns to face Job, his expression gravely expectant.

                                  JOB
                          (pleading)
                    Listen, I know why you re here, but 
                    I can t help you.

      Lucas shakes his head: wrong answer.  He reaches back, knocks 
      a monitor off the desk.  It hits the floor with a CRASH.

                  JOB (CONT D)LUCAS
      Hey!Just give me the address.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Why are you assuming that I even 
                    know-

      Lucas picks up another monitor, a light and sleek one.  He  
      tosses it like a frisbee across the room.  Smash.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Jesus!  Quit breaking my shit!                                                                                      3.


                                  LUCAS
                    Worry about what I ll start 
                    breaking when I run out of shit.

                                  JOB
                    Come on, man.  You know how it 
                    works.  The trail is cold.  

      Lucas rips an LCD screen off the wall and tosses it at Job s 
      high-heeled feet, where it bursts into pieces.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Fuck!  Okay, okay!  Just stop the 
                      carnage...

      Lucas looks up at Job and smiles congenially.



      The gallery is empty save for one man sitting in the back:  
      DAN KENDALL (late 20s), the town s ridiculously young mayor.  

      D.A. GORDON HOPEWELL (40s) stands at the prosecution table, 
      next to an assistant D.A.  Over at the defense table sits...

      KAI PROCTOR (45), tall, powerfully built, with an aura of 
      confident power.  He has long, almost boyishly blond hair.  
      His defense lawyer stands beside him.

      An aging Judge enters, pulling his robe on over a track suit.

                                  JUDGE
                    Good morning, everyone.  I ve 
                    reviewed the defense s motion to 
                    dismiss, and, based on the 
                    evidence, or lack thereof, it is my 
                    opinion that the Prosecution cannot 
                    sustain the burden for a trial - 

                      GORDONJUDGE
      -Are you kidding me?!-so I m finding for the 
                                                    defense. Case dismissed.

                                  GORDON
                    Your Honor!

                                  JUDGE
                    You can t take this to trial, 
                    Gordon. You should be thanking me 
                    for saving you the embarrassment.

      The Judge leaves.  Gordon collapses into his seat.  Proctor 
      and his lawyer start out of the room, pausing by Gordon.

                                  LAWYER
                    Gordon.                                                                                      6.


                                  GORDON
                    Andy.  Is that a judge in your 
                    pocket, or are you just happy to 
                    see me?

      Proctor smiles.  He is a silent, menacing presence.  Heading 
      out of the room, Proctor and his lawyer pass the Mayor 
      simmering by the door.

                                  LAWYER
                    Mr. Mayor.

      Proctor and his lawyer exit.  Gordon, still seated, spins in 
      his chair to face the Mayor, who is absolutely stewing.

                                    KENDALL
                    Jesus Christ, Gordon.

                                  GORDON
                    Pace yourself, Dan.  Our day will 
                    come.

      Dan nods curtly, then exits, leaving Gordon alone in the 
      courtroom.  Gordon wearily turns to gather his papers into 
      his briefcase.  Suddenly, in a fit of anger, he violently 
      shoves the whole mess off the table.



      Carrie drives, Gordon rides shotgun.                                                                                        7.


      DEVA HOPEWELL, 15, rebelliously sexy and precocious, in 
      skimpy black clothes with a Goth edge, sulks in the back 
      seat.  Her younger brother, MAX, 8, thin and frail, small for 
      his age, sits next to her playing a video game on his PSP.

                                  GORDON
                          (at Deva, pissed)
                    You kicked your teacher?!

                                  DEVA
                          (bored)
                      Substitute teacher.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, well that s okay then.

                                  DEVA
                    He s a perv, Mom!  He tried to see 
                    down my shirt.

                                  GORDON
                    Well, with a shirt like that, it 
                    doesn t take much trying.

                      CARRIEDEVA
          (quietly)So it s my fault?! So if I 
      Gordon.get molested by a teacher, 
                                                  you ll just blame my shirt?

      Gordon sighs.  Deva s attire is clearly an ongoing issue 
      between Carrie and Gordon.



      They step inside.  Carrie moves down the hall to the kitchen, 
      while Gordon heads upstairs.  



      Carrie, sipping at a coffee mug, flips through the mail on 
      her kitchen counter.  She sets down the last envelope and 
      looks up through the picture window facing her backyard.


      CARRIE S POV OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW OF HER BACKYARD

      LUCAS HOOD IS STANDING IN THE YARD, staring right back at 
      her.  She gasps and drops her coffee mug, which shatters on 
      the floor.  Hot coffee splatters by her feet. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Ow!

      She jumps back, stung by the hot coffee.  When she looks up 
      again, Lucas is gone.

      Deva walks in and indifferently takes in the mess as Carrie, 
      still stunned, looks up at her daughter.  The doorbell rings.

                                  DEVA
                    That s Beaty.  Later.

      She leaves. 



      Lucas drives toward the outskirts of town, deep in thought.  
      He sees a dilapidated brick building with neon beer signs in 
      a window.  A sign over the door says: 

                              THE FORGE  

                     Drink-Eat-Both

      Lucas pulls into the lot and parks near two other vehicles.  
      Out back behind the Forge is a small house and a separate 
      garage, and beyond them a LAKE is visible through some trees.



      It s a former Amish blacksmith shop turned into a pub.  In 
      one corner are an old forge oven and anvil.  Tables and 
      chairs, a pool table, a long wooden bar counter.    

      Lucas enters.  The place is empty, but at the bar s far end 
      is a beer pint beside a table setting.  A TV above the bar 
      plays a ball game.  There s no one behind the bar until...

      SUGAR BATES (58), African-American, grizzled, comes through a 
      swinging door from a kitchen.  He sets a plate of steak and 
      fries down near the beer pint, then sees Lucas by the door.                                                                                    10.


                                  SUGAR
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.  I m 
                    between cooks, so it s kind of a 
                    one man show for now.  You re not a 
                    cook, are you?

                                  LUCAS
                          (moving to the bar)
                    Sorry.

      Sugar sizes him up.

                                  SUGAR
                    I m gonna go with shitty day, and 
                    whiskey neat.

                                  LUCAS
                    Shitty fifteen years.  Whiskey s 
                    fine. 

      Sugar sets down a glass, pours Lucas a whiskey.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    One for you too.

      Sugar nods thanks, pours a shot.  They drink, Sugar refills.  

                                  SUGAR
                    You coming or going?

                                  LUCAS
                    I m still working that out.

      Lucas spies a framed photo hanging above a row of bottles; a 
      young black boxer uppercuts a white boxer.

                                  SUGAR
                    That s me... Sugar Bates in the 
                      cruiserweight years.   

                                  LUCAS
                    The other guy looks outclassed.  
                    What d you drop him, in the fifth?

                                  SUGAR
                    The eighth.  He was a southpaw- 
                    they take longer.

      Lucas drains his glass.  Sugar refills it and studies Lucas.

                                  SUGAR (CONT D)
                    So, where d you sit?

      Lucas meets Sugar s gaze, impressed by the man s intuition.                                                                                     11.


                                  LUCAS
                    Attica.

                                  SUGAR
                    I did eight years in Allenwood.  
                    You look fresh.
                          (holds up his glass)
                    Freedom.

      They clink glasses, drink.  Lucas looks to the pub s back as 
      a men s room door opens.  Out steps: 

      A TALL MAN (45) with a no-nonsense bearing, in boots, jeans 
      and a rumpled leather jacket.  He sits to his steak and beer, 
      looks at Lucas and Sugar.  The two ex-cons have gone silent.

                                  TALL MAN
                          (at Sugar)
                    Always this quiet around here?
                          (off Sugar s shrug)
                    Well, let s stimulate the local 
                    economy.  A round on me.

      Lucas and Sugar nod thanks.  Sugar fills his and Lucas s 
      glasses, pours the tall man a beer.   

                                  SUGAR
                    All you tourists buying me drinks 
                    today. 

      He raises his glass, toasting them, and downs the shot.

                                  TALL MAN
                    Actually, I m not a tourist.  

      Bringing his plate, he moves to get the beer and join them.

                                  TALL MAN/SHERIFF
                    Come Monday, I m being sworn in as 
                    sheriff.

      Lucas gives the tall man an appropriating, semi-wary glance.

                                  LUCAS
                      Congratulations.  Do you say 
                      congratulations, or good luck?

                                    SHERIFF 
                    I ll take both, thanks.  I spent 
                    nine years as sheriff in Bend, 
                    Oregon.  Ever hear of it? 

      They haven t.                                                                                    12.


                                    SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    I m not surprised.  Anyway, this is 
                    my first day east.  I drove clean 
                    across the country.  Less to see 
                    than you d think.         

                                  SUGAR
                    I thought a sheriff had to be 
                    elected.

      The tall man nods as he cuts meat and eats.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Me too.  Turns out, under certain 
                      circumstances, the mayor can 
                    authorize a ringer.  Sheriff Hale s 
                    the one who hired me.  I was 
                    looking forward to meeting him.

                                  SUGAR
                    That d be a hell of a trick, since 
                    he died last Tuesday.

                                    SHERIFF
                          (nods knowingly)
                    Liver cancer.  I think he thought 
                    he had more time. 
                          (shrugs)
                    I hope he got my paperwork in.

      SOUND of the front door opening.  Lucas turns to see TWO 
      SILHOUETTED MEN striding inside out of the daylight.  One has 
      a scar on his jaw, the other s bald.

      They glance at Lucas and the sheriff, then stare at Sugar, 
      who sets two glasses on the bar, pours shots of Johnnie 
      Walker.  The sheriff has a bite of steak, watches the thugs.

                                  SUGAR
                          (as he pours)
                    On the house, boys. 

      The thugs leave the whiskey untouched.  

                                  BALD THUG
                    Glad you re feeling so generous.

      He casually draws a GUN.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                          (to Sheriff and Lucas)
                    You two sit tight.                                                                                    13.


      Sugar sighs and goes to the till.  The sheriff unbuttons his 
      coat.  Lucas sees a GLOCK in the sheriff s shoulder holster.  
      Lucas catches the sheriff s eye and shakes his head.  But the 
      sheriff DRAWS HIS GLOCK, jumps up.  

                                    SHERIFF
                    Sheriff s department!  I ll take 
                    that gun now.

      Both thugs step back surprised.  Bald Thug whips an automatic 
      handgun from behind his back, and both point their guns at 
      the sheriff.  Lucas takes it all in, measuring, calculating.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                          (at the sheriff)
                    No, you drop your fucking gun!

                                    SHERIFF
                    The only thing I ll drop is you, 
                    son, if you don t put that weapon 
                    down right now.

      Suddenly, Lucas steps into the center of the stand-off, hands 
      raised.  He speaks in a congenial, easygoing manner:  

                                  LUCAS
                    Okay, what we have here is your 
                    classic Mexican standoff.  I m 
                    actually feeling kind of left out 
                    without a gun, you know?

                                  BALD THUG
                    Who the fuck s this guy now?

                                  LUCAS
                          (to Scarred Thug)
                    Hey, that s the new PZ-600, isn t 
                    it?  That s a hard gun to get.  
                    How s the recoil?

                                    SCARRED THUG
                    Like shaking hands with a baby.

                                  LUCAS
                    Sweet.

                                    SHERIFF
                          (to Lucas)
                    Sit your ass down.

                                  LUCAS
                    Just hear me out, Sheriff.  They ve 
                    got you outgunned.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                  LUCAS (CONT'D)
                    You shoot either one, the other s 
                    got you at close range.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                    Damn straight we do.

                                  LUCAS
                          (to the thugs)
                    On the other hand, one of you boys 
                    is dead, or else shitting into a 
                    bag for the rest of your life. And 
                    for what?  The two hundred or so 
                    bucks Sugar s got in the register 
                    at four PM on a Tuesday?  So, 
                    Sheriff, how about you just let 
                    them take the cash.  Then I ll put 
                    down a card and buy us enough 
                    drinks to make Sugar whole.  What 
                    do you say, fellas?

      The sheriff seems about to nod, when HE SHOVES LUCAS ASIDE 
      AND FIRES AT SCARRED THUG.  The bullet grazes Scarred Thug s 
      shoulder and his gun falls.  In the same instant:

      BALD THUG SHOOTS THE SHERIFF TWICE IN THE CHEST.  The sheriff 
      is blown off his feet, landing across the room.  As Bald Thug 
      turns to shoot Lucas... 

      LUCAS EXPLODES INTO ACTION.  He grabs Bald Thug s wrist as 
      the gun fires.  The shot goes past Sugar s ear and hits the 
      BOXING PHOTO behind him.  Lucas spins and twists Bald Thug s 
      arm into an Aikido lock that breaks it at the elbow savagely 
      enough that BONE BURSTS THROUGH SKIN. 

      Still holding the guy, Lucas grabs the Sheriff s STEAK KNIFE 
      from his plate and HE SHIVS THE BALD THUG once each in the 
      guts, heart, and throat, dropping him as BLOOD SPURTS.

      SCARRED THUG TACKLES LUCAS, pinning him onto a dinner table.  
      He gets his hands around Lucas s throat, strangling him.  
      Wheezing, Lucas grabs a ketchup bottle and bangs it against 
      Scarred Thug s temple.  The thug falls toward him.

      LUCAS JAMS THE KETCHUP BOTTLE skinny-end first into Scarred 
      Thug s mouth and down his throat.  The thug stands, choking, 
      eyes bulging.  

      Lucas hits him in the chest with a flying side kick.  The 
      thug flies back and down.  THE BACK OF HIS HEAD GETS IMPALED 
      ON THE TIP OF THE ANVIL, HARD ENOUGH TO PIERCE HIS SKULL AND 
      SHATTER THE KETCHUP BOTTLE FROM BEHIND.

      SCARRED THUG twitches once and dies, with pieces of bottle 
      glass and ketchup dripping from his mouth.                                                                                      15.


      Lucas moves to the side of the fallen sheriff, who s still 
      alive, barely.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Am I dead?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah.

                                    SHERIFF
                    My first day in town.  Shit.

                                  LUCAS
                    I m sorry.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Christ, that stings.
                          (shudders, fading)
                    I hope my mother was right about 
                    God.

      HE DIES.  Lucas sits on his ass, rubs his throat where the 
      thug was choking him.  Sugar walks out from behind the bar.  

                                  SUGAR
                    Jesus Ripshit Christ.  Is he dead?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah.

      Sugar walks to where the dead thug is stuck to the anvil.  
      Using his foot, Sugar nudges the corpse till its head 
      unsticks from the anvil.  The corpse drops away.  Sugar comes 
      to Lucas, crouches beside him.  They look at the dead thugs.

                                  SUGAR
                    This is what the Bible calls a 
                      clusterfuck of epic proportions.

                                  LUCAS
                    Two cons and three corpses, one of 
                    them a cop. I don t like that math.

      The two men look at each other as they stand.

                                  SUGAR
                    You get going.
                          (off Lucas s look)
                    They would have killed me, same as 
                    him.  Least I can do is give you a 
                    head start.

                                  LUCAS
                    What about you?                                                                                    16.


                                  SUGAR
                    I got a few tricks.  Now get out of 
                    here.

      Lucas studies Sugar s eyes, then backs out the front door.



      In a nice suburban home, three well-dressed couples --
      including Carrie and Gordon Hopewell -- are having dinner.  
      All are drinking wine, finishing salads.

      JOCELYN FREARS (40) walks around with a tray, serving what 
      look like small gourmet hamburgers to each guest.  Carrie is 
      picking at her salad with a distracted look.  

                                    JOCELYN FREARS 
                    These are beef brisket sliders with 
                    Cabot cheddar and white pepper cole 
                    slaw.  They re fun, right?

                                  LARRY FREARS 
                    They re small. 

                                    JOCELYN
                          (at Larry)
                    And if I couldn t have fun with 
                    small things, where would you and I 
                    be, huh?

      Everyone except Carrie laughs.  LARRY FREARS (45) rolls his 
      eyes at his wife, then lifts a wine bottle, pours more into 
      Gordon s glass.  He moves on to Carrie s glass.

                                  LARRY FREARS
                    Refill, gorgeous?

      Carrie shakes her head no, absently.  He pours her more wine 
      anyway, then moves on to another guest s glass.  Gordon 
      notices that his wife is tuned out: he squeezes her hand.

                                  GORDON
                    Carrie?  You okay?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah.  I m fine. 

      Trying to brighten, she smiles at him, has a bite of food.  
      We see a tightening shot of Carrie as she struggles to pay 
      attention to the group.  She s a million miles away.                                                                                    17.



      Carrie puts dirty plates in the sink.  She grabs a plastic 
      bag of empty wine bottles, walks down a hall toward a door. 



      Barefoot, wearing shorts and a tank top, Carrie sits alone in 
      the kitchen, drinking a glass of wine.  The house is dark and 
      silent.  She looks out the window, sees something.



      Job sits in his computer lair, his wig off.  The phone rings 
      and Job picks up.

      Lucas sits at the bar on Sugar s phone, washing blood off the 
      badge as he talks.  His clothes are muddy.  Sugar is behind 
      the bar, pretending to be busy, but listening to Lucas talk.

      Lucas hangs up and hands Sugar the phone.  Sugar considers 
      him for a long moment.

                                  SUGAR
                    Some cons, the minute they get out, 
                    they re just trying like hell to 
                    get back in. 

                                  LUCAS
                    I m not going back.

                                  SUGAR
                    Well, you ve got a revolutionary 
                    method of staying out of trouble.                                                                                    26.


      Lucas gets up and offers Sugar his hand.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks for everything you ve done.

      Sugar shakes hands and watches thoughtfully as Lucas leaves.



      Lucas is behind the wheel, conked out.  A KNOCK on the window 
      rouses him.  He looks out at Sugar, who is gazing in at him.



      Lucas climbs into an old queen-sized bed.  He moves around, 
        unaccustomed to such space.  Eventually he moves the bed two 
      feet from the wall, brings his blanket and pillow and lies on 
      the floor between the bed and wall, staring upward.



      Gordon sleeps in bed.  Carrie s side is empty.  A shower can 
      be heard running.  



      The room is filled with shower steam.  Carrie sits on the 
      floor, arms around her knees, weeping, stricken.



      LUCAS LURCHES UP FROM SLEEP IN HIS PLACE ON SUGAR S FLOOR 

      In a sweaty panic, he gasps for air, his eyes wild.  He is 
      shirtless, wearing only jeans.  He staggers to the door...                                                                                     27.



      Lucas kneels, scrubbing the anvil with a soapy rag.  Sugar 
      finishes hanging a FRAMED PICTURE of Muhammad Ali where the 
      boxing picture used to be.  SOUND of car wheels on gravel.  
      Sugar looks out the window...

                                  SUGAR
                    Go back and stay out of sight.

                                  LUCAS
                    What is it?

                                  SUGAR
                    Just go.

      Lucas heads into the kitchen.



      Sugar pulls out his BEST SCOTCH, pours a generous glass.  The 
      door opens and Proctor walks in. 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Morning, Sugar.

                                  SUGAR
                    Kai.

      Sugar slides the Scotch across the bar.  Proctor sits down 
      and takes a sip.  These men know each other.

                                    PROCTOR
                    I haven t seen you for a while.  
                    How are the headaches?  Did those 
                    Mexican painkillers I got you help?

                                  SUGAR
                    They did, thanks.  So, what brings 
                    you around?

                                    PROCTOR
                    I seem to have misplaced two of my 
                    men.  Randall and Munson.

      REACTION SHOT OF LUCAS: he s in the kitchen, standing near 
      the door, eavesdropping attentively.

                                  SUGAR (O.C.)
                    Munson the bald one?

                                    PROCTOR (O.C.)
                    That s right.  One of the boys 
                    thought they might have been headed 
                    out this way yesterday afternoon.


      BACK ON SUGAR AND PROCTOR

                                  SUGAR
                    They didn t come here.  I d have 
                    taken note if they did.

      Proctor looks at him, hard.

                                    PROCTOR
                    If any of my employees ever stepped 
                    out of line, hassled you in any 
                    way, I d expect you to call me.

                                  SUGAR
                    I would.                                                                                    29.


                                    PROCTOR
                    What I mean is, I wouldn t want you 
                    taking matters into your own hands.

                                  SUGAR
                    Look at me.  Hell, even my pubes 
                    are gray.  No one runs from a fight 
                    faster than an old fighter.

      Kai looks at him for a long, uncomfortable beat, and then 
      over his shoulder at the picture of Ali.

                                    PROCTOR
                          (pointing to the picture)
                    What happened to your title fight?

                                  SUGAR
                    Oh... I knocked it off the hook the 
                    other night, busted the frame.  I m 
                    having it redone.

      Proctor stands, finishes his Scotch, still watching Sugar.

                                    PROCTOR
                    You ll let me know if you need any 
                    more of those painkillers.

      Sugar nods.  Walking out, Proctor passes the anvil.  He 
      pauses to run his finger along the anvil s wet edge.  He 
      studies his finger for another agonizing beat.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Thanks for the drink.

      He leaves.  Lucas steps back in.

                                  LUCAS
                    That s some car. 

                                  SUGAR
                    You re thinking of stealing from 
                    Kai Proctor, you might as well just 
                    put a bullet in your own head now.

                                  LUCAS
                    Kai Proctor.  There s a name.

                                  SUGAR
                    What the man doesn t own, he runs.  
                    What he doesn t run, he burns to 
                    the ground.

                                  LUCAS
                    He seemed to like you well enough.                                                                                    30.


                                  SUGAR
                    We go back a ways.  But I m not 
                    kidding.  You want to maintain a 
                    quality of life, you steer clear of 
                    him.

      Lucas gazes out the window, watching the Bentley drive off.  



      Job, in full drag, works at his computers.   

      CLOSE ON: The monitor.  We see Sheriff Lucas Hood s driver s 
      license.  Job drags a photo of OUR Lucas over the photo of 
      the dead Sheriff. 

      AN EFFEMINATE YOUNG MAN (20s) with an Elvis pompadour enters.

                                  ELVIS
                    Job.  Two suits, badly tailored.  
                    They re looking for you.

      Job hits a button and his monitor shows the salon upstairs. 
      TWO MEN in dark suits stand at the reception desk.  They are 
      the men who chased Lucas a few days ago.

                                  ELVIS (CONT D)
                    Cops?

                                  JOB
                          (troubled)
                    Let s hope so.

      He stands and starts unplugging a row of back-up hard drives.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    I want all the back-up drives in 
                    the car, now.

      Elvis collects them.  Job runs to a safe, hits buttons.  He 
      pulls out stacks of cash, which he throws in a duffel.  He 
      hands the bag to Elvis, who is holding the hard drives.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Keep the engine running.

      Elvis goes into a closet, through a hidden back door and up a 
      staircase.  Job gets onto his computer and types in a code.                                                                                    31.


      CLOSE ON: The computer screen, which reads: Wipe Drives?

      Job clicks: the screen fills with naked women swimming 
      underwater.

      Job turns to go upstairs, when the door opens and the men in 
      suits step into the basement.  They are Widow s Peak and his 
      partner, who has a buzz cut. 

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                      Gentlemen, we don t open until ten, 
                    but if you ll come back upstairs, 
                    I ll see when we can fit you in.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Down here might be better for the 
                    private nature of our inquiry.

                                  JOB
                    Inquiry?  Can I see some ID?

      Widow s Peak pulls out a wallet and hands Job a business 
      card.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    This isn t a badge.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    No, it s not.

      BUZZ CUT PUNCHES JOB IN FACE.  Instead of going down, Job 
      punches the guy right back, a wicked left cross. 

      JOB WHIPS A BUTTERFLY KNIFE OUT OF HIS BRA, flips it open in 
      a blur, and slices a gash down Buzz Cut s jaw.  But before he 
      can strike again, Widow s Peak grabs Job s knife arm and 
      punches him repeatedly in the face until the knife falls.  

      Widow s Peak drops Job into a chair.  Job bleeds from nose 
      and mouth.  

                                  BUZZ CUT
                          (draws his gun)
                    You fucking slope cunt!

      He shoves his gun under Job s chin, but Widow s Peak grabs 
      his arm and pushes his partner away, flashing him a stern 
      look.

      Widow s Peak pulls up a second chair, sits on it backwards, 
      gets in Job s face.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    We work for Mr. Rabbit.                                                                                    32.


                                  JOB
                          (scared by the name)
                    Oh, sweet fuck.
                          (off Widow Peak s stare)
                    The guy you re after... he came in 
                    a few days ago.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    And what did he want?

                                  JOB
                    The usual.  ID.  Credit cards. 

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Where is he now?

                                  JOB
                    I have no idea.

      Buzz Cut pistol-whips Job across the face.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Okay, okay!  I ll get you the file.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    That would be helpful.

      Job gets up shakily and goes into the closet. 



      As a bloody Job moves to the back of the deep storage closet, 
      he slips through the hidden doorway and heads up the stairs.



      Carrie, naked, lies in her bed as Gordon vigorously goes down 
      on her.  But even as she moves with him, she stares off to 
      the side as she remembers...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    34.



      Lucas and Carrie, naked, have intense, sweaty sex.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON: The hard, craggy face of a powerful-looking, 
        seventy-year-old man with dark, malevolent green eyes.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



      Lucas, sleeping on the floor, lurches awake in a panic once 
      again: whoever the green-eyed man he saw in his dream is, 
      Lucas is clearly terrified of him.

      A PROGRESSION OF SHOTS reminiscent of earlier: Lucas bursts 
      out of the garage, grips the railing, gasping for air. He 
      does push-ups on the shore, then stops and sits, panting.

      He pulls from his pocket the picture of Carrie, Gordon, Deva 
      and Max and stares down at it as he catches his breath.  

      Sugar appears and crouches beside him.  As Lucas puts the 
      photo away, Sugar puts $200 on the ground between them.

                                  SUGAR
                    You don t strike me as the kind of 
                    guy who takes much advice.  But I m 
                    going to try.  That s two hundred 
                    dollars.  Take it and go.

                                  LUCAS
                    I can t.

                                  SUGAR
                          (insistent)
                    Look around you.  You re free, man!

                                  LUCAS
                    No.  I m not.

      He takes the money, grabs half of the twenties, and hands the 
      rest back to Sugar as he walks back to the garage.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    I ll pay you back in a day or so.

      Sugar shakes his head as he watches Lucas walk away.                                                                                    35.



      Dan leads Lucas inside.  It s a strange, shiny amalgam of 
      Sheriff s department and former luxury car dealership.  In 
      back, there are three free-standing holding cells.  There is 
      still one gleaming Cadillac parked in the b.g. against a 
      wall.  Two DEPUTIES sit at their desks.  They are:

      EMMETT YAWNERS (40), African-American, tall, clean-cut, built 
      like a tank.  He s doing paperwork.  The other deputy is...

      BROCK LOTUS (48), a dour, middle-aged troll of a man.  He 
      sits at his computer, clacking keys, staring at the screen. 

      Emmett stands and comes over.  Brock stays put.

                                  LUCAS
                    What s up, fellas?

                                  DAN
                    Emmett Yawners here holds the all-
                    time rushing record at Penn State.

      Lucas and Emmett shake hands.

                                  EMMETT
                    Welcome to the BSD. 

                                  DAN
                    And this is Brock Lotus. 

      Brock grudgingly stands and walks over.                                                                                    37.


                                  BROCK
                          (mutters)
                    Nice to meet you, sheriff.

      He puts extra emphasis on that last word, and flashes Dan a 
      dirty look.  The look is not lost on Lucas.

                                  DAN
                          (covering)
                    Deputy Lotus is the longest-serving 
                    member of the department. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Is that right?

      The door flies open.  In comes DEPUTY SIOBAHN KELLY, 30, a 
      sexy redhead, dragging along a surly tweaker in handcuffs.

                                    TWEAKER
                          (at Siobahn)
                    You fucking fascist!  I didn t do 
                    anything!

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Yeah, you re a model citizen.

      Siobahn wrestles the guy across the room back toward the 
      holding cells.  She spins him around against the bars.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    I m going to remove your cuffs now.  
                    If you try to fight me again, I ll 
                    remove your testicles.

      She uncuffs him, pushes him into the cell, locks him in.  As 
      she joins her colleagues, she notices Lucas.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                          (inquisitive, flirty)
                    Hey- hi.

                                  DAN
                    This is Lucas Hood.  Your new boss.

                          (at the mayor)
                    Shit, Danny, you could ve said so 
                    sooner.
                          (to Lucas)
                    Siobahn Kelly.

      She wipes her hands on her jacket, shakes hands with Lucas.                                                                                    38.


                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    You re younger than I pictured.  

                                  LUCAS
                          (eyeing the mayor)
                    There s a bit of that going around.

                                  DAN
                    Siobahn, I thought you might give 
                    the sheriff a tour of Banshee.

                                    SIOBAHN
                          (nods toward the cell)
                    I d love to, but I have to write up 
                    Charlie Sheen over there.

                                    TWEAKER (O.S.)
                          (at Siobahn)
                    Nazi twat!

                                  LUCAS
                    That s okay.  I think I d like a 
                    tour from the longest-serving 
                    member of the department anyway.

      Lucas and Brock stare at each other.  Brock grumbles, grabs 
      his radio off his desk and heads out, with Lucas behind him.



      Brock drives Lucas around the outskirts of Banshee.  They 
      pass the guarded checkpoint of a fenced in MILITARY BASE.

                                  BROCK
                          (deadpan, still pissed)
                    Camp Genoa.  Marine Base.

      They pass a stand of woods and then a metallic warehouse with 
      livestock trailers in its large parking lot/loading area.   

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    That s the slaughterhouse...

      They come to a giant modern complex that is the SENECA STAR 
      CASINO.  Brock nods at the casino. 

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    There s s the casino...there s the 
                    pawn shop.

      LUCAS S POV: A seedy pawn shop in the shadow of the casino.                                                                                    39.


      They drive into town, pull onto BROAD STREET and see a 
      commotion in the lot of PAT S LUMBER.  Four burly blue collar 
      workers have surrounded three Amish men and are preventing 
      them from loading their wagons with sheets of wood.

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    Oh shit.  Not again.

                                  LUCAS
                    What s going on?

                                  BROCK
                    The Moody boys build furniture. The 
                    Amish mills have been driving down 
                    their prices.  We ve had incidents.

      In the lumber lot, COLE MOODY (40), shoves a younger Amish 
      guy away from the lumber.  His brothers, TOM, DEX, and MARCUS 
      close ranks, as the two older Amish men attempt to reason 
      with them.

                                  LUCAS
                    They won t hit back.

                                  BROCK
                          (with contempt)
                    Terrific.  You ve seen Witness. 

      Brock parks at the curb. 

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    You d better let me handle this.

                                  LUCAS
                          (agreeable)
                    Yeah, sure, I ll just wait here.

      But then, before Brock can move, Lucas jumps out of the car, 
      strides toward the commotion.  Brock hurries after him.



      Deva, in only a bra and skirt, is making out with the 
      shirtless guy.  They re groping and going at it.  As his hand 
      starts moving under her skirt, she playfully catches it and 
      pushes him away.

                                  DEVA
                    I have to go.

      She sits up and pulls on her shirt.                                                                                    44.


                                  BOY
                    Come on.  Stay.

                                  DEVA
                          (getting out of the car)
                    I ll see you later.

      The boy climbs over to the front seat.



      Proctor steps out of a den, pulling on his jacket.  Before 
      the den door closes, we see A NAKED HOOKER sprawled across a 
      bed.  TOM BURTON, 35, Proctor s right hand man, impeccably 
      dressed in a suit and bow-tie, stands waiting for Proctor.

                                  BURTON
                    He s here.

      Proctor walks down a hallway.  Keeping pace, Burton hands him 
      a file.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    The P & Ls...

      Proctor reads as he walks, moving toward the increasingly 
      loud DIN OF WHINING SAW BLADES. 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Our numbers are down at both strip 
                    clubs?                                                                                    46.


                                  BURTON
                    Well, with the economy where it is - 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Men will pay for tits until they re 
                    broke or dead.  Fix it.

      Proctor shoves the file back at Burton as they walk through a 
      double set of safety doors into...



      A vast area where slaughtered cows are hanging from steel 
      hooks to bleed out.  WORKERS in white Hazmat-looking suits 
      and headgear are skinning the carcasses.  

      Proctor and Burton enter the room to find Cole Moody standing 
      there looking nervous.  Proctor waves at the WORKERS, who 
      turn off their saws and switch to clean-up work.  

      Burton hangs back as Proctor walks over to Moody.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    They said you wanted to see me.

                                    PROCTOR
                    First time you ve seen a 
                      slaughterhouse?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Yeah.

                                    PROCTOR
                    It s a relatively humane procedure.  
                    We stun the beasts with a pneumatic 
                    captive bolt gun - one of these. 

      He takes one of the cylindrical bolt guns off a table and 
      shows it to Moody.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    One bolt to the brain does the 
                    trick.  Then we cut them and hang 
                    them up to bleed out. 

      Moody stares at the bolt gun, wondering what the hell is up.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Listen-                                                                                    47.


                                    PROCTOR
                    -The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch 
                    don t like being called  Dutchies.   
                    It s derisive.  Like if I called 
                    you a Mick or a Kraut- which are 
                    you by the way?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Both, actually.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Okay, a mongrel then.  My point is, 
                    you called my father a fucking 
                    Dutchie.

      Moody backs away in fear, staring at the gun.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    I was just running my mouth!  I had 
                    no idea he was your father.

      Proctor waits a beat, then puts the gun down and shakes his 
      head at Moody, amused.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Relax, Moody.  It s not loaded.

      Proctor smiles.  Moody dares to appear hopeful.  Then in a 
      flash, PROCTOR GRABS MOODY BY THE NECK AND BASHES HIS FACE IN 
      WITH THE BOLT GUN. 

      As Moody goes down, Proctor plants his knee on Moody s chest, 
      and continues to violently pound his face in.  Moody screams 
      and flails as BLOOD AND TEETH FLY from his mouth.   

      Proctor stands, his own face spattered with Moody s blood. 

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (enraged)
                    Now put your fucking teeth back in 
                    your fat, bigoted mouth, and get 
                    the fuck out of here!

      On hands and knees, Moody looks around, dizzy.  He feebly 
      grabs as many teeth as he can off the bloody floor.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Back in your mouth, I said.

      Moody pops the dozen shards of teeth from his palm back into 
      his mouth, which is still gushing blood.  He gets up, mouth  
      shut tight, and stumbles toward the door.                                                                                       48.


                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (to Burton)
                    If he spits any of them out before 
                    he leaves the building, shoot him. 

      Burton nods and escorts out the reeling Moody.



      Proctor steps back into a den that is part bedroom, part 
      study.  He hangs up his jacket, his face still speckled with 
      blood.  The naked HOOKER lies on the bed reading a magazine.

                                    PROCTOR
                    I m sorry for the interruption.

      She sits up, crawls to him, reaches for his fly.  Proctor 
      stops her, opens a roll-top desk near him and takes out a 
      white Amish bonnet.  He tosses it to the hooker.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Put that on.

      She smiles gamely, puts it on, and moves to him.  She kisses 
      his blood-speckled face, then unzips and drops his pants.  
      She licks her lips and goes down on him.

      Seeing the blood on his shirt, he unbuttons it and shrugs it 
      off.  His back is covered with a huge TATTOO OF A BLOODY 
      CHRIST NAILED TO THE CROSS.  

      As the hooker s head bobs, Proctor studies his knuckles and 
      casually pulls out a shard of tooth.



      Lucas stands before a mirror, staring at himself in his new 
      Sheriff s uniform.  He pulls at the pants, which are loose.

                                    SIOBAHN (O.C.)
                    They get your size wrong?

      He turns to see her pulling on her own shirt and sees the 
      briefest flash of skin as she does, and a nasty burn scar  
      across her scapula.

                                  LUCAS
                          (bunching up the pants)
                    Nah, it s good.  

      She grabs a safety pin and comes up behind him.  

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Here, let me...

      He watches in the mirror as she kneels to pin him from 
      behind.  Her shirt is open on top, and he enjoys the view.  
      Catching him looking, she merely goes on pinning the pants.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    Bring the pants to the Martinizing, 
                    across from the Gravy Train.  
                    They ll take them in for you.

                                  LUCAS
                    I will, thanks.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    You got any family coming to the 
                      swearing-in?

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t have any family, coming or 
                    not.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Well, we ll all be there, and at 
                    Proctor s reception for you 
                    tonight.

                                  LUCAS
                      Reception?                                                                                    50.


                                    SIOBAHN
                    Say what you will about Proctor, 
                    but the man knows how to throw a 
                    party.  

      She stands, smiles at Lucas in the mirror, smooths his shirt.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    Now that s what a sheriff looks 
                    like.

      In the instant that she playfully smacks his ass, rousing 
      ROCK MUSIC begins.  She walks away and we CUT TO:



      THE ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, in full uniform with his 
      right hand raised, stands facing the robed judge, getting 
      sworn in.  Watching are his deputies, Mayor Kendall, Gordon 
      Hopewell, and three Amish elders, including Israel Proctor.



      THE MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, Emmett, and the PAWN SHOP OWNER - 
      50s, decrepit - standing side by side, can be seen through a 
      large, blown-out hole in the wall, staring at where the safe 
      used to be.



      Deva sits on Max s bed with him, playing God of War with him 
      on PlayStation.  On the bedside table are an array of pill 
      containers, and on the floor is a standing oxygen tank.

      Carrie, dressed up in a black cocktail dress, comes in.                                                                                    51.


                                  CARRIE
                    Max, did you take your meds?

                                  MAX
                    Yes.  Where are you and Dad going?

                                  CARRIE
                    Your dad just has to show his face 
                    at a party for the new Sheriff.

      She lifts a clear oxygen mask off the night table, holds it 
      toward her son.  Max wilts at the sight of it. 

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Just for an hour.  Deva will take 
                    it off at nine.

      Max takes the mask, puts it on.  Deva helps him adjust it.  
      Carrie kisses them both.

      Deva nods and Carrie leaves.  After a beat, Deva turns to 
      Max, who s already pulling off his mask.  She waits until 
      it s off.

                                  DEVA
                    You ready?

                                  MAX
                    Bring it!

      They continue playing.



      Sugar picks up the baseball bat in his front hall and moves 
      into the house, scowling.

                                  SUGAR
                    Who s in here?!

      He turns into his kitchen, and stops.  On his kitchen table 
      are five twenty dollar bills held down by the CRUISERWEIGHT 
        CHAMPIONSHIP BELT last seen hanging in the pawn shop.  Sugar 
      lifts the belt, running his fingers over it emotionally.  He 
      looks toward the front door and smiles.                                                                                     56.



      A cavernous old tavern.  In the room s middle is a bar and 
      all around the bar are small tables, some of which hold chess 
      boards.  A bartender polishes glasses.

      There are four older men, each alone at his own table in 
      front of a chess board.  Each smokes and drinks whiskey.  
      Each also wears a black suit and a white shirt.

      Pacing between the men, glancing at the chess boards, is the 
      malevolent man we saw for a second in Lucas s dream. He is...

      MR. RABBIT, 70, a gangster with a full head of white hair and 
      a large, powerful frame.  His face is craggy, creased, with 
      piercing green eyes.  He is the same man that Lucas saw in 
      his dream earlier.  

      Widow s Peak stands waiting.  The bartender looks up at him, 
      takes an extra moment to register something about his face.  
      Mr. Rabbit slowly makes his way around the bar.  One of the 
      chess players moves a piece, then speaks quietly: 

                                  FIRST CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                          (Ukrainian accent)
                    Yours-

      Rabbit never even looks at the board.

                                  MR. RABBIT
                          (Ukrainian accent)
                    Knight to Rook Four.

      He reaches Widow s Peak, studies his face for a moment.

                                  SECOND CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                    Yours-

                                  MR. RABBIT
                    Pishak to Queen Three. 

      We slowly pull around to see the left side of Widow s Peak s 
      face, which has been badly burned.  Gleaming in his wrecked 
      eye socket is a completely black, brushed metallic orb.                                                                                     60.


                                  MR. RABBIT (CONT D)
                    So, no documents.  No software, no 
                    hardware, nothing.  Everything at 
                    this hairdresser s - burned.    

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Yes. 

                                  THIRD CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                    Yours-

                                  MR. RABBIT
                          (eyes on Widow s Peak)
                    Queen to Knight Two.  Check mate.

      Third Chess-Playing Man swears under his breath in the b.g.

      A beat passes.  Rabbit fixes Widow s Peak with a gaze that 
      could bore through the core of the Earth.

                                  MR. RABBIT (CONT D)
                    You will find them both.  Quickly.

      CLOSE ON: Rabbit s craggy face, simmering with rage.

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.
