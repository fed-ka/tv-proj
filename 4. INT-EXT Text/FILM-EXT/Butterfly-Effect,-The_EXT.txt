A playground. Evan's father, JASON (23), puts a 1-year old
on a slide.
A birthday party for LENNY, 5, a chubby kid with only a few
friends. Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward
KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair.
Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and
kisses his cheek.
He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg.
END MONTAGE & TITLES.
In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky
cocker spaniel puppy.
Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on
the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he
watches his mother work.
ANDREA
Okay, okay... what now?
Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench
from the toolbox.
EVAN
We're gonna be late again.
ANDREA
When did you ever care about getting
to school on time?
EVAN
We're putting up pictures for Parent's
Night.
Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt.
EVAN
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
ANDREA
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll
have plenty of time.
The carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with
the wrench.
ANDREA
(re: carb)
Darn it!
EVAN
Um... can dad come this time?
ANDREA
(getting impatient)
You know the answer to that.
EVAN
Can't he come out for one day?
ANDREA
We've been over this a hundred times.
It's too dangerous for him.
EVAN
But Lenny said that his dad's
coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's
dad...
Andrea hands the wrench to Evan.
ANDREA
Here, Ev... Finish this up for me.
Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb
back together.
Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a
spotless nurse's uniform underneath.
EVAN
All the dads are gonna be there.
ANDREA
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not
so bad, am I?
EVAN
No.
ANDREA
Good. Because I've been waiting to
see your art projects all week and
I'd feel terrible if all you thought
about was your father not being there.
Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.
EVAN
(beat)
Done. Try it.
Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the
engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.
ANDREA
You're amazing, kiddo.
Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main
doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on
the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks
her watch.
ANDREA
Okay have a great day I love you
I'll pick you up later gotta go...
Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school.
As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.
MRS. BOSWELL
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with
you!
ANDREA
I'm sorry, but can it wait til
tonight? I'm already late for work --
Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.
MRS. BOSWELL
I think you really need to see this.
Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot
even start the car.
Gothic. Imposing. Andrea runs up the stairs.
The looming building looks even more frightening at night.
Andrea and Evan head up the stairs.
EVAN
I don't like this place, Mom. It's
creepy. Please can we go? I promise
I won't make any more bad pictures!
ANDREA
(lighthearted)
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just
wants to give you some tests. You'll
like him.
Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE
MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile.
He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan.
MR. MILLER
Hey, Andrea.
(to Evan)
Hello little man.
Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets
out.
ANDREA
Thanks a lot George. Here's my work
number in case there are any problems.
MR. MILLER
(lighthearted laughter)
Whaddaya kidding? We're going to
have a great time today, right Evan?
Andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away. Evan walks up
to Mr. Miller and momentarily reaches for his hand. Mr. Miller
flinches his hand away and chuckles at Evan.
MR. MILLER
You waiting for an invitation? The
kids are inside.
Evan appears confused for a moment at Mr. Miller's unexpected
rudeness, but walks inside.
Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being
lowered into the ground. Andrea's tears soak through her
veil. A few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan.
PRIEST
Ashes to ashes... dust to dust.
Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight.
Kayleigh steps up to Evan and takes his hand. A moment. And
she softly whispers in Evan's ear.
KAYLEIGH
You're better off anyway.
A rumble of thunder. Evan looks up at the brooding dark
clouds.
Gray skies. Andrea drives the children home. Evan stares at
the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket
fence. The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a
white blur is hypnotic.
SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:
Bright and sunny. The lawn freshly cut. A Toro lawnmower has
been carelessly left in the grass-strewn driveway.
TITLE: SIX YEARS LATER
CRANE DOWN to the window of the --
Tommy leads Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny on a mission through
the woods. Everyone smokes except Lenny, yet he's the only
one who's wheezing. He pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff.
LENNY
Guys, slow up, would you?
KAYLEIGH
Evan, did I tell you? My mother said
I might be able to visit her this
summer in Orlando with her new family.
TOMMY
What did I say about mentioning that
bitch?
KAYLEIGH
(uncomfortable)
Where the hell are you taking us
anyway? Just blow something up
already.
TOMMY
Just blow something up? Are you nuts?
There's an art to mass destruction.
Would you just paint the Mona Lisa?
No. Besides, we're here already.
Now at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots:
A MAILBOX sits at the end of the driveway. It's exquisite.
An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves.
Across the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny.
TOMMY
Here you go, buddy.
LENNY
(recoiling)
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not
touching that thing.
TOMMY
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us
does it, you'll puss out and narc
for sure.
LENNY
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small that fuse is! I'll
get killed.
EVAN
Not necessarily.
All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks
off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end.
EVAN
That should buy you ten minutes at
least.
LENNY
Gee, thanks friend.
Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox,
desperately trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice
his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods,
the other kids watch anxiously.
TOMMY
Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it,
Lenny.
Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox. Then sprints
like hell to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and
hands it to him when he gets back.
LENNY
(taking puff)
Thanks.
Evan pats Lenny on the back.
EVAN
You got balls, man.
The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan
smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips
and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back
at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches
this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to --
The mailbox. Tick-tock... tick-tock... It's like a staring
contest...
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place.
He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground. Lenny,
falling on top of him.
TOMMY
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan!
Come on!
EVAN
(frantic)
What happened?? Where are we?!
Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being
followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying
him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles
back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through
the woods as fast as they can.
KAYLEIGH
(crying)
Oh God... what did we do?
EVAN
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you!
We've gotta get help!
SMASH CUT TO:
Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house. Lenny's
mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance.
As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her
an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face.
Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop.
ANDREA
What is it? What happened?
TOMMY
(staring menacingly
at the others)
We were just building a fort in the
woods when Lenny freaked out. One
minute he was fine, then he just
froze up. Right guys?
ANDREA
What happened, Evan? The truth.
EVAN
I don't know... I don't remember.
ANDREA
Something must've happened! What set
him off?
EVAN
I... I blacked out.
ANDREA
(building frustration)
Don't try to use your blackouts to
get out of this one!
Evan looks helpless.
ANDREA
You're not making this up, are you?
Evan shakes his head "no". Almost ashamed...
DISSOLVE TO:
Andrea drops off Evan, Kayleigh and Tommy outside the complex.
Kayleigh, looking morose, shuts the car door and Andrea drives
off. They walk through the parking lot.
TOMMY
(to Kayleigh)
Wipe that sad-assed look off your
face before you get us all busted.
You see the way Evan's mom was looking
at you?
KAYLEIGH
I'm sorry.
EVAN
Would someone just tell me already
what the hell happened in the mailbox?
On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES
him against a parked car. Tommy looks around to make sure
nobody heard anything.
TOMMY
Don't ever bring that shit up again.
Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh,
or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he
ever learns to talk again. Understand?
Evan nods, scared. Tommy gives a final shove.
TOMMY
Ever.
(re: Kayleigh)
She don't want to talk about it,
anyway. Do you Kayleigh?
Tommy's right. Kayleigh clearly doesn't.
A "For Sale" sign is now planted on the front lawn. Andrea,
in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car.
Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house.
EVAN
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed
at me. He knows I'm moving away,
right?
KAYLEIGH
He's been acting real strange lately.
He won't even look me in the eyes
anymore.
EVAN
Duck, here they come.
As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh
duck in nearby bushes.
KAYLEIGH
Did your mom say if Lenny was...
okay?
EVAN
He must be. They're letting him go,
right?
The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Evan puts
on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window.
EVAN
Welcome home, Lenny!
Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror. Mrs. Kagan looks
angry as she rolls the window down.
MRS. KAGAN
I think your little homecoming's in
bad taste.
The smile fades from Evan's face. Kayleigh hangs back.
EVAN
Sorry?
MRS. KAGAN
(acidic)
Lenny's been through a hell of an
ordeal no thanks to you.
Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up
and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage.
Evan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis.
EVAN
(quietly)
Welcome home. Thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.
KAYLEIGH
Hi, Lenny.
Lenny twitches ever-so-slightly.
LENNY
Is Tommy with you guys?
Evan shakes his head "no".
EVAN
It's cool.
Lenny looks back at the model airplane. Needs to think.
Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods.
KAYLEIGH
(to Lenny)
So what did you do in there?
LENNY
It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause
everyone's screaming all night long.
I never want to go back.
As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column
of smoke billowing in the horizon.
KAYLEIGH
Do you see that?
Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously
follows behind.
They exit the woods to find:
Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses
with lighter fluid.
Next to a campfire.
EVAN
Crockett!!
Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog.
Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks
up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last
minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head.
Knocking her unconscious.
TOMMY
Look what you made me do!
EVAN
What's wrong with you?!
Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's
knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the
ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett
squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.
Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart
from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped
in the tied gunny sack.
EVAN
Kayleigh! Wake up!
No response.
TOMMY
Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince
Charming!
Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from
the campfire to the fluid soaked dog.
As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands
up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED --
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. Still in running mode.
His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he
is now lying face down on the ground.
Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly
bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.
EVAN
How long was I out?
He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same
spot. Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh
weeping. Evan spins to face her.
EVAN
Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's
Crockett?
Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to
answer through her tears. Evan struggles to rise but he
becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground.
Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering
then moans and buries his head in his hands.
A small neighborhood CROWD has gathered to watch an ambulance
with the SUNNYVALE insignia take an entranced Lenny away.
Mrs. Kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and
turns to Evan.
MRS. KAGAN
(ice cold)
Do you know what you are? A monster.
Evan stands there, speechless.
A packed U-HAUL sits in front of Evan's house. Andrea shifts
the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out.
Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling
shamelessly down her cheeks. Evan reaches behind his seat
and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past
journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and
writes something.
Finished he presses the journal to the window.
EVAN'S DIARY
"I'll come back for you."
Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his
own tears as she fades into the distance.
When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to
see what he's written.
ANDREA
I'm sorry.
Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
Evan bikes past students.
Evan bikes past some obnoxious GREEKS.
Evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside.
Evan is THIRTEEN again. The scene begins exactly where Evan's
blackout occurred as a child. Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh
unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight
of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack. And Evan, seething
with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy
at full speed.
Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.
EVAN
What the hell is going on?
Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and
swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling
backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.
Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan
writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves
toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the
rope that traps Crockett inside.
LENNY
I can't undo the rope!
Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.
TOMMY
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's
throat in her sleep.
As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told. His eyes begin
to glaze over.
Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of
strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.
EVAN
I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!
Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back,
breaking Evan's grip.
Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.
Tommy's voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up
frustration.
TOMMY
Listen to me good, Evan. There's a
million other sisters in the world.
You didn't have to fuck with mine.
Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy
pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the
campfire to the soaked gunny sack.
WHOOSH OF FLAMES
And Evan passes out.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Very
little has changed in the past seven years.
Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the
mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.
When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently
drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt,
SMOLDERING.
The mailbox... tick-tock, tick-tock... Like a staring contest.
LENNY
Maybe it went out. Should someone
check it?
TOMMY
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls
into the driveway.
MRS. HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of
the car and walks to the mailbox.
Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of
Lenny's shoulder.
TOMMY
Make one peep and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.
Tommy's words make Evan flinch. From inside the car, a BABY
begins to cry. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.
Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in
pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the
lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing
a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.
MRS. HALPERN
How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need
a change, don't you honey?
Mrs. Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. As
the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids
break into wide smiles of relief. But wait...
The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to
the mailbox. Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling.
MRS. HALPERN
You want to open the door, honey?
The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment --
ANGLE ON KIDS' FACES
BOOM!!!
The blast is deafening. Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the
results in stunned horror.
TOMMY
C'mon! Run!!
Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run
a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them.
TOMMY
Lenny? Come on!
KAYLEIGH
Oh my God oh my God...
Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson
road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to
make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply
against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin
to run with Lenny through the woods.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a
piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.
Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she
exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first,
but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her
face and she allows herself to be hugged.
KAYLEIGH
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see
you again. How've you been?
EVAN
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
KAYLEIGH
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a
long time. Fill me in.
EVAN
I'm going to State now. Things are
going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches
into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.
EVAN
(declining)
Not since we were kids.
KAYLEIGH
I've stopped a hundred times.
EVAN
So how's Tommy?
KAYLEIGH
(takes a long drag)
They kept him in juvy for a few years.
Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.
EVAN
You still live with your dad?
Her face is betrayed by a slight tick.
KAYLEIGH
No. I emancipated myself when I was
fifteen.
EVAN
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
KAYLEIGH
Not if you remember my dad.
EVAN
Couldn't you have moved in with your
mom?
KAYLEIGH
(shaking her head)
She had a new family. Not enough
space for me. Said I should have
moved in with her when we were kids.
But... whatever.
They walk in silence for a moment.
EVAN
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I
came back to town was to talk to
you.
KAYLEIGH
(brightening)
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
EVAN
Remember when I was a kid I had all
these blackouts?
KAYLEIGH
Of course.
EVAN
Well, lately some of the memories
have begun to come back and I'd kinda
like to talk to you about one of
them in particular. It'd be a big
help.
KAYLEIGH
Well, sure. I'll try to remember.
Shoot.
EVAN
When we were kids. Your dad was making
a movie. Robin Hood or something?
KAYLEIGH
(cold)
What do you want to know, Evan?
EVAN
It's just... did he... what happened
in the basement?
KAYLEIGH
It was a long time ago.
EVAN
I know, but...
KAYLEIGH
(cold)
Is that why you came all the way
back? To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?
EVAN
No, but I think something really bad
might've happened to us.
Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette.
KAYLEIGH
Is there a point to any of this?
Evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. He
steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face. She
flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.
EVAN
Whatever happened, it wasn't our
fault. You know we couldn't have
stopped it.
Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow.
EVAN
Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like
bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't
spoken to you in seven years...
She moves her face away from his hand.
EVAN
But you were seven years old and
there's nothing you could've done to
deserve...
Her face collapses and she turns away.
KAYLEIGH
(defeated)
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting
your breath.
EVAN
You can't hate yourself just because
your dad's a twisted freak.
KAYLEIGH
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?!
You come all the way out here to
stir up my shit just because you had
a bad memory!? You want me to cry on
your shoulder and tell you that
everything's all better now? Well
fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be
all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets
better!
Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan.
KAYLEIGH
If I was so wonderful, Evan, why
didn't you ever call me? Why'd you
leave me here to rot?!
She turns and runs away. Evan looks sick with guilt.
A few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash. Evan, tired and
depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn
scar on his belly. Contemplating...
Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of
the cemetery. A small cluster of friends and family gather
at the grave. Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking
to the grave. When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.
Evan's hands tense up into fists. He becomes weak in the
knees and stops walking. After an uncomfortable moment of
standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the
ceremony from the driver's seat.
DISSOLVE TO:
The last of the mourners are filing away. Evan exits his car
and walks to the deserted grave. He drops the roses on the
casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.
Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper.
He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:
EVAN'S DIARY
"I'll come back for you."
Evan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon.
Kayleigh pushes Evan on a tire swing.
Burning sack in flames.
QUICK FLASH of the U-Haul driving away.
At thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and
runs into Evan's arms.
Still thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house,
Kayleigh riding on the handlebars.
More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen
years, they grow up as lovers now:
Evan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat.
Evan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom.
BACK TO:
Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches
the eye of every guy on campus. She and Evan stroll arm in
arm through the quad.
Somehow, the world seems brighter now. Even the colors seem
more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world
we've known.
MANY STUDENTS wave to Evan and call his name. He can't
remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the BMOC.
Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.
EVAN
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me
over this, but do you remember when
your dad first got his video camera?
KAYLEIGH
Well I remember he had one... but
he, like, put it away after the first
day. Why would that freak me out?
EVAN
I dunno.
(goofy smile)
Just being weird.
Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the
ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.
KAYLEIGH
Such a goofus. See you tonight.
Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away.
After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself.
The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their
clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.
Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon
on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as
a hat.
EVAN
Order, order. So all you rushes know
what you've got to do for me?
THETA CHI PLEDGE
(correcting him)
Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir.
EVAN
Pledges, rushees, same difference.
Now this is a one-time deal. You do
all this for me and I'll never give
you shit again. Promise.
A buzz of excitement runs through the pledges.
DISSOLVE TO:
The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh
and Evan. Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:
The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese
lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant
romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY
DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully
stare ahead with the utmost class.
Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by.
Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.
KAYLEIGH
I don't know what to say. It's
beautiful.
EVAN
Go on. Sit down.
As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower
down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing
on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.
Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.
KAYLEIGH
Why are you doing all this for me?
EVAN
Simple math. When I woke up this
morning and saw your smile... I knew
that I wanted to spend the rest of
my life with you.
Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes
tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.
And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it
might as well be their first ever --
Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.
HUNTER
We been lookin' all over for you,
man.
SENIOR BROTHER
Someone trashed your car.
The moment's gone. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.
Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked
at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.
Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass.
The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been
mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the
roof.
The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG
COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.
By now a crowd has gathered. Evan runs up to people.
EVAN
(panicked)
Did you see who did this? You see
anyone?
No one will answer with anything more than a shrug.
HUNTER
Probably them Pika fuckers.
But Kayleigh knows better. She stares at the collar.
EVAN
How could he get away with this?
Right in front of the goddamn frat
house!
A SENIOR BROTHER angrily calls him from the lawn.
SENIOR BROTHER
Frat house? Hey man, would you call
your "country" a "cunt"?
Kayleigh shudders and Evan puts his arms around her.
KAYLEIGH
Don't. He's probably watching.
Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus.
Evan seems especially paranoid. In the distance, some guy
vomits loudly.
KAYLEIGH
Are you okay?
EVAN
What do you mean?
KAYLEIGH
It's just... you've been acting kinda
strange, you know?
EVAN
Like how?
KAYLEIGH
I don't know. You seem... different.
You make weird jokes. Your accents
changed. You don't even walk the
same.
EVAN
I walk differently?
KAYLEIGH
I can't put my finger on it, but
everything's a bit off. Even the
dinner tonight. It was beautiful,
but...
EVAN
I know I've been actin strange lately.
It's just that... I don't want
anything to happen to us.
The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. Kayleigh
and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's
ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.
KAYLEIGH
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't
that your jacket?
EVAN
What?
The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs
to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.
KAYLEIGH
Tommy.
Tommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy
hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short,
steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.
Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat
pockets.
EVAN
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
TOMMY
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna
lay a hand on my own sister. You've
done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice
friends, nice life, not to mention
you're fucking my sister. Not a bad
piece of ass if I say so myself.
KAYLEIGH
Shut up, Tommy!
TOMMY
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper.
EVAN
What the hell are you doing?
TOMMY
It wasn't enough that the whole world
loves you, but you had to take away
the last person on earth who didn't
think I was a piece of shit.
EVAN
(suppressing panic)
No one thinks you're a piece of shit,
Tommy.
TOMMY
Right, Evan. I believe you just said
"sick fuck."
Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in
the shoulder and ribs.
Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in,
Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.
Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free
hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy,
keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray.
Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly
swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an
uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands
and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open
mouth.
KAYLEIGH
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
EVAN
He's a fucking maniac!
Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper. Kayleigh screams
and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of
her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.
EVAN
He ruined Lenny's life --
Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Kayleigh pushes a button
on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.
EVAN
He killed Crockett --
(kicks him)
Murdered that woman and her baby!
(kicks again)
And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh!
He's trying to fucking kill me!
Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings
down OFF CAMERA.
CRUNCH!
Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified.
Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops
cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.
Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still
terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a
crablike fashion.
SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's
limp body.
Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.
DISSOLVE TO:
A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of
the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along
with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.
Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other
prisoners working out.
Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him
from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a
white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.
Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ
tattoos all over Carlos' back.
EVAN
You're religious Carlos, you believe
that bit about "the Lord works in
mysterious ways?"
CARLOS
Straight up.
EVAN
Because I think he sent me to your
cell on purpose. For you to help me.
CARLOS
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
EVAN
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks
to me in my dreams.
Carlos scoffs whatever.
EVAN
Pack of smokes says I can prove it
to you.
Carlos is suddenly interested.
Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles
at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated.
A sinister victory smile.
EVAN
Rot in hell you fucking animals.
Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take.
Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his
bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.
EVAN
Wait. Before we --
He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an
awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine
young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering
before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.
Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.
EVAN
We need something to cut open the
sack!
Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.
Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a
razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers
it to Lenny.
EVAN
I want you to take this, Lenny.
Today's your day of atonement. I
know how guilty you feel about that
woman and her baby --
KAYLEIGH
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
EVAN
(frantic)
Now's the only time!
(to Lenny)
Today you get a chance to redeem
yourself. Start over with a clean
slate. Tabula rasa --
LENNY
What are you talking about?
KAYLEIGH
You're acting crazy!
EVAN
(desperate; to Lenny)
Please. If you've ever trusted me
before, trust me on this one.
Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.
EVAN
Cut the rope.
Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.
Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches,
eyes watering from pent up frustration.
TOMMY
Listen to me good, Evan...
EVAN
I'll do whatever you want. You don't
want me to ever see Kayleigh again,
fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides,
you kill him now and they'll stick
you in juvy for sure. And I know
you'd never leave your sister alone
with your father.
Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A
look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.
Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes
screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of
the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way
through Tommy's throat!
Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys
the scene in shock:
EVAN
Oh fuck, Lenny, no!
Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in
his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and
SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat.
Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.
EVAN'S POV
Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as
if operating a jack-hammer.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Memories of Evan's vandalized car fade to BLACK and WHITE
and dissipate.
Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops
himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the
entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale.
JOURNAL ENTRY
"Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is
crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."
Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading.
EVAN
(as if reciting a
mantra)
Today I get to meet my father. His
name is Jason and he is crazy...
Evan gets some strange looks, but continues. As he does, the
trees and frisbee-playing students behind him VIBRATE and
SHUDDER.
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he
realizes his surroundings. Heartbroken, he shuts the journal
and stands up shakily.
Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated
mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off
the sides of the house. Inside, Mr. Miller yells at someone.
MR. MILLER
Just shut the hell up already! Can't
a man get a little goddman peace in
his own home!
(Evan rings doorbell)
Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?
Mr. Miller opens the door and sees Evan.
MR. MILLER
Don't suppose you're here to sell
cookies?
In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves
him through the house and into a wall.
EVAN
Good guess, fuckbag.
(off Miller's startled
face)
Remember me now? We had a great chat
once when I was seven.
Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror.
EVAN
One question, fuckbag. Where can I
find your daughter?
Evan walks past some junkies and enters.
Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen --
watch Mrs. Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across
the street with intense anticipation. Evan suddenly comes to
life and makes himself visible, running across the street
shouting.
EVAN
Lady, stay back! Don't go near the
mailbox!
Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically
as she absently continues toward the mailbox.
EVAN
I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!
Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and
Tommy shrugs and follows after him.
LENNY
There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get
away!
Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid
confession and rolls his eyes at the situation. Evan positions
himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically
waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's STILL
COMING.
TOMMY
I'll save you lady!
Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit
too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt,
but no major injuries.
Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail --
BOOM!
The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards
dramatically.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Tommy pushes Evan to church.
Lenny and Kayleigh, as teens, sit together with Evan at the
far end of the boat.
A campfire. Evan sips from a BEER CAP as Lenny and Kayleigh
make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.
BACK TO EVAN:
It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair
around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE
call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world.
LENNY
'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the
party! Don't even think I'm giving
you my lab notes either! Think I
like getting up for "eight thirty's"?
Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation
stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by.
Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.
LENNY
Hey, there's Tommy.
Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and
handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus
Crusade for Christ." Tommy seems good-natured now, working
hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan
rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.
TOMMY
I did what you said, man! We're
pooling our student funds with Hillel
House and we're going to have an
Awareness Dance.
EVAN
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my
chair around to a techno mix of Hava
Nagila til I puke.
Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs
and nods back to him.
LENNY
Uh, we should be getting to class
now.
EVAN
Forget it. What's the point of Psych
now? Tomorrow I could wake up as
some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan.
KAYLEIGH
Let's go for a stroll.
Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To
the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.
Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically"
will to open, close, open, close...
EVAN
So Tommy's really into this Jesus
kick, huh?
Kayleigh looks at him curiously.
KAYLEIGH
You know how spiritual he's gotten
ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and
Katie.
EVAN
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the
twisted fuck.
Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually
uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a
granola bar and hands it to him.
His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She
seems more confused.
KAYLEIGH
Is something the matter?
EVAN
(re: prosthetic arms)
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed
or something.
She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.
EVAN
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about
"us?" I mean, wonder if it could
ever have been different between the
two of us?
KAYLEIGH
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the
first person I really ever cared
about.
EVAN
I was?
KAYLEIGH
That's why when I was little I never
went to live with my mother.
EVAN
I don't get it.
KAYLEIGH
(feeding another bite)
When my folks split, they gave me
and Tommy a choice who we wanted to
live with. I couldn't stand my dad,
but I knew if I moved to my mom's
I'd never see you again.
EVAN
I never knew that. So then you still
sometimes think of us... together?
KAYLEIGH
It's crossed my mind from time to
time.
EVAN
(hopeful)
And...?
KAYLEIGH
Well a lot of things cross my mind.
I've always been a fast thinker, Ev.
I can play out the movie of our entire
lives in under a second. Boom -- we
fall in love -- get married -- two
kids, your keen analytical insight
matched to my generous nature --
kids grow old as do we, relatively
stable relationships, matching burial
plots, the whole bit. It took a lot
longer to spit out than to imagine.
EVAN
Then you think it might have worked
out?
KAYLEIGH
Why not? But that's not how things
wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's
your friend. And there it ends.
She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically.
Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading
tone.
EVAN
Would it make any difference if I
told you that no one could possibly
love anyone as much as I love you?
Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan
turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on
Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.
Evan can't take his eyes off her.
ANGLE ON
Lenny kissing Kayleigh. In painful slo-mo. Evan turns away,
utterly heartbroken.
BOOM! The blast is deafening.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. He's unexpectedly
gently prodded forward by Andrea.
ANDREA
Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.
Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five. She smiles
bashfully at him. An old memory comes back to him.
KAYLEIGH (V.O.)
When my folks split, they gave me
and Tommy a choice who we wanted to
live with. I couldn't stand my dad,
but I knew if I lived with my mom,
I'd never see you again...
Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of
this distant memory.
He even inhales the aroma of the place. Savoring the moment.
He locks eyes with Kayleigh.
ANDREA (O.S.)
He's not usually this shy.
It's time. Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to
kiss her. Then whispers in her ear:
EVAN
I hate you. If you ever come near me
again, I'll kill you and your whole
family.
Kayleigh reacts predictably. Bursting into tears and runs
into Kayleigh's mother's arms.
KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER
What did you say to her? What
happened?!
Evan ignores them. He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh.
EVAN
Goodbye.
His eyes well up.
FLASH!
SMASH CUT TO:
Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell
phone to his ear.
TITLE CARD: YEARS LATER
EVAN
(into phone)
Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late
for lunch. One of my patients had a
breakdown. Anyway, order some soup
in the meantime. See ya soon.
As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit
approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely,
but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.
He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her
eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's
no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down
the sidewalk.
After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and
follows her.
FADE TO BLACK.
Roll credits...
