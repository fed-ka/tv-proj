    THE SCREEN STROBES BLACK, WHITE, BLACK, WHITE.  In each of

                        I love the night.  The stillness of my 
                        dreamless sleep.

    INT. DEXTER S BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 - (JUST HOURS AFTER 201 ENDED)

    Shooting through the CEILING FAN down to Dexter in bed.  
    He s awake.  Wide awake.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                          ...usually...

    The fan s THRUPPING becomes the SOUND OF A HEART BEATING.  
    He puts his hand on his heart.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I ve got a hamster wheel spinning in 
                        here.  Okay, then.  Waiting for 
                        Morpheus.  Here we go.  

    He waits.  Fidgets.  Waits some more.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Counting sheep...  Lullaby and

    EXT. EAST KENDALL STREET - DAY 233

    A fully involved Homicide Scene.  Our cops doing their 
    thing.  Angry on-lookers staring them down.  

    DEXTER PARKS HIS GREY TAURUS next to a Fire Truck.  He gets 
    out with his kit, looks around.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Back in the belly of the beast.  
                        Little Chino s home turf.  Riskier 
                        than I d like...

    He pulls a Miami Metro cap low over his forehead. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        But duty calls. 

    He scooches under the yellow perimeter tape.  BATISTA and 
    MASUKA fall into step.

                                        MASUKA
                        Eight confirmed.

                                        DEXTER
                        Eight confirmed... here?

                                        BATISTA
                        No, here it s just one.

                                        MASUKA
                        I m talking eight confirmed victims of 
                        the Bay Harbor Butcher.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                              (a sigh)
                        My beautiful bodies of work.

                        Bay Harbor Butcher?

                                        MASUKA
                        That s what the press is calling 
                        whoever dumped those bodies offshore.  
                        Has a nice ring to it, no?

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, it s a little... lurid.

                                        BATISTA
                        Lurid and possibly wrong.  Part of me 
                        is hoping they found the Ice Truck 
                        Killer s dumping ground.DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      3.

                        Tell me about it.  Last thing Miami 
                        needs is another serial killer.

    DEXTER KNEELS NEXT TO A BODY.  Batista raises the tarp.  
    It s EVA ARENAS (201).  Badly hacked-up.  Dexter can t help 
    but be a little fascinated.  Batista s disgusted. 

                                        DEXTER
                        Death by machete... again.

                                        BATISTA
                        Eva Arenas.  All she wanted was 
                        justice against the 29th Street Kings 
                        for whacking her son.  
                                (shakes his head)
                        First she was the messenger...

    DOAKES COMES UP.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        ... now she s the goddamn message.

                                        BATISTA
                        I got a B.O.L.O. out on Little Chino.  
                        Gang Crash Unit.  Local patrol.  
                        Everyone s looking for that carajo.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Last thing I want is for the cops to 
                        bring Little Chino in.  He s mine.

                                        DEXTER
                        Here s hoping.

    He stares at the body - almost remorseful.  

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Why don t you take a picture, Morgan.  
                        It ll last longer.  

    Dexter snaps out of his reverie and raises his camera.  

                                        DEXTER

    JOEY NUNEZ (14, full of swagger) sidles forward.

                        She s saying you fucking cops don t do

    And he s gone, weaving through the crowd.  Debra s steamed.

    DEXTER opens his kit and goes to work.  Debra storms up.

                                        DEBRA
                        Fucking people don t want our help.

    Debra peers at the body, recoils in recognition.

                        What?  I m so over that.

    She goes off, anything but over that.  We follow her past 
    PASCAL in her car.  She s on the phone, in a seething 
    conversation.  LAGUERTA taps on her window.  Pascal lowers 
    it, clearly stressed.  Says into her cell --

    Pascal s eyes fill with gratitude. She glances off to Debra.

    DEXTER PHOTOGRAPHS Eva s body.  

    A Woman in a  Child Services  windbreaker passes by the 
    perimeter tape.  She s carrying Eva's daughter MARISSA (201) 
    in her arms.  Marissa s eyes lock on Dexter.

                        have happened.

    Looking from beneath the bill of his cap, he squints into 
    the crowd.  Eerily silhouetted faces glare back.

                        And I wouldn t be exposed like this.

    Firemen train their hoses on the blood left behind by Eva's 
    body.  Dexter watches as the diluted red stream slides 
    toward the storm drain, where it ripples past yellow 
    perimeter tape and drops from sight.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I ve gotta find Chino, before he finds

                                        MATTHEWS (V.O.)
                         I want to assure the citizens of 
                        Miami that whoever committed these 
                        dreadful crimes will be brought to the 
                        swiftest and harshest justice. 

    Dexter reacts.

                                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        So far authorities have no clue as to 
                        who that criminal might be.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        And I have no clue as to why I m going 
                        through this time-warp mind-trip.  Got 
                        to stay focussed.

    He looks off to a street corner where a group of Gang 
    Bangers hang.  Surly, smoking, drinking, staring back at 
    him.

    Suddenly, a ribbon of light bounces off his rearview and 
    slashes across his eyes.  Dexter adjusts the mirror.  As he 
    does, the trailing car s headlights go out.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Shit.  Little Chino.  He did see me.  
                        Timing could be better.  That, plus I 
                        don t have my tools, but... 

    He swerves into an alley, swings to a stop; blocking it.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        ... it does give me the chance to tie 
                        up one massive loose end.  

    He grabs his Taser and a longneck Mag-light, jumps out and 
    strides toward the trailing car as it screeches up.  Dexter 
    hefts the Mag-light, about to demolish the driver s window, 
    when it abruptly powers down to reveal... Doakes.  DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      8.

                        Go ahead.  Try it.  I ve been waiting.

    They lock gazes for a beat.  Then Dexter heads for his car.

    INT. DEXTER S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING (DAY 3)66

    Dexter sits at his meticulously uncluttered desk, watching 
    news video of the body recovery process on his laptop.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        This is quickly losing its appeal.

    Debra enters, fully dressed, towelling off her hair.

    Debra opens the fridge, pulls out the OJ and chugs.

    DEBRA TOSSES HER TOWEL onto the floor; looks over Dexter s 
    shoulder, while taking another swig of OJ.

                        hour.  See you at the job.

    And she s gone.  Dexter picks up the OJ.  It left a ring on 
    his desk.  He practices a smile. Then, dripping with irony --  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

    His cell phone rings.  The readout:   Rita .  INTERCUT (INT.

                        What fucking asshole left this here?

    She kicks the briefcase into a wall.  Beat.  Liquid starts 
    leaking out.  Lundy enters from his office; retrieves the 
    dripping briefcase and holds it over a waste basket.

                        It s Special Agent fucking asshole.

    He opens the briefcase, drops his broken thermos into the 
    trash and shakes out his soggy paperwork.  Lundy looks to 
    Debra, his old-soldier eyes crinkling.

    EXT. DEXTER S APARTMENT - MORNING (DAY 4)2626

    Dexter, looking like hell after his night in hell, hustles 
    toward his front door.  He s covered in dirt and grime.

                        Please, Deb, don t be home.  I can t

    Rita, wearing a simple black dress, comes from around the 
    corner.  Dexter sags as she takes in his ragged appearance.

    Wrong thing to say, kid.  Debra jams her gun into his neck.

                        What do you want?

    Debra, her finger twitching on the trigger, shrieks at Joey.

                                        DEBRA
                        WHAT DO I WANT?  I WANT TO PUT A 
                        BULLET IN YOUR BRAIN!

    In the face of such unbridled intensity, Joey crumbles.

                        shit... Please don t shoot me, Miss!

    His adolescent terror snaps Debra back to her senses.  
    Jesus, she almost shot this kid.  She withdraws her pistol 
    from Joey s neck and rises.  Just as she starts to re-
    holster her gun, Batista comes huffing around the corner.  
    He sees that Debra had her weapon out.  

    ON DEBRA. Her heart-pounding, she secures her pistol and 
    looks across to the kid as Batista yanks him to his feet.  DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      35.

    EXT./INT. CHURCH - DAY 43030

    Rita herds the kids inside.  Dexter pauses at the threshold.  

    HIS POV:  a small sad empty church.  Rita moves down the 
    aisle.  Paul s casket up front, a smiling photograph on top.  
    The crucifix - Christ in his divine and bloody agony.  

    ON DEXTER.  Working it out.

    BACK TO SCENE.  Cody turns to Dexter, holds out his hand.

                        C mon, Dexter.  It s all right.

    Dexter steps over the threshold.  Waits to see if he ll be 
    struck dead.  He isn t.  Then he goes up the aisle.  Cody 
    takes his hand and guides him to a seat next to Rita and 
    Astor.  Rita, eyes wet, smiles and puts her hand on his leg.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

    DEXTER looks from Cody (on his right) to Rita (on his left).  
    She s weeping softly.  Dexter puts his hand on her back.  
    She leans into it and puts her own arm around Astor.

                        forward for a moment of silent prayer.

    Rita and the kids move up.  Dexter respectfully remains 
    behind.  He watches as Rita touches the coffin.

    CODY hands Astor the nesting dolls.  He takes Paul s picture 
    down and stares at it.  Then, simply --

                        ... bye, Dad.

    Dexter watches, oddly affected.  The Priest comes up.  Takes 
    Dexter s hands in his.

                                        PRIEST

                        No, you just took my life.

    Dexter nods.  Understands.

                                        DEXTER
                        So, how do I make you go away?

    Brian gestures to Rita; crying, comforting the kids.

    INT. POLICE STATION - DEXTER S LAB - DAY 43636

    Dexter on the phone while he works on his computer.  We see 
    what looks like a nautical chart on the monitor, a red wavy 
    swath snaking through a field of blue.  

                                        DEXTER 
                        Deb, it s me.  Again.  You re probably 
                        at the gym.  Again.

    He taps the keyboard.  Photos of Little Chino come up.

                        I ve got some unfinished business

    He rings off, pushes away from his desk and rises.

    Doakes at his desk.  Batista comes up.

                        Maria told me about the task force.  
                        They say when you don t get what you 
                        want, it s the biggest sign the 
                        universe is giving you a gift.

    Doakes looks up at him, ready to rip his head off.

                        door that closes, another one opens.

    The door to Dexter s lab opens.  He sees Doakes staring at 
    him.  Dexter smiles and shrugs that shrug of his.  

    INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT 43838

    THE TOP FLOOR.  Joey Nunez sprays gang symbols on the bare 
    walls.  A ratty mattress, fast-food bags and a boombox tell 
    us this is where the kid lives.

    DOWN BELOW.  The Chrysler 300C crunches into FRAME.  Little 
    Chino emerges, as big as a silo.  He reaches into his car 
    for his machete and heads for the Freight Elevator.

    INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - SAME3939

    Little Chino enters, pulls the iron grating closed and 
    presses  10 .  The car ascends.  DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      42.

    Suddenly, it shudders to a stop at the second floor.  Little 
    Chino impatiently pokes at the control panel.  Nothing.

    Dexter appears.  He quickly secures the iron grate with a 
    pair of handcuffs, trapping Chino.  Brandishing the TRANQ 
    STICK, he jams the business end into Chino s neck.  The big 
    man roars and grabs the stick.  Enraged, he pulls on the 
    stick.  Dexter is yanked against the cage, the Tranq Stick 
    all that separates him from this huge wounded animal...

    THE TOP FLOOR.  The elevator arrives.  Joey turns, startled.  
    But it s empty.

    INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - LOADING DOCK - SAME4040

    Dexter wheels the unconscious Little Chino on a four-wheeled 
    construction dolly.

                        It was simple really.  All I had to do 
                        was put myself into the mind of a 
                        killer.  Hardly a stretch.

    He dumps Little Chino into the Chrysler s trunk.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        It was only a matter of time before 
                        Little Chino went after Joey Nunez.    

    He jumps down, climbs into the Chrysler and starts it.  The 
    car pulls away from CAMERA, the rear-end visibly sagging.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I m gonna need a bigger boat.

    Little Chino s prostrate body RISES INTO FRAME.  We re --

    INT. AUTO BODY GARAGE - NIGHT 44141

    The massive Little Chino is bound to an auto lift.

                        I ll have to find a way to thank her.

    The lift jolts to a stop.  Little Chino opens his eyes, 
    looks around.  Photos of Eva Arenas, Rafael Arenas and his 
    other victims are propped behind votive candles.  Each 
    victim has a blood-red teardrop weeping from his or her left 
    eye.  Little Chino struggles mightily against his 
      restraints.  Dexter steps into his field of vision.DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      43.

    He prepares the blood slide and puts it on a table.  Then he 
    lights another votive.  When he clears, we see a photo of 
    Eva s daughter, Marissa.  Dexter returns to Little Chino. 
    Killing tools at the ready, he nods to Marissa s picture.

    He sucks in a long deep breath.  Then confidently presses 
    the knife into Little Chino s chest.

    CLOSE ON DEXTER.  A long beat.  A smile comes to his face.  
    At last.  Another beat.  And he finally allows himself to 
    exhale.  A cleansing rush of air escaping his lungs.

                        guy like Paul?

    Dexter doesn t have an answer.

                        Oh my God.  How did I miss this?

    She leans across the table, urgent.

                        If there s anything left between us, 
                        you need to answer me one question; 
                        and you better tell me the truth... 
                        are you a drug addict?

    Dexter stares at her, groping for the right words.  Then --

    Rita sits back hard, taking it all in.  This is their moment 
    of truth.  Is it the end of them?

    Then, to Dexter s surprise, a change comes over her.  A calm 
    sense of familiar purpose.  She rises and goes to him.

                                        RITA
                        Oh, Dexter.  That s the first step.

                        be there for you.

      Bewildered, Dexter returns the hug.  Rita looks deep into 
    his eyes.  DEXTER S POV:  Rita s eyes, searching.

    Lundy sits there, staring at the photos of the Bay Harbor 
    Butcher s  sunken treasure . 

    DEXTER switches off his light.  Sits in the semi-darkness.

                        And now I m faced with the struggle

                        was coming.

    He rises, exits his lab and crosses the bullpen.  Lundy 
    looks up, nods with a benign smile.  Dexter nods back.  Then 
    he steps into the elevator, turns and looks into CAMERA. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

    INT. DEXTER S APARTMENT - NIGHT 44646

    Dexter slips Little Chino s blood slide into the box; runs 
    his index finger along the other slides.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        When all is said and done, Chino, 
                        you re the same size as everyone else.

    He closes the box and is about to put it back in the AC 
    unit, when the front door opens.  The chain catches.

                                        DEBRA
                        Hey, Dex.  What the fuck?

    Dexter jams the slide box home and reassembles the AC unit. 

                                        DEXTER
                        Hang on.  I m coming.

    He crosses to unchain the door.

    Debra goes to the refrigerator, takes out the orange juice.  
    She swigs from the carton, then puts it on top of the mail.

    She notices Dexter looking at the OJ carton and returns it 
    to the fridge.  Then she gestures around the apartment.
