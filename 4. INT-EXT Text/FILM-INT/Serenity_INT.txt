And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.
2ND TECHNICIAN
She's dreaming.
FIRST TECHNICIAN
Nightmare?
2ND TECHNICIAN
Off the charts. Scary monsters.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
drop.
DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
with himself.
4.
Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
making him a little nervous.
The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
-- no
substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
(CONTINUING)
See, most of our best work is done
when they're asleep. We can
monitor and direct their
subconscious, implant
suggestions...
River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
starts forward, slowly.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
(CONTINUING)
It's a little startling to see,
but the results are spectacular.
Especially in this case. River
Tam is our star pupil.
The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
will very soon learn, is SIMON.
SIMON
I've heard that.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
She's a genius. Her mental
capacity is extraordinary, even
with the side-effects.
SIMON
Tell me about them.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Well, obviously, she's unstable...
the neural stripping gives them
heightened cognitive reception,
but it also destabilizes their own
reality matrix. It manifests as
borderline schizophrenia... which
at this point is the price for
being truly psychic.
SIMON
(moves toward her)
What use do we have for a psychic
if she's insane?
J
5.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I don't have to tell you the
security potential of someone who
can read minds. And she has lucid
periods -- we hope to improve upon
the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
ask if there's some reason for
this inspection.
SIMON
(TURNING)
Am I making you nervous?
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.
I was told their support for the
project was unanimous. The
demonstration of her power --
SIMON
(turns back to her)
How is she physically?
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Like nothing we've seen. All our
subjects are conditioned for
combat, but River... she's a
creature of extraordinary grace.
400
SIMON
Yes. She always did love to dance.
He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.
ANGLE: THE BATON
As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
head and swabs her, whispering:
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
River. Wake up. Please, it's
Simon. River. It's your brother.
Wake up...
She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
beneath.

River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.
RIVER
Simon.
A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.
RIVER
(CONTINUING)
They know you've come.
As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.
Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
of double doors.
SIMON
We can't make it to the surface
from inside.
Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
them from the other side of the doors.
4wo SIMON
(CONTINUING)
Find a --
But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.
THE OPERATIVE
Biograph. Simon Tam.
CLOSE ON: THE OPERATIVE'S GLASSES

As Simon's history files down in print and pictures --
graduation, security photo from his medical internship --
over one lens of the Operative's glasses.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
Remarkable children.
Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Excuse me! No one is allowed in
the records room without my
express permission.
THE OPERATIVE
(over this, quietly)
Enter the doctor.
(to Mathias)
Forgive me. I prefer to see the
event alone, without bias.
Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I need to see your clearance.
THE OPERATIVE
You're right to insist. I know
you've had security issues here.
He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
at the readout, and drops the bluster.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Apologies. An Operative of the
Parliament will of course have
full cooperation.
(looks at screen)
I'm not sure what... I see no
listing of rank, or name.
THE OPERATIVE
I have neither. Like this
facility, I don't exist. The
Parliament calls me in when...
when they wish they didn't have
to. Let's talk about the Tams.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I assume you've scanned the status
logs...
VJ

THE OPERATIVE
River was your greatest success.
A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
her brother walked in eight months
ago and took her from you.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
It's not quite so simple.
THE OPERATIVE
I'm very aware of that.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
He came in with full creds. He
beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
There was no way I could --
THE OPERATIVE
No, no. Of course. The boy spent
his fortune developing the
contacts to infiltrate this place.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Gave up a brilliant future in.
medicine as well, you've probably
read. Turned his back on his
whole life. Madness.
THE OPERATIVE
Madness, no. Something a good
deal more dangerous. Have you
looked at this scan carefully? At
his face?
Mathias looks uncertain.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
It's love, in point of fact. He
loved his sister and he knew she
was in pain. So he took her
somewhere safe.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Why are you here?
THE OPERATIVE
I'm here because the situation is
even less simple than you think.
(eyeing him)
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?
J
10.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I. I would be very careful about
what you --
THE OPERATIVE
(SADLY)
It's pride.
He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.
I was told their support --
THE OPERATIVE
(shutting it off)
Key members of Parliament. Key.
The minds behind every diplomatic,
military and covert operation in
the galaxy, and you put them in a
room with a psychic.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
She was... she read cards, nothing
more.
THE OPERATIVE
It's come to our attention that
River became much more unstable,
more... disturbed, after you
showed her off to Parliament. Did
she see something very terrible in
those cards?
DOCTOR MATHIAS
Whatever... secrets she might have
accidentally gleaned... it's
probable she doesn't even know she
knows them. That they're buried
beneath --
THE OPERATIVE
But they are in her. Her mind is
unquiet. It's the will of the
Parliament that I kill her. And
the brother. Because of your sin.
J
11.
THE OPERATIVE
(continuing; moving
to his briefcase)
You know, in certain older
civilized cultures, when men
failed as entirely as you have,
they would throw themselves on
their swords.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
(fed up)
Well, unfortunately I forgot to
bring a sword to --
The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.
THE OPERATIVE
The Parliament has no further
interest in psychics. They
represent a threat to the harmony
and stability of our Alliance.
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I would put that down right now if
I were you.
THE OPERATIVE
Would you be killed in your sleep,
like an ailing pet? Whatever your
failings, I believe you deserve
better than that.
The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
quietly as the first.
Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

12.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
Young miss, I'll need all the logs-
on behavioral modification
triggers. We'll have to reach out
to River Tam, and help her to come
back to us. No matter how far out
Simon has taken her, we can --
He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
This is a good death. There's no
shame in this, in a man's death.
A man who's done fine works.
We're making a better world. All
of them, better worlds.
Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
Young miss, I need you to get to
work now. I think I may have a
long way to travel.
40
She goes. He approaches River, very close, staring...
THE OPERATIVE

Where are you hiding,,little girl?
The noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out.

becomes the name painted on the side of a spaceship, with
the same in Chinese behind it.
[Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
tangle of wires and machinery all about.
Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.
MAL
What was that?
He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old
soldier, but just as startled.
WASH
Whoah! Did you see that --
The ship bucks --
MAL
Was that the primary buffer panel?
WASH
It did seem to resemble --
J
14.
MAL
Did the Primary Buffer Panel just
fall off my gorramn ship for no
apparent reason?
Another buck --
WASH
Looks like.
MAL
I thought Kaylee checked our entry
couplings! I have a very clear
memory of it --
WASH
Yeah well if she doesn't give us
some extra flow from the engine
room to offset the burnthrough
this landing is gonna get pretty
interesting.
MAL
Define "Interesting".
WASH
(calm suggestion:)
"Oh god, oh god, we're all gonna
die?"
J
MAL
(hits the com)
This is the Captain. There's a
little problem with our entry
sequence; we may experience slight
turbulence and then explode.
(to Wash, exiting)
Can you shave the vector --
WASH
I'm doing it! It's not enough.
(hits com)
Kaylee!
MAL
Just get us on the ground!
WASH
That part'll happen, pretty
definitely.
J
15.
The camera leads Mal down. On either side of the hall are
ladders leading down to crew's personal quarters.
The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as
Mal passes. He carries a number of rifles and grenades.
JAYNE
we're gonna explode? I don't
wanna explode.
MAL
Jayne, how many weapons you plan
on bringing? You only got the two
arms...
JAYNE
I just get excitable as to choice,
like to have my options open.
MAL
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.
JAYNE
Well, what you plan and what takes
place ain't ever exactly been
similar.
MAL
No grenades.
(Jayne groans)
No grenades.
First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of
dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.
ZOE
Are we crashing again?
MAL
Talk to your husband. Is the mule
prepped?
ZOE
Good to go, sir. Just loading her
up.
(to Jayne)
Are those grenades?
JAYNE
Cap'n doesn't want 'em.
J
16.
ZOE
We're robbing the place. We're
not occupying it.
All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:
It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.
MAL
(calling out)
Kaylee!
He enters:
MAL
(still calling)
Kaylee, what in the sphincter of
hell are you playing at?
The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes
Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
doorway, raising his voice above the din.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
We got the Primary Buffer
KAYLEE
Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to
fret.
MAL
You told me --
(JOLT)
You told me the entry couplings
would hold for another week!
KAYLEE
(WORKING)
That was six months ago, cap'n.
MAL
My ship don't crash. If she
crashes, you crashed her.
17.
Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up.
He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Doctor. Guess I need to get
innocked 'fore we hit planetside.
Simon nods, the ship jolting again.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to
worry about.
SIMON
I'm not worried.
MAL
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of,
Doc.
SIMON
This isn't fear. This is anger.
MAL
4 (LAUGHS)
Well, it's kinda hard to tell the
one from t'other, face like yours.
SIMON
I imagine if it were fear, my eyes
would be wider.
MAL
I'll look for that next time.
SIMON
You're not taking her.
MAL
(brushing past him)
No no, that's not a thing I'm
interested in talking over with --
SIMON
She's not going with you. That's
final.

18.
MAL
(turning back)
I hear the words "that's final"
come out of your mouth ever again,
they truly will be.
(turning away again)
This is my boat. Y'all are guests
on it.
He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:
Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.
SIMON
Guests? I earn my passage,
Captain --
MAL
And it's time your little sister
learned from your fine example.
SIMON
I've earned my passage treating
bullet holes, knife wounds, laser
burns...
MAL
Some of our jobs are trickier than
others --
SIMON
And you want to put my sister in
the middle of that.
MAL
Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:
Into which the two men step.
SIMON
She's a seventeen year old girl.
A mentally traumatized sevente--
J
19.
MAL
She's a reader. Sees into the
truth of things; might see trouble
before it's coming. Which is of
use to me.
SIMON
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.
MAL
(LAUGHS)
Honestly, doctor, I think we may
really crash this time anyway.
Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.
SIMON
Do you understand what I've gone
through to keep River away from
the Alliance?
MAL
I do, and it's a fact me and mine
have been courteous enough to keep
to our own selves.
SIMON
Are you threatening to --
MAL
I got one purpose here: keep this
boat in the air. I take the jobs
I get -- which is less and less,
case you ain't been keeping track.
He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Every year since the war the
Alliance pushes just a little
further out towards the rim.
Makes it a chore for naughty men
like us to slip about -- and
keeping you two on board means
working twice as hard to avoid the
law. Means turning down a score
of honest jobs.
J
20.
They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.
MAL
So here is us, on the raggedy
edge. Don't push me and I won't
push you.
Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Things get gritty I will keep her
from the fray, but she's coming.
Best you get her ready.
As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
boat out before we get flattened?
ZOE
Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
flies like my mister.
The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
the catwalk, and track with them to find:
SIMON
River...
She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
summer dress draped over her small frame.
RIVER
I know. We're going for a ride.
The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
River in the back:
21.
SIMON
Now, River, you stay behind the
others. If there's fighting you
drop to the floor or run away.
It's okay to leave them to die.
River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.
RIVER
I'm the brains of the operation.
ZOE
We should hit town right during
Sunday worship. Won't be any
crowds.
MAL
If Fanty and Mingo are right about
the payroll, this could look to be
a sunny day for us.
SIMON
(APPROACHING)
Captain, I'll ask you one last
time...
MAL
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here. If
anything happens to her, anything
at all, I swear to you I will get
very choked up. Honestly. There
could be tears.
He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...
KAYLEE
Don't mind the Captain none,
Simon. I know he'll look out for
her.
SIMON
It's amazing. I bring River all
the way out to the raggedy edge of
the 'verse so she can hide from
the Alliance by robbing banks.
KAYLEE
It's just a little Trading
Station. They'll be back 'fore
you can spit.
(as he stalks off)
Not that you spit...
22.
Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.
We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.
J
23.
The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
"Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
blown to bits.
There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.
MAL
Hands and knees and heads bowed
down! Everybody, now!
Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
much new in design.
The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Y'all wanna be looking very
intently at your own belly
buttons. I see a head start to
rise, violence is gonna ensue.
The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.
JAYNE
Looks like this is the place.
He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
door. She does, and River steps in.
ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
over customers as Mal addresses them.
MAL
You've probably guessed we mean to
be thieving here, but what we are
after is not yours. So let's have
no undue fussing.
As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
finding the small vault locked.
1410
24.
JAYNE
She's locked up.
River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
CLOSE ON: a young tough.
River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.
ZOE
You know what the definition of a
hero is? It's someone who gets
other people killed. You can look
it up later.
He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.
TRADE AGENT
This is just a crop moon, don't
think you'll find what you --
MAL
(in Chinese)
140
The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.
ZOE
At last. We can retire and give
up this life of crime.
Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
addresses the Trade Agent.
MAL
Is there a fed down there? Be
truthful.
TRADE AGENT
(NODDING)
Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought
for independence?
VJ
25.
MAL
War's long done. We're all just
folk now.
(calls down)
Listen up! We are coming down to
empty that vault!
The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.
GUARD (O.S.)
You have to give me your
authorization password!
Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
the hole. A beat...
GUARD (O . S . )
(CONTINUING)
Okay...
Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:
Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.
We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.
River SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation.
Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her.
JAYNE
What the hell is up? You all
right? What's goin' on?
He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...
RIVER
Reavers.
Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
guard, holding his gun at him:
MAL
Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and
we avoid any necessary organs...
GUARD
I was thinking more of a graze..
MAL
Well you don't want it to look
like you just gave up...
JAYNE (O.S.)
MAL!
MAL
(to himself)
Every heist, he's gotta start
yelling my name --
JAYNE
(barreling in)
Mal! Reavers! The girl's
pitchin' a fit. They're here or
they're comin' soon.
He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.
MAL
(to Zoe and Jayne)
Get on the mule.
(to the guard,
pointing to the
VAULT)
Does that open from the inside?
J
27.
GUARD
Whah -ah- yes...
MAL
You get everyone upstairs in there
and you seal it. Long as you got
air you don't open up, you
understand?
GUARD
I -- Buh I --
Mal is in his face, dark and huge:
MAL
GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT.
Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off.
WASH
We're moments from air. You got
somebody behind you?
We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:
Wash hits the com.
WASH
J Simon! Open the loading dock!
Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.
And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --
A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.
SIMON
River?
RIVER
I swallowed a bug.
Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.
KAYLEE
Are you okay?
MAL
Is he okay?
A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.
4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.
32.
WASH (O.S.)
We all here? What's going on?
Hello?
r./ ZOE
(moves to the com)
No casualties. Anybody following?
WASH
Nice flying, baby, and that's a
negative. Clean getaway -- Out of
atmo in six minutes.
MAL
Set course for Beaumonde.
(to the others)
First thing, I want these bod --
Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
SIMON
You stupid, selfish, son of a
whore ---
MAL
I'm a hair's breadth from riddling
you with holes, Doctor --
SIMON
"One simple job! She'll be fine!"
MAL
She IS fine! Except for bein'
still crazy, she's the picture of
health!
ZOE
Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
left there. She felt 'em coming.
SIMON
Never again. You understand me?
J
33.
MAL
Seems I remember a talk about you
giving orders on my boat.
SIMON
Well sleep easy 'cause we're off
your boat. Just as soon as River
gets her share of the "bounty".
KAYLEE
Well let's not do anything hasty...
MAL
No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying
tourists anyhow. We'll be on
Beaumonde in ten hours time, you
can pick up your earnings and be
on your merry. Meantime you do
your job. Patch up my crew.
A beat.
RIVER
He didn't lie down. They never
lie down.
She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.
Mal and Zoe enter from below.
ZOE
No, I think things'll glide a deal
smoother for us without River and
Simon on board... but how long do
you think they'll last?
MAL
Doc made his call. They's as
babes in a basket when we took 'em
in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man
has to cut loose, learn to stand
on his own.
ZOE
Like that man back in town?
They stop by Mal Is room.
MAL
I had to shoot him. What the
Reavers woulda done to him before
they killed him...
J
34.
ZOE
I know. That was a piece a'
mercy. But before that, him
begging us to bring him along...
vo,
MAL
We couldn't take the weight.
Woulda slowed us down.
ZOE
You know that for certain
MAL
Mule won't run with five. I
shoulda dumped the girl? Or you?
Or Jayne?
(CONSIDERING)
Well, Jayne...
ZOE
Coulda tossed the payload.
MAL
And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
in our mitts, tell 'em "here's
your share"? They'd set the dogs
on us in the space of a twitch,
and there we are back in mortal
peril. We get a job, we gotta
vo make good.
Washenters from the bridge.
ZOE
Sir, I don't disagree on any
particular point, it's just... in
the time of war, we woulda never
left a man stranded.
MAL
Maybe that's why we lost.
She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room
as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.
Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls
off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
closed and sits on his bunk.
The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
clutter, ancient maps on the walls.
J
35.
Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides
out. Hits the floor and starts moving: it's a snapshot-movie
OF:
VW - DAY
We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little
shuttle.
INARA
Kaylee, are you ever gonna put
that capture down?
KAYLEE (0.5.)
We gotta have records of
everything. A bona fide Companion
entertained clients on this very
ship! In this very bed!
The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending
over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.
KAYLEE (O.S.)
(CONTINUING)
For one sweet second, we was
almost classy.
INARA
4 You promised to help me pack.
KAYLEE (O.S.)
Honest, Inara, why do you have to
leave?
Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.
JAYNE (V.0.)
I do not get it. How's a guy get
so wrong?
We see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below.
Pan to see, for a moment, the dead Reaver's face.
Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable. Jayne
drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues:
R
36.
JAYNE
Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own
face, rapin' and murdering -- I
mean, I'll kill a man in a fair
fight... or if I think he's gonna
start a fair fight, or if he
bothers me, or if there's a woman,
or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only
when I'm gettin' paid. But these
Reavers... last ten years they
just show up like the boageyman
from stories. Eating people
alive? Where does that get fun?
He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.
KAYLEE
Shepherd Book said they was men
that reached the edge of space.,
saw a vasty nothingness and just
went bibbledy over it.
JAYNE
Hell, I been to the edge. Just
looked like more space.
KAYLEE
I don't know. People get awful
lonely in the black. Like to get
addlepated ourselves, we stay on
this boat much longer. Captain'll
drive us all off, one by one.
JAYNE
You're just in a whinge cuz that
prissy doc is finally
disembarking. Me I says good
riddance. He never belonged here,
and his sister's no saner than one
of them Reavers.
KAYLEE
That ain't even so! River's a
dear heart and a boon to this
crew! You just don't like her
'cause she can read your mind and
everything you think is mean.
JAYNE
Well, there is that.
J
37.
KAYLEE
Her and Simon could have a place
here. Now they're leaving us.
Just like Shepherd Book.
She looks up toward one of the shuttles.
KAYLEE
(CONTINUING)
Just like Inara...
And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
heads in the back, also on their knees.
Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.
A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
They love you.
410
The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the
town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand.
KAYLEE
Don't talk to the barkers -- only
the captains.
(MORE)
40.
KAYLEE (cont'd)
You look the captain in the eye,
know who you're dealing with.
40 SIMON
 I wish there was...
Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:
KAYLEE
You shouldn't aughta be so clean.
It's a dead giveaway you don't
belong, you always gotta be tidy.
Don't pay anybody in advance. And
don't ride in anything with a
Capissen 38 engine, they fall
right out of the sky.
SIMON
Kaylee.
She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other
direction, but River looks after her and the others.
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
River... do you want to stay with
them?
4 RIVER
It's not safe.
SIMON
No, I fear it's not safe anymore.
He's heading off and doesn't hear:
RIVER
For them.
We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
a smoking ruin.
NEWSPERSON (V.O.)
that it was a band of Reavers
remains unconfirmed. The only
survivors of the massacre
apparently locked themselves in
the Trade Station vault until --
40
41.
During this we come around to see that the screen has a
blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.
40
We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
booths and a second screen playing in the corner.
MAL
It's not my fault the Doc's got no
stomach for Rim living --
KAYLEE
It is entirely and for all your
fault! If you'd given Simon a
moment, just a moment where he
didn't think you were gonna throw
them off or turn them in, he
might've --
MAL
What? Swept you into his cleanly
arms? Made tidy love to you?
They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.
KAYLEE
(as they continue
DOWN)
Don't you dare joke! You know how
much I pined on Simon. And him
fair sweet on me, I well believe,
but he's so worried about being
found out --
ZOE
Captain didn't make 'em fugitives.
KAYLEE
But he coulda made 'em family!
Steada driving them off. Steada
keeping Simon from seein' I was
there, when I carried such a torch
and we coulda -- goin' on a year
now I ain't had nothin' twixt my
nethers weren't run on batteries!
40
42.
MAL
Oh god! I can't know that!
JAYNE
40 I could stand to hear a little
more...
KAYLEE
If you had a care for anybody's
heart you woulda --
MAL
(ENOUGH)
You knew he was gonna leave. We
never been but a way station to
those two. And how do you know
what he feels? He's got River to
worry on but he still coulda shown
you... if I truly wanted someone
bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in
the 'verse could stop me from
going to her.
KAYLEE
Tell that to Inara.
For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.
MINGO
4 Domestic troubles?
MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it.
FANTY
Domestic troubles?
FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
dress, they are indistinguishable.
MINGO
'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.
FANTY
A man should keep his house in
order.
MAL
(greets them each)
Mingo. Fanty.
14
43.
MINGO
(pointing at his
BROTHER)
He's Mingo.
,do
MAL
He's Fanty. You're Mingo.
MINGO
Ghahh! How is it you always know?
MAL
Fanty's prettier.
(pulling out a chair)
Feel to do some business?
MINGO
(re: Mal Is gang)
Bit crowded, isn't it? As you
see, we come unencumbered by thugs.
MAL
Which means at least four of the
guys already in here are yours.
All's one. I'll just keep Jayne
with me.
ZOE
Sir, are you sure you don't --
4
MAL
Go. Go get yourselves a nice
romantic meal.
WASH
Those are my two favorite words!
(to Zoe)
Honey... "Meal..."
MAL
(to Zoe)
It's business. We're fine.
They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a
few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance...
ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
blocked by her little dance.
Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.
MINGO
Quite a crew you've got.
4
44.
MAL
Yeah, they're a fine bunch of
ruebens.
MINGO
How you keep them on that crap
boat is the subject of much musing
tween me and Fanty.
FANTY
We go on and on.
MAL
So I'm noticing. Is there a
problem I don't know of? You got
25% of a sweet take kissing your
foot, how come we're not
dispersing?
FANTY
Our end is forty, precious.
JAYNE
My muscular buttocks it's forty --
MINGO
It is as of now. Find anyone
around going cheaper.
J FANTY
Find anyone around going near a
sorry lot like you in the first
instance.
ANGLE: RIVER has entered, is looking about.
Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to
business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.
FANTY
(CONTINUING)
You're unlikable, Mal. You got no
respect for us above you, you got
enemies in every quadrant, and
your ship's older than the
starting point of time. You's
charity cases to such as us.
45.
MAL
Well here's a foul thought. I
conjured you two were incompetent;
sent us out not knowing there were
V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking
you picked us out because you did.
MINGO
That were a sign of faith, boy.
And it doesn't affect our forty
per. Danger is, after all, your
business.
JAYNE
Reavers ain't business, double
dickless.
This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the
CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy,
cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:
COMMERCIAL
FRUITY OATY BARS, POW! HEY! FRUITY
BARS, MAKE A MAN OF A MOUSE, MAKE
YOU BUST OUT YOUR BLOUSE, EAT THEM
NOW, BANG! PING! ZOW! -- TRY
FRUITY, OATY BARS.
We push in, the light from the CV on River's face, pushing to
EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the jingle fading out,
finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears.
And she whispers:
RIVER
Miranda.
She turns and looks back at the crowd.
What happens next happens very fast.
She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
people are turning, just registering that this girl --
kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --
V0
46.
MAL
River...
JAYNE
V0 Whuhuh?
She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect
precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
the room itself to take out every single person there. One
man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
around the corner and nails his face.
Jayne grabs her from behind --
JAYNE
(CONTINUING)
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
his, they are pointed right at each other --
SIMON
Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.
MAL
I think maybe we ought to leave.
10
47.
The operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed --
and River is staring right at him.
THE OPERATIVE
(CAPTIVATED)
Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm
glad you've finally asked for me.
An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:
ENSIGN
We got a pos on a retinal -- man
carrying her out is Malcolm
Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class
transport ship, "Serenity". Bound
by law five times, smuggling,
tariff dodge... not convicted.
Nothing here that would --
THE OPERATIVE
The ship. The name of the ship.
10 (SOFTLY)
Crossref. Malcolm Reynolds.
Serenity.
He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on
his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text.
ENSIGN
Sir?
THE OPERATIVE
Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle
of the entire war. The
Independents held the valley for
seven weeks, two of them after
their high command had
surrendered. 68% casualty rate.
ENSIGN
Of course, Sir, I just didn't --
THE OPERATIVE
There.
4
48.
His glasses stop scrolling and Mal's military file opens, a
picture of Mal in one lens.
THE OPERATIVE
140 (CONTINUING)
If the feds ever bothered to
crossref justice files with war
records... Yes. Our Mr. Reynolds
was a sergeant, 57th Overlanders.
Volunteer. Fought at Serenity
till the very last. This man is
an issue. This man hates us.
ENSIGN
First Mate Zoe Washburn, formerly
Corporal Zoe Alleyne, also in the
57th. Career army, looks like.
THE OPERATIVE
She's followed him far... Give me
the crew, registered passengers --
Our Captain is a passionate man,
no room there for subtlety. He's
bound to have some very obvious...
CLOSE ON: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly moving
picture of INARA.
THE OPERATIVE
-40 (continuing)
.weakness...
River is still asleep, Mal finishing chaining her wrists.
She lies on her side, breathing evenly.
Mal stares at her a moment, then:
He exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash.
SIMON
May I see her?
MAL
She's still napping just now. And
I believe you've got some
storytelling to do.
4
49.
WASH
(ENTERING)
We're out of atmo, plotted for
Haven. No one following as of yet.
KAYLEE
Haven? We're gonna see Shepherd
Book?
MAL
(NODDING)
We got to lay low. And I could
fair use some spiritual guidance
right about now.
(to Simon)
I am a lost lamb; what in hell
happened back there?
WASH
Start with the part where Jayne
gets knocked out by a ninety pound
girl. 'Cause I don't think that's
ever getting old.
ZOE
Do we know if anyone was killed?
MAL
It's likely. I know she meant to
Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to
sleep, which how exactly does that
work anyhow?
SIMON
Safeword.
(BEAT)
The people who helped me break
River out -- they had intel that
River and the other subjects were
being embedded with behavioral
conditioning. They taught me a
safeword, in case... something
happened.
KAYLEE
Not sure I get it.
SIMON
A phrase that's encoded in her
brain, that makes her fall asleep.
If I speak the words, "Eta --
4
50.
JAYNE
(jumping back)
Well don't say it!
moo ZOE
It only works on her, Jayne.
JAYNE
Oh. Well, now I know that.
MAL
"In case something happened."
SIMON
What?
MAL
You feel to elaborate on what that
something might be? I mean they
taught you that fancy safeword,
they must've figured she was
gonna, what -- start
uncontrollably crocheting?
SIMON
They never said what --
MAL
And you never did ask.
Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Eight months. Eight months you
had her on my boat knowing full
well she might go monkeyshit at
the wrong word and you never said
a thing --
SIMON
I brought her out here so they
couldn't get to her, I don't even
know how they --
MAL
My ship. My crewi You had a
gorramn timebomb living with us!
River's eyes open.
V0
51.
MAL
What if she went off in the middle
woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee,
did that give you a moment's pause?
Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.
SIMON
I thought she was getting better.
JAYNE
And I thought they was gettin' off!
(off looks)
Didn't we have a intricate plan
how they was gonna be not here
anymore?
KAYLEE
We couldn't leave them now...
JAYNE
No, now that she's a... killer
woman we ought be bringin' 'em tea
and dumplings!
(to Mal)
In earnest, Mal: why'd you bring
her back on?
4
Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them. Doesn't have an answer.
SIMON
May I see her.
Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.
JAYNE
She goes woolly again, we're gonna
have to put a bullet to her.
River mouths the next words right along with Mal:
MAL
It's crossed my mind.
WASH
Can I make a suggestion that
doesn't involve violence, or is
this the wrong crowd?
J
52.
ZOE
Honey...
WASH
V0 Fanty and Mingo might be coming
hard down on us, or the laws... or
maybe nobody could be bunged about
a little social brawl. We need to
get our bearings. I think we need
to talk to Mr. Universe.
Inside, we find an unkempt young man. Also sleep-deprived,
over-caffeinated and kinda sweet. This is MR UNIVERSE. He
is alone but for his mannikin-like Love-bot, Lenore.
He's surrounded by screens, computers, feeds -- machinery
that looks both ultra-modern and long neglected. All the
screens play different images -- it's a mediaverse.
A0
As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image
becomes a vidscreen. He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe.
We intercut between the two spaces:
MR UNIVERSE
Oh, this is good. This is...
(GIGGLES)
.she's beating up all the burly
men and I'm having a catharsis,
it's happening right now, you guys
always bring me the very best
violence. You think you're in a
hot place?
WASH
That's what we're looking to
learn. Is there any follow up, a
newswave...
4
53.
MR UNIVERSE
There is no "news", there's the
truth of the signal, what I see,
and there's the puppet theatre the
V0 Parliament's jesters foist on the
somnambulant public. Monkey taught
to say the word "monkey" -- lead
story on 32 planets. But the slum
riots on Hera, not a --
MAL
What about this? Did this make
the... puppet theatre?
MR UNIVERSE
No sir. And no lawforce flags,
either -- I hadda go into the
security feed direct...
MAL
You can do that?
MR UNIVERSE
Can't stop the signal, Mal.
Everything goes somewhere and I go
everywhere. Security feeds are a
traipse to access -- and I wasn't
the first one in, this has prints
on it -- oh! Look at her go!
A0 Everyone is getting bruises and
contusions. Contoooosions.
ZOE
(to Mal, over that)
So somebody else has been fed
this. That doesn't like me too
well.
MR UNIVERSE
Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling
in love with me. You're just
gonna embarrass yourself. I have
a commitment to my Lovebot, it was
a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore
wrote her own vows, I cried like
a baby, a hungry, angry baby.
(re: screen)
And she falls asleep. Which, she
would be sleepy.
J
54.
MAL
Can you go back? See if anybody
spoke with her 'fore she acted up,
-40 made any kind of contact with
her...
Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on
River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word,
"Miranda", and starts to move away.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Miranda...? Go back further.
MR UNIVERSE
No..
He pulls another screen close, starts working that one.
Matching timecodes, he pulls up the commercial.
MAL
Um... please?
Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as
(NON-MATRIXY)
well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of
code showing through. As he does so:
MR UNIVERSE
Friends and potential lovers, I
4DO
have good news and I have the
other kind. Good is you're very
smart. Someone is talking to her.
WASH
The oaty bar?
MAL
Subliminal. It's a subliminal
message broadwaved to trigger her.
MR UNIVERSE
(NODDING)
I been seeing this code pop up all
over, last few weeks. And I
cannot crack it. It's Alliance
and it's high military, so here
then is the bad. Someone has gone
to enormous trouble to find your
little friend. And found her
they have.
Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each other.
40
55.
MR UNIVERSE
(CONTINUING)
Do you all know what it is you're
carrying?
W
River stares at us, impassive, as the camera pulls away from
her to reveal Simon, who is cleaning blood off her face.
RIVER
They're afraid of me.
SIMON
I'm sorry...
RIVER
They should be. What I will show
them... Oh God...
She starts tearing up, breathing faster... Simon runs his
hands through her hair.
SIMON
It's okay, it's okay...
RIVER
(somewhere else)
Show me off like a dog, old men
covered in blood, it never touched
them but they're drowning in it...
so much loss... I don't know what
I'm saying. I never know what I'm
saying...
SIMON
You said something. When you were
triggered, do you remember? The
Captain saw you say something on
the feed...
RIVER
Miranda.
SIMON
Miranda.
RIVER
(laughs bitterly)
Ask her. She'll show you all.
40
56.
SIMON
Show us what? Who is Miranda?
(BEAT)
Am I... talking to Miranda now?
Nw
She shoots him a look.
RIVER
I'm not a multiple, dumbo.
SIMON
No. Right. But I think somehow
when they triggered you it brought
this up, this memory --
RIVER
It isn't mine. The memory. I
didn't bring it and I shouldn't
have to carry it, it isn't mine.
(URGENTLY:)
Don't make me sleep again.
SIMON
I won't.
RIVER
Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the
brain pan, squish.
SIMON
Don't say that. Not ever. We'll
get through this.
She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.
RIVER
Things are going to get much much
worse.
SIMON
Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us
in the airlock, so I'd say we're --
RIVER
He has to see. More than
anyone... he has to see what he
doesn't want to.
SIMON
River. What will Miranda show us.
She thinks.
VD
57.
RIVER
Death.
SIMON
Whose death?
And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then
almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face:
RIVER
EVERYBODY'S!!!
SMASH CUT TO:
Black Silence.
It's pitch black here, til Serenity's lights throw a hard
relief on the rocky wall. She flies in after, slow and
steady, revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft.
BOOK (O.S.)
Lord, I am walking your way.
ANGLE: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a working-
class preacher and former crew member. He smiles as they
come out to meet him:
NOO BOOK (O.S.)
(CONTINUING)
Let me in, for my feet are sore,
my clothes are ragged.
We see the gang sitting and eating. Comfortable, even
laughing a bit. Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars.
Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap.
BOOK (O.S. )
Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins
will play out on them as on a
screen. Read them all.
4
58.
As he continues, we see an image of him watching over the
sleeping girl, his mind, racing.
MAL (O.S.)
I had an out -- hell, I had every
reason in the 'verse to leave her
lay and haul anchor.
River starts awake.
Mal does too, shirtless on his bunk.
MAL
Whuh huh nuhwhat?
WASH (0.S.)
(for the third time)
Mal! You up? Got a wave. I'm a
bounce it down to you.
He pops up, turns to the screen as the white noise becomes:
1400
62.
MAL
Inara.
REVERSE ON: Inara on Mal's screen. We see her from about
chest level up. She, presumably, sees the same.
INARA
?
Mal. I uh, is this a bad time
MAL
Good as any.
INARA
Please tell me you're wearing
pants.
MAL
(slight grin)
Naked as the day I come cryin'.
How's your world?
INARA
Cold. It's autumn here.
MAL
Still at the Training House?
INARA
Right where you left me.
MAL
I remember it as nice enough.
picturesque.
INARA
It is that. What about you?
MAL

Still flying. So what occasi

different screens, smiling
Jayne enters, wondering what's up...
63.
INARA
Oh. Thank you, I... I guess we
have something of a problem here.
With the locals, I thought maybe...
MAL
You could use a gun hand?
INARA
I'm hoping not. But if you were
close at all, you -- the crew --
could take your ease here a
while... and there'd be payment...
MAL
Payment is never not a factor. I
could sound out the crew... This
pot like to boil over soon?
INARA
Soon. Not right away.
MAL
Well, it would be, I mean I would
like to... Kaylee's been missing
you something fierce --
There is a general groan among the audience, which now
includes Kaylee as well...
KAYLEE
Oh they're so pathetic!
INARA
I miss her too. I even miss my
shuttle, occasionally.
MAL
Yeah, you left a... got some of
your stuff in a trunk, never did
get a chance to drop it off.
INARA
Oh.
MAL
I didn't look through the...
stuff... just sundries I expect.
64
Inara smiles blandly, nods. An awkward beat.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Well, it's kind of late where I'm
at. I'll send a wave as soon as
I can.
INARA
Thank you.
She disappears. Mal thinks a moment.
Mal comes up in, buttoning his shirt.
WASH
Inara. Nice to see her again.
ZOE
So, trap?
MAL
Trap.
ZOE
We goin' in?
moo MAL
It ain't but a few hours out...
WASH
Yeah, but, remember the part where
it's a trap?
MAL
If that's the case, then Inara's
already caught in it. She
wouldn't set us up willing. Might
be we got a shot at seeing who's
turning these wheels. We go in.
KAYLEE
How can you be sure Inara don't
just wanna see you? Sometimes
people have feelings -- I'm
referring here to people...
MAL
Y'all were watching, I take it.
Guilty glances.
4
65
KAYLEE
Yes.
MAL
140 You see us fight?
KAYLEE
No.
MAL
Trap.
WASH
We're about seventy miles from the
Training house. And nobody on
radar... if the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.
MAL
They're about. Find us a home.
I'll take the shuttle in closer.
Zoe, ship is yours.
4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Remember: if anything happens to
me, or you don't hear from me
within the hour... you take this
ship and you come and rescue me.
ZOE
What? And risk my ship?
MAL
(EXITING)
I mean it. It's cold out there.
I don't wanna get left.
She is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha, lighting a
few incense sticks.
The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished
and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light,
casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the
rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara.
MAL
Dear Buddha, please send me a
pony, and a plastic rocket, and --
I NAR.A
Mal! What are you doing here?
MAL
You invited me.
INARA
I never thought for a second you'd
be stupid enough to come!
MAL
Well that makes you kind of a
tease, doesn't it?
INARA
You knew my invitation wasn't on
the level --
MAL
Which led me to the conclusion
that you must be in some trouble.
INARA
I'm fine! I'm. giddy.
MAL
For a woman schooled in telling
men what they wanna hear, you
ain't much of a liar.
INARA
Mal, you cannot handle this man.
-40
67.
THE OPERATIVE
(ENTERING)
I have to say, I'm impressed that
you would come for her yourself.
lw And that you would make it this
far in that outfit.
MAL
(STANDING)
I can be very graceful when I need
to.
THE OPERATIVE
I've no doubt.
Mal sheds his shawl and robe. Inara kneels at the alter,
picks out another incense stick.
MAL
What are you doing?
INARA
I'm praying for you, Mal.
THE OPERATIVE
That's very thoughtful. But I
mean it when I say you're not in
any danger.
MAL
Speak your piece.
THE OPERATIVE
I think you're beginning to
understand how dangerous River Tam
is.
MAL
She is a mite unpredictable. Mood
swings, of a sort.
THE OPERATIVE
It's worse than you know.
MAL
It usually is.
THE OPERATIVE
That girl will rain destruction
down on you and your ship. She's
an albatross, Captain.
4
68.
MAL
Way I remember it, albatross was
a ship's good luck... til some
idiot killed it.
(to Inara)
Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to
faint.
The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
moves, Mal counters.
THE OPERATIVE
I've seen your war record. I know
how you must feel about the
Alliance.
MAL
You really don't.
THE OPERATIVE
Fair to say. But I have to hope
you understand you can't beat us.
MAL
I got no need to beat you. I just
wanna go my way.
THE OPERATIVE
And you can do that, once you let
me take the girl back home. Give
me the opportunity to help you.
MAL
All I gotta do is let you take one
more thing away from me. I've had
a lot of things taken in my time.
And it may just be that this is
one too many.
THE OPERATIVE
This psychotic, potentially
murderous girl who can't have the
slightest awareness of your
protection. This is where you
"draw the line".
MAL
Well I'm a whimsical soul.
THE OPERATIVE
There's a number of lives that
hang in the balance here. Lives
under your care. Are they as
whimsical as yourself?
69.
MAL
I got no notion that I'm being
heroical at all. Any more than I
think you're really just a
harmless bureaucrat come to help
me out. You move like a killer.
The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:
THE OPERATIVE
I have a warship in deep orbit,
Captain. We locked on to
Serenity's pulse beacon the moment
you hit atmo. I can speak a word
and send a missile to that exact
location inside of three minutes.
Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
around it, and tosses it to the Operative.
MAL
You do that, best make peace with
your dear and fluffy lord.
THE OPERATIVE
Pulse beacon.
MAL
Advice from an old tracker: you
J wanna find someone, use your eyes.
THE OPERATIVE
How long do you think you can
really run from us?
MAL
Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I
never credited the Alliance with
an over-abundance of brains. And
if you're the best they got...
THE OPERATIVE
Captain Reynolds, I should tell
you so that you don't waste your
time: You can't make me angry.
INARA
Oh please. Spend an hour with him.
Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"
70.
THE OPERATIVE
I need her, Captain. River is...
my purpose and I will gather her
to me. The brother as well.
Whatever else happens is
incidental. In the greater scheme.
MAL
Why is it that the greater scheme
always makes everything not that
great?
THE OPERATIVE
I want to resolve this like
civilized men. I'm not
threatening you. I'm unarmed.
MAL
Great!
He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.
THE OPERATIVE
I am of course wearing full body
armor. I'm not a moron.
He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.
MAL
No back up? We're making an awful
ruckus...
THE OPERATIVE
They'll come when they're needed.
MAL
I'd start whistling.
THE OPERATIVE
Captain, what do you think is
going to happen here?
They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.
40
71.
Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
precision is wearing Mal down.
Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
places her hand on his arm.
The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
fascination as he looks at it.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
Nothing here is what it seems.
INARA
I know.
THE OPERATIVE
He's not the plucky hero. The
Alliance isn't some evil empire.
This isn't the grand arena.
INARA
And that's not incense.
He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.
40
It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.
THE OPERATIVE
Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!
Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.
MAL
.I had him...
INARA
What?
MAL
(deafly loud)
I think that I was winning!
4
72.
Inara pushes into the pilot's seat.
INARA
Hang on to something.
MAL
4 You sure you remember how it --
He nearly falls over as:
Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
controls. Mal is gone.
INARA
I told you to hang on.
MAL (O.S. )
(in great pain)
I'm fine...
The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple.
THE OPERATIVE
(into a com)
Forget the pulse beacon, there has
to be another way to track the
ship -- get a read on the nav sat.
It's a registered transport, you
must be able to locate --
ENSIGN (O.S.)
Sir?
THE OPERATIVE
Have you found a nav sat
trajectory?
ENSIGN (O.S.)
Sir... we've found seven.
The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.
THE OPERATIVE
(to himself)
Does he think this is a game?
Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --
.00
74.
And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her
eyes narrow with intent.
INARA (V.0.)
We have every reason to be afraid.
JAYNE
Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
That ain't so hard --
MAL
He didn't beat me up --
INARA
Because he's a believer.
As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.
Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters.
INARA (V.0.)
He's intelligent, methodical and
devout in his belief that killing
River is the right thing to do.
INARA
I honestly think the only reason
we haven't been blown out of the
air is that he needs to see her.
SIMON
Needs to see her why?
INARA
I'm uncertain. I would say to be
sure of the kill, but... I just
know he'll kill us all to get to
her.
JAYNE
So no hope of a reward, huh?
ZOE
Did he mention a deal of any kind?
IWO
75.
MAL
(looking at Simon)
Give the two of them up. Go my
way.
JAYNE
Which you was all ready to do not
a day ago. What went sour?
MAL
Cutting them loose ain't the same
as handing them over.
JAYNE
That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm
about to become is having trouble
telling the difference.
SIMON
(to Inara)
Did he say anything about a
"Miranda"?
INARA
What is that?
MAL
Don't know who or what, but it's
on River's mind. Conjure it might
be the reason he's after her.
INARA
You think maybe it poses some kind
of threat to the Alliance?
WASH
Do we care? Are we caring about
that?
JAYNE
You dumbass hogs, the only people
she's a threat to is us on this
boat!
River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split
again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to
the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it
inside the lock of her shackles.
76.
MAL
Look, we get back to Haven in a
'r/ few hours time --
JAYNE
Hiding under the Shepherd's
skirts, that's a manful scheme --
MAL
You wanna run this ship?
JAYNE
Yes!
MAL
(small beat)
Well you can't!
JAYNE
Do a damn sight better job'n you.
Getting us lashed over a couple of
strays...
(to Simon)
No offense, Doc, I think it's
noble as a grape the way you look
to River, but she ain't my sister
(to Mal)
and she ain't your crew. Oh, and
neither is she exactly helpless!
So where's it writ we gotta lay
down our lives for her, which is
what you've steered us toward.
MAL
I didn't start this.
JAYNE
No, the Alliance starts the war --
and then you volunteer. Battle of
Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here,
how many --
(Mal turns away)
-- I'm talkin' at you -- how many
men in your platoon came out of
there alive?
Mal stares at him.
ZOE
(dead cold)
You wanna leave this room.
77
JAYNE
You're damn right I do.
He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment.
INARA
This isn't the war, Mal.
Mal turns, eyeing her.
MAL
Are you telling me that because
you think I don't know --
INARA
You came to the training house
looking for a fight.
MAL
I came looking for you.
INARA
I just want to know who I'm
dealing with. I've seen too many
versions of you to be sure.
MAL
I start fighting a war I guarantee
you'll see something new.
TO
Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:
SIMON
We'll get off. River and I'll get
off at Haven and find some --
KAYLEE
Nobody's saying that.
WASH
Nobody besides Jayne is saying
that.
Inara tries to catch up to --
INARA
Mal.
10
78.
MAL
(TURNING)
I got no answers for you, Inara.
I got no rudder. Wind blows
40 northerly, I go north. That's who
I am. Maybe that ain't a man to
lead but they have to follow so
you wanna tear me down do it
inside your own mind.
0
INARA
I'm not trying to tear you down --
D
MAL
But you fog things up. You always
have -- you spin me about. I wish
like hell you was elsewhere.
INARA
I was.
Jayne is looking at the storage locker door. A beat.
JAYNE
He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes
40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun.
JAYNE
(CONTINUING)
No trouble now, little crazy
person... we're going for a nice
I
shuttle ride --
He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow
to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on
him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back --
The crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't
open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne...
MAL
The other way! Find her and-do
not engage!
Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in
the window.
10
79.
ANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River
pops up right in front of us.
He starts, then waits as she opens the door.
NO
SIMON
It's gonna be oka --
She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He
doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.
Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
upstairs. He gives up, looking around.
ZOE
She's sealed off the bridge. I do
not like her there.
KAYLEE
Cap'n!
She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:
MAL
Check the shuttles. She coulda
40 snuck in.
He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.
A floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves
quietly to the bridge, gun drawn.
He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's
seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at
him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun.
MAL
The government's man, he says
you're a danger to us. Not worth
helping. Is he right? Are you
anything but a weapon? I've
staked my crew's life on the
a - person-,-- -
actual and whole, and if I'm wrong
you'd best shoot me now.
(she cocks the gun)
Or we could talk more...
40
80.
RIVER
(pointing to screen)
Miranda.
WIt's a planet. Matches the one from her dream.
Everyone has gathered. Wash is piloting now, as they are in
atmosphere. River is by Simon. She moves restlessly, upset.
KAYLEE
How can it be there's a whole
planet called Miranda and none of
us knowed that?
MAL
Because there isn't one. It's a
blackrock. Uninhabitable.
Terraforming didn't hold, or
somesuch. Few settlers died.
RIVER
(to Simon)
I had to show them. I didn't know
if you were going to make me sleep.
SIMON
(hoarse whisper)
You could've asked...
10
KAYLEE
(re: planet)
Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years
back, before the war. There was
call for workers to settle on
Miranda, my daddy talked about
going. I should've recalled...
WASH
But there's nothing about it on
the Cortex -- History,
Astronomy... it's not in there.
MAL
Half of writing history is hiding
the truth. There's something on
this rock the Alliance doesn't
want known.
INARA
That's right at the edge of the
Burnham Quadrant, right?
(MORE)
10
81.
INARA (cont'd)
Furthest planet out.
(Mal nods)
It's not that far from here...
W
WASH
Whoah, no, no --
ZOE
(moving to the screen)
That's a bad notion --
WASH
Honey...
ZOE
I got it, baby.
WASH
Show them the bad...
She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a
couple of other planets near Miranda.
ZOE
This is us, see? And here's
Miranda. All along here, this
dead space in between, that's
Reaver territory.
WASH
They just float out there, sending
out raiding parties --
ZOE
Maybe a hundred ships. And more
every year. You go through that
you're signing up to be a banquet.
WASH
I'm on board with the run and hide
scenario -- and we are just
about...
He looks at his monitors, looks ahead...
WASH
(CONTINUING)
WAIT
We see Mal's face as the sight hits him like a gut-punch.
Silence.
Every Cortex screen is on, each looking at a different place.
Every one shows fire, destruction or the snow of an
interrupted signal.
Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After
a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced
by identical images of the Operative. He looks solemn.
THE OPERATIVE
V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you
hide and I cannot let you run.
Things become... extreme. And we
wish for another way.
MAL
Don't talk at me like a righteous
man. You are a killer of children.
THE OPERATIVE
When God wanted Pharaoh to release
His people from bondage -- you
know the story? He didn't ask.
He sent his plagues down upon
Egypt. That's me, Captain. The
path to peace is paved with
corpses. It's always been so.
MAL
So me and mine got to lie down and
R--BETTER-
world?
85.
THE OPERATIVE
I'm not going to live there. How
could you think -- there's no
place for me there, any more than
40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a
monster. What I do is evil, I've
no illusions about it. But it
must be done.
MAL
Why? Do you know why?
THE OPERATIVE
It's not my place to ask.
MAL
You will never see River Tam. I'm
telling you this.
THE OPERATIVE
Maybe not. But you'll keep her
close now, and when I blow
Serenity out of the air, this will
be ended. You're so terribly out
of your depth, Captain. Your old
boat can't take the pressure.
MAL
She ain't buckled yet. And the
40 only reason you're talking such a
lot is you can't get a fix on us.
THE OPERATIVE
Yes, your scrambler's code is too
old for our seekers. You love
that, yes? The small triumph over
modernity. You really are the
noble savage.
MAL
Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.
THE OPERATIVE
But that's what's going to kill
you, Malcolm. Nobility. It
confuses your text, which is
self-interest. And sin.
MAL
Only- many-I-know-who still --bel i-eved-
in sin just died by your hand.
THE OPERATIVE
What do you believe in?
40
86.
MAL
Not a solitary thing.
THE OPERATIVE
If that were true, you'd be
nothing more than a Reaver.
Something changes in Mal's expression.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
But then, maybe you're not that
far from --
Mal flicks a switch and every screen goes dark.
Mal comes down the stairs to the catwalk. He hesitates, then
steps into the shuttle.
Mo
89.
It's dark in here. Mal stands with his back to the door, no
light on his face, shaking. Not crying, but overcome.
LOW
INARA
Mal.
He looks up: she's in the corner looking through that trunk
of hers, hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something.
MAL
Didn't see you.
I NARA
I figured that.
MAL
Anything of use in there?
INARA
Maybe.
She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her.
MAL
You don't have to stay in the
shuttle, you know. There's empty
rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.
INARA
You think anyone's set to sleep?
Simon's portioning out overdoses
of morphine, just in case.
MAL
Cheerful fellow.
(looking around)
Did you really miss this place?
INARA
(rueful smile)
Sometimes... Not so much right now.
A beat. He doesn't look at her when he asks:
MAL
Why did you leave?
Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m-
INARA
Why didn't you ask me not to?
90.
Dissatisfied, Mal rises.
MAL
I, uh, I'd better go check on the
VW crew. See how the inevitable
mutiny is coming along.
They both want to say more. They don't. He goes.
The group make their way toward the bridge. Those close
enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked --
those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up
against the glass of the window is River, just staring.
They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...
The Operative stares blankly at the Ensign.
THE OPERATIVE
Define "disappeared".
The Ensign just looks uncomfortable.
4
91.
Kaylee, Simon and River have left the bridge. The clouds fog
the windows, so nothing below is visible.
ZOE
Every reading I'm getting says
normal. Oceans, land masses... no
tectonic instability or radiation.
WASH
Yeah, but no power, either.
MAL
Nothing at all?
WASH
Wait. Something. Might be a
beacon, but it's awful weak.
MAL
Find it.
It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no
bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around.
River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
turns it slightly --
A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,
everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
exactly where she was when she recorded this message...
(As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it
in.. River silently mouths every word.)
,two
95.
CARON
-- just a few of the images we've
recorded, and you can see it
isn't.. it isn't what we thought.
There's been no war here, and no
terraforming event. The
environment is stable. It's the
Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added to the air
processors. It's...
(tearing up)
.well it works... it was
supposed to calm the population,
weed out aggression. Make a
peaceful... it worked. The people
here stopped fighting. And then
they stopped everything else.
They stopped going to work,
stopped breeding... talking...
eating...
(trying for control)
There's thirty million people here
and they all just let themselves
die. They didn't even kill
themselves. They just... most
starved. When they stopped
working the power grids, there
were overloads, fires -- people
burned to death sitting in their
V0 chairs. Just sitting.
There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts,
gathers herself.
CARON
(CONTINUING)
I have to be quick. There was no
one working the receptors when we
landed, so we hit pretty hard. We
can't leave. We can't take any of
the local transports because...
The bang again.
CARON
(CONTINUING)
There are people... they're not
people... about a tenth of a
percent of the population had the
opposite reaction to the Pax.
Their aggressor response
increased... beyond madness.
They've become...
(MORE)
VJ
96.
CARON (cont'd)
they've killed most of us... not
just killed, they've done...
things.
V0
WASH
(QUIETLY)
Reavers... they made them...
CARON
I won't live to report this, and
we haven't got power to... people
have to know...
(loses it here)
We meant it for the best... to
make people safer... to... God!
She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her
own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and
bites her face --
She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at
her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin.
JAYNE
(QUIETLY)
Turn it off.
Wash does, nobody saying anything.
10
Mal walks outside.
River falls to her knees, vomiting. Simon goes to her, puts
his hand on her back, lets her ride it out.
SIMON
River...
RIVER
I'm all right.
She looks at him, wet eyes full of clarity.
RIVER
(CONTINUING)
I'm all right.
V0
Wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the console.
The cylinder is on the table. Mal stands at the head,
looking at his crew.
MAL
This report is maybe twelve years
old. Parliament buried it, and it
stayed buried til River dug it up.
This is what they feared she knew.
And they were right to fear,
'cause there's a universe of folk
that are gonna know it too.
(touches the cylinder)
They're gonna see it. Somebody
has to speak for these people.
He pauses. Everyone waits.
V0
98.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
You all got on this boat for
different reasons, but you all
V0 come to the same place. So now
I'm asking more of you than I have
before. Maybe all. 'Cause as
sure as I know anything I know
this: They will try again. Maybe
on another world, maybe on this
very ground, swept clean. A year
from now, ten, they'll swing back
to the belief that they can make
people... better. And I do not
hold to that. So no more running.
I aim to misbehave.
There is a beat as he eyes them all.
JAYNE
My grandma always told me: if you
can't do something smart, do
something right.
By way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big-ass rifle. Mal
takes in the fact that Jayne has spoken for them all.
MAL
That the same grandma told you
4 there was an evil dwarf spirit
living in your well?
JAYNE
(NODDING)
She was a fun grandma.
SIMON
Do we have a plan?
MAL
Mr Universe. We haven't the
equipment to broadwave this code,
but he can put it on every screen
for thirty worlds. He's pretty
damn close, too.
RIVER
Based on our orbital trajectories,
he reached optimum proximity just
before our sunset. If we make a
direct run within the hour we're
only 67,332 miles out. At full
burn we'd reach him inside of
three- hours .
4
99.
She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity --
she's still somewhat in her own world.
WASH
Still got the Reavers, and
probably the Alliance between us
and him.
ZOE
It's a fair bet the Alliance knows
about Mr Universe. They're gonna
see this coming.
MAL
No.
He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
They're not gonna see this coming.
CLOSE ON: One of Serenity's jet engines, as it FIRES up.
He's talking with Mal and Wash again, very animated.
MR UNIVERSE
It's no problem! Bring it on
bring it on bring it on! From
here to the eyes and ears of the
'verse, that's my motto, or it
might be if I start having a motto.
MAL (ON SCREEN)
We won't be long.
MR UNIVERSE
You're gonna get caught in the ion
cloud, it'll play merry hob with
your radar, but pretty pretty
lights and a few miles after
you'll be right in my orbit.
MAL (ON SCREEN)
You'll let us know if anyone else
comes at you?
100.
DROP BACK WIDE to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in
the room, visible to Mr Universe but not to the screen.
MR UNIVERSE
You'll be the first.
CLOSE ON: the Operative's sword, as he unsheathes it.
As the Operative waits with the others.
HELMSMAN
I'm reading activity in the cloud.
THE OPERATIVE
(into com)
Lock and fire on my command.
(to himself)
You should have let me see her.
We should have done this as men.
Not with fire...
HELMSMAN
Sir!
,Wd
101.
He looks confused, then smiles at the ruse. Hits the com:
THE OPERATIVE
Vessel in range, lock on...
(ADMIRINGLY)
Bastard's not even changing
course...
The Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed.
THE OPERATIVE
That's not good...
HELMSMAN
(FREAKING)
Sir?
THE OPERATIVE
Target the Reavers!
(into com)
Target the Reavers! Target
everyone! Somebody FIRE!
Mal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down
Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us --
MAL
We're too close for them to arm --
ZOE
This is gonna be very tight --
4
102.
JAYNE
(ENTERING)
Hey look, we're upside down.
V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne.
WASH
(to himself)
I am a leaf on the wind, watch how
I soar.
Mal looks out at the chaos...
MAL
Chickens come home to roost...
They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another
ship -- Wash struggles to control her --
MAL
(CONTINUING)
The hell --
WASH
(PANICKY)
It's okay! I am a leaf on the
wind!
MAL
(also panicky)
What does that mean?
4
103.
As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves
to a door marked: DART. He puts his thumb to a panel and the
door slides up to reveal a standing, almost formfitting one-
man cockpit.
4 WASH
We're fried! I got no control!
Sparks -- and arcs of electricity -- are everywhere here.
Kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted -- Simon runs in and
pulls her out, slams the door shut on the erupting fires.
MAL
Where's the back up? Where's the
back up?
He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship
whirs to a semblance of life - -
ZOE
Back up reads at 20%..
(to Wash)-
Can you get us down?
WASH
I'm gonna have to glide her in!
40
104.
ZOE
Will that work?
WASH
140 Long as that landing strip is made
of fluffy pillows...
MAL
(on the com)
Everybody to the upper decks!
Strap yourselves to something!
Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
pulls out a seat as well, straps in.
Jayne, Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike "Batman the
Ride" seats from the ceiling, help the others in.
-40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
the body of the ship is hidden from it.
There is a moment of quiet.
WASH
I am a leaf on the wind. Watch --
A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole.
Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.
WASH!
She moves to him --
40
105.
ZOE
(CONTINUING)
Wash baby baby no, come on, you
gotta move you gotta move baby
VW please --
Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
slams through the window into the wall above them.
A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which
is the entrance proper to the facility.
Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the
black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that
point to an elevator some fifty feet away.
MAL
Come on. Jayne, rearguard.
Zoe slows, looking around her.
ZOE
Sir.
(he turns to her)
This is a good hold point_
MAL
We all stay together --
44
106
ZOE
No. They have to come through
here; they'll bottleneck and we
can thin 'em out. We get pushed
,oO
back there's the blast doors.
KAYLEE
I can rig 'em so they won't re-
open once they close.
MAL
Then shut 'em and hide til --
ZOE
We need to draw them til it's
done. This is the place. We'll
buy you the time.
JAYNE
(to the others)
Move those crates back there for
cover -- and make sure they ain't
filled with anything goes boom.
KAYLEE
Wait, Wash -- where's Wash?
Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm.
,No ZOE
He ain't comin'.
Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.
JAYNE
Move the gorram crates! Come on!
We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're
approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him.
ANGLE: HIS POV
Reavers rush toward them.
He turns to Jayne.
MAL
Tell me you brought 'em this
time...
Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own
and fastballs it at the Reavers.
J
107.
It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about.
Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut.
ANGLE: THE GRENADE
40
Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a
catwalk -- right in front of the door.
In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe
stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off.
MAL
(continuing; moving
back to Zoe)
Zoe... are you here?
She looks up at him.
ZOE
Do the job, sir.
MAL
You hold. Hold till I'm back.
He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone.
Jayne moves over to Zoe.
10
JAYNE
Captain's right. Can't be
thinking on revenge if we're gonna
get through this.
ZOE
You really think any of us are
gonna get through this?
He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat,
and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope:
JAYNE
I might...
The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of
screens and machines in the center of the space.
The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
been destroyed. The second:
1
108.
ANGLE: MR UNIVERSE is lying dead, eyes open, half draped on
his equally still lovebot. A trail of blood shows he crawled
from his chair.
V0
Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness,
and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice.
LOVEBOT
Mal.
Mal stops.
LOVEBOT
(CONTINUING)
Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me
with a sword. How weird is that?
I got... a short span here... they
destroyed my equipment but I have
a back-up unit... bottom of the
complex, right over the generator.
Hard to get to. I know they
missed it. They can't stop the
signal, Mal. They can never stop
the signal.
(BEAT)
Okay this is painful. On many
levels. I'm not --
A0
She turns back, powering down. Recording over.
A beat, and Mal takes off.
Inara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her
shuttle. River is in the corner, clutching her head.
RIVER
I can't shut them up...
SIMON
It's okay... -
RIVER
They're all made up of rage. I
can't...
A BANG as a body slams against the door.
SIMON
Just stay low. I'm right here.
4
109.
Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.
JAYNE
She picked a sweet bung of a time
to go helpless on us.
ZOE
(calls out)
Jayne and I take the first wave.
Nobody shoots less they get past
our fire.
Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
the door continue.
KAYLEE
Oh, I didn't plan on going out
like this. I think we did right,
but...
SIMON
I never planned... anything. I
just wanted to keep River safe.
Spent so much time on Serenity
trying to find us a home I never
realized I already had.
She looks at him with soft surprise.
140
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
My one true regret in all this is
never being with you.
KAYLEE
With me? You mean to say, as, sex?
SIMON
(SMILES)
I mean to say.
Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door.
KAYLEE
Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
door.
Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace.
ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges.
4
110.
A panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops
down, having clearly entered from a different location.
He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr
Universe and Lenore --
LOVEBOT
MAL
(The Operative turns)
Guy killed me, Mal.
Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.
MAL
Hard to get to. That's a fact.
lw
The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
squeeze through and charge.
Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
the door --
JAYNE
Zoe... Gorramnit...
But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the
bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
and she's rushed from behind ---
But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,
moving forward himself --
J
JAYNE
(CONTINUING)
ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line!
vo She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets
comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
his neck.
Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.
Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
as Mal gets shakily up.
MAL
(in pain)
Shot me in the back. I haven't...
made you angry, have I?
I s
THE OPERATIVE
There's a lot of innocent people
in the air being killed right now.
MAL
You have no idea how true that is.
There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing
off at ten paces.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
I know the secret now. The truth
that burned up River Tam's brain
and set you after her. And the
rest of the 'verse is gonna know
it too. 'Cause they need to.
THE OPERATIVE
You really believe that?
MAL
I do.
4
112.
THE OPERATIVE
You willing to die for that belief?
MAL
V0
I am.
The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Of course, that ain't exactly plan
A..
He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
the platform from above.
Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now,
squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
shirt, checks the wound.
SIMON
Spine's intact --
ZOE
Just gimme a bandage.
Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a
foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering.
40
113.
There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to
Zoe and opening fire --
A0
JAYNE
Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
Cheaters!
He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
Zoe shouts:
ZOE
Everybody fall back! Fall back!
Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
four by four, they stop.
ZOE
(CONTINUING)
Jayne! Grenade!
JAYNE
Very last one...
He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
the blast as she thinks.
ZOE
They're gonna get in --
KAYLEE
Can close it... from outside...
ZOE
No one's coming back from that...
She tries to stand, fails.
ZOE
(CONTINUING)
How much ammo do we have?
JAYNE
We got three full cartridges and
my swingin' cod. That's all.
Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.---
40
114.
INARA
Lift isn't moving...
ZOE
When they come, try to plug the
hole with 'em...
Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.
KAYLEE
I'm starting to lose some feeling
here... I think there's something
in them darts they throwed at me.
SIMON
Lie still. I'm gonna give you
something to counteract the --
He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
My bag.
and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.
INARA
Keep pressure here...
SIMON
My bag. Need... adrenaline... and
a shot of calaphar for Kaylee...
I can't... River...?
She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of
serenity to her, like she understands something now.
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
River... I'm sorry...
RIVER
No. No.
The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
again, but all the sound has bled out save these two.
4
115.
SIMON
I hate to... leave...
RIVER
You won't. You take care of me,
Simon. You've always taken care
of me.
She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face
an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.
RIVER
(CONTINUING)
My turn.
She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
over her.
ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.
Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
knocking over tools and computer parts.
The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.
MO
116.
Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.
THE OPERATIVE
You know what your sin is, Malcolm?
MAL
(shaky smile)
Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
still in his belly.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
But right now...
He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the
Operative. The smile gone.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath.
He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.
The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
and Simon is slipping away. Jayne looks at Zoe.
JAYNE
You suppose he got through? Think
Mal got the word out?
ZOE
(almost convincingly)
He got through. I know he got
through.
VO
117.
Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.
THE OPERATIVE
I'm sorry.
The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
You should know there's no shame
in this. You've done remarkable
things. But you're fighting a war
you've already lost.
He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
staggering force.
MAL
Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
unable to make a sound.
Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
hear his arms crack.
Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
sword, saying:
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Piece a shrapnel tore up that
nerve cluster my first tour. Had
it moved.
He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.
VO
118.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
you'd wanna say your famous last
MW words now. Just one trouble.
He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
I ain't gonna kill you.
He moves to the console, starts prepping it.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Hell, I'm gonna grant your
greatest wish.
He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
I'm gonna show you a world without
sin.
He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.
CARON (V.0.)
These are some of the first sites
we scouted on Miranda. There is
no one living on this planet.
There is no one...
Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...
CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.
And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly --
the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:
4
119.
River.
She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
above -- the mob.
She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.
The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.
The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
bleeding side.
ZOE
Sir?
140 MAL
It's done. Report?
Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
completely away.
Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...
SOLDIER
Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!
ANOTHER SOLDIER
Do we engage? Do we engage?
4
120.
Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at
her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting...
The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:
SOLDIER (O.S.)
Targets are acquired! Do we have
a kill order? Do we have an order?
CLOSE ON: THE SOLDIER'S FINGER, SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER...
BLACK OUT.
We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.
Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
she slides her arms around his chest...
Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
looking down at them with detached curiosity.
Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.
MAL
(to himself)
What a whiner...
ZOE
Sir, we have a green light.
Inspection's pos and we're clear
for upthrust.
MAL
Think she'll hold together?
J
124.
ZOE
She's tore up plenty. But she'll
fly true.
VW
A beat between them before:
MAL
Make sure everything's secure.
Could be bumpy.
ZOE
Always is.
She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.
Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
supplies.
MAL
We're taking her out. Should be
about a day's ride to get you back
to your girls.
INARA
Right.
VW
MAL
(moving past her)
You ready to get off this heap and
back to a civilized life?
INARA
I, uh...
(he stops)
I don't know.
He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.
MAL
Good answer.
He turns and heads into the bridge.
Mal eases himself into his seat. Takes a moment to adjust
one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left.

125.
MAL
You gonna ride shotgun, help me
fly?
V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
screens and buttons.
RIVER
That's the plan.
MAL
Think you can work out how to get
her in the --
She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
hums to life.
Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.
MAL
Okay, clearly some aptitude for
the... but it ain't all buttons
A0 and charts, .
You know what the first rule of
flying is? Well, I suppose you
do, since you already know what
I'm about to say.
RIVER
I do. But I like to hear you say
it.
He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
taking her up as he says:
MAL
Love. You can learn all the math
in the 'verse, but you take a boat
in the air you don't love, she'll
shake you off just as sure as the
turning of worlds. Love keeps her
in the air when she oughta fall
down, tells you she's hurting
'fore she keens. Makes her a home.
River also looks out at the sky.
126.
RIVER
Storm's getting worse.
MAL
We'll pass through it soon enough.
