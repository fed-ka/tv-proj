      Will walks backward out the front door, across the lawn, over 
      the sidewalk.  He is alone in the neighborhood in his P.O.V.

      ON WILL S FEET - OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      He walks backward past the LEGS OF DOZENS OF POLICE OFFICERS 
      and OFFICIALS, between the TIRES OF POLICE CARS.  

      POP WIDE - OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      The Police Officers, Detectives, Coroners and Crime-Scene 
      Specialists all part or stand by, averting their eyes as they 
      intentionally avoid looking at Will Graham backwards walking 
      through them toward the shadowy yard across the street.

      A Police Officer breaks protocol and sneaks a peek at Will.  
      A SUPERIOR OFFICER snaps and points at the Officer, who 
      quickly fixes his gaze on the ground in front of his feet.

      THE PENDULUM

      It continues to rhythmically FWUM-FWUM-FWUM through the scene 
      giving GLIMPSES between OMNISCIENT P.O.V. and WILL S P.O.V.

      ON WILL - WILL S P.O.V.

      The street is empty.  The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping 
      into place as Will snaps into focus.  He watches the quiet 
      house (he just back-walked out of) from across the street.  
      Through the partially curtained windows, he can see the 
      silhouettes of (still living) Theresa and Thomas Marlow.

      Will watches them for a long moment, taking in their 
        domesticity, then walks with purpose for the front door.

      OVERHEAD SHOT- OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      The crowd of Officers, Detectives, Coroners and Specialists 
      parts to allow Will Graham a direct path.

      ON WILL - WILL S P.O.V.

      He marches to the front door and VIOLENTLY KICKS IT IN.  The 
      HOME SECURITY ALARM BLARES.  Thomas Marlow rushes down the 
      stairs, two steps at a time, moving to intercept Will.                                                                                      3.


      Will raises a TOWEL-WRAPPED ARM.  Thomas realizes too late 
      that it s concealing a GUN.  Will SHOOTS HIM TWICE THROUGH 
      THE NECK.  The FIRED SHOTS, ENTRY WOUNDS, EXIT WOUNDS, and 
      PLUMES OF TERRYCLOTH DEBRIS are all QUICK CUT SLOW MOTION.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I shoot Mr. Marlow twice, severing 
                    jugulars and cartoids with near 
                    surgical precision.  He will die 
                    watching me take what is his away 
                    from him.  This is my design.

      Theresa Marlow is frantically pushing the panic code into the 
      HOME SECURITY KEY PAD when Will SHOOTS HER expertly THROUGH 
      THE THROAT, missing her jugular, BREAKING HER NECK and 
      peppering the KEY BAD with her blood.  The flow is much less 
      dramatic than it was with her husband.  Regardless, she drops 
      to the floor like a rag doll, instantly paralyzed.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    I shoot Mrs. Marlow expertly 
                    through the neck.  This is not a 
                    fatal wound.  The bullet misses 
                    every artery.  She is paralyzed 
                    before it leaves her body.  Which 
                    doesn t mean she can t feel pain.  
                    It just means she can t do anything 
                    about it.  This is my design.

      Will finishes punching in  OFF  on the ALARM CODE and the 
      BLARING HOME SECURITY ALARM is mercifully silenced.  The 
      PHONE IMMEDIATELY RINGS.  Will picks it up.

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    This is DDT Security.  Who am I 
                    speaking with?

      Will hangs up the phone, breaking character as he asks:

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I need the Incident Report from the 
                    Home Security company.

      CAMERA REVEALS Will is now holding the Incident Report.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                          (perusing the report)
                    This was recorded as a false alarm.  
                    There was a false alarm last week.
                          (then)
                    He tapped their phone.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                      4.



      A PHONE COMPANY REPAIRMAN has climbed to the top of the

                    Yup.

                                                                    SMASH BACK TO:


      CAMERA FOLLOWS Jack Crawford leading Will Graham across a 
      field of TRAINEES on a FIRING RANGE as another GROUP OF 
      TRAINEES in matching sweats jogs by.  A ROW OF SIGNS mounted 
      on a post read:  Hurt,   Agony,   Pain,   Love it,   Pride. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Eight girls from eight different 
                    Minnesota campuses abducted in the 
                    last eight months. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I thought there were seven.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    There were.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    When did you tag the eighth?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    About three minutes before I walked 
                    into your lecture hall.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You re calling them  abductions  
                    because you have no bodies?                                                                                      8.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We have nothing.  No bodies.  No 
                    parts of bodies.  Nothing that 
                    comes out of a body.  We have 
                    lonely swabs in used evidence kits. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Then those girls weren t taken from 
                    where you think they were taken.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Where were they taken from?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I don t know.  Someplace else.

      The FIRING RANGE ERUPTS into a BARRAGE OF GUN SHOTS.


      Establishing.  A CHYRON tells us we are --

      DULUTH, MINNESOTA

      ON MR. AND MRS. NICHOLS

      Emily s PARENTS.  They are sick with worry.  Mr. Nichols is 
      rationalizing while Mrs. Nichols seems almost resigned.

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    She could have gone off by herself.  
                    She was a very interior young 
                    woman.  She didn t like living in a 
                    dorm.  I could see how the pressure 
                    of school might have gotten to her.  
                    She likes trains.  Maybe she just 
                    got on a train and...

      We are --


      Will Graham has climbed out the window onto the porch roof.  
      He sits on the gritty shingles.  He hugs his knees, his damp 
      shirt pressed cold across his back.  He snorts the night air 
      to cleanse the smell of Emily Nichols death from his nose.

      From his vantage point, he can see POLICE OFFICERS, POLICE 
      CARS and other CRIME SCENE SPECIALISTS assembled on the lawn.  
      Mr. and Mrs. Nichols are treated in the back of an Ambulance.

      Will Graham takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness of Will Graham s mind, keeping 
      rhythm with his heart beat.  FWUM.  FWUM.  FWUM.                                                                                      16.


      ON WILL GRAHAM - WILL S P.O.V.

      He OPENS HIS EYES and he is standing outside Emily Nichols  
      Bedroom Window.  The neighborhood is quiet and empty.  No 
      Police.  No Police Cars.  No Ambulance.

      He looks through the face-less reflection of himself in the 
      window glass to Emily Nichols sleeping soundly in her bed.  
      Will quietly opens the window and climbs inside.


      Will slows considerably as he pulls along side A DOG.  A rope 
      around its neck suggests it was once tied to something.  No 
      collar, matted fur, nevertheless it trots with determination, 
      barely acknowledging Will as he rolls down his window.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Hello.

      The stray Dog stops and allows Will to drive past.  Will 
      slows to a stop and gets out of his car, at which point the 
      dog abruptly turns around and heads the opposite direction.

      Despite being absolutely exhausted emotionally and 
      physically, Will gets back in his car and u-turns on the road 
      to pursue the dog who is keeping a steady pace trotting away.

      Will goes around the Dog, blocking both lanes of the road 
      ahead of it Police Car style.  The Dog trots around his car 
      in a half-circle, continuing down the road on the other side.


      The Dog with the rope around its neck continues its sojourn 
      into the night, undeterred by anything up until this point.

      Then CAMERA REVEALS the Dog is trotting past Will sitting on 
      the bumper of his car, unwrapping a BAG OF HOTDOGS.

      The Dog stops.                                                                                    20.



      CAMERA FINDS the car, from which we can see a Minnesota girl 
      getting out, milquetoasted and wind-chaffed.  She is of the 
      same hair color, eye color, weight and height as Emily 
      Nichols and the seven young women before her.  

      Her name is ABIGAIL HOBBS.

      DIRTY HANDS

      They wipe away oil and shavings from the newly threaded pipe.

      ON ABIGAIL HOBBS

      She offers a small wave to the PIPE THREADER.  One dirty hand 
      offers a small wave in return.  She knows her killer.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      An academic atmosphere with ivy-covered neo-Gothic buildings, 
      populated with DOZENS OF STUDENTS, milling about, studying.

      A CHYRON tells us we are --

      UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

      CAMERA FINDS Jack Crawford walking with DR. ALANA BLOOM, a 
      beautiful Psychology Professor at the University in her 30s.                                                                                    26.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Graham likes you.  He doesn t think 
                    you run any mind games on him.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    I don t.  I m as honest with him as 
                    I d be with a patient.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Been observing him during your 
                    guest lectures at the academy?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    I ve never been in a room alone 
                    with Will. I want to be his friend.  
                    And I am.  You already asked me to 
                    do a study on him.  I said no.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Petersen upstairs wanted the study.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    You re the one who asked for it.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Seemed a shame not to take 
                      advantage, academically speaking.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Anything scholarly on Will Graham 
                    would be published posthumously.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    After you or after Graham?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                          (ignoring his question)
                    Will wants to think of this as a 
                    purely intellectual exercise, and 
                    in the narrow definition of 
                      forensics, that s what it is.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Why aren t you ever alone with him?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Because I have a professional 
                    curiosity about him.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    If he caught you peeking, he d 
                    snatch down the shades?                                                                                    27.


                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Normally I wouldn t even broach 
                    this, but what do you think one of 
                    Will s strongest drives is?

      Jack knows exactly what she s getting at.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Fear.  He deals with huge amounts 
                    of fear.  Comes with imagination.  

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    It s the price of imagination.  
                    What you don t mention on the big 
                    boys side of the playground. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Don t worry about telling me he s 
                    afraid.  I won t think he s not a 
                    stand up guy.  I m not an asshole.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    You re not a total asshole.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                      I wouldn t put him out there if I 
                    couldn t cover him -- if I couldn t 
                    cover him eighty percent. 

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                      I wouldn t put him out there.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He s out there.  And I need him out 
                    there.  And I need you to make sure 
                    he s not left out there.  Come back 
                    to Quantico with me.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    No.  Jack, you really don t want me 
                      commenting on this in any official 
                    capacity.  It wouldn t reflect well 
                    on you.  Sorry you wasted the trip.

      Jack heaves a frustrated breath and exhales:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    So am I.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Promise me something, Jack.  Don t 
                    let him get too close.  I think it 
                    would kill him to have to fight.                                                                                    28.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He won t have to fight.  I can 
                    promise you that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The garage door rolls up unceremoniously and the indistinct

      steps out of the car and pulls the storage unit door closed.


        A monumental STATE SIGN reads  MINNESOTA WELCOMES YOU.   The

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CAMERA FLOATS HIGH ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT:                                                                                    39.



      The UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA MARCHING BAND is performing its 
      half-time rendition of Fleetwood Mac s TUSK.  

      CONCESSION STANDS AND RESTROOMS

      Bustling with HUNDREDS OF FACULTY, STUDENTS, PARENTS and 
      VISITORS.  The Marching Band can be heard in the background.

      CAMERA FINDS CASSIE and ALICE, two attractive young MINNESOTA 
      GIRLS.  They move through the crowd heading toward...

      DISGUISED HANNIBAL

      He stands politely away from the crowd, a smoking cigarette 
      dangling from his gloved fingertips.  As the girls approach:

                                  CASSIE
                    Doesn t use them.  Rolls up toilet 
                    paper in tight little wads.  Her 
                    family is really poor.  It s gross.

                                  ALICE
                    Too poor to buy tampons?

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe it s an OCD thing.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    OCD is something else altogether.

      She shoots him a look, but sees his cigarette and wants one.

                                  CASSIE
                    You got another cigarette?

      Hannibal fishes through pockets for the box of cigarettes.

                                  HANNIBAL
                          (playful)
                    I have to ask you to start over.  I 
                    simply cannot reward rude behavior.  
                    It s unspeakably ugly to me.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yawn.  Just give me the cigarette 
                    or I have to make you hate me.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Don t do that.

                                  CASSIE
                    I have qualities.                                                                                    40.


                                  HANNIBAL
                    That make people hate you?

      Hannibal shakes a cigarette out of the box and offers it.

                                  CASSIE
                    I can be very judgemental.  There s 
                    a fat girl on my floor and she s a 
                      vegetarian and that pisses me off.

      She takes the cigarette and he lights it.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    The fat or the vegetarian?

                                  CASSIE
                    Both.  Existing in one entity.  I 
                    guess there s no meat in a Twinkie.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    No.  None at all.

                                  CASSIE
                    Aren t you gonna watch the game?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I know very little about the sport.

                                  CASSIE
                    Then why are you here?  Piss off.

      Cassie heaves an exhausted, annoyed sigh as she casually 
      blows smoke in Hannibal s face before turning away.

      Hannibal smiles.  Then coughs.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FIVE

      CASSIE S DEAD BODY

      She has similar WOUNDS across her torso to the ones seen on 
      Emily Nichols, as well as TWO LARGE PUNCTURES on her chest.  
      The ANTLERS she is impaled on tastefully mask her nudity, 
      along with the small MURDER OF CROWS gathered around her.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...

      A HORRIFIC TABLEAU

      Cassie s body is mounted like a TABLE TOP on ANTLER TABLE 
      LEGS belonging to the SEVERED HEAD of a TROPHY STAG.  The 
      CROWS give the impression of guests at a dinner table.

      We are -- 


      CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK under the POLICE TAPE, which 
      Jack Crawford and Will Graham are presently stepping over.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I feel like I m dreaming.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    The head was reported stolen last 
                    night about a mile from here.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Just the head?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      A couple of flannel-wearing, down-vest-sporting HUNTERS mosey 
      across the parking lot toward their gun-rack-equipped TRUCK. 
      CAMERA REVEALS the HEADLESS STAG strapped to its hood.

      The TWO HUNTERS stop short, jaws falling slack.

      Brian Zeller, Beverly Katz, and Jimmy Price are combing the 
      immediate area for forensic evidence.  Jack and Will stare as 
      Beverly and Brian Zeller attempt to shoo the crows away.                                                                                    42.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                      Minneapolis homicide has already 
                    made a statement.  They re calling 
                    him the  Minnesota Shrike. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Like the bird?

      Jimmy Price stands out of the tall grass nearby.

                                  JIMMY PRICE
                    Shrike s a perching bird.  Impales 
                    mice and lizards on thorny branches 
                    and barbed wire.  Rips their organs 
                    right out of their bodies.  Puts 
                    them in a little birdie pantry and 
                    eats them later.  At its leisure.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Sounds about right.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Is he self-destructing?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    If he were self-destructing he 
                    wouldn t be so meticulous.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Can t tell if it s sloppy or shrewd.    

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He wanted her to be found this way.  
                    It s the homicidal equivalent of 
                    fecal smearing.  It s petulant.   I 
                    almost feel like he s mocking her.
                          (then)
                    Or he s mocking us.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Where d all his love go?  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Whoever tucked Emily Nichols into 
                    bed didn t paint this picture.  

      Brian Zeller looks up from Cassie s mounted corpse.

                                  BRIAN ZELLER
                    He took her lungs.  I think she was 
                    still alive when he cut them out.

                                                                    QUICK POP TO:                                                                                    43.


      THE MISSING LUNGS

      Raw and cleaned.  We are --


      Will has finally turned away to give his soul some relief.  
      Jack Crawford and Brian Zeller stand over the table that is 
      CASSIE S BODY.  Beverly Katz and Jimmy Price work nearby.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    What do they call it when the copy 
                    cat is crazier than the original?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You have the  Evil Minds  museum.
                          (then)
                    Our cannibal loves women.  He 
                    doesn t want to destroy them.  He 
                    wants to consume them.  Keep some 
                    part of them inside him.  This 
                    girl s killer that she was a pig.

      Will takes in the open field, considering the stage.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    The cannibal who killed Emily 
                    Nichols had a place to do it and no 
                    real interest in field Kabuki.  He 
                    has a house, maybe two, or a cabin.  
                    Something with an antler room.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We re already looking at Minnesota 
                      steamfitters and plumbers and 
                    people with hunting licenses.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He would have a daughter.  Same age 
                    as the other girls.  Same hair color, 
                    same eye color, same height, same 
                    weight.  She would be an only child.  
                    She s leaving home.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    44.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    He can t stand the thought of losing 
                    her.  She s his Golden Ticket. 

                                                                    QUICK POP TO:

      THE MISSING LUNGS - HANNIBAL LECTER S KITCHEN

      Hannibal dunks the offal into a gently simmering wine stock.

      Hannibal fries the meat with onions and tomatoes.

                                                                      POP BACK TO:


      Jack Crawford and Will Graham stare at the horrible tableau. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    What about the Copy Cat?  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    An intelligent psychopath, 
                      particularly a sadist, is hard to 
                    catch.  There s no traceable 
                    motive.  There ll be no patterns.  
                    He may never kill like this again.

      Will turns and crosses under the POLICE TAPE, tossing back:

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Have Dr. Lecter work up a 
                      psychological profile.  You seem to 
                    be impressed with his opinion.

      THE MISSING LUNGS - HANNIBAL LECTER S DINING ROOM

      Hannibal takes a bite and washes it down with a sip of wine.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      A syrupy MORNING FOG blankets the road.  Will Graham, 
      completely naked, stumbles INTO FRAME, dazed.  He glances up 
      just as HEADLIGHTS cut through the mist, blinding him.

      Then... 

      Will is suddenly, brutally TRAMPLED/GORED by a LARGE STAG 
      COVERED WITH BLACK CROW FEATHERS.  OFF the IMPACT of the 
      FEATHERED DEER KNOCKING Will OUT OF FRAME...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    45.


      A CLOSED DOOR

      A distorted image of SOMEONE KNOCKING rolls across the fish-
      eye lens of the PEEP HOLE.  KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.  We are --


      Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter step out of their rental car 
      and cross toward a CAMPER TRAILER OFFICE.


      Will, Hannibal and Dixie haul file boxes from the make-shift 
      office building to the trunk of their rental car.

      Hannibal allows himself to knock a box out of the trunk, 
      scattering papers.  Will and Dixie stoop to pick them up.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I got it.

      As Will and Dixie pick up the pages, Hannibal returns to:


      A cozy, well-kept tract home stands unobtrusively amongst 
      aesthetically similar homes.  BLOOD-SPATTERED Will leans 
      against his rental car idling across the street. 

      A circus of AMBULANCES, PARAMEDICS, POLICE CARS and OFFICERS.  

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      He takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness of Will s mind.  FWUM.  FWUM. FWUM.

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      His eyes are still closed.  The PENDULUM is now outside his 
      head.  It swings in front of his eyes, wiping away the POLICE 
      CARS and OFFICERS.  FWUM.  The PENDULUM swings across his 
      bloodied face and the horrible streaks of madness vanish.

      Will opens his eyes.  We are --


      The crime scene has now been decriminalized in Will s mind.  

      Will pops a Bufferin behind the wheel of the rental car.  
      Lector unbuckles his seatbelt on the passenger side.  Will 
      thinks a moment before getting out.

      Hannibal smiles, a hint of excitement. 


      Will walks purposefully to the front door, trying his best 
      not to look uncomfortable.  Hannibal purposefully lags 
      behind.  Will is halfway to the door when it suddenly opens:                                                                                    52.


      LOUISE HOBBS

      Bleeding and wheezing, she is shoved down the porch steps in 
      a heap, the door slamming shut behind her.

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      He rushes to DYING LOUISE HOBBS.  Her alabaster skin in sharp 
      contrast to the crimson pouring out of it.  Multiple wounds 
      puncture her torso and arms.  She grasps haltingly for Will, 
      streaking him with her blood. 

      Her cold hand clutches his wrist as her body spasms. She s 
      already gone and Will knows this. 

      He pries her slick, red fingers from his wrist, trying not to 
      see the last flickers of pain and fear exciting her face. 

      THE DOOR

      Will smashes into it with everything he s got. It s hard to 
      say whether the sickening crack was from his shoulder or the 
      its wood frame. He gives it a well-placed kick, and another, 
      splintering it little-by-little until he can stumble INSIDE. 

      ON HANNIBAL LECTOR

      He strolls casually up the walk, barely glancing at the 
      lifeless body of Louise Hobbs stepping deliberately over it. 

      He pauses in the broken doorway, listening closely.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:


      A CHYRON tells us we are --

      CHIPPEWA NATIONAL FOREST, MINNESOTA

      Jack Crawford is the first in a bevy of FBI AGENTS moving 
      toward the Cabin door.  He nods to the BIG AGENT beside him. 

      SMASH! One kick sends the door off its hinges.                                                                                    54.
