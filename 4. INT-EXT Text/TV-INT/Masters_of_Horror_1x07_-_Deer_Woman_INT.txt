      CLOSE ON a triangle of POOL BALLS as they are broken by the first shot. 
      This is a truck stop bar, and business is good. Tipsy, laughing TRUCKERS 
      wander from table to table, generally being happy. 

      At the pool table, WALLY, a grizzled trucker in his late 40s, takes his 
      shot. He sinks two balls in the corner pocket. His opponent, TRUCKER #1, 
      sets down his beer. 

                                      TRUCKER #1 
                              (slurs) 
                        All right, I'm going to go drain the 
                        snake. Wally! Watch my beer. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Well, you're gonna have to use the 
                        woods, man, because the toilet's 
                        broken. 

                                      TRUCKER #1 
                        Aaah! Bullshit! 

      Trucker #1 heads out. Wally takes another shot. 


      The room is lit with early morning sun and BIRDS CHIRP. AN ALARM BUZZES 
      and an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE comes over the RADIO. 

                                      RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 (V/O) 
                        This is Jerry, Lisa and Tom at 95.2, 
                        the FM stock station. Now, I think 
                        yesterday I started the show with a 
                        story that would possibly make you 
                        upset and cry, about the dog. 



 2       PAN ALONG to Dwight's rumpled bed. A half-eaten pizza sits in its box 
      above the sheets. 

                                      RADIO ANNOUNCER #2 (V/O) 
                        Oh, yeah. The, uh... 

                                      RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 (V/O) 
                        The dissection. Well, now there's 
                        another story that's going to make you 
                        upset and cry, from the Internet this 
                        time, coming to us from Tallahassee& 

      OFFICER DWIGHT FARADAY, late 40s, unshaven and unkempt, lies in bed. He 
      stares at the ceiling. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Shut up! 

      Dwight slaps the snooze button, knocking over a framed picture as he 
      does so. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Goddamn it. 

      He sits up and picks up the picture. REVEAL it to be of a pretty blonde 
      woman, CATHY. She is on a beach, sporting a sunhat and a wide smile. He 
      sadly contemplates it for a beat, then replaces it on the night table. 
      He buries his head in his hands. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Son of a bitch. 
                                (beat) 
                        Oh, God. 


      PHONES RING and OFFICERS bustle about. Dwight enters. He moves to his 
      desk, takes off his coat, and sits. CLOSE ON a framed photo of himself 
      and Cathy at the beach, looking happy. 

      DISSOLVE TO  

      SLOW MOTION as Officers and EMPLOYEES go about their business all around 
      Dwight as he sits at his desk in a daze. The CAMERA MOVES IN on him. He 
      sits, practically paralysed, as life goes on about him. 

      RESUME REGULAR MOTION as a young African-American officer in uniform, 
      JACOB REED, approaches. 



 3                                       REED 
                        Faraday? 

      Dwight stares at him for a beat. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah? 

                                      REED 
                        We're going out on a call. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Why am I going out on a call? 

                                      REED 
                        Einhorn said to take you. Said the call 
                        was a little&weird. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        So now I'm the "weird call guy," huh? 

                                      REED 
                        Yeah, 'cause you know, you've been so 
                        busy, he figured-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                        All right, all right. All right. All 
                        right. I'm coming. 

      He stands. 


      Reed and Dwight move along. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Okay, what's so weird about this? 

                                      REED 
                        Possible dead body. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Possible? 

                                      REED 
                        Yeah. "Possible." 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Well, is there a dead guy or isn't 
                        there a dead guy? 

                                      REED 
                        Caller said he didn't know what it was. 

 4                                       DWIGHT 
                                (sarcastic) 
                        Ooh, spooky. 

      They move through a set of double doors. 


      They continue along. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        And why couldn't another uniform do 
                        this? 

                                      REED 
                        It's out in Red County. Our patrols 
                        don't usually go that far unless we get 
                      a call. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        And we got a call, huh? 

                                      REED 
                        We got a call. 

      Reed moves off. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah, well, I m the "weird calls guy," 
                        huh? 

      Dwight follows. 


      Trucker #2 is in the driver's seat. Dwight climbs in, followed by Reed. 
      The men stare into the back of the cab. They are rendered speechless. 

                                      REED 
                        Oh, Jesus. 

      Reed moves off. 

                                      TRUCKER #2 
                        Now, tell me honestly, buddy. What the 
                        fuck is that? 

      Dwight stares intently. 

                                      TRUCKER #2 (CONT'D) 
                      I was thinking' at first it was may be 
                      a dead animal, but now& 

      REVEAL the gory sight   an ENORMOUS MOUND of BLOODY FLESH. 

                                      TRUCKER #2 (CONT'D) 
                        What are you doin'? What do you think? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't know. 
                                (beat) 
                        Has anyone touched this or anything? 

                                      TRUCKER #2 
                        Oh, no. No. I made sure nobody fooled 
                        with it. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Right. 

      Spotting something, Dwight snaps on a latex glove. He picks up the 
      bloody remains of a human jaw. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Holy shit. 


      Faraday is at the counter, interviewing the OWNER of the 
      truck stop. 




 7                                       OWNER 
                        And that was about 11:40 that he left 
                        with her, and he looked out of it. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Define "out of it." 

                                      OWNER 
                        Drunk. He looked drunk. 

      Dwight makes a note. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What more can you tell me about this 
                        woman? 

                                      OWNER 
                        Aw, let me think... 
                                (beat) 
                        Indian, I think. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Indian? 

                                      OWNER 
                        You know, American Indian, like, uh, 
                        Native American. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Right, I got it. Go ahead. 

                                      OWNER 
                        Long, black hair. She had, uh, sharp 
                        features, like she was perfectly 
                        carved, like someone really took time 
                        making her. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Can I get a height? 

                                      OWNER 
                        She was, maybe, five foot five, maybe 
                        six. 

      Dwight makes a note. The Owner leans down close to Dwight. He lowers his 
      voice. 

                                      OWNER (CONT'D) 
                        And, uh, she was just real sexy, you 
                        know? One of those where you look at 
                        her and all you could think was, "man, 
                      I gotta hit that. I gotta hit it." 


 8                                       DWIGHT 
                        Pardon me. "Hit that?" 

                                      OWNER 
                        Fuck her. 

      Dwight raises his eyebrows. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Ah. 

      The Owner straightens. 

                                      OWNER 
                        And she had these eyes, like, maybe 
                        they were contacts, but maybe, like, 
                        yellow eyes, y'know? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Okay, so&what, light brown? 

                                      OWNER 
                        No, man. Yellow, like a& 
                                (beat) 
                        Like a deer caught in the headlights of 
                        your car. 

      The DOOR OPENS O/S. 

                                        PATTERSON (O/S) 
                        All right. 

    A muscular young man with a confident gait enters. This is Detective 
      JOHN PATTERSON. 

                                        PATTERSON (CONT'D) 
                        Who's in charge of the scene? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        That would be me. 

      Patterson SCOFFS. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Great. 

      He stalks towards Dwight and sits beside him. 

                                        PATTERSON (CONT'D) 
                        Well, I hope you didn't manage to lose 
                        the body or something. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Nope. Everything's copasetic. 


 9                                         PATTERSON 
                        Copasetic. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. Everything's cool. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Whatever. Just give me your notes. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I thought Einhorn was giving me this 
                        one. 

      Patterson puts a hand on Dwight's shoulder. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        In your dreams, Duh-white. This one is 
                        all me. You see, I'd say this falls 
                        under the "violent crimes" category, 
                        not insurance fraud, or incest, or 
                        whatever bullshit they ve got you up to 
                        these days. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Animal attacks. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Right. Sure. Animal attacks. So tell 
                        me, does this look like an animal 
                        attack to you? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Actually, they were telling me they saw 
                        some deer over by the truck. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Right, right. So a deer rips this guy's 
                        truck door off& 

      The Owner smiles. 

                                        PATTERSON (CONT'D) 
                        Beats him with a sledgehammer until he 
                        looks like surrealist art, then, what? 
                        Retires to his chateau in the woods to 
                        plan his next attack? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I didn't ask for this call. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Whatever. Like you haven't been begging 
                        for a reason to get out of the station. 


 10       Dwight looks to the Owner. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Detective Patterson will be taking over 
                        for me. 
                              (closes his notebook) 
                        Have a nice day. 

      The Owner nods. 


    A TEENY LAP DOG YIPS. At his desk, Dwight rolls his eyes as 
      he takes notes from the dog's owner, an ELDERLY WOMAN. 
      Beside her sits a tearful ELDERLY MAN. He cradles a DEAD 
      MONKEY in his arms. The dog YIPS and PANTS. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN 
                        Of course, that was before we moved to 
                        Seattle, and I'd never seen anyone own 
                      a monkey there. I didn't even think 
                        owning a monkey was legal, in fact. I 
                        think you better check that out. 


 11       On a nonplussed Dwight. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yes, ma'am. 

      REVEAL Dwight's pad, on which he sketches a cartoon of a monkey in 
      handcuffs. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN 
                        Did you make a note of that? That 
                        owning monkeys is illegal? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yes ma'am, I made a note to check it 
                        out. Yes, I did. 

      Over the cartoon, Dwight writes "monkey illegal?" 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN 
                        Of course, he was always a vicious 
                        little thing. In fact, he nearly killed 
                        my neighbour's cat. 

      Dwight looks off. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D) 
                        He just picked it up and twirled it 
                        around and around and around. It hit 
                        that wall. 

      He spots a horseshoe hanging above a display case. He sketches a hoof 
      print beside the monkey cartoon. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D O/S) 
                        That poor cat! 

      The Woman whimpers. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh! I can't have five husbands looking 
                        after these-- 

      Dwight draws another horseshoe, then a deer hoof. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Excuse me? 

      The Woman glares at him. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Excuse me? 

      Dwight looks to the horseshoe. 



 12                                       DWIGHT 
                        It started at the groin. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN 
                        What did you just say? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        The trampling. It was a trampling. It 
                        started at the groin, then worked its 
                        way up and then back down the body, 
                        maybe 15&16 times. That's why it didn't 
                        look like a body at first. The torso 
                        was shattered and caved inward. 

                                      ELDERLY WOMAN 
                        What? 

      Dwight thinks for a beat. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        It was nice talking to you, ma'am. 

      He spots the monkey. The Elderly Man sobs. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                              (to Elderly Man) 
                        I'm sorry for your loss. 

      He gets up and crosses to a desk where an OFFICER works. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Did the morgue get in that body from 
                        Red County yet? 

                                      OFFICER 
                        Yes, Sir, it's already on the table. 
                        The family's requested it, but we're 
                        just going to keep it for a little 
                        longer&see if we can dredge something 
                        up. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What name is it under? 

                                      OFFICER 
                        The guy's name was Multoy. 
                              (checks the computer) 
                        Uh, yeah. Henry Multoy. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Sign me in so I can take a look at it, 
                        will you? 


 13                                       OFFICER 
                        They're actually in the middle of 
                        checking it out right now. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Who's the, uh& 

      The Officer smiles. 

                                      OFFICER 
                        Dana. 

      Dwight's face falls. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Great. 


      CLOSE ON a scalpel cutting into flesh. PAN UP to REVEAL that the person 
      holding the scalpel is a pretty blonde woman, late 20s, with pink hair 
      and several piercings in her face. This is DANA. GOTH ROCK FILTERS 
      through the earphones of her MP3 player. She HUMS CHEERFULLY as she 
      places a handful of intestines in a scale. 

      Dwight enters. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Hey, Dana. 

      An oblivious Dana works. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Dana? 

      Dana works away. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Dana? 

      He watches her work for a beat. Then  

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                              (shouts) 
                        Dana! 

      She GASPS. 

                                      DANA 
                        Christ! 

      She pulls out her earphones. 





 14                                       DWIGHT 
                      I thought they stopped letting you wear 
                        your, uh... 
                              (gestures at his 
                              face) 
                        Face things. 

                                      DANA 
                        Yeah, well, no one else would take this 
                        guy, so I figured fuck 'em, right? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What do you mean no one else would take 
                        him? 

                                      DANA 
                        Just that. No one on staff would look 
                        at him for more than a couple of 
                        seconds. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Aren't you people trained to handle 
                        this kind of stuff? 

                                      DANA 
                        Yeah. That's what I said. 

      CLOSE ON Dana's bootied foot. A THUMB PLOPS to the floor next to it. 
      Dwight furrows his brow. He leans down for a closer inspection. He 
      straightens and gives her an expectant look. 

                                      DANA (CONT'D) 
                      I should probably get that. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. 

      Dana reaches down and grabs the thumb. She places it in the scale. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Do we have a cause of death yet? 

                                      DANA 
                        Well, massive blunt force trauma would 
                        be a sort of obvious guess. This guy 
                        got levelled. It looks like a truck ran 
                        over him, then backed over him, then 
                        ran over-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                      I get it. I get it. But it wasn't a 
                        truck. 

 15                                       DANA 
                        No. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Have any clue what it was? 

                                      DANA 
                        Not the slightest. I mean, I've really 
                        only got one thing for sure so far. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What's that? 

                                      DANA 
                        He died with a... 
                                (rolls her eyes) 
                        He died in a state of arousal. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        How can you tell that? 

      She pulls back the cloth. 

                                      DANA 
                              (points) 
                        You see this? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. 

                                      DANA 
                        That was his penis. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (gags) 
                        Uh-huh. 

                                      DANA 
                        You see these lines here? These are 
                        stress fractures. You wouldn't see 
                        those if he was flaccid. Something 
                        snapped his penis. 

      Dwight takes this in. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What do you mean, "snapped?" 

                                      DANA 
                      I mean, snapped. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Okay, look, I had a thought. 



 16                                       DANA 
                        Isn't this Patterson's case? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yes, but I was first on the scene& 
                                (beat) 
                        And I have an interest. 

                                      DANA 
                      I thought you were off homicide. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I am, but there's a chance this is an 
                        animal attack. 

      An unconvinced Dana stares at him for a beat. 

                                      DANA 
                        Really? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. 
                              (points to the cadaver) 
                        Here, look. 

                                      DANA 
                        What am I looking at? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Just look. 

      She stares at the body for a beat. She looks up at Dwight. 

                                      DANA 
                        Hoof prints. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (nods) 
                        Hoof prints. 



      The painted deer dissolves to an actual stuffed DEER HEAD mounted on the 
      wall. Below it stands the beautiful, yellow-eyed DEER WOMAN. She gazes 
      across the room. REVEAL a young BUSINESSMAN at the bar. He speaks into 
      his cellphone. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN 
                              (into phone) 
                      I couldn't get a flight out until 
                        tomorrow morning, so I'll have an early 
                        dinner and call it a night. 
                                (beat) 
                        What? 
                                (beat) 
                        Well, right now I'm having a scotch to 
                        celebrate the deal. 

      The Deer Woman sidles up and sits next to him. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Good. 
                                (beat) 
                        Right. 
                                (beat) 
                        Okay, see you in the office on 
                        Thursday. Fine. Bye. 

      He hangs up and glances at the Woman, clearly taken aback by 
      her beauty. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN 
                        Hi. 

      She smiles brightly. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Can I buy you a drink? 

      She lowers her eyes, then smiles even wider. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                      I bet I know what you want. 

      She raises her eyebrows. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                      A Cosmopolitan? 

      She smiles. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Am I right? 

      She nods. 

 18                                       BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                              (smiles) 
                        Yes! 

      He gestures to the Bartender. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Bartender, a Cosmopolitan for the lady. 

      He looks to the Woman. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        I'm only here for one night. Can you 
                        recommend a good restaurant for dinner? 

      The Bartender sets down her drink. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh. Thank you, my good man. 

      He raises his glass. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Cheers. 

      They CLINK glasses. He downs his scotch in a single gulp. She sets down 
      her drink without taking a sip. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        So, are you here all by yourself? 

      She nods. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        Well, this is my lucky day. Would you 
                        care to join me for dinner? 

      She thinks for a beat. She smiles and nods. He chuckles to 
      himself. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                      I can't believe how well this day is 
                        going. 

      She looks over to the lobby. He notices. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        You&you want to go? 

      She rises and starts out. He tosses some bills on the bar and follows. 






      The Businessman enters and turns on the lights. The Deer Woman follows 
      him in, locking the door behind her, a wide smile upon her lips. She 
      removes her shawl and drops it to the floor. He watches as she sidles up 
      to him. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN 
                        Are you hungry? Should we call room 
                        service? 

      She pushes him down on the bed. She takes a few steps back and removes 
      her blouse. He stares in stunned silence. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        You don't fool around do you? 

      She sashays up to him and undoes his pants. He grins. 

                                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) 
                        This is definitely my lucky day. 


      Dana sits at the examination table, eating a sandwich. 

                                      DANA 
                        So this man lures a woman into his 
                        truck. He tries to have sex with her. 

      Dwight sits across from her. 

                                      DANA (CONT'D) 
                        She gets mad and leaves. Then a deer 
                        comes and stomps the man to death. 

      Dwight SIGHS deeply, then stands and paces. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Okay, problems. One, there's not a deer 
                        in the world that could do this kind of 
                        damage. Two, the "something" kicked out 
                        the door from the inside. And three, 
                        what happened to the girl? 

                                      DANA 
                        She went home? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        How did she get home? She disappeared. 
                        And where did the deer come from? 




 20                                       DANA 
                        Maybe the girl went cold and he had a 
                        deer handy as a replacement. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        It would be a lot easier to think of 
                        this objectively if it wasn't so damn 
                        stupid. 

                                      DANA 
                        Maybe it was something else. You know, 
                      I mean, other animals have hooves. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        No. Trust me, those are deer hooves. 

                                      DANA 
                        Maybe the girl beat him to death with a 
                        deer leg. 

      Dwight narrows his eyes at this. 

                                      DANA (CONT'D) 
                        What's wrong? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        That's just one of those sentences that 
                        you never expect to hear. 

                                      DANA 
                        How do you think I feel saying it? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (checks his watch) 
                        Okay, look, it's 1 a.m. We've been at 
                        this for hours and the best we have is 
                        murder by taxidermy. Okay, I should be 
                        home in bed. 

      He dons his jacket. 

                                      DANA 
                        And I should be out partying. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Right. Thanks for your time, Dana. 

                                      DANA 
                        No, no problem. 

      He starts off. 



 21                                       DANA (CONT'D) 
                        So, um&are you going to ask to be 
                          reassigned, or-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (surprised) 
                        No. 
                              (thinks) 
                        No. It was just a hunch. No, tomorrow 
                        it's back to dog bites and lost cats. 

      Dana laughs. Dwight moves off. 


      Dwight lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. After a few 
      moments, he rolls over and closes his eyes. 


      COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS. A lonely-looking trucker, HENRY sits at the bar and 
      sips a beer. He spots something O/S and narrows his eyes in disbelief. 
      REVEAL a woman's pair of sexy, heeled boots. PAN UP her shapely legs, 
      skin-tight denim cut-offs, and low-cut bustier to REVEAL a smiling, sexy 
      BLONDE. Henry smiles back. 


      Henry and the Blonde laugh as they settle into the cab. They kiss. He 
      pulls back and watches lustily as she unbuttons her bustier. He begins 
      humming a STRIPTEASE. 

                                      HENRY 
                                (hums) 
                        Da&da&da& 


 22       She GIGGLES as she undoes the last button and dangles the bustier before 
      him. He LAUGHS. Clad in only her cut-offs and a lacy black bra, she 
      wriggles and writhes. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Oh, wow. 

      She cocks her head and smiles. He SIGHS. She smiles as she reaches 
      behind and produce a DEER HOOF. A perplexed Henry cocks his head. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Huh? 

      Her eyes go wild. She lunges forward and STRIKES Henry in the head, over 
      and over. He SCREAMS. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Oh my God! 

      She THWACKS him again and again. Blood spatters. He HOWLS in pain. 


      Dwight lies in bed, staring into space. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Stupid. 


      The Blonde settles into the cab. He joins her and they start kissing. 
      She pulls away after a beat. 

                                      BLONDE 
                        There it is again. 

      He points to the door. 

                                      HENRY 
                        It's over there. 


      Dwight lies in bed, staring into space. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Retarded. 


      They settle into the cab and wrap their arms around each other. He 
      removes her top and kisses her neck. Suddenly, her eyes go wide with 
      terror. REVEAL a silly-looking DEER MONSTER, fashioned from an ENORMOUS 
      STUFFED DEER HEAD on a man's body, straight out of a B-grade horror 
      movie. 

      Henry and the Blonde SCREAM. It STRIKES Henry with its hoof over and 
      over. The Blonde SCREAMS. 


      Dwight looks disgruntled, staring at the ceiling. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Fuck. 


      The Deer Woman enters. Cagey, she glances around. She inspects a bouquet 
      of plastic flowers. Behind the counter, the PAWN SHOP OWNER spots her. 
      He smiles lustily. She spots him and smiles back. 

                                      PAWN SHOP OWNER 
                        Can I help you? 

      He waggles his eyebrows up and down. She smiles brightly. He nods with 
      approval. Suddenly, she narrows her eyes and her expression darkens. He 
      furrows his brow. 


      Dwight sits at his desk, completely zoned out as he stares at the photo 
      of Cathy. Reed approaches. He sits at stares at the oblivious Dwight. 

                                      REED 
                                (claps his hands) 
                        Yo, Dwight. 

      Dwight snaps to. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. Yeah? Yes, what? 

      Reed chuckles. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        What is it? 

                                      REED 
                      I just thought you should know they 
                        found another one of those things. 

      Dwight straightens some items on his desk. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Pardon me, "things"? 

                                      REED 
                        Another one of those hamburger things. 
                        You know, trampled to death. 

      Dwight looks up at this. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        They just brought in the body this 
                        morning. I only know because Patterson 
                        was having a hissy fit about you 
                        playing with his corpse. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I didn't "play" with it-- 

 26                                       REED 
                              (laughs) 
                        Whatever, man. 

      An uneasy Dwight straightens his tie. Reed leans in close. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Hey, tell me honestly. Why aren't you 
                        ever doing anything? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Excuse me? 

                                      REED 
                        I've been here for five months. Up 
                        until yesterday, I'd talked to you 
                        twice. But I see you every day. You're 
                        always sitting right there and your 
                        eyes are always right about... 
                              (points to the photo) 
                        There. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What's your point, Reed? 

                                      REED 
                        Well, I've never heard of a detective 
                        that was assigned exclusively to animal 
                        attacks. What happened? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      A lot happened. 

                                      REED 
                        May we delve? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        No. 

                                      REED 
                        Aw, man, you're no fun. 

      Dwight glares at him. Reed looks to the photo. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Is that your wife? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        We're separated, actually. 

                                      REED 
                        Shit. I'm sorry. 


 27                                       DWIGHT 
                        Hey, don't worry about it, man. Don't 
                        worry about it. 
                                (beat) 
                        What are you doing right now? 

                                      REED 
                        Me? 
                                (looks around) 
                        Bothering you, I guess. I was supposed 
                        to go down to the firing range, but I 
                        don't have much to do-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                        You want to go to the morgue and get a 
                        look at that new cadaver? 

      There is a beat of silence. 

                                      REED 
                        That's not the sort of stuff I do for 
                        fun. 


      Reed and Dwight stand over the examination table. Dana pulls a sheet 
      back to reveal another mutilated body. 

                                      REED 
                        Christ. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Start working the highway, Reed. It'll 
                        toughen you up a little bit to stuff 
                        like this. 

                                      DANA 
                        Same MO, basically. Massive blunt force 
                        trauma, died in a state of arousal, you 
                        know the deal. But then& 

      She crosses the room. 

                                      DANA (CONT'D) 
                      I found this. 

      She holds up a slide and sets it under a microscope. 

                                      DANA (CONT'D) 
                        Under his fingernails. 

      Dwight moves to the microscope and looks into it. 



 28                                       DWIGHT 
                        That can't be human hair. 

                                      DANA 
                        Yeah. It's deer hair. 

                                      REED 
                        Deer hair? 

                                      DANA 
                        Yeah. It looks like it got pulled out 
                        during the struggle. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Hmm. 

                                      REED 
                        "Hmm?" Someone gets sliced and diced in 
                      a struggle with a deer in a hotel room 
                        and your response is "hmm?" 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        He was in a hotel? 

                                      DANA 
                        That's what it says in the file. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Then we must have witnesses saying they 
                        saw him there, right? 

                                      DANA 
                        Yeah. With a girl. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Do they have a description? 

                                      DANA 
                        They have three. 

      They move back to the table. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Dark skin, long dark hair? 

                                      DANA 
                        You got it, but that's about all they 
                        have in common. We've got three 
                        different heights, three different 
                          weights...although they all agree she 
                        was gorgeous.

                                (looks at the body) 
                        Hey, I'm starting to see what you said 
                        about those hooves. Some big animal did 
                      a tap dance on this guy. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (to Dana) 
                        Is there any way we can tell how big 
                        the deer was? 

                                      DANA 
                        Wait, so we're definitely calling the 
                        perp a deer now? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      A deer or a deer-type animal. 

                                      REED 
                        But what about the woman? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't know about the woman yet. I'm 
                        still thinking about the woman. 

                                      DANA 
                        There's no real way to call the size, 
                        at least that I know of, but the hairs 
                        were short, though, so it's probably 
                        either young or small. 

                                      REED 
                        Oh, no, no. There's no way anything 
                        under 300 pounds did this to him. I 
                        mean, this was a big guy. You know, 
                        it's not like he was-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                        Maybe it's strong. Really strong. It 
                        kicked the door clean off that 18-
                        wheeler. 

                                      REED 
                        So, wait, the girl smuggles a deer in 
                        the room under her coat? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Stop with the girl. We're not thinking 
                        about the girl yet. We're still on the 
                        weapon.

                        Weapon? Man, I thought we agreed on an 
                        animal attack. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. Well& 

      The double doors CRASH open and BILL, a lab technician, rolls in a 
      gurney.

                        We got another one of those messy ones, 
                        Dana. 
                              (notices Dwight)

                        So soon?

                        Just in. I brought it into room one, 
                        but they said you were handling this. 

                                      DANA 
                        Great.

                        Don't feel bad. I'm still the weird 
                        calls guy.

                        What, so you're not going to say hello 
                        to me? 
                              (off Dwight's confusion) 
                      I said hello. You should say hello 
                        back. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't even know your name.

                        But I didn't--

                        About 15 minutes ago. There are still 
                        officers on scene, but Patterson had 
                        the Coroner take the body away 'cause 
                        there was a crowd. They're still having 
                        trouble finding one of his arms.

                        That's creepy. 

      Dwight thinks for a beat. He points to Reed. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You're driving. 


      Dwight stands with GLENN FUCHES, a burly officer in his late 40s. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Fuches. What's up? 

                                      FUCHES 
                        What are you doing here? This is me and 
                          Patterson's gig. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Calm down. We're just checking it out. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        No, you're not. Go on, get out of here. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Where'd they find the body? 



 32                                       FUCHES 
                        I'm not telling you. Find your own way 
                        around. 

      Reed enters. 

                                      REED 
                        Dwight. 

      Dwight looks to him. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        On the roof. 

      Dwight joins Reed. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        Ooh, first names. 

      He shoots Fuches a look as he moves off. 


      CHIEF EINHORN sits behind his desk. Dwight and Patterson sit across from 
      him, and Fuches sits casually on a couch. Einhorn studies some photos. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        All I'm saying is that we cannot rule 
                        out an animal attack. 

                                      EINHORN 
                        Weren't you just saying that this was 
                        sexual assault homicide? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yes, well, that's true too. Maybe some 
                        sort of an animal sexual assault. 

 36                                         PATTERSON 
                        Oh, boy, here we go. 

                                      FUCHES 
                      I think your private fantasy life is

                        Look, I'm being serious. Dana down in 
                        forensics says that the blows are hoof-
                        shaped. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Oh, right, Dana, that pillar of sanity. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        The blows are circular. The hooves are 
                        ovoid. I don't think that--

                        The murder weapon is hoof-shaped, I'll 
                        give you that one. But the blows hit 
                        these guys with a tremendous amount of 
                        force behind them. For an animal of 
                        that size and strength to be hiding in 
                      a major metropolitan area for any 
                        extended amount of time is, frankly, 
                          impossible.

                        It is possible. It's very possible. 
                        This could be an unknown animal, some 
                        kind of mutant hoofed quadruped.

                        All right, that's enough. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        In London, in 1981, a series of brutal 
                        animal attacks were directly linked to 
                      a freak wolf that was gunned down in 
                        Piccadilly Circus. 

                                      EINHORN 
                        I'm familiar with the case. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Then what makes this so different? 

                                      EINHORN 
                        Because this is not 1981, and this is 
                        not London. These men weren't bitten or 
                        clawed or even scratched. They were 
                        pounded into fucking mincemeat. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (shouts) 
                        Then how do you explain the bloody hoof 
                        prints that were found at the scene? 

                                      EINHORN 
                      I don't know. They're way too far apart 
                        for anything that I know of with hooves 
                        to have made them. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        My bet is they're from the perp 
                        dragging the weapon on the ground. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        That is ridiculous. The distance of the 
                        hoof prints suggests an animal moving 
                        on two legs, a biped, that was leaping, 
                        or&or jumping like a deer. Okay? And I 
                        can't believe you're taking this 
                        dragged weapon theory seriously. Come 
                        on.

                        Okay, here's the story.

                        Back when I was still on homicide, I 
                        was partnered with a guy named Ted 
                        Neiman. Real sweet guy, smart, you 
                        know. He was really going places. He'd 
                        started criminal justice classes 
                        because he wanted to be a crime fiction 
                        writer, and he'd just sort of fallen in 
                        love with it. Anyway, we were following 
                        up leads on this murder downtown. It 
                        was no big deal, you know, a drug deal 
                        thing... 

      Nearby, several PLAYERS WHOOP. CLOSE ON a slot machine as it pours out 
      QUARTERS. The Players high-five each other.

                        Anyway, we'd found an address on this 
                        guy named Daikwon Barlow. When we got 
                        there&we should've radioed for back-up, 
                        you know, but we didn't. Ted went 
                        around the back, I went in the front, 
                        and rouble started right away. I mean, 
                        it was crazy--crack addicts running 
                        every which way.

                        Of course, one of them decides he's not 
                        afraid of the cops, right? So he runs 
                        on me with a pistol. He was this little 
                        white guy, bright red hair, you know, 
                        he must've been around 95 pounds 
                        soaking wet. And I don't have my gun 
                        out, right? So I'm basically running 
                        away a couple of seconds so I can pull 
                        the Glock, and by then he'd chased me 
                        into this narrow hallway, and I just&I 
                        turned and I fired my gun three times. 
                        One shot missed, and the other two hit 
                        him& 
                              (points to his shoulder) 
                        Here... 
                              (points to his head) 
                        And here. And I'm still rushing off the 
                          adrenaline, you know, scared to death 
                        that some junkie's gonna jump out at me 
                        out of nowhere, and then I saw Ted, my 
                        partner Ted& 
                                (beat) 
                        Just lying on the floor in back of the 
                        junkie. Both bullets went through the 
                        guy and they both hit Ted. 
                                (beat) 
                        So there was this big investigation, 
                        you know, and for a while a few people 
                        said that I'd planned it, right? That 
                        I'd meant to shoot Ted. Eventually, the 
                        whole thing was dismissed as an 
                        accident, but people don't forget so 
                        easy. Einhorn took me off active duty, 
                        and by the time he let me come back, I 
                        was on animal attacks. 

      He gives a sad chuckle. 


 43                                       DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        So I was pretty fucked up in the thick 
                        of it, you know? And I was always out 
                        of it and doped on anti-depressants. My 
                        wife left me and I lost touch with most 
                        of my friends, and then I had this, 
                        uh&this kind of realization. 

                                      REED 
                        An epiphany. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah. 
                                (beat) 
                      I just realized that we all have our 
                        time to make our mark on this planet, 
                        you know? And all that I'd done with my 
                        time was&get a decent man killed. 
                        That's the mark that I'd made on the 
                        Earth. 

                                      REED 
                        That's dark. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah, well& 

                                      REED 
                        Shit. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Well, now that we've had our special 
                        sharing time, let's figure out what a 
                        deer monster has against horny men, 
                        huh? 

      Reed smiles. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        This girl&this girl bothers me. 
                        Whatever's happened to these men, it's 
                        happened because of her. 

                                      REED 
                        Right. 

      Dwight thinks for a beat. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Maybe it's not a woman. 

                                      REED 
                        What? 

 44                                       DWIGHT 
                        There's this type of spider that looks 
                        just like an ant. Okay? And it builds 
                        these fake antholes& 

      The MANAGER, a young Native American man, spots Dwight and Reed. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        And it hides in them and waits for real 
                        ants to follow it down. 

                                      REED 
                        And then&chomp. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Right. 

      The Manager appears uneasy as he listens. 

                                      REED 
                        So you're saying the deer monster 
                        pretends to be a beautiful woman, lures 
                        guys to somewhere secluded and stomps 
                        the shit out of them? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't know. I don't know. 

      The Manager approaches. 

                                      MANAGER 
                              (laughs) 
                        Oh, right, Deer Woman. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Whoa, whoa, wait. What? You know of a 
                        Deer Woman? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Are you guys into stuff like that? 

                                      REED 
                        Into stuff like what? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Native American mythology. You know, 
                        the Deer Woman, the Piasa Thunder 
                        Birds, the Wil-Go-Yhuk. You know, stuff 
                        like that. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Sit down. 



 45                                       MANAGER 
                        I've got to  

                                      DWIGHT 
                        No, no, no. It's okay. Please. Sit 
                        down. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Yeah, I guess I've got a minute. 

      Dwight glances at Reed. The Manager pulls up a chair. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What you heard us talking about isn't a 
                        legend. It's a case we're working on, 
                        okay? Somebody's killing people in the 
                        city, trampling them to death. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Oh, yeah, yeah. I saw that on the news. 
                              (laughs) 
                        You guys think that's the Deer Woman? 

                                      REED 
                        What is a Deer Woman, exactly? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Okay, okay. Here's the story how my dad 
                        used to tell it. When the Powhatans 
                        would get together, you know, for a big 
                        social gathering, the Deer Woman would 
                        come out of the woods and slip 
                        unnoticed into the party. She's, like, 
                        the most beautiful woman in the world, 
                        really sexy, built like a goddess from 
                        the waist up, but from the waist down, 
                        she's like a deer. 

                                      REED 
                      A deer? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Well, you know, she has deer legs. 

      Reed and Dwight share a look. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Four legs or two? 

      The Manager laughs. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        You guys can't be serious. 

 46                                       DWIGHT 
                        We're very serious. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Two legs. Anyway, she comes into the 
                        party and she finds a guy. She lures 
                        him out somewhere to secluded, bangs 
                        him and then tramples him to death. 

                                      REED 
                        That's the stupidest thing I've ever 
                        heard. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Hey, it's just a story. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        How come no one notices she has deer 
                        legs? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        She keeps them covered up. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Why? Why does she do it? What's her 
                        motive? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        Why does everything have to have a 
                        "why" with you people? You know, it's a 
                        woman with deer legs. Motive really 
                        isn't an issue here. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Okay. How do they catch her? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        What do you mean, "catch her?" 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You know, how does the legend end? How 
                        do they kill the Deer Woman? 

                                      MANAGER 
                        They don't. 

      Reed looks baffled by this. 

                                      MANAGER (CONT'D) 
                        She just kills everyone who she seduces 
                        and then she disappears back into the 
                        forest. 



 47                                       DWIGHT 
                                (unconvinced) 
                        Right. 

                                      MANAGER 
                        It's just some silly misogynistic 
                        Powhatan legend, and you two are acting 
                        like this is a serious theory in a 
                        criminal case. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Actually, it is our only theory at the 
                        moment. 

      The Manager LAUGHS. He looks from Reed to Dwight. 


      The office is empty. Dwight sits at his desk, drawing on a pad. CLOSE ON 
      his sketch of a goofy, cartoonish half-deer/half-woman. Fuches marches 
      up. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        You working nights now, Faraday? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Not now, Fuches. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        Look, I'm sorry about being such an 
                        asshole to you earlier. The more I look 
                        at this case, the more it 
                          seems...bizarre. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Yeah, to say the least. 

      He chuckles softly. He glances at Dwight's drawing. 

                                      FUCHES 
                        Yeah. 
                                (beat) 
                        Well, have a good night. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You too. 


 49       Fuches heads out. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Asshole. 


      The floor bustles with enthusiastic PATRONS. Reed moves along a row of 
      slot machines, slamming the spin buttons on each one. They spin. There 
      are no winners. 

                                      REED 
                        Shit. 

      He sips his drink, then wanders off. REVEAL the Deer Woman 
      behind him. She stares after him, her eyes steely. 

      Reed moves the craps table. He gestures to a Waitress. 

                                      REED 
                        Excuse me, ma'am. 

      He sets his empty glass on her tray. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Can I get a seven-and-seven, please? 

                                      WAITRESS 
                        Well, I don't see why not. 

      She winks and moves off. Reed moves up to the craps table and holds out 
    a $50 bill. 

                                      REED 
                        $50 worth of chips, please. 

      He sets the bill on the table and the Croupier accepts it. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go, new shooter coming out. Any 
                      C and E, horn high? Last chance. 

      The Croupier pushes a small pile of chips towards Reed. 

                                      PLAYER #1 (O/S) 
                        Whoo! Yeah, let's go! 

                                      PLAYER #2 (O/S) 
                        Big money, baby. Big money. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go. 

                                      PLAYER #3 (O/S) 
                        Come on, now. Eleven! Eleven! 

 50       Reed watches as an OLDER WOMAN tosses the dice. Reed watches as double 
      sixes come up. He grimaces. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Twelve. 

                                      REED 
                        Shit! 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Line away, notes to pay. 

      The Waitress returns with Reed's drink. 

                                      WAITRESS 
                        Okay, here you go. 

                                      REED 
                        Thank you. 

      He drops two chips on her tray and takes the drink. 

                                      WAITRESS 
                        No, thank you. 

      Reed takes a sip of his drink. Sensing something, he turns around to 
      find the Deer Woman standing beside him. She smiles. He smiles back. 

                                      REED 
                        Should I play the seven? 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Same shooter, here we go. Bets down. 

      The Deer Woman smiles and nods. Reed places his chips. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Okay, lady, you're the boss. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go. 

      The Older Woman tosses the dice. A nine comes up. Reed CHUCKLES. PLAYERS 
      APPLAUD. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Hey, how about that? 

      Reed collects his chips. The Older Woman tosses again. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Eleven, eleven, eleven. 


 51       An eleven comes up. Reed CHEERS. 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Eleven. 

                                      REED 
                        Yes! That's what I'm talking about! 
                        Yeah! Yeah! 

      He goes to pick up his chips, but the Deer Woman pulls back his arm. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        You want me to let it ride? 

      She smiles. He nervously gulps his drink. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Okay. The lady says let it ride! 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go. 

      The Older Woman throws. Another eleven comes up. Reed CHEERS and turns 
      to the Deer Woman. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, baby! Where have you been all my 
                        life? 

      He throws his arms around her and kisses her cheek. She smiles. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Yes! Yes! 

                                      CROUPIER (O/S) 
                        Here we go, new shooter coming out. 

      The Deer Woman spots something O/S and her face darkens. REVEAL the 
      Waitress standing beside Reed. 

                                      WAITRESS 
                        Hey, Lucky, how about another round? 

                                      REED 
                        Yeah! Yeah! For everybody! 


      Reed enters, LAUGHING and clearly tipsy as he turns on the lights. The 
      Deer Woman follows. He tosses his keys aside and staggers across the 
      room. She locks the door and leads him to the couch. He gazes up at her. 

                                      REED 
                              (slurs) 
                        Oh, man, you are beautiful. 


 52       She smiles. The PHONE RINGS. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Dammit! I've got to get that. 

      He moves to stand. She pushes him down. The PHONE RINGS 
      again.. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                      I know, baby, but it's my job. I've got 
                        to get the phone. 

      She kisses him. He chuckles as he pulls away. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        Cool down, baby. I'm not going 
                        anywhere. 

      He staggers to the phone. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        Hello? 

      INTERCUT WITH-- 


      Dwight is at his desk. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Is that you, Reed? 

      Reed furrows his brow. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        Dwight? 

      On Dwight. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Look, I've been doing some research. 

      Reed glances back at the Deer Woman. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        That's good, Dwight, I'll see you 
                        tomorrow. 

      She smiles. 



 53                                       DWIGHT (V/O) 
                              (over phone) 
                        This has happened here before, okay? 

      He smiles back. 

                                      DWIGHT (V/O CONT'D) 
                        About 100 years ago, 11 loggers were 
                        found pulverized. They had all been 
                        seen with a pretty woman. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        Dwight, I'm a little drunk and 
                          something's come up. 

      The Deer Woman takes off her blouse. Reed grins. 

                                      DWIGHT (V/O) 
                              (over phone) 
                        You know, I'm thinking we should put 
                        some officers clubs and bars and on the 
                        street, you know? 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        I'm a little busy now. 

      Reed turns and whispers into the mouthpiece. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        I've got a girl in here, man. I will 
                        call you to you tomorrow. 

      On Dwight. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Have you seen her feet? 

      On Reed. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        Say what? 

      On Dwight. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Do you know her? Have you seen her 
                        feet? 

      Reed's face falls. 

 54                                       DWIGHT (CONT'D V/O) 
                              (over phone) 
                        Reed? Are you there? 

      Reed is speechless for a beat. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        I'm a fucking idiot, Dwight. 

      On Dwight. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Where is your gun? 

      The Deer Woman stalks up behind Reed. His voice trembles. 

                                      REED 
                              (into phone) 
                        Call back-up. 

      END INTERCUT 

      Dwight loads his gun. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into phone) 
                        Reed? Reed! 


      Dwight drives. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (into his radio) 
                        Request back up at 3581 Mineri.

                              (over radio) 
                        Copy that. 


      Dwight swerves. 




      Dwight clenches the wheel. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Fuck me. 


      Dwight drives. 


      Dwight rushes through, weapon poised. He stops at Reed's 
      door and tries it. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Reed? 

      He steps back and cocks his gun. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Reed? 

      He kicks the door in. 


      Dwight barrels in, his gun aimed. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Reed? 

      He glances around. He spots Reed's mutilated body. He knees beside it. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Oh my God. 

      He pulls out his radio. 




 56                                       DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                              (into radio) 
                        Officer down. Repeat, officer down at 
                        3581 Mineri. 

      Behind him, the Deer Woman slowly approaches, her eyes ablaze. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                              (into radio) 
                        Apartment 406  

      Spotting her shadow, Dwight s whirls around and FIRES, hitting her 
      shoulder. She falls to the floor. He takes a beat to collect himself, 
      then crouches by her. He is taken aback by her beauty. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        What have I done? 

      He reaches tentatively for the hem of her skirt and pulls it back. 
      REVEAL DEER HOOVES. CLOSE ON her face as her eyes pop open. She kicks, 
      sending Dwight clear across the room. He CRASHES against the wall and 
      tumbles to the floor. He MOANS as he picks himself up. He staggers off. 


      Dwight staggers down the hall. 


      Dwight drives. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Goddamn it. 


      Dwight drives. 


      Dwight gets in. He checks the rear-view mirror and sees that a good 
      number of DEER have gathered around the vehicle. Suddenly, a pair of 
      ANTLERS comes crashing through the window, sending glass flying. 


      Dwight drives. POV through his windshield as the Deer Woman 
      leaps across the road. He speeds towards her. She leaps off 
      the road.
