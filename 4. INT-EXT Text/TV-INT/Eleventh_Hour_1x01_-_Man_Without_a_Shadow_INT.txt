    The driver, Martin Sanders, grips the wheel and stares ahead 
    as the vehicle barrels through the night. Fear has sobered 
    him somewhat.

    He s gabbling miserably.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  My cup overflows. Surely goodness 
                  and mercy shall follow me...

    In the side mirror, the beams and flashing blue lights of the 
      pursuing cruiser come into sight.

    He glances at the mirror.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Oh, crap.


    Traffic cop Elaine driving, supercool.

    Partner Mike on the radio, while checking a map.                                                                                    3.



                                MIKE
                        (calmly into radio)
                  Saw us and exited the pub car park 
                  at speed. Vehicle is now heading 
                  West on Higher Commons Lane...


    Martin Sanders, growing visibly more desperate, glances down 
    at something on the passenger seat beside him.

    Another check on the mirror, but the cruiser s still there.


    Mike looks up from the map.

                                MIKE
                    There s no turnoff now until the 
                  Cable Road.


    Martin Sanders reaches for a button, and the driver s window 
    opens.

    Visibly upset, he glances down at something on the passenger 
    seat.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  God forgive me.


      Elaine s spotted the action.

                                  ELAINE
                  He threw something out of the car.

                                MIKE
                          (looking back as they pass 
                          the spot)
                  Near a white gatepost.


    Elaine pulls in by the crashed vehicle.

    She and Mike get out and move in. Others from the police van 
    follow.

    Sanders isn t hurt, but he s in tears at the wheel.


    One of the boxes stands open on a table. Professor Alan Hood, 
    in latex gloves, has opened one and is carefully lifting a 
    silver cross and chain out of the way while Rachel Young, his 
      personal protection officer, looks on. She s holding a manila 
    file.

                                HOOD
                          (looking at the crucifix)
                  The man who buried them put one of 
                  these in every grave.                                                                                    6.



    Rachel looks into the box. She s too professional to react. 
    Just about.

                                HOOD
                  It s one thing to hear about it. 
                  But it s coming face to face that 
                  really brings it home.

    She s going to say something, then changes her mind. 

                                HOOD
                  Would you rather wait outside?

                                  RACHEL
                  I ll be fine. Thank you.

    The flap is thrown open and Bruno storms in.

                                BRUNO
                  What do think you re doing?

                                HOOD
                        (replacing the lid)
                  You don t have to worry, inspector. 
                  I do know how to handle a sample.

                                BRUNO
                  I don t care! I ve got thirty dead 
                  babies and the last thing I need is 
                  for my evidence to be interfered 
                  with. Out!

    Hood turns to him, stripping off his gloves.

                                HOOD
                    Strictly speaking, you ve got 
                  thirty dead foetuses. Can you read 
                  a DNA profile?

                                BRUNO
                  Are you from the lab?

                                HOOD
                  No. Can you? 

    As he s speaking, Rachel hands him the file in exchange for 
    the gloves.

                                BRUNO
                  I don t know what you mean by 
                     reading it .                                                                                    7.



    He moves to the side of the tent and indicates for Bruno to 
    join him...

    Bruno, not quite sure how his momentum s been stolen, glances 
    at Rachel and then complies.

    From the file, Hood takes an A5-sized sheet of X-ray film 
    showing the familiar banded pattern of a DNA profile.  

                                HOOD
                  Think of it as a personal barcode. 
                  Each one s different, and each 
                  one s unique.

    He slides the top edge of the sheet under the crossbar of the 
    tent s frame so that it stays there, making the backlit 
    fabric into a makeshift light box.

                                HOOD
                  This is the profile for the twelve-
                    week-old foetus that was thrown out 
                  of the car.

    He adds another next to it.

                                HOOD
                  And this from the first one you dug 
                  up. What do you see?

                                BRUNO
                    They re similar.

                                HOOD
                        (adding a third)
                    They re not similar. They re the 
                  same. As are all the others. Look.

    He holds up a fourth for comparison, and then starts moving 
    back down the row gathering them into a stack like playing 
    cards.

                                HOOD
                  Every one you ve sent in for 
                    testing so far. The same... The 
                    same... The same.

    Angle on the sheets -- in a single stack with the lines 
    perfectly matched up.

                                HOOD
                  What do you know about cloning?                                                                                    8.



                                BRUNO
                  I ve heard of Dolly the Sheep.

    Hood turns to look back and now we see that there s a grim 
    row of fifteen of the boxes, perfectly spaced along the 
    trestle tables, all labelled, all separate.

                                HOOD
                  What you see here is the disaster 
                  you get when you try it with 
                    people.

                                BRUNO
                  Who are you?

                                HOOD
                  I m Alan Hood.


    Kelly Fox, 19 years old and 20+ weeks pregnant, is pushing 
    along a trolley with a toddler in the rumble seat, studying a 
    list. Her pregnancy isn t screamingly obvious and the clothes 
    that she s wearing make it even less so.

    She only belatedly notices that the child s holding a packet 
    of biscuits.

                                KELLY
                  No, Davy. Not the fancy ones.

    She extracts them from his grasp and we pan with her as she 
    goes the few yards back down the aisle to replace them.

    Then without a cut we pan back with her to the trolley, which 
    now has no kid in it.

                                KELLY
                  Davy? David?

    With rising panic, she looks all around her...

    Then moves past the trolley to the aisle junction. As she 
    turns the corner...

    She sees, directly ahead of her a young guy with baseball cap 
    and trackie pants tucked into his Nike socks. He s got Davy 
    with him and is squatting down by the sweet shelves, 
    unwrapping something to put in the boy s hands.

                                ROLY
                  There y are. Take that from your 
                  dad.

    Kelly freezes in horror. Roly sees her and rises.

                                ROLY
                  You didn t move but five miles. Did 
                  you think no-one was ever going to 
                  see you?

                                KELLY
                  You come near me again, I m taking 
                  you right back to court.

                                ROLY
                  Yeah, whatever, you try it and see 
                  what happens. A dad s got a right 
                  to see his lad.                                                                                  13.



                                KELLY
                  Oh, don t come that. You take an 
                    interest when it suits you and it 
                    doesn t last five minutes.

    Kelly spies what Davy is eating.

                                KELLY
                  That s got nuts! You know he can t 
                  have it.

    She moves to take it from him and Roly catches her by the 
    arm.

                                ROLY
                  Hey.

    He s noticed something. He shoves her out to arm s length for 
    a better look, and she makes a feeble attempt to cover the 
    signs.

                                ROLY
                  You going to tell me that s all 
                    Dunkin  Donuts? Whose is it?

                                KELLY
                  Get off.

                                ROLY
                  I asked you a question.

    The volume s rising and people are starting to take notice.

                                KELLY
                  It s none of your business!

                                ROLY
                  You needn t think you re having it.

                                KELLY
                  Get off!

    He smartly hustles her to a spot no more than a stride away, 
    where a stack of stuff in the aisle obscures them from 
    general view.

    Something nasty happens just out of our line of sight.

    An instant later, Roly is walking away briskly, hands thrust 
    in pockets, at a speed that will have him out of the store 
    before anyone can act.                                                                                  14.



    An elderly woman starts raising the alarm. She s got one of 
    those walker-trolleys and can only shout from the spot.

                                  ELDERLY SHOPPER
                  I saw what you did! You nasty 
                  little bastard! You should be 
                    ashamed of yourself!

    Kelly is clutching her stomach, doubled-over and sinking to 
    her knees.

    Roly sweeps on and out of the store unimpeded.

    CCTV insert as he passes the checkouts -- he tilts his head 
    so that the baseball cap hides his features from the camera. 
    Someone s trying to call after him but he doesn t break his 
    stride.

    Back in the aisle -- Kelly s doubled up, hugging herself, 
    still not able to make any sound as people start coming to 
    her aid.


    Another part of the store. Kelly s been seated on a chair. 
    She s breathing deeply, wiping at tears with a tissue. A 
    shelf-stacker lad hands her a paper cup of water.

                                  MANAGERESS
                  Dan?

    The lad looks at her and, with a flick of her eyes, she 
    signals for him to move away.

    Then she bends over Kelly and lowers her voice for 
      discretion.

                                  MANAGERESS
                  Have you stopped bleeding?

                                KELLY
                  Think so.

                                  MANAGERESS
                  You ve got to let me call an 
                  ambulance.

                                KELLY
                          (emphatically)
                  No!!

                                  MANAGERESS
                  Well, I ve got to call someone.                                                                                  15.



    Kelly looks up. There is someone.


    On the move. Rachel at the wheel, Hood beside her. Still dark 
    of mood and pensive.

                                  RACHEL
                  So do we try and find this woman?

    Hood stirs and starts paying attention.

                                HOOD
                  Which one?

                                  RACHEL
                  The one who paid the caretaker to 
                  burn the foetuses.

                                HOOD
                  I can t get to her until they let 
                  me talk to him.

                                  RACHEL
                  You need to cut the local bobbies a 
                  bit of slack, Hood. How often do 
                  you think they come up against 
                    something like this?

                                HOOD
                  Human cloning, a crime that brings 
                  all of science into disrepute and 
                  gets you ten years in jail. What s 
                  so complicated about that?

                                  RACHEL
                    Nothing if you ve got a PhD.                                                                                  16.



                                HOOD
                  Bloody coppers. Thick as they come. 
                    Present company excepted. How far 
                  are we going?

                                  RACHEL
                  I ve booked us into the Novotel.

                                HOOD
                  Does it have a gym?

                                  RACHEL
                  What do you want a gym for?

                                HOOD
                  I like to ogle women in Lycra.

    They pass a junction sign.

                                  RACHEL
                  I thought your daughter lived in 
                  this neck of the woods.

                                HOOD
                  She does.

                                  RACHEL
                  Are you going to call her?

                                HOOD
                  I might.

    He doesn t sound too keen. Rachel glances his way with mild 
    surprise.


    At first we re close on Lena and Davy. The woman is chatting 
    to him brightly, keeping him distracted by letting him play 
    with some medical stuff -- tongue depressors, bandages. Only 
    when she glances across do we see that this is...

    A big, bare space. In the middle of the old floor stands an 
    island of modern furniture and medical instruments, the 
      centrepiece being an obstetrics examination table under an 
      overhead operating light.                                                                                  17.



    Kelly s lying on the table. Dr Sidney Hayward, 50s, runs a 
    compact ultrasound scanner over her bulge and studies the 
    results in a laptop screen. Hayward is a former consultant. 
    His patrician manner is intact even if the bespoke suit has 
    seen better days.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  I think we re all right. I don t 
                  see any damage. The placenta s a 
                  bit low down but that will probably 
                  sort itself out.

    He hands her a towel, and closes everything down while she s 
    wiping off the lube and rearranging her clothes.

                                KELLY
                  Would I still get paid if anything 
                  did go wrong?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Not if it leads to a termination. 
                  Don t blame me, it s my boss who 
                  sets the terms. Why? Are you 
                    worried about anything in 
                    particular?

                                KELLY
                  Just asking.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    Asking s free. But if anything does 
                  go wrong, you call me and I ll do 
                  what s necessary. Don t even think 
                  about going to your doctor.

                                KELLY
                  I ve only got you.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Good. You know what they do with 
                  girls who break the law.

    Kelly glances in Lena s direction.

                                KELLY
                  If she can t drive me back, can I 
                  have some taxi money?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  What s wrong with the bus?

                                KELLY
                  Bus fare, then.                                                                                  18.



    Hayward hesitates, fails to come up with an evasion, then 
    roots around in his trouser pockets for change.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  How much is it from here?

                                KELLY
                  Three pounds.

    Lena Muller looks across at the scene with a face like a 
    plate of condemned veal.

    Hayward reluctantly sorts through his small change, trying to 
    make up the three quid.


    A short time later.

    Kelly s leading Davy out. The door closes after them.

    Lena Muller joins Sidney Hayward.

                                LENA MULLER
                  What s the point sending her out 
                  again? 

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  She s worth a few more weeks.

                                LENA MULLER
                  I don t know why you didn t just 
                    terminate her right there.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  If you believe the scan she s got 
                  the most viable-looking foetus yet.

                                LENA MULLER
                  She ll never hold onto it.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Bit longer and it might be worth 
                    inducing.

                                LENA MULLER
                  What if it won t wait? 

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Then she d better be sure she gives 
                  me a call. Unless she particularly 
                  wants to die.                                                                                  19.

    On the move. Rachel at the wheel, Hood and Martin Sanders in 
    the back.

                                HOOD
                  Twenty quid a pop and you couldn t 
                  quite bring yourself to pass it up? 
                  You d make a lousy businessman, 
                    Martin. Between the crosses and 
                  chains and the Dutch courage I 
                  think you ll find you were trading 
                  at a loss.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  You can t do this. It isn t legal.

                                HOOD
                  Apparently you were helpful drunk 
                  and useless sober. What s best to 
                  do with you, Martin? Take you to 
                  the pub?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  I m not saying anything else.

                                HOOD
                  Have you got no conscience? You 
                  won t get a better chance to ease 
                  it.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Jesus knows what was in my heart. 
                  And he s forgiven me.

                                HOOD
                  Let s ask him.


    A gloomy town-centre Victorian Gothic church, pretty small. 
    Hood marches Martin Sanders down the aisle toward the altar 
    rail with Rachel following after.

      Sanders  leg is still trailing and Hood s helping to support 
    him, but the effect is that of dragging him up the aisle by 
    the scruff of his neck.                                                                                  22.



                                HOOD
                  If the only thing that impresses 
                  you is the wrath of God then make 
                  no mistake, as far as you re 
                    concerned I am his instrument right 
                  here on Earth. You think you did 
                  right by the unborn dead? Think 
                  again. Who paid you to burn that 
                    medical waste?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Just some woman.

                                HOOD
                  She didn t come out of nowhere and 
                  she didn t pick you for no reason. 
                  Who is she, Martin, and where can I 
                  find her?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  I m already in trouble. I don t 
                  want more.

                                HOOD
                  Don t you? Well, you picked the 
                  wrong day to meet me, then, didn t 
                  you?

    A side door opens.

                                  PRIEST
                  What s going on?

    Hood relaxes his grip, turns it into a friendly hand-on-
    shoulder.

                                HOOD
                  Sorry for the noise, father, I 
                  always get a bit passionate in a 
                    theological discussion.

                                  PRIEST
                  Give me a better reason than that, 
                  or take it outside.

                                HOOD
                  We were talking about the slaughter 
                  of the innocents. Whether it was 
                  all down to Herod, or whether the 
                    footsoldiers and spear-carriers 
                  need to shoulder some of the blame. 
                  What do you say, Martin?                                                                                  23.



    On Martin. His eyes flick from Hood to the priest. He has no 
    ready answer.


    A crude conversion -- partition walls and numbered units, 
    each with the owner s custom-made security on the door.

    Hood and Sanders are by the door to the unit 118. They re 
    waiting for something. As they talk, Hood inspects the chunky 
    padlock on its hasp. 

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  I ve never had a key.

                                HOOD
                  Don t you worry about it.

    Hood moves to the plasterboard wall alongside the door and 
    gives it an experimental tap.

                                HOOD
                  If the whole thing troubled you so 
                  much, why didn t you stop?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  He who rides a tiger can never 
                    dismount.

                                HOOD
                  You weren t riding any tiger. You 
                  were cremating human foetuses for 
                  money.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  I stopped doing that when I found 
                  out what they were.

                                HOOD
                  But you didn t stop taking them on. 
                  Why?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Who else was going to give them a 
                  decent burial?                                                                                  24.



                                HOOD
                  A shallow grave and a couple of 
                    prayers.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  And some holy water.

                                HOOD
                  That s your idea of decency, is it? 

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Unless one is born of water and the 
                    Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom 
                  of God.

    Hood stops tapping the plasterboard.

                                HOOD
                  What?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  If a baby s not baptised then it 
                    doesn t go to heaven.

                                HOOD
                  So you did them yourself? Does that 
                  still count?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  You probably think it s stupid.

    On Hood. His manner doesn t change much but his deeper 
      attitude to Martin does.

                                HOOD
                  No, Martin. I don t.

    A moment of understanding, then...

    Rachel arrives, carrying a set of boltcutters.

    Hood changes the mood.

                                HOOD
                  Oy oy. Armed feminist.


    A slow track taking in the big empty space with the island of 
    modern furniture and medical instruments, the centrepiece of 
    which is the obstetrics examination table under an overhead 
    operating light, now standing dark.                                                                                  25.



    CLUNG! The sound of the padlock shearing is followed by the 
    door opening.

    After taking the sight in for a moment, Hood moves toward it. 
    Rachel follows with the boltcutters in her hand. Martin comes 
    in last, closes the door, and stands close to it.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                    There s two of them. She calls him 
                    Doctor.

                                HOOD
                  Is this where they work on the 
                  girls?

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  I wouldn t know.

    Hood shoots him a cynical look.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                          (admitting)
                  Couple of times a week. Most of 
                  them are only kids.

    Hood picks up some shiny instrument, muses, and lays it down 
    again.

                                  RACHEL
                  You obviously don t have a 
                    gynaecologist.

                                HOOD
                  I don t have anything that would 
                    interest one.

                                  RACHEL
                  You re not very happy.

                                HOOD
                  I was hoping for more than this.

      Rachel s by a table with a compact inkjet printer and a 
    scattering of discarded attempts. She holds one up for him to 
    see. 

    It s an ultrasound scan from around 11 weeks. Printing was 
    cancelled so the image is unfinished by an inch or two.

                                  RACHEL
                  Hood! You ve got baby scans in a 
                  secret clinic. What on earth are 
                  you looking for?                                                                                   26.



                                HOOD
                  He may have implanted his embryos 
                  here but he made them somewhere 
                  else. It s a big deal, Rachel. Big 
                    technology. It s not like your 
                  basic two lesbians and a turkey-
                    baster.

                                  RACHEL
                  Hood!

                                HOOD
                  It takes a proper lab and all the 
                  skills to go with it. See this?

    He lays his hand on a container like a milk churn. Lifts the 
    lid, but it s empty.

                                  RACHEL
                  What?

                                HOOD
                  Liquid nitrogen transporter.
                  (reads label on lid) With an import 
                    license for bovine semen.

                                  RACHEL
                  What s he making, a minotaur?

                                HOOD
                    That ll be a cover. He can hardly 
                  say frozen clone embryos, can he? 
                  He s outsourced his lab work to a 
                    country where there s no 
                    regulation.

    Their heads turn at a sound, as the door to the unit is 
    opened.

    Framed in the doorway stands Sidney Hayward, with the broken 
    padlock in his hand and a furious expression.

    The first person he sees is Martin.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    Martin? You know you don t come in 
                  here!

    Martin can t help it -- he looks to Hood.

    Hayward follows his glance...                                                                                  27.



    And at the sight of Hood starting towards him, steps out 
    quickly and pulls the door shut.

    Hood covers the rest of the distance at a run, but he s too 
    late -- the door won t open.


    Closeup on the hasp and staple, as the door rattles -- it s 
    been closed up and the broken padlock thrust into it so that 
    the door can t be opened from inside.

    A quick pan gives us a parting glimpse of Hayward as, none 
    too dignified, he vanishes off down the stairs.


    Rachel can see that Hood s getting nowhere.

                                  RACHEL
                  I ll take him.

    She turns and heads across the floor to a marked Fire Exit 
    door with a crush bar.

                                HOOD
                  Preferably in one piece!

    Rachel hits the crush bar and an alarm sounds throughout the 
      building as she heads out.

    Something then occurs to Hood. He lays his hand against the 
    partition wall by the door.

                                HOOD
                        (to Martin)
                  Is this hollow?

    Martin does a kind of shrug to say, As far as I know.

    Hood brings out a Swiss Army knife or Leatherman which he 
    opens and plunges, dagger-like, into the plasterboard at 
      shoulder height, before sawing it downward.


    Hayward reaches the bottom of the stairs and heads toward 
    daylight.                                                                                  28.




    A big, ragged section of plasterboard being booted out into 
    the corridor with Hood stepping through after in a cloud of 
    white dust.

    He heads for the stairway.


    Both get in. Rachel slams her door. There s an atmosphere. 

                                  RACHEL
                  I discharged a firearm at a moving 
                    vehicle. Do you know what I ll have 
                  to go through now?

    She makes an effort to calm herself.

                                HOOD
                  I am sorry.

                                  RACHEL
                        (not looking at him)
                  Let me go, Hood. Please.

                                HOOD
                  Your job is far from a joke. And I 
                  do need you.

                                  RACHEL
                  You d get the exact same support 
                  from any one of a hundred people.                                                                                  30.



                                HOOD
                  Not from the ones they keep trying 
                  to send me. Look, I don t do 
                    apology very well.

                                  RACHEL
                  Is that why your own daughter won t 
                  speak to you?

    Ouch! Bullseye with a brick.

    Kelly s in social housing and may not have been trained in 
      housekeeping skills, but it s as decent as a 19-year-old 
    single mother can make it.

    She s reading to Davy. It s a child s book with pictures, but 
    still she struggles with the words.

                                KELLY
                          (reading)
                   And that s the end of the story, 
                  except to say that all of the 
                  guests went back to their homes, 
                  and told stories of the kindness of 
                    Mondrago their king. And when the 
                  word of his kindness had spread far 
                  and wide... 

    Ouch. She winces with a sudden pain. 

                                KELLY
                  Oh, god, no.

    She puts a hand to her stomach and fights the pain. At this 
    moment, her phone rings.

    Kelly moves into the kitchen where her phone s plugged into a 
    wall socket, charging.

    We stay, and push right in on the cream-coloured cushion she 
    was sitting on, to find...

    Blood patches, freshly soaking into the material.

    With Kelly -- wiping her eyes, she answers the call.

                                KELLY
                  Hello?                                                                                  31.




    Parked on a busyish street where there are flats and houses. 
    Hood and Rachel sit in the car. Rachel s calmer now. They 
    seem to be watching for something.                                                                                  33.



                                HOOD
                    Cloning s a numbers game. It s a 
                  fluke if one comes right. You make 
                  a thousand little monsters to get 
                  your one little angel.

                                  RACHEL
                  Why s he doing it here?

    Hood looks at her.

                                  RACHEL
                  You tell me how tricky these 
                    maverick cloners are. Moving it 
                  around whenever there s a ban. So 
                  why not do the whole thing in some 
                  third world country?

                                HOOD
                  Maybe I ll get the chance to ask 
                  him.

                                  RACHEL
                  Maybe this is where his client is.

    Hood looks at her again, more seriously.

                                  RACHEL
                  How much is it costing? Someone s 
                  got to be paying.

    Hood s mind is so taken with the implications of this that he 
    almost misses his reason for being here.

                                  RACHEL
                  Is that your daughter?

      Quickly, he returns his attention to the street.

    A young woman has emerged from one of the houses. She s 
    stopped to double-lock the door behind her.

                                  RACHEL
                  Well?

    Hood starts to undo his belt, then...

                                HOOD
                  What am I doing? This is stupid. 

                                  RACHEL
                  Get a move on. You ll miss her.                                                                                  34.



    Hood hesitates. Then decides.

                                HOOD
                  No.

                                  RACHEL
                  Hood!

                                HOOD
                  It s not right. I ve gone and 
                    dragged you down here to prove a 
                  point that doesn t need proving. 
                  Look. It s obvious she s going 
                  somewhere. I m not going to bother 
                  her. (refastens his belt) Come on. 
                  Let s go.

    Hood s blustering a bit and Rachel s not fooled. She keeps a 
    steady gaze on him; he avoids looking at her.

                                HOOD
                    Please.

    With a shrug, Rachel starts the car.

    Davy sits watching TV.

    Through an open doorway we can see that Kelly s in the next 
    room. She s just pacing, but we can t see all the way in to 
    what she s doing.

    But we glimpse her as she passes the doorway, hand to her 
    brow and crying.


    Hood comes in with Rachel a few paces behind him, 
      professionally scanning for hazards. Hood s carrying a 
    laptop.

                                HOOD
                  D you want to meet up in the 
                  restaurant later?                                                                                  35.



                                  RACHEL
                  Nah. I m for a long bath and room 
                    service.


    Hood stands waiting as Rachel takes a look in the bathroom, 
    then checks the window lock and closes the curtains.

                                  RACHEL
                  Keep these closed. Got your panic 
                    button?

    He rummages around in his coat pocket and digs out a small 
    signalling device no bigger than a zippo lighter.

    He blows the fluff off before showing it to her.

                                  RACHEL
                          (patiently)
                  Switch it on.

    He slides the thumb switch on the side.

                                  RACHEL
                  In case you didn t notice it, your 
                  threat level went up today.

                                HOOD
                  Does that mean I can t leave the 
                  room?

                                  RACHEL
                  You can leave the room, but don t 
                  leave the hotel. And if you sign 
                  for dinner...

                                HOOD
                  Use the cover name.

      Rachel s phone gives a text beep. She looks and...

                                  RACHEL
                  Excuse me. And I wouldn t risk the 
                  fruit.

    She leaves the room.

    Hood puts the laptop computer down and starts to open it.

    DS Cook is standing in the foyer. Hands in pockets, waiting, 
    killing time in motel limbo.

    He wanders across to look at some piece of hotel art that s 
    not worth looking at.

      Suddenly...

    Rachel comes striding through the swing doors from the rooms 
    corridor.

                                  RACHEL
                  Doug. Thanks for this.

                                DS COOK
                  I m five minutes away.

                                  RACHEL
                  I know, I remembered. I need to 
                  give you this.

    She holds a metal disc out to him.

                                DS COOK
                  What is it?

                                  RACHEL
                  The lid from a container for 
                    refrigerated bull semen.

                                DS COOK
                  Now you re embarrassing me,  cause 
                  I haven t got a present for you.

                                  RACHEL
                          (patiently)
                    There s a customs label on it. Do 
                  me a big favour and find out who 
                    applied for the import license.

                                DS COOK
                  That s your close protection work, 
                  is it? Admit it, you re desperate 
                  for some proper coppering.

                                  RACHEL
                  I am not desperate for anything. 
                  But Professor Hood and I would 
                  appreciate a result.

    She walks away, back toward the doors.

    DS Cook glances at the lid and its label...                                                                                  37.



    But finds Rachel walking away more interesting.


    (relocated from police building, day and moved from 247)

    Closeup on Hood s computer laptop screen. He s got it plugged 
    into the room s internet access point.

    It s showing a website news page very similar to the  format 
    of the BBC news pages. The news column carries the headline 
    GYNAECOLOGIST BANNED and a column-width picture of someone we 
    don t know above the text.

    Hood clicks a link in the  See also  column and another story 
    takes its place... DISGRACED SURGEON STRUCK OFF and another 
    picture we don t recognise.

    A knock at the door.

                                HOOD
                  Yes.

    Hood clicks again as Rachel enters the room on a key. 
      HOSPITAL SPECIALIST SUSPENDED.

                                  RACHEL
                  I forgot to leave your key. What s 
                  with the charm squad?

                                HOOD
                  Struck off.

                                  RACHEL
                  All I did was ask.

                                HOOD
                  These are all gynaecologists who ve

                  then you ll find one among the

    As he s speaking, up comes a photo of Sidney Hayward. 

                                  RACHEL
                  Isn t that ours?

    The headline reads HAYWARD CONDEMNED AS  DISGRACEFUL . The 
    picture shows a smoother, better-groomed Hayward in a pause-

    Hood summarises from the screen.

                                  RACHEL
                  Why not?

                                HOOD
                  He s not the one who s making the 
                    clones. He s just here to manage 
                  the host mothers.

                                  RACHEL
                  He could be doing both.

    Hood looks around. How to explain?

                                HOOD
                  Give me your tweezers.

      Puzzled, Rachel takes out a jellycard and pulls the tweezers 
    from it.

    Hood, meanwhile, takes a green grape from the mixed bunch on 
    the room s underwhelming fruit basket. He holds it up between 
    thumb and forefinger.

                                HOOD
                  This a woman s egg. The pip inside 
                  it is the nucleus with her unique 
                  DNA. To make a clone you first get 
                  rid of her nucleus...

    He plunges the tweezers into the grape stem hole.

                                  RACHEL
                          (wincing)
                    Hood...

    The tweezers come out with a grape pip, which he discards.                                                                                  39.



                                HOOD
                  And replace it with a nucleus from 
                  any cell of the person you want to 
                  clone. I need a different grape.

                                  RACHEL
                  I ll imagine.

                                HOOD
                  No, it s not the same.

    Jump cut to a pip being pulled from a black grape.

    Jump cut to Hood inserting the new pip into the original 
    grape.

                                HOOD
                    Original egg, new DNA in the 
                    nucleus. Shock it with a little 
                  jolt of electricity...

    He gives the grape a little flick.

                                HOOD
                  Which fools it into thinking it s 
                  been fertilised. Within a week...

    He holds up the small cluster of half a dozen black grapes.

                                HOOD
                    ...it s making stem cells that will 
                    develop into the person of your 
                    choice. You put this embryo back 
                  into a woman and then, and only 
                  then, does our incompetent 
                    gynaecologist enter the picture. 

    Rachel reaches over retrieves her sticky tweezers with an 
    expression of distaste.

                                HOOD
                  The man I want is the man who does 
                  the grapes.

                                  RACHEL
                  Goodnight, Hood.

    She leaves him to it.

    He pops the grape in his mouth.

                                  RACHEL (O.S.)
                    Cannibal.                                                                                  40.

    Kelly Fox sits on an examining couch with her knees drawn up 
    and a blanket over them. 

    A junior doctor who doesn t look much older is addressing her 
    while amending her notes.

                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                  Why d you let the pregnancy get 
                  this far without seeing anyone?

                                KELLY
                  I was fine with my first one.

                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                  Well, this time s different. We 
                  need to know what s causing the 
                  bleed.

                                KELLY
                  Are you going to give me something 
                  for it or not?

                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                  It s not that simple. Have a lie 
                  down. I ll be back in a minute.


    A short time later.

    The cubicle curtains part and Kelly pops her head out.

      Unobserved, she slides out and away.

    OMITTED255255


    Hood sits alone at a table. Reading a secondhand JG Ballard 
    paperback.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Finished?

                                HOOD
                  Yes, thank you. That was ever so 
                  good.                                                                                  41.



    He sits back so that she can clear the table for him.

    Ouch! Something s digging in. He reaches down behind and 
    comes up with...

    The panic button device. Seems he s been sitting on it.

    With a frown, he holds it to his ear. It s humming faintly.

    Peering through his reading glasses, he slides the little 
      thumb-switch off and on again.

    BAM!

    The restaurant doors burst open.

    SMASH!

    The waitress drops all her plates and cutlery as a charging 
    figure shoulders her aside.

    It s Rachel. Her hair s up and she s dripping wet. One hand 
      clutches a damp towel around her and the other hand holds a 
    9mm automatic ready to fire.

    She skids to a halt in the middle of the floor and then...

    Stillness. Only her eyes move as she quickly takes in the 
    room.

    Every diner is staring at her. At least one with mouth open 
    and fork in midair. 

    And there s Hood, innocently surprised, paused in the act of 
      fiddling with the device.

    Rachel blushes to her roots.

                                  RACHEL
                  Right.

    Then makes as abrupt and dignified a withdrawal as she can 
    manage.


    The junior doctor approaches with a nurse, and draws the 
    curtain aside to reveal...

    An empty cubicle, blanket thrown back. Blood spotting on the 
    couch s paper liner.                                                                                  42.




    Hood approaches. 

    He raises his knuckles to tap on one of the doors. 

    But before he even makes contact, the door jerks open about 
    six inches and one eye of Rachel looks out through the gap.

                                  RACHEL
                  Well done, Hood, you ve blown our 
                  cover.

                                HOOD
                  Buy you a drink to say sorry?

                                  RACHEL
                  You think I can show my face out 
                  there again?

    Slam! She closes the door on him.

                                HOOD
                  It s not your face they ll 
                    remember.

    As he starts to turn away from the door he sees...

                                DS COOK
                    Professor Hood!

    DS Cook, heading down the hotel corridor towards him. 

                                HOOD
                  Any luck with Sidney Hayward?

                                DS COOK
                  He d done a runner. But the 
                    hospital watch has turned up a 
                    pregnant teenager. Nineteen years 
                  old. Turned up bleeding at A and E. 
                  No prior care and some serious 
                    complications.

    Hood turns and bangs on the door behind him.

                                HOOD
                    Rachel. Rachel!!

    She opens it, again a crack.

                                HOOD
                  We re not done yet.                                                                                  43.



    She nods and vanishes. No messing.

                                SECOND COMMERCIAL BREAK


    BANG! Through a set of double doors.

    Hood and DS Cook come into view together, Rachel close 
    behind. All moving briskly.

                                HOOD
                  Any problem with patient 
                      confidentiality?

                                DS COOK
                  Duty of Care overrides it.


    They re running CCTV tapes from earlier in the day.

    One shows the children s play area by the waiting room. 
    Davy s there alone.

    Then Kelly rushes in, gathers him up, and exits. It s over in 
      moments.

    But they backwind, hunt around for the one frame that catches 
    Kelly full-face, and freeze on it.

                                HOOD
                    Doesn t that just put a human face 
                  on it?

    Big close up on the monitor. Seen at this distance, Kelly s 
    face comprises an op-art pattern of pixels that almost fills 
    the screen.


    Hood and Rachel talking to the junior doctor.

                                HOOD
                  They won t let her go to a proper 
                    doctor. But if she can t hang onto 
                  it, she probably won t get paid. 

                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                  She s well on her way to losing it. 

                                HOOD
                  Is she actually in danger?                                                                                  44.



                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                    Someone s punched her in the 
                    stomach. It s exposed a condition 
                  where the placenta s covering the 
                  exit of the uterus.

                                  RACHEL
                    Placenta Previa.

    They look at her.

                                  RACHEL
                  My sister-in-law had it. They said 
                  if it didn t correct itself they d 
                  give her an early caesarian.

                                  JUNIOR DOCTOR
                  Better that than a fatal 
                    haemorrhage. If contractions start 
                  with the placenta blocking the 
                  way...

    He makes a POW! hand gesture like a grenade exploding.

                                HOOD
                  She has no idea. 

    He launches off without explanation.


    Hood s heading for the treatment cubicles with Rachel 
      sticking close.

                                HOOD
                  An oversized placenta is one of the 
                    commonest features of a clone 
                  pregnancy. 

    And as we come around with them into the cubicle we find...

    An orderly stuffing the bloodstained covering straight from 
    the treatment couch into a hazard bag.

                                HOOD
                  Excuse me. I ll need that.

                  I prefer it simple.

                  You want it simple? Therapeutic

                  perversion of the science.

                  Making an embryo just to kill it 
                    doesn t sound too brilliant, 
                    either.

                  all the time. 

                                  RACHEL
                  So it s a numbers game. Same as 
                  with your cloner.

                                HOOD
                  Not the same.

                                  RACHEL
                  Only because one suits your 
                    argument and the other doesn t.

      Rachel s phone beeps with a text message.

    As she checks it...

                                HOOD
                  Who s it from?

                                  RACHEL
                  No-one you know.

    Rachel completing the security once-over, bathroom and 
      windows.

                                HOOD
                  You never got to eat.

                                  RACHEL
                  I ll survive.

    Hood rummages in his pocket and brings out a manky-looking 
    paper bag that you wouldn t want to touch. 

                                HOOD
                  I ve got a sandwich.

    He offers it.

                                  RACHEL
                  How old is that?

    He sniffs the bag and shrugs.

                                  RACHEL
                  Good night, Hood.

    She leaves him.


    Rachel closes Hood s door.

    Then sets off down the corridor.


    The restaurant s now deserted apart from Doug Cook, sitting 
    on a chair pulled out from an empty table with an uncapped 
    bottle of beer at his elbow.

    He rises when he sees Rachel coming.

                                DS COOK
                    Thought you were gone for the 
                  night.

                                  RACHEL
                  It was starting to look that way.

    She seizes him by the hand and tows him away. He s a bit 
    bewildered but he doesn t resist.                                                                                  49.



    We let them go.


    TV s on. Miniature teamaker kettle s on. Hood inspects his 
      sandwich and decides it s only fit for the bin.

    Having dumped it, he starts to throw his keys and loose 
    change and stuff onto the unit.

    Along the way he picks up the TV remote and switches on the 
    set.


    The minibar stands open. Empties are ranged on top of it. 
    Loads of ice in the ice bucket. Energetic music on the TV for 
      background.

    On the king-sized bed, Doug Cook and Rachel are playing gin 
    rummy, of all things.

                                  RACHEL
                  I came to him on a three month 
                    assignment. I ve been with him ever 
                  since. He won t have anyone else.

                                DS COOK
                  Why not?

                                  RACHEL
                  He reckons no-one else will do. 
                  Which means my entire career has 
                  been stopped in its tracks. Now 
                  every few days it s another town 
                  and another hotel with a bar full 
                  of salesmen like chihuahuas on 
                  heat. Half the people from my year 
                    already outrank me and if I ever do 
                  return to duties, I ll be the 
                  oldest newbie in the business. Gin.

    She lays down a completed hand of cards. Cook contemplates it 
    for a moment.

                                DS COOK
                  This should really be poker.

                                  RACHEL
                  I m useless at poker. Get on with 
                  it.                                                                                  50.



    He throws his cards down and starts to strip off his T-shirt. 
    It gets snarled up over his head and he has a struggle.

    Rachel gathers in all the cards and shuffles them like a pro.


    Hood s kicked off his shoes and stretched out on the bed 
    covers with the pillows wadded up behind him; remote in one 
    hand and a mug of coffee in the other, he s channel surfing 
    and has found an ad to be offended by.

                                TV VOICE-OVER
                    Essence Rouge harnesses the power 
                  of multihydrated liposomes to 
                    literally turn back the clock on 
                  ageing skin. 

                                HOOD
                  That s bollocks. Bollocks!

                                TV VOICE-OVER
                          (continuing under Hood)
                  Its special deep-penetration 
                    formula acts to reduce lines and 
                    wrinkles.


      Rachel s down to her underwear. 

    She rearranges her hand and discards a picture card...

    Which Doug Cook picks up and adds to his own.

                                DS COOK
                  Gin.

    He lays down his hand. Looks at Rachel.

    Rachel looks back. Anticipation in the air.

    Then there s a gap in the music and they hear...

                                HOOD (O.S.)
                          (muffled by the wall)
                    Absolute bollocks!


    Back with the music. Slam!                                                                                  51.



    The game abandoned, Rachel and Doug Cook hit the mattress 
    hard enough to make it bounce.

    Then Doug Cook suddenly hesitates.

                                DS COOK
                  What about protection?

                                  RACHEL
                  That s what I do all day.

    Rachel waits but he s a bit too anxious to appreciate the 
    gag... so she relents.

                                  RACHEL
                  In the drawer.

    He slides out of shot and we hear the bedside table drawer 
    being pulled open, followed by a nonplussed sound as Cook 
    finds something unexpected.

                                DS COOK
                  Oh.

                                  RACHEL
                  Behind that.

    As Cook gets what he needs and returns to her, we pan away 
    from them toward the bedside table.

      Whatever they re doing sounds like fun but we don t see 
      anything of it because we re pushing in on the open bedside 
    drawer to discover...

      Rachel s gun in its holster, lying on top of her clean 
    underwear.

                                THIRD COMMERCIAL BREAK


    Gifford s made a singlehanded start on packing the house up 
    and hasn t got very far.

                                HOOD
                  Hope I m not holding up your move.

                                  GIFFORD
                  This lot s for storage. I m taking 
                  a flat.

                                HOOD
                  We traced your company name from 
                  the import license on a consignment 
                  of frozen bull semen.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Do I look like a farmer?

                                HOOD
                  The license was a cover for 
                    something else. I take it you ve no 
                  idea what I m talking about.                                                                                  53.



                                  GIFFORD
                  Sorry to disappoint you. My 
                    company s been wound up, now. 
                  Anyone could be using the name.

                                HOOD
                  What line of business are you in?

                                  GIFFORD
                  I used to buy and sell office 
                  furniture. Until I sold up and 
                  liquidated the stock.

                                HOOD
                  What did you do then? Invest in 
                    biotech?

                                  GIFFORD
                  I haven t done science since I was 
                  at school. I ll stick to what I 
                  know.

                                HOOD
                  Office furniture.

    Gifford shrugs, his point already made.

      Rachel s looking at a collection of framed family photos 
    that s been gathered for packing.

                                  RACHEL
                  How old was your son when he died?

    Hood looks. Looks at the photos.

    It all clicks.

                                HOOD
                        (to himself)
                  Hood, you re an idiot. Where idiots 
                    gather, they will speak your name 
                  with awe.

    Gifford knows the game just changed. But he s calm.

                                  GIFFORD
                  To answer your question, he was 
                  seventeen. We d only just taken 
                  this place on.

                                HOOD
                  How did you lose him?                                                                                  54.



                                  GIFFORD
                  H E S. It s a rare blood disorder. 
                  You treat it with chemo and drugs 
                  but it goes for the major organs. 
                  With Simon it was the heart and the 
                  lungs.

                                HOOD
                  I m very sorry.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Sorry doesn t bring him back.

                                HOOD
                  But you think money will? Is that 
                  why you cashed in your company and 
                  sold up the house?

                                  GIFFORD
                  I don t expect you to understand, 
                  so perhaps you d better just leave.

                                HOOD
                  Who s doing it for you? Has he told 
                  you that you can see your son 
                  again? Because he s lying to you. 
                  The dead stay dead. 

                                  GIFFORD
                  Get out.

                                HOOD
                  Just his name! It s not just about 
                  you! There s a girl out there who 
                  could be bleeding to death right 
                  now!

                                  GIFFORD
                  Out!


    In a cramped attic bedroom, Sidney Hayward stands at the 
    washbasin in his vest, shaving. Across the room, his mobile 
    phone starts to ring.

    Lena Muller lies fully-clothed but shoeless on the bed. One 
    hand s over her eyes in a  I m-precious-and-I ve-got-a-
    migraine  pose.

    Hayward looks at her, sees that she isn t going to move, then 
    lays down his razor and moves to get the phone.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                        (into phone)
                  Yes.


    Gifford s in the kitchen.

                                  GIFFORD
                  It s Peter Gifford. I just had a 
                    Professor Hood here. Do you know 
                    anything about him?                                                                                  56.



                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                          (guarded)
                  Maybe.

                                  GIFFORD
                  You do or you don t.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  He could be the one who found the 
                  clinic setup.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Well, thanks for the warning! I m 
                    telling Luciano we need to cool it 
                  for a while.

    This is not what Hayward wants to hear.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  You can t do that.


    Continuing as before.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Is that true?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  On your son s life.

                                  GIFFORD
                  I might have known it.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  What?                                                                                  57.



                                  GIFFORD
                  Hood was trying to scare me by 
                  saying she was bleeding to death. 
                  The bastard.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                        (mind racing)
                  He said that?

    He kicks the bed, and gets some satisfaction as Lena Muller 
    jumps.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Look, if you pull the plug now, 
                  that could be the end of it. You ve 
                  seen how Luciano protects himself. 
                  You think your son will thank you 
                  if you pass up your last chance? 

    Gifford takes a moment. 

    Hayward briefly covers the phone and gestures to Lena Muller.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                        (to her)
                  Get your pouty arse in gear. He s 
                  trying to bail out on us. 

    Then back to the phone as her jaw drops...

                                  GIFFORD
                  What do we do?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Don t do anything hasty. I ll check 
                  on the mother right now.


    A DNA profile on a lightboard.

    Amanda Ross turns from it.

                                  AMANDA ROSS
                  Sorry, Hood. There s only one 
                    person s DNA in the sample you 
                    brought me.

    Hood looks on it despondently.

                                HOOD
                  So it s just the mother s?

                                  AMANDA ROSS
                  Yes.

    Rachel steps in.                                                                                  59.



                                  RACHEL
                  Can you run a familial search?

                                  AMANDA ROSS
                  If someone authorises it.

                                  RACHEL
                  You make a start and we ll get the 
                    authorisation. 

                                  AMANDA ROSS
                  Will do.

    She moves to it. Hood s aware that things just got a bit less 
    bleak but he s not sure how.

                                HOOD
                  A what?

                                  RACHEL
                  A familial search. DNA from every 
                  police case goes into the database. 
                    Doesn t matter if the girl herself 
                  isn t in there. You can look for a 
                  blood relation with points of 
                    similarity.

                                HOOD
                  So you don t even have to be in the 
                    database... as long as you ve got a 
                    relative who is?

                                  RACHEL
                  We found the Cardiff Valentine 
                  killer through a 14-year-old nephew 
                  who wasn t even born when the crime 
                  was committed.

      Curtains drawn. The TV playing. Hayward leads the way through 
    into the sitting room.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Kelly? 

    In the sitting room... toys everywhere, the TV s on, and the 
    young woman s hunched shape lies on the sofa.

      Quickly, Hayward moves to her. He crouches by the sofa and 
    opens up his medical bag.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Kelly. Why didn t you call me?

                                KELLY
                        (in pain)
                  If I m not doing well enough, 
                  you ll just get rid of it.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Not this one, we won t.

    Amanda Ross phoning from before a computer screen with search 
      results.

                                  AMANDA ROSS
                  Hood, I ve got a strong contender 
                  for you. Kelly Ann Fox, single 
                    teenage mother, one child, in 
                    council accommodation.


    Rachel driving, Hood on the phone.

                                HOOD
                  Let me write down the address.

    He gets out his palm pilot.

                                HOOD
                  Hang on. The battery s down.                                                                                  62.



    Without even looking, Rachel produces a notepad from 
    somewhere on the dash.

                                HOOD
                    Thanks.

    Now he starts to pat his pockets for a pen.

    With similar economy of movement, Rachel reaches up and pulls 
    a pen from his sun visor.

    Hood clicks the pen. Then keeps clicking it because he can t 
    make it work.

                                  RACHEL
                          (raising her voice)
                  Text it to him.


    Kelly sitting upright on the sofa now, a blanket around her 
    shoulders. Lena Muller s cleaning Kelly s face up with wipes, 
    taking off the tearstains and the smudged mascara.

                                KELLY
                          (attempting optimism)
                  I m sure I can still feel it 
                    moving. 

                                LENA MULLER
                  Don t you worry. The doctor s 
                  making the arrangements.

                                KELLY
                  I don t even care about the money 
                  any more.

                                LENA MULLER
                  Shh... shh... shh.

                                KELLY
                  I was all right till he punched me.

    The door buzzer rings.

                                LENA MULLER
                  See? The doctor s back. Told you he 
                    wouldn t be long. You finish up.

    She puts a clean wipe into Kelly s hand and leaves her to 
    carry on in a weak and halfhearted manner, as she heads to 
    the door.                                                                                  63.




    Roly lies on the floor, curled up, scissors jammed deep into 
    his neck so they re buried right up to the hilt, panting like 
    a dog.

    Hood comes up and crouches by him.

                                HOOD
                  Who did this?

                                ROLY
                  That old cow. She came up from 
                  behind me.

                                HOOD
                    Where s Kelly Fox?                                                                                  65.



                                ROLY
                  How would I know. Get me the 
                  ambulance.

                                HOOD
                  I m going to ask you again, and 
                  it s important. Where is she?

                                ROLY
                  I can t feel my legs. Ambulance! 
                  Ambulance!

                                HOOD
                  When you tell me.

    Hood waits.

    Roly starts to panic and blubber.


    Gifford comes into the main room. He doesn t see Rachel 
    waiting behind the door, but we do. 

    She reaches out and closes it just as he s realising that 
    Hood s in the room.

    He looks this way and that, momentarily wrong-footed. Then...

                                  GIFFORD
                        (pissed off)
                  Oh, great.

                                HOOD
                  You know what s happening today.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Yes I do.

                                HOOD
                  Then tell us where they took Kelly 
                  Fox.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Forget it. You re not going to 
                  interfere.

                                HOOD
                  Look. I know you think I don t 
                  understand what you re going 
                    through. Where s your wife?

                                  GIFFORD
                  Don t think you can get it out of 
                  her. She left me.

                                HOOD
                  I think I can guess why.

                                  GIFFORD
                    Because I m obsessed. All right? 
                  What of it?

                                HOOD
                  Mine died two years ago.                                                                                  67.



                                  GIFFORD
                  I m sorry.

                                HOOD
                  So am I. I had to nurse her through 
                  her last illness, and every single 
                  day of it I d find some little sign 
                  to let me think she might get 
                    better. Do you think I don t have 
                  the same dreams as you? There isn t 
                  a day goes by when I don t wish her 
                  back.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Don t tell me that s the same! I m 
                  sorry, but it isn t. One of you 
                  dies first, it s sad but that s the 
                  deal. Try losing a child! Because 
                  that s the day you die too. You re 
                  all rotten and dead on the inside, 
                  and the outside s just a shell that 
                  walks around. Your life is over but 
                  the pain goes on.

                                HOOD
                  That s grief. It s natural.

                                  GIFFORD
                  I know, and they call it the price 
                  tag on love. Well, I don t accept 
                  it!

                                HOOD
                  What s your answer, then? Because 
                  what you re trying can only make it 
                  worse.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Not possible.

                                HOOD
                  Don t make me prove it to you.

                                  GIFFORD
                  I m going to see my son again and 
                    there s not a thing you can do 
                  about it.

    Hood stops.

    He s reached the end of his road. He s given it his best 
    shot, but it s clear to him now that nothing he says is going 
    to make any difference.                                                                                  68.



    He meets Rachel s eyes. A barely perceptible lift of his 
    head, which sets her moving.

                                HOOD
                  Just remember that I didn t want it 
                  to come to this.

                                  GIFFORD
                  All right, then. What s coming now?

    Rachel moves to Hood s side. We now see that she s brought in 
    one of the cardboard evidence boxes, which she gives to him.

                                HOOD
                  You want to see your son again.

    Hood holds the box up in front of Gifford and opens the lid.

    For a moment Gifford doesn t understand what he s looking at.

                                HOOD
                  This is just one of them. They re 
                  still finding more. 

    Then he understands, but he can t quite believe that Hood 
    would do this.

    In the end he just stares down into the box, blank with 
    shock.

    Hood moves around beside him and speaks with persuasive 
      urgency.

                                HOOD
                  Even if he survived the damage, 
                  this would never be the boy you 
                  knew. He d be some other, different 
                  child. 

    Gifford raises his gaze to stare at Hood.

                                HOOD
                  What price your little angel now?

    Gifford looks back into the box. He s broken now, and about 
    to fall.

                                HOOD
                  I can t speak for the child that s 
                  being born. But the girl who s 
                    carrying him will die if you don t 
                  help me.                                                                                  69.




    It s tasteful and expensive-feeling but it s more like a 
    sterilised country hotel than any kind of a modern hospital; 
    no-one on reception, and empty corridors. Fresh flowers in 
    the foyer, the odd antique.

    We go with Hood and Rachel move through, looking into rooms 
    as they pass...

                                  RACHEL
                  Where is everyone?

                                HOOD
                  I know this kind of place. You pay 
                  top whack for a skeleton staff and 
                  the part-time attention of a 
                    moonlighting consultant.

                                  RACHEL
                  You speak from experience.

                                HOOD
                  I do.                                                                                  70.



    Hood s spotted an auxiliary emptying bins in one of the 
    rooms.

                                HOOD
                  Hey, Miss. You.

    She looks somewhat intimidated as Hood comes bearing down on 
    her.

                                HOOD
                  I need your help.


    The auxiliary leads Hood and Rachel through a doorway and 
    points them at the treatment rooms.


    Hood bursts in to find...

    There s a man in shirtsleeves, sleeves rolled up, end of his 
    tie tucked into his shirt, performing two-handed pressure 
    heart massage on an inert Kelly Fox. Fifteen quick 
      compressions and then one squeeze of the oxygen bag. She s 
    bled out badly on the table.

                                HOOD
                  What happened?

                                  LUCIANO
                  Her blood pressure dropped and her 
                  heart stopped beating.

                                HOOD
                  Her name s Kelly Fox. Is there 
                    anything I can do?

    The man looks up, and their eyes meet. 

                                  LUCIANO
                  You can get the oxygen. When I 
                  stop, squeeze the bag and give her 
                  a breath. (Looks at Rachel) If you 
                  want to be useful, find a duty 
                    doctor.

    She goes. Luciano drops to five compressions, then nods to 
    Hood for a squeeze of the bag.

                                HOOD
                  How long s she been like this?                                                                                  71.



                                  LUCIANO
                  Long enough. Keep squeezing until 
                  you see her chest move.


    Rachel races through the corridors, flinging open doors.

                                  RACHEL
                  Police emergency!


    Both men working on Kelly.

                                HOOD
                  What about the baby?

                                  LUCIANO
                  Dead. It was dead when I got here.

                                HOOD
                  It kills me to say it, but I count 
                  that as a blessing.

                                  LUCIANO
                  Shame on you. Every child is a gift 
                  from God.

                                HOOD
                  God was looking the other way when 
                  this one got its start.
                  When I find the man who put it 
                  there, he s going to suffer.

    Luciano abruptly ceases the heart massage and crosses the 
    room to where his jacket hangs on a chair.

                                HOOD
                  What are you doing?

                                  LUCIANO
                  You need to take over. 

    He s pulling on his jacket as he heads for the door.

                                HOOD
                  Don t just walk away from her!

                                  LUCIANO
                  Five compressions. Then one breath.

    And he s gone.                                                                                  72.



    Hood moves around the table. She s lying there and he has no 
    idea.

    He begins two-handed heart massage, imitating Luciano as best 
    he can. Five compressions, then a squeeze on the bag.

    OMITTED306306


    Rachel turns a corner and finds...

    Sidney Hayward, struggling to manoeuver a trolley through a 
      doorway.

    Their eyes meet.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  I ve got the crash trolley. Find me 
                  a nurse.


    Hood operating the oxygen. All the way through this, Kelly s 
    made no response or shown any sign of life.

    And now Hood lets the mask fall aside. 

    She s still. Gently, he lays his hand against her cheek.

    On Hood -- the wrench as, in his heart, he lets her go.


      Rachel s flying at us down the corridor with a Sidney Hayward 
    and a uniformed nurse driving the trolley along  behind her.


    It s all over.

    Kelly still lying in the same position on the table.

    Hood by the window, head bowed in dejection.

    Rachel bursts in and holds the door open for Hayward and the 
    nurse to push the trolley through.

    Then she moves to Hood. We re aware of Hayward and the Nurse 
    attending to Kelly, but our focus is on Rachel as she lays a 
    tentative hand of consolation on Hood.                                                                                  73.



    Then...

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                        (to Nurse)
                  She s got a brady. Do the airway. 
                  I ll get some atropine into her.

    Hood perks up and the weariness falls from him as 
    understanding dawns.

                                  RACHEL
                  What s a brady?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Faint irregular heartbeat. Where s 
                    Luciano?

    Hood s still taking in the first revelation.

                                HOOD
                  How would I know?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  He wanted to be present for the 
                  birth.

    Hood takes a moment to absorb this.

    Then he turns to the window and rips the blind aside.


    We go with Hood as he races down the corridor, out through 
    the entranceway, and onto the empty forecourt...                                                                                  74.



    Where the cab is long gone.

    OMITTED309309


    The visitor area. Kelly s up and about in a dressing-gown but 
    she s bearing all the marks of the rough time she s had.

    Hood s with her. Rachel waits a few yards off.

                                KELLY
                  They said if I was interested, I 
                  could help some poor couple who 
                    couldn t have a baby and make some 
                  money at the same time. I can 
                    imagine why they picked on me.

                                HOOD
                  Young, fit, one pregnancy and no 
                    complications.

                                KELLY
                  More like a teenaged slapper who d 
                  been knocked up once already. You 
                  can t spoil damaged goods.

                                HOOD
                  I m really sorry, Kelly.

                                KELLY
                  Now they re saying I can never have 
                    another kid. I don t mind. It s not 
                  fair on them. Not in a world like 
                  this.

                                HOOD
                  Anyone I can call for you?

    She shakes her head... And Hood can see that her attention 
    has focused on something beyond him.

    He looks back and sees...

    Davy, entering the ward on the hand of a social worker.

    On Kelly -- it s as if her face is slowly lighting up from 
    within.

    Hood can see that he s now surplus to requirements. He rises 
    to go.                                                                                  75.



                                HOOD
                  See you later.

    Kelly barely acknowledges him, and never takes her eyes off 
    her approaching son. She pushes herself up in her chair a 
    little.

    Hood withdraws, and Rachel with him.


    Hood and Rachel, walking side by side, this whole exchange 
    played over their backs and on the longest lens we can get 
    away with.

    Hood s posture gives away his mood.

                                  RACHEL
                  What s the matter, Hood? You did 
                  well. You saved a life. 

                                HOOD
                  But I didn t get him.

                                  RACHEL
                  Proud of you anyway.

    They walk on.

    OMITTED312312


    On the soundtrack, a long low ominous note that tells us it 
    ain t over yet.

    A well-manicured hand slides some pictures across a desk. 
    They re all interview shots of young women around 19 or 20.

                                  LUCIANO
                  These are the girls. All young and 
                    healthy. This time I m very 
                    optimistic.

    Luciano sits back. He s in an executive chair in a nice 
    office. Obviously on his home territory.

                                  LUCIANO
                  Soon, very soon, you will be 
                    holding your son in your arms. I 
                  can guarantee you, there will be no 
                    feeling in the world like it. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                  76.

                                  LUCIANO (cont'd)
                  This time the signs just couldn t 
                  be better.

    And now we see who s looking at the pictures.

    It s Gifford.

    Who no longer has the excuse of his ignorance, but is driven 
    to go ahead anyway.

    A man who knows what it is to be damned.
