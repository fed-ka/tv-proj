      A COUPLE is engaged in passionate love-making.  DUNCAN, early 
      40s and dapper, has LISBETH, also early 40s and classically 
      attractive -- pinned amidst the aging wine bottles.

                                    LISBETH
                    Do you think they re going to hear 
                    us?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Only if we keep doing it right...

      Another beat of lovemaking.  We re not quite sure who this 
      pair of lovers is until...

                                    LISBETH 
                    Oh...I forgot to mention -- you 
                    need to talk to Cameron.  She 
                    dropped out of school last week.

      Duncan looks at her.  Lisbeth nods.  But he stays focused on 
      the task at hand.  And Lisbeth seems to be enjoying it too.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    God.  If we did it like this when 
                    we were married, we might still be 
                    married.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Or just very, very tired.

      DUNCAN COLLINSWORTH, CEO REVEAL COSMETICS.

      The necklace rests in the hand of WALTER STORRS, late 50s and 
      craggily handsome.  Walter is the CEO of AMERIMART 
      INDUSTRIES.  As he admires it, the door pushes open and

      JAMES WALKER, 35, enters.  James is our moral center, 
      handsome with an easy charm that makes him instantly 
      likeable.  He notes the necklace in Walter s hands.

                                  JAMES 
                          (re: the necklace)
                    Your wife is a very lucky woman, 
                    sir.

      Walter says nothing.  He simply slips the necklace back into 
      its BLACK CASE.  Then he motions for James to sit across from 
      him in one of the leather club chairs.

                                  WALTER
                    James.  Thanks for meeting me.  So 
                    tell me -- how long have you been a 
                    member of Firmwood?

                    Since my Christmas bonus. And thank 
                    you for that, by the way.

                                  WALTER
                    Well, I hope it won t be awkward.  
                    Running into each other here.

                                  JAMES
                    Why would it be awkward?  We see 
                    each other at the office every day.

                                  WALTER
                    Because I m letting you go.

      James is stunned.  Off his look...

                          (cutting him off)
                    The Board doesn t know yet.  No one 
                    does.  But when I present my 
                      reorganization plan to the 
                      stockholders tomorrow, they won t 
                    have any choice.  
                          (beat)
                    You ll land on your feet, James.  I 
                    know you will. You re a survivor.  
                    That s why I hired you in the first 
                    place.

      James shakes his head in disbelief.  Walter stands to leave, 
      then turns back.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Oh.  And since you re new here, 
                    make sure you try the shrimp -- 
                    it s one of life s true pleasures.

      And with that, the CEO is gone.  James remains, shell-
      shocked, his professional life flashing before his eyes.  A 
      moment ago, the shining future of AmeriMart and now...nearly 
      unemployed.  We FREEZE FRAME over him as the screen reads --

      James, a briefcase in one hand and his PASS CARD in the 
      other, steps off the escalator and tentatively approaches the

      James enters.  After a beat, KATIE GRAHAM -- mid-30s and 
      attractive -- swivels around in James  desk chair.

                    our friends upstairs. 

      Katie smiles.  The pair couldn t be closer.  In fact, around 
      AmeriMart, she s referred to as James   work wife. 

                                  KATIE
                    Rumor is that the front-runner for

                    who hit on me at the Sun Valley 
                      conference.

                                  JAMES
                    Wait a sec.  Didn t you sleep with 
                    that guy?

                                  KATIE
                    I said he was a jerk, not that he 
                    wasn t hot.

      James rolls his eyes and exits.  Katie follows him out the 
      door and --


      James and Katie stand side-by-side.

                                  KATIE

                    don t remember what it s like to be 
                    single.  You have to kiss a few

                    I think I know how this story ends.

      Karl and his wife, WENDY -- late 30s and plainly pretty -- 
      sit across from the dour couples  therapist, DR. DARLENE 
      SEAVER-FILNER.  Filled with guilt, Karl looks like he d 
      rather be anywhere else.

                                  WENDY
                    I mean, I must sound like a 
                      clich ...but sometimes I wonder if 
                    Karl is seeing someone else.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Are you, Karl?

                                  KARL
                    Yes.  My staff of twelve hundred 
                    employees who count on me each and 
                    every day.

                                  WENDY
                    It s ironic.  When I had a career 
                    and friends, Karl wanted more of 
                    me.  So I quit my job and stayed 
                    home and now he complains that I 
                    smother him.  
                          (then)
                    And we barely do anything together 
                    anymore.  Last week, I asked Karl 
                    to go to the movies.  To see  The 
                    Nanny Diaries.   He said he had to 
                    work.  On a Sunday.

                                  DR. SEAVER-FILNER
                    Karl...as a gesture to Wendy, could 
                    you find the time to take her to 
                    the movies?  I think it could be a 
                    small but important step in 
                    repairing this marriage.  

      But Karl is distracted when he looks down at his cell phone, 
      as it reads  NEW TEXT MESSAGE RECEIVED

                      Karl...could you?

      ANGLE ON THE TEXT MESSAGE    I MISS YOUR PENIS. 

      Karl is flustered.  Clearly it s from his mistress.  He puts 
      down the phone and looks up at the therapist.

                                  KARL
                          (at a loss)
                    Yes, sorry.  Forgot to shut off my

      Duncan is immediately flustered.  Clearly, she s struck a 
      nerve.  But he does his best to hide it.

      The Wake is in progress.  MOURNERS file past the deceased 
      CEO s body to pay their respects.  The room is crowded with 
      EMPLOYEES AND FRIENDS including Stacey (James  wife), Katie 
      (James   work wife ) and our four guys.

                    That makes one of us.

      James looks unsurely at her, then reaches into his breast 
      pocket and takes out the BLACK JEWELRY CASE that was on the 
      CEO s body at the time of his death.  He hands it to her.

                                  JAMES 
                    I think this belongs to you.  They 
                    left it behind at the scene.

      The Widow opens the case but -- it s EMPTY.  James is 
      surprised.  But a wry, knowing grin forms on her face. 

                                  WIDOW
                      Apparently he found someone more 
                    deserving than me.

      The Widow moves off.  James -- a  little stunned -- moves 
      towards Katie.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  20.

                          (to Katie)
                    Probably bad etiquette to gossip at 
                    a wake, but the necklace -- not for 
                    the loyal wife.  For the other 
                    woman.  He must have given her the 
                    necklace right before he died.

                                  KATIE

                                  JAMES

                    Guy s worth forty million and not 
                    even a sniff in my direction.

      James smiles.  Katie notices that Stacey is sobbing quietly 
      to herself as she takes in the body.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                          (re: Stacey)
                    She okay?

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah, you know Stacey. She takes 
                    things hard.  I mean, when our 
                    springer spaniel died, she was a 
                    mess for --

      But James watches as Stacey surreptitiously takes the DIAMOND 
      NECKLACE from her hand bag and sets it gently on the hand of 
      the dead CEO. The VERY SAME DIAMOND NECKLACE that we saw 
      earlier.  James stares at it.  His face ashen.

                                  KATIE
                    You okay?
                          (no answer)
                    James?

      James can t even hear Katie.  His stunned gaze is fixed on 
      his wife.  The love of his life was apparently the love of 
      another man s too.  

      Katie studies the pain in James  face, as if trying to 
      understand it.  But she doesn t and he doesn t bother to 
      explain.  He bolts from the room.  Pushes through the crowd 
      and out the door.  As Katie watches in concern, we...SMASH TO 
      BLACK.

      James -- reeling from the discovery that his wife has been 
      having an affair with his dead boss -- splashes water on his 
      face as he stares at himself in the mirror, as if searching 
      for the wounds that he feels so deeply.  After a beat, Duncan 
      emerges from one of the stalls.

                    - a pine coffin?  Very tacky.

      James doesn t react.  He s lost in his own thoughts.  Duncan 
      notes James  preoccupation.

                    Just trying to breathe. 

      Duncan nods.  He looks at James as if he d like to press the

                    sleep together?

                                  KARL
                    No, I told you.  Not in months.  
                    And honestly, after being with you, 
                    I m not sure we were even doing it 
                    right to begin with.

                                  MARLA
                    But you still do other things with 
                    her, right?  And I love you so much I 
                    want to do those things with you, too.

                                  KARL
                    The truth is -- there s only one 
                    thing we do together anymore.  Couples  
                    therapy.  Two mornings a week.

                    Then that s what I want to do with you.

                          (huh?)
                    But we re not even married.  Plus 
                    we get along great.  We don t need 
                    couples  therapy.

                    Oh, I see how this works.  I do things

                    Um, Mr. Mixworthy?  A word.

      Karl and Dr. Seaver-Filner huddle off to the side, out of

                    what her real skill is?  Making an

      As Brody s car fires down the Thruway...


      James sits at his desk.  Looking every bit the man whose 
      whole world has been turned upside down. Barely slept.  
      Unshaven, no tie.  Although a few tie options rest on his 
      desk.  After a beat, his cell phone rings.  He looks at the 
      display which reads  STACEY CALLING.   He presses a button 
      and redirects it to voice mail.

      Just then, Katie enters.  Stylish and confident in her sleek 
      Prada suit.  She takes him in.

                                  KATIE

                    By the way, why d you run out of

                    this job.  And except for men, I m 
                    pretty good at getting what I want.

      After an early morning round of golf, Karl pulls Brody into a 
      secluded corner of the club...

                                  KARL
                    I need to end it.  With Marla.  I 
                    mean, we have nothing in common. 
                    The only books she reads are about 
                    the differences between good carbs 
                    and bad.

                                  BRODY
                    So end it. What s the problem?

      Karl reaches into his pocket and takes out a PAIR of the 
      SLINKIEST, SEXIEST PANTIES that we ve ever seen.  He HOLDS 
      them up for Brody to see.

                    How do you break up with a woman

      Duncan exits.  Cameron looks around, taking in the massive 
      job that lays ahead of her and exhales.


      James, wearing his blue tie, sits alone -- lost in thought --  
      in a lobby chair. We HEAR approaching footsteps and then a

                    double our market share.  Right 
                    now, there are two kids in a garage 
                    inventing something that will put 
                    us out of business someday.  
                    Instead of ignoring those kids, we 
                    should be hiring them.  And you 
                    know what they ll call us if we 
                    don t?   Available office space.

                    Now I m sure your dream applicants 
                    have perfect resumes and 
                      unblemished lives and have 
                    succeeded at everything they ve 
                    ever done.  But if I were you, I d 
                    hire the guy who knows what it 
                    feels like to lose something.  
                    Because he ll never let it happen

                                        ACT FOUR


      Karl lies in bed.  Post-coital.  Marla -- in a skirt and bra -
      - takes herself in in the full-length mirror.

                                  MARLA
                    I wished I hadn t eaten all that 
                    bread at lunch.  Nothing worse than 
                    bad carbs. 

      Karl exhales.  He can t listen to these inanities anymore. 

                                  KARL
                          (haltingly)
                    Marla... if I may... we ve had 
                    quite an adventure, you and I.  But 
                    like every great adventure... there 
                    comes a time when --

      Marla isn t really listening, as she opens her pocketbook.

                                  MARLA 
                    Damn.  I forgot to go to the cash 
                    machine.  Can you loan me twenty 
                    dollars for a cab?

                                  KARL
                    Pants pocket.
                          (beat, continuing)
                    Like I was saying.  Everything has 
                    it s time and place, but --

      Marla picks up Karl s pants, takes out his wallet.  But 
      instead of cash, she pulls out two TICKET STUBS.  We re CLOSE 
      on the tickets which read,  The Nanny Diaries.   Marla 
      furrows her brow.

                                  MARLA 
                          (unsure, re: the tickets)
                    You saw  The Nanny Diaries?

                    Last night.  Wendy was dying to see it.  

      Marla stops short.  She thinks, then...

                                  MARLA
                    But you said -- hmmm, you said you 
                    don t spend time together anymore.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  39.


                                  KARL
                    We don t. The couple s therapist 
                    thought it would be a good idea.  
                    But getting back to what I was --

      Marla exhales.  Scorned, she s instantly on the war-path.

                                  MARLA 
                    Well, don t I feel like a fool? I 
                    mean, you had me convinced that you 
                    and your wife were practically 
                    strangers and --

                                  KARL
                    We are...

                                  MARLA
                    Well, I don t go to the movies with 
                      strangers, Karl.  Do you?
                          (beat, angry)
                    I mean, what kind of man would be 
                    so deceitful as to lie to the woman 
                    he s cheating on his wife with?

      Karl looks like his head might explode.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    You know, I bet Wendy would like to 
                    know what her loving husband is up 
                    to when he s not at home.

                                  KARL
                          (alarmed)
                    What are you saying?  You re gonna 
                    tell her...about us?

                                  MARLA
                    Not everything.  Just the part 
                    about the sex in the hotel rooms.

      Marla exits. Karl wraps a sheet around himself and scurries 
      to the door. A CHAMBERMAID looks at him askance.

                                  KARL
                          (calling after her)
                      Marla...wait.  Let s discuss this 
                    in couples  therapy!  

      But it s no use -- she s gone.  On Karl, worried, we SMASH TO --    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  40.



      Karl, Brody, Duncan and a contemplative James are wrapped in 
      towels in the steam room.  Karl clearly has just finished 
      recounting Marla s threat.

                                  DUNCAN
                    C mon, Karl.  The mistress never 
                    tells.  Just buy her something 
                    nice.  Like some jewelry.  Or a low-
                    carb bar.

                                  KARL
                    I was inches from ending it.  And -- 
                    now...  I mean, maybe Wendy and I 
                    have grown apart lately, but the 
                    thought of losing her...

                                  JAMES
                          (edgy)
                    You know what s funny?  You re so 
                    worried about losing her but maybe 
                    you ve lost her already.

                                  KARL
                          (shocked, re: James)
                    What?  What s he talking about?

                                  JAMES
                    How do you know she s not spending 
                    her afternoons in some hotel room, 
                    too?  Lying in bed with your 
                      contractor having the same 
                      conversations about you.

                                  KARL
                    But Wendy hates our contractor.  He 
                    was completely unreliable...

      Brody, Duncan and Karl share a look over James  
        uncharacteristic behavior.  Duncan turns to James.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (gently, knowingly)
                    What s wrong, James?

      James looks up at his friends.  A long beat, then...

                                  JAMES
                    Stacey was having an affair with my 
                    boss.

      The guys all turn to James.  Full of surprise and concern.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  41.



                                  DUNCAN
                          (shocked)
                    You re kidding?  The dead guy?

      James nods.

                                  KARL
                    Man, I don t know what to say...  

                                  BRODY
                    Well, I do -- that sucks.  And I d 
                    offer to take the guy out if Hector 
                    hadn t already done it for us...

      James nods appreciatively.  A long beat, as the guys let the 
      moment linger.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Okay.  All this genuine emotion is 
                    making me a little uneasy.

                                  BRODY 
                          (shakes his head)
                    Look at us.  We re supposed to be 
                    these Alpha Males.  And now... 
                    James  wife is sleeping around, 
                    Karl can t control his crazy 
                    mistress and I m too whipped to 
                    tell my wife that the delivery 
                    company can t find her shipment of

                    Men.  We re the new women.

      Just then, Brody s cell phone -- which sits next to him on 
      the wood bench -- rings.

                                  BRODY

                    Don t give me that.  A cream 
                    filling is no excuse...

      Brody pats James on the back, exits.  Duncan turns to James.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I ve always said Brody had a real 
                    Napoleon complex.

      James smiles.  The joke cheers him slightly. Then Karl stands...

                                  KARL 
                            (apologetically)
                    Hey, uh, I should probably be 
                    going, too.  See if Wendy s had the 
                    accounts frozen.

      Karl exits.  Only Duncan and James remain.  A long, silent 
      beat as the two friends sit alone.  Then, Duncan says simply --

                                  DUNCAN 
                          (re: Stacey)
                    I m sorry.

                                  JAMES
                    Yeah.  Me, too.

      And as the pair sits quietly, we re --


      Karl steps into his living room and, much to his horror, he 
      sees Marla and Wendy sitting on the couch and having tea.  
      Karl does his best not to betray a reaction.  Wendy looks up 
      at him with a serious look.

                                  WENDY
                    I can t believe you, Karl.  All I 
                    can say is -- I m shocked.

      Karl s heart is immediately in his throat.

                                  KARL
                    Right.  Well, about that --

                    Why didn t you tell me you hired a 
                      decorator?  Marla and I were just 
                      discussing ideas for the guest 
                    house.

      Karl can only force a weak smile.  Apparently, Marla hasn t 
      yet revealed the affair.

                    It s so unlike Karl to take an

                     Angry?  I ve given her everything

                    That s true.  But did you ever 
                    notice, that after she turned 
                    twelve she stopped asking?

      Clearly, this lands on Duncan.  He s instantly lost in 
      thought.  Lisbeth looks up at him with sympathy.

                                    LISBETH (CONT D)
                    Look.  You may not have been the 
                    greatest father to date.  But 
                    you re a good man.  And the best 
                    thing about being a father   every 
                    day s a chance to do better.

                    Were you this pretty when we were 
                    married?

                                    LISBETH

                    Your date.  So you like this guy?

                                    LISBETH
                    I might.

                                  DUNCAN
                    If it gets serious...no more wine 
                    cellars for us, right?

                                    LISBETH
                    That s right, Duncan.

                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan stands, grabs his drink off the tray of the arriving 
      waitress and starts to exit.  As he does, he passes a MAN IN 
      A SUIT -- Lisbeth s date -- entering.  Duncan sizes him up as

                    Then what are you doing here?

                                  MARLA
                    Well, I came here to tell her.  But 
                    then I realized -- Wendy s not the 
                    one I want to hurt.  And then we 
                    got to talking and you know what?  
                    We kind of hit it off.

                          (not thrilled)
                    You hit it off with my wife?

                    Karl.  How you could not appreciate 
                    her is beyond me.  She s a gem.  I 
                    have half a mind to fix her up with 
                    my super.

      Karl looks stunned, as Wendy emerges with his drink.

                    I never liked her, you know.  Even 
                    when I said I did, I didn t.

      James looks up at her.

                    Of course, if you take her back, 
                    I ll deny ever saying that.

                                  JAMES
                    Who told you?

                                  KATIE
                    Not you.  I had to find out the old-

      Katie nods. 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    What are they saying?

                                  KATIE
                    The men hate her.  The women are 
                    trying to figure out when you ll be 
                    ready to date.

                    And a lot of women out there can 
                    see it. Even if your wife can t.

      James nods appreciatively.  If he was in a better place, this 
      might be a moment.  So let s call it a moment-adjacent.  But 
      Katie can t help but notice something in James  face...

                    You re not kidding.

      Katie can t quite believe it.  She s happy for James but, at 
      the same time, she s an incredibly competitive person.

      The party for Janelle, Brody s wife, is in full swing.  We 
      PAN ACROSS the room -- from the sea of Napoleons on the

      Just then, Duncan s face turns ashen as he looks to the 
      ENTRANCE of the room to see --

      Dontrelle, standing in the doorway.  Duncan nearly chokes on 
      his drink.

      A WOMAN -- we can t see her face -- gives Brody a hug and 
      disappears into the crowd.  This is JANELLE, Brody s wife.  
      Brody smiles to himself, self-satisfied, as James steps in 
      next to him.

                    Janelle s thrilled.  She s having a

      Brody uncharacteristically softens.

                    I know I bitch about her.  But 
                    she s got another side, too.  Maybe 
                    you don t see it.  Maybe I don t 
                    see it as much as I used to.  But 
                    we just fit, you know?

                    Yeah.  I know.

      Then, James does his best to pull himself out of his reverie 
      and indicates the dessert table filled with Napoleons.

      reporter who earlier interviewed Duncan.

                                  DONTRELLE
                    He seems like a nice guy.  I don t 
                    know why you needed me to tape him.

                                  LORI
                    Because a thousand words paint a 
                    very nice picture...

      Dontrelle shrugs.  And as Lori cradles the tape in her hands -
      - and we wonder to ourselves about the intrigue that awaits 
      us, we re...    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  56.




      James joins Duncan, Brody and Karl in mid-conversation.

                                  BRODY
                    One.  Just one for me.  The lady 
                    with the cute forked tail.

      As James sits down at the table...

                                  JAMES
                    What are you guys talking about?

                                  DUNCAN
                    The number of women in our lives 
                    who drive us absolutely off the 
                      reservation.

                                  KARL
                    Two for me.

      ANGLE ON MARLA AND WENDY -- on the dance floor, as they dance 
      and laugh with one another.

                                  KARL (CONT D)
                          (swigs his drink)
                    God help me.

                                  JAMES
                    I m with Brody.  One...

      INSERT STACEY -- as she stands forlorn by the pool.

      BACK TO JAMES -- as he watches Katie, across the party.  
      Brody notices James watching her.

                                  BRODY
                    But ask him again in six months.

      The guys smile.  Karl turns to Duncan.

                                  KARL
                    What about you, Dunc?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Two and a half.

                                  BRODY
                          (unsure)
                     Two and a half? 

      INSERT LISBETH, feigning interest on her dinner date.  
      Clearly, Duncan s on her mind.    UNTITLED JON FELDMAN PROJECT     3/27/07   FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT  57.



                                  DUNCAN
                    There s Lisbeth...

      INSERT CAMERON -- later that night -- as she finishes 
      organizing the mail room and smiles to herself, pleased.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Cameron, of course.
                          (beat)
                    And I think Dontrelle s worth a 
                    half, don t you?

                                  KARL
                    To Dontrelle!  

      The guys start to raise their glasses in a toast...

                                  BRODY
                    And Duncan, I have two words for 
                    you -- corrective lenses...

      As the guys laugh and clink their glasses, we re...
