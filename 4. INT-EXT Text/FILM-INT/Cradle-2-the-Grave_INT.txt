A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --
DOUGLAS
Last delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --
ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
Party?
DOUGLAS
Introducing a new line of jewelry.
ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
Told her to spend a little time with
the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --
ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
Keep it real.
We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...
3.
An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.
The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.
A train arrives.
People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.
When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.
The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.
Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.
FAIT
Watch yourself.
Miles nods.
4.
FAIT
Keep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.
Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.
ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.
BACK TO SCENE
Douglas settles back in with his magazine.
Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.
Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.
Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.
Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.
FAIT
Bull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.
Fait
pulls out a cell phone.
Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.
CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
Yes?
FAIT (V.O.)
We're in position.
CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
Delivery confirmed. The stones are
there.
FAIT (V.O.)
Not for long.
CLICK.
HISS.
Su didn't like what he just heard.
Curses in Chinese.
And
takes off.
6.
A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
SU (0.S.)
Where are the stones?
Christophe turns.
Sees Su standing behind him.
CHRISTOPHE
(French accent)
Who the fuck are you?
Wham.
The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
SU
Who's getting them for you?
CHRISTOPHE
Fuck off.
Wham!
Wham!
Wham!
Wham!
Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.
CHRISTOPHE
I'll tell you.
SU
I know.
A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...
A hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.
Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.
FAIT
Daria.
Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.
7.
ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
A limo pulls up outside.
Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
DARIA
I'm here for the reception.
DOUGLAS
Name, please?
DARIA
Angie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.
Checks off hers.
DOUGLAS
Thank you. You can go on up.
Front
elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
DARIA
... I hate these things.
Don't you
hate these things?
DOUGLAS
I'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.
Studies him a moment.
Liking
what she sees.
DARIA
Then again, you never know who you're
going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.
Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
DARIA
8.
I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.
Just looks at her blankly.
DOUGLAS
Really, ma'am.
I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.
DARIA'S POV
The magazine is Genre.
Males for males.
Buff boys.
Big
pecs, big penises.
BACK TO SCENE
Daria steps back.
DARIA
Well, I suppose I should go up and
see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
DARIA
Tommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --
DARIA
Change of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
TOMMY
No way.
DARIA
Yeah way.
INTERCUT WITH:
Fait and Miles have heard it, too.
Into his mike --
FAIT
Tommy.
Your turn.
9.
A look of alarm on Tommy's face.
Into his mike --
TOMMY
Uh-uh.
FAIT
This isn't a conversation.
Do it.
It's an order.
Tommy knows he has to.
Shit.
TOMMY
Shit.
DARIA
Key-card.
Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
DARIA
Why don't you keep my purse?
I
shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
TOMMY
... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.
DOUGLAS
Hi.
TOMMY
I hope you don't take offense at
this... but I just have such a
weakness for a man in uniform.
DOUGLAS
If that's your thing...
TOMMY
Uniform's definitely my thing. I
mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
mmm, seafood. Y'know?
DOUGLAS
I'm not actually supposed to be
10.
talking on duty.
TOMMY
Who's talking? Honey, this is a
flirting... But you're probably just
another good-looking man wasting it
all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.
Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
TOMMY
Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
pictures of those underfed, white
males and let's broaden your
horizons.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
not too cute for you. And don't tell
me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
come over there and slap a little
discrimination right upside your
yummy little cheeks.
DOUGLAS
I'm hooked up.
TOMMY
Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
Jesus got there first. That bitch.
Taking you. From me.
DOUGLAS
Sorry.
TOMMY
Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
it for your number one is keeping the
world safe, and it's okay by me.
Even if you are just breaking my
heart... Guess I'll just have to come
in here someday, let you catch me
shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
to have you wrestle me down and cuff
me.
DOUGLAS
I can be pretty rough.
TOMMY
Don't you get me all excited now.
I
was just learning to accept my
disappointment.
11.
Tommy sticks out his hand.
TOMMY
Tommy.
But you can call me Rachel.
Shaking hands --
DOUGLAS
Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
get back to what I'm supposed to be
doing, okay?
He looks away.
Scans the monitors.
ANGLE - MONITORS
Everything looks normal.
ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.
TOMMY
I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
if I just stand here and stare at the
muscles I'll be missing for the rest
of my
life?
OFF which...
Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...
TOMMY
who furtively flips her the bird.
Never missing a beat with
Douglas.
12.
Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.
On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.
Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....
CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.
As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.
On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.
Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.
13.
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
FAIT
Out.
Speeding through L.A.
Calling 911 on a cell phone.
SU
... I want to report a crime in
progress.
Fait is the last one down through the hole.
Beat.
He looks
at the others.
FAIT
Faith.
MILES
Faith.
DARIA
Faith.
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.
He pushes
the button. And...
The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.
They felt a rumble.
Tommy covers --
TOMMY
Earthquake.
14.
Douglas checks the monitors.
Everything looks okay.
TOMMY
Bet you know how to hit a ten on the
Richter scale...
The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.
DARIA
Holy shit...
Fait's already swinging open the vault.
FAIT
This will trigger the silent alarm.
Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
Miles moves down the rows of
drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria
follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying
jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.
All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.
And
stops, admiring them.
FAIT
... I love colored stones... Look at
this...
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.
FAIT
Two-point-seven million.
Into the bag.
MILES
Whose shit we stealing, anyway?
FAIT
Drug dealers and money launderers.
DARIA
Works for me.
Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.
FAIT
This I can use.
15.
And pockets it.
DARIA
T.
Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.
FAIT
Pow.
He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.
Beat.
Fait answers.
FAIT
Go.
INTERCUT WITH:
Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.
SU
Your employer betrayed you. The
police are on the way. Leave the
black stones.
FAIT
Who is this?
SU
You know the ones I mean.
FAIT
Don't think I'll do that.
Fait just hangs up.
Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.
TOMMY
Shit.
Five-0 at the do'.
(then, aloud to
Douglas)
Better move my car.
16.
Fait grabs a bag of jewels.
FAIT
Go time.
Leave the rest.
SWAT swarms in.
Tommy exits behind them.
Tommy gets in.
A SWAT COP signals him.
SWAT COP
Move it out.
Fait, Miles, and Daria run.
Slam! Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door.
Fait kneels, feels the track.
FAIT
Stopped the trains.
(then)
We're in the rabbit hole, they're
sending down the snakes.
(then)
Daria comes with me.
(to Miles)
I got no idea where you should go,
but you know where to end up.
Miles nods.
FAIT
Faith.
MILES
Faith.
17.
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.
running like hell. Rounds a curve.
Ahead are the rear
lights of a stopped train.
Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a
station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his
head around the corner of the train.
FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM
SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
COP jumps back down.
SWAT COP #2
All clear.
ANGLE BACK
Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
etc.
Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
closer. Looking up. Just as...
Fait's leg just clears the window.
They don't see it.
But...
As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...
The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.
To the Driver --
SWAT COP #3
Hold it.
18.
A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.
The Cop
checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.
SWAT COP #3
(radios)
Train's clear.
The Cop exits.
The Driver enters his compartment.
ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.
DRIVER
Okay to go?
SWAT COP #4
Just hang tight.
During which, just above them...
Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
looks back at him in disbelief.
FAIT
Nice.
That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.
RADIO (V.O.)
All clear.
SWAT COP #4
(to Driver)
Okay.
Get this train outta here.
Whereupon the train jerks to a start.
running toward the rear of the stopped train.
Leaping onto
the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.
19.
SU
The stones.
MILES
You'll have to come and get 'em.
Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.
Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.
Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.
Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.
20.
Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.
Swarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.
He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a
COP --
SU
21.
Who's in charge?
COP
Who wants to know?
Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.
The Cop scopes it a
moment. He's clearly impressed.
COP
Follow me.
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...
VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on
her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.
FAIT
You know it's past your bedtime.
VANESSA
Just a little longer.
FAIT
(imitating sweetly)
'Just a little longer'... School
tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the
computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she
doesn't dawdle.
FAIT
'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
time.
Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once
around the room and tucks her into bed.
FAIT
You bag some Z's now, you hear?
VANESSA
Okay.
FAIT
... Wait a second.
VANESSA
What?
FAIT
I think there's something behind your
22.
ear.
VANESSA
Oh, please, that is so lame.
It's in
your hand.
She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
More nothing. She's stumped.
Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.
VANESSA
How'd you do that?
Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.
FAIT
Good night.
Then Fait looks up.
Addresses the air above her.
FAIT
Angels east, angels west, north and
south, do your best. Guard her,
watch her, while she rests.
A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
light and shines in the dark.
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.
Fait enters.
Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.
To Tonita
--
FAIT
She'll stay down now.
TONITA
She won't listen to me lately.
Only
you.
FAIT
I'll have a talk with her about it
tomorrow.
Still to the nanny --
FAIT
I got some work to do in the office.
You can go on to bed.
23.
TONITA
I'm watching TV, if you need me.
Fait exits.
Fait enters.
Tommy and Daria are there.
TOMMY
What the hell happened?
Fait puts a finger to his lips.
Leads them across the room
to another door.
They enter.
Fait shuts the door.
TOMMY
Should we be considering a
long vacation in a warm,
foreign climate where there's
no extradition?
Fait's thinking it through.
FAIT
The guy who called was only
interested in the black stones...
DARIA
Christophe sold us out.
FAIT
Or something.
Just then, Miles enters.
DARIA
You made it.
MILES
By the skin of my ass. Some
Chinese dude kicked me around
the motherfuckin' block. Busted
my ear piece.
He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and
tosses it on the table.
MILES
Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to
24.
rethink the no-gun policy.
TOMMY
Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least
you didn't have to play all foxy with
the rent-a-cop.
Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.
FAIT
Means this is all we got.
DARIA
So what do we do?
FAIT
You all wait to hear from me.
TOMMY
Where're you going?
FAIT
To get some answers.
Miles moves to go with him.
MILES
I got your back.
FAIT
No. I got us into this.
I'll call
you if I need you.
Daria moves to him.
Their eyes meet.
DARIA
Be careful.
Fait gives her a kiss.
Then goes.
Christophe's arms are
wrapped around the large fish tank,
one arm over the top,
the other through the legs of the
stand. His hands are
bound. He can't move. His beaten
face is pressed to the
glass. Large, weird fish swim past
in front of him.
The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.
Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with
him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs
stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow
them.
25.
LING
So this is Mr. Christophe?
SONA
Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish
tank are a new look.
LING
Apparently we're not his first
visitors today.
CHRISTOPHE
Please, Monsieur Ling --
Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder.
LING
Whatever you're going to say... Make
it the truth.
Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.
Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
Water. The carpet's soaked.
His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
REVEAL Christophe.
Stuffed inside the tank.
Sleeping with
the fishes.
SU (O.S.)
Looks dead to me.
Behind him.
Fait turns around.
Sees Su.
Sitting on a
sofa.
FAIT
Guess you got to him first.
SU
Not me.
Someone else.
Fait does the math.
FAIT
... You're the one who called me.
The one who took on my guy... Who the
fuck are you, man?
SU
My name is Su.
FAIT
Cool.
I'm Sally.
SU
I want the black stones.
28.
FAIT
Yeah?
Make me an offer.
Su stands.
SU
You can walk out of here.
FAIT
... No deal.
Fait launches
himself at Su. Gonna fight
his way
out the
door. A much
better fighter than Miles.
And...
He's saved
by the bell:
the PHONE RINGS. The fight
stops.
The
phone's near
Fait. Beat. The answering
machine
picks up.
CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
Christophe here. Leave a message.
BEEP.
LING (V.O.)
I know you're there, Mr. Fait.
Beat.
Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.
FAIT
Who's this?
INTERCUT WITH:
Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room
service. Ling's on a cell phone.
LING
The man for
whom Mr. Christophe
arranged to
have the black stones
brought into
the country and
deposited at
the jewelry exchange.
The man who
wants them back. Now.
FAIT
Fine.
How much?
LING
Maybe you didn't understand me.
The
stones are already mine.
FAIT
I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get
your bid in or go fuck yourself.
29.
LING
I don't have time for this.
FAIT
That your final offer?
LING
I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.
Fait.
Fait just hangs up.
FAIT
Everybody think I'm the fucking
Goodwill or something...? Look, I've
had a shitty night, and so far, I got
zip for all my troubles. So I don't
know who the fuck you are, and I
don't care. But hear this: you can
beat my ass around the block all
night --
Brother, it ain't gonna get you those
stones.
A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...
Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
FAIT
Oh, man...
He's about
to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls
in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.
Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits
it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.
30.
Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.
Archie's had the shit beat out of him.
ARCHIE
It's Archie.
Bad news.
We got a
problem.
CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.
Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball
caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and
start to beat something out of him.
ARCHIE (O.S.)
... I did what you said, right? Put
it out on the street, trying to get
info on the stones. Next thing I
know, the Jackson Five here show
up... Now, there are three
significant elements to notice here.
One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're
heavily armed. Three, they're gonna
beat me like a bongo drum...
Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen,
Archie surrenders immediately.
ARCHIE
... I mean, hey, I coulda resisted,
sure -- and they coulda beat me into
a coma or killed me or whatever --
but then, see, I'm thinking: How
would I be able to tell Tony what
happened to the stones? Right? What
good am I dead or on life-support.
So I threw in the towel.
Reluctantly, of course. For your
sake.
FAIT
Okay. You saved yourself to tell me.
So tell me.
ARCHIE
What?
33.
FAIT
Who are they?
ARCHIE
Uh... Don't know.
FAIT
What'd they say?
ARCHIE
Well... 'Give us the stones,
motherfucker.' You know. That kinda
thing.
FAIT
That's it?
ARCHIE
Pretty much.
Yeah.
FAIT
Thanks for keeping yourself alive to
pass on all that valuable
information.
SU
Did you call the police?
ARCHIE
Look around. Are you crazy? Then
again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause I
have no idea who you are.
FAIT
Big question is, who's behind the
boost?
ARCHIE
(re: footage)
I don't know that, but I know they
got great guns. I can't even get
those. U.S. Special Forces only.
FAIT
... Chambers.
ARCHIE
What?
FAIT
He's wired into everything going down
in this city, and he can get that
kind of firepower. Gotta be him.
SU
Who's Chambers?
34.
FAIT
Runs the biggest outfit in town.
What warlords are to Afghanistan,
Chambers is to L.A... And you want to
take him on, you're on your own.
Game over for me.
(beat; then)
And now that I'm truly fucked -- what
the hell are you, anyway? You got
some I.D.?
Beat.
Su takes out his wallet and shows him.
INSERT - I.D.
In Chinese.
Clearly official.
FAIT
Doesn't mean shit to me.
ARCHIE
Let me see that.
Archie takes it, reads.
ARCHIE
Taiwan. Central Security Bureau.
Taiwanese intelligence.
FAIT
You read Chinese?
ARCHIE
No. But I know 'cop' in every
language.
FAIT
What, you some kinda Asian James
Bond?
SU
The stones belong to my government.
FAIT
Yeah, well, they're Chambers' now.
And even governments don't go to war
with him.
UNDER which, Fait's CELL PHONE starts RINGING.
FAIT
I'm starting to hate this phone.
(answers)
What now?
35.
INTERCUT WITH:
Ling's on his cell phone.
LING
I hope you've reconsidered.
FAIT
Hey, it's Mr. Dangerous.
'Sup,
'homie'?
LING
You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.
Let me make it easy.
FAIT
Can't wait to hear.
LING
I have your daughter.
Fait freezes.
LING
She's very pretty in her pink
pajamas. Aren't you, Vanessa?
REVEAL Vanessa, in the limo, held by Charles.
On Ling's
signal, Charles uncovers her mouth.
VANESSA
Daddy!
FAIT
Vanessa!
LING
I want my stones, Mr. Fait.
FAIT
Motherfucker...
LING
You think about it a moment. Let me
talk to the Chinese gentleman who's
with you.
FAIT
Don't you hurt her.
LING
That's up to you... The Chinese
36.
gentleman, please?
Beat.
Fait hands the phone to Su.
FAIT
He has my daughter.
ARCHIE
Oh, Jesus...
FAIT
He wants to talk to you.
Su takes the phone.
In CHINESE with ENGLISH SUBTITLES --
SU
Hello.
LING
I thought I killed you.
SU
I have the stones.
No negotiations.
Let the girl go.
LING
Do you really want one more person to
die?
We see this resonates with Su.
SU
No negotiations.
And then, he simply hangs up.
END INTERCUT.
FAIT
What'd you just do?
What happened?
SU
I said I have the stones and won't
negotiate for your daughter.
FAIT
You what?
ARCHIE
Oh, Jesus...
SU
It will confuse him.
Buy us time and
keep her alive.
FAIT
37.
What the fuck're you talking about?
That asshole has my daughter.
SU
Look -- I know him.
(then)
I want the stones, you want your
daughter. We'll get them both back.
We'll work together.
FAIT
... I gotta work with you?
SU
You have no choice.
Beat.
Fait realizes what this means.
FAIT
... Shit... We gotta go see
Chambers...
(beat, then)
Oh, god... Vanessa...
Large, empty, brightly-lit.
The door opens, and the limo
pulls in.
The limo stops inside the hangar.
To Charles, re:
Vanessa
--
LING
Find a place to put her.
Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out --
VANESSA
My daddy's gonna come and kick your
butts.
Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises
Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's
daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles
takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call.
LING
Su says he has the stones... But why
cut me off? Why not negotiate for
the girl? It doesn't make sense.
SONA
38.
The buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should
we stop them?
LING
We'll never regain their confidence.
(beat)
We need information. Find the right
people. Pay whatever it costs.
Something's not right. Something's
happening with the stones.
SONA
What about the girl?
LING
We'll need her... She stays alive.
For now.
In motion.
Fait and Su.
Fait on the cell to Tommy.
FAIT
I'm on the way to Chambers... Yeah, I
know, but I got no other choice.
Just get the word into his pipeline
that I'm coming and want permission
to visit... I'll get back to you...
Faith...
(hangs up)
Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and
give the stones back.
(then)
Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join
the Peace Corps.
Su looks over.
Beat.
SU
I'm sorry about your daughter... How
old is she?
FAIT
This ain't the Biography Channel.
Let's just get there.
A long beat.
L.A. moving by outside.
FAIT
Eight.
She'll be nine in September.
Beat.
SU
39.
Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...
FAIT
Never happen.
I'll just kill
'em.
SU
I wish it were that easy.
Another beat.
Then --
FAIT
About time I got the 4-1-1.
SU
4-1-1?
FAIT
What's this all about?
SU
The stones aren't what you think they
are.
FAIT
No shit.
(then)
How about the guy who has Vanessa?
SU
He's exactly what you think he is --
a thief and a killer.
FAIT
Great...
A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.
We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.
Not scared. Pissed. As...
Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.
ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR
Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.
CHARLES
Where'd you get that piece of shit?
LING THUG #1
Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
have a long walk back from the
40.
campground.
CHARLES
You're sure you cleaned it out?
LING THUG #1
Everything except the denture cream
and adult diapers.
Vanessa's still screaming.
It's getting on Charles' nerves.
CHARLES
I'm sick of her already.
He marches toward the van.
Unlocks the rear door and slides
it open.
Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
CHARLES
Shut up!
VANESSA
You shut up!
CHARLES
Go to sleep!
Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.
Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.
Locks it.
And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.
CLOSEUP - FAIT
As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
--
FAIT
Angels east, angels west, north and
south, do your best. Guard her,
watch her, while she rests.
41.
OFF which, as Su regards him...
A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.
Hanging
blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...
After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
CHAMBERS
Metz.
The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
CHAMBERS
D.V.D.'s broke.
METZ
Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
Chambers.
Metz goes.
Beat.
Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
CHAMBERS
Thanks for your patience.
Man needs
his nightly rest.
(then)
Who's the gook?
42.
FAIT
... Chinese guy.
CHAMBERS
... No shoes in my crib.
Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
CHAMBERS
In.
The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
FAIT
How you doing, Jump?
CHAMBERS
Don't waste my precious time.
FAIT
... I got a problem.
CHAMBERS
How's Daria?
FAIT
... Good.
CHAMBERS
Always was good. From the moment I
found her till the moment you took
her away from me. Problem, you say?
FAIT
... The black stones.
CHAMBERS
Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
money. But that all stopped. You
stopped that. You decided it was
okay to put an end to that. Black
stones. Go on.
FAIT
I need 'em back.
CHAMBERS
Only smart thing was not pimping her
yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
sore-angry, and you'da both been real
cold-dead...
CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
But you don't pimp, do you? Just a
43.
thief in the night. Stealing what
don't belong to you.
Chambers turns to Su.
In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
CHAMBERS
You like tall white women?
Su doesn't say anything.
Back to English --
CHAMBERS
He can't talk?
SU
I don't speak Korean.
Chambers carves up a sausage.
CHAMBERS
Bought myself this Korean club
downtown. Packing in the Seoul
brothers 24-7-365... Black man
gouging Koreans, ain't that a
switch... Motherfuckers got faces
like walls, but they love to drink
liquor and look at naked girls...
Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
an office looks like a kabuki love
palace. My own little sanctuary --
A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
CHAMBERS
-- just waiting for when I parole
out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the
poon.
FAIT
... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
this. I gotta have the stones, or
she's dead.
No response.
Chambers just keeps eating.
FAIT
If you need something more than that,
here it is...
(this is hard)
I'm begging you, Jump.
Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.
Wipes his
face. Finally --
CHAMBERS
Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
news. I'm watching it wondering why.
44.
What's worth that kind of trouble,
that kind of heat? Gotta be
something good. Gotta be something
expensive.
Beat.
He meets Fait's eyes.
Holds them.
FAIT
She's my little girl.
CHAMBERS
Make another one... Lotta offspring
running around. Big scores're rare
in a lifetime.
Another beat.
That's it.
No deal.
Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.
Su stops him.
CHAMBERS
Slope's no dope.
He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
CHICKENS
Let me cut one of these
motherfuckers.
CHAMBERS
Your choice.
Chickens is happy.
Thrusts the knife at Fait.
When...
Su reaches out and catches the
blade.
Catches it with just
the thumb and forefinger of one
hand.
And holds it like
that. Holds it hard. Chickens
can't push and can't pull.
Doesn't know what to do next.
Finally yanks really hard.
And...
Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
beat. Then, to Fait --
CHAMBERS
Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
your shoes.
RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
looking in the back of the truck.
RUSSELL
Hey!
Get away from there!
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.
RUSSELL
What are you doing?!
CHARLES
Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
I could help with something.
RUSSELL
You can't! It's very delicate
equipment! Stay away! Just stay
away from my truck!
CHARLES
What?
RUSSELL
Stay away from my truck!
CHARLES
What?
RUSSELL
Stay away from my truck!
CHARLES
What?
Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
SONA
Stop it.
Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
screaming inside the camper.
VANESSA (O.S.)
I want my daddy!
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --
47.
CHARLES
I'm backing away... I'm backing
away...
VANESSA (O.S.)
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Charles joins Sona.
Re:
Russell --
CHARLES
Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
SONA
At least he's doing his job. Which
is more than I can say for some
people.
VANESSA (O.S.)
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
SONA
Tape her up and gag her.
As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
Then opens the door. And...
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
waist.
VANESSA
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
I
want my daddy!
CHARLES
Get the hell off me.
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
CHARLES
... Waste of time... I can think of a
better way of shutting you
up --
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.
Charles howls in
pain and lets her go.
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.
48.
Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
the remote. And...
Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."
CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
can...
ANGLE - CAMPER
takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
see where she's going. But she's going.
The camper careens around the large space.
Charles
scrambles after.
Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.
The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.
And...
... CRASHES into a support post.
As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...
49.
A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant
decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra
money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but
the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:
at the
door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.
ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
ODION
Delicious Daria.
DARIA
'Sup, Odion?
ODION
Long time no see.
Then, checking her out --
ODION
Like cognac. Just getting better.
(then)
So what brings you around?
DARIA
... Sometimes you need an old friend,
y'know?
ODION
Got trouble?
DARIA
... With a capital 'T.'
ODION
Tony Fait? Thought you and him were
tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
DARIA
Used to be that way. Not treating me
right these days. The kid's all he
cares about.
ODION
... What do you want me to do?
DARIA
... Man, I don't know. Probably
nothing you can do. I just
50.
thought...
(then)
Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't
know what I was thinking. I
shouldn't even be here like this.
Sorry, Odion.
Daria starts to go.
Odion stops her.
ODION
Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
DARIA
Back in the day... Just always seemed
like you and I had something special
between us.
ODION
Didn't know you thought so.
DARIA
I always cared for you, Odion.
That's why I'm here.
ODION
... You looking for a job?
DARIA
I need something.
ODION
... So maybe you could work here.
DARIA
Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
ODION
You were the best. Not many girls
pulling in two g's a night.
DARIA
Yeah, but it's been a while for
that... Might not remember how.
ODION
Just like a bicycle, baby.
You don't
forget that stuff.
Daria considers it a moment.
DARIA
Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.
Having me back.
ODION
Hey, you let me worry about Jump,
51.
okay?
(then)
Meantime, why don't you come on in,
and you and me can, y'know, talk some
more about it.
Beat.
Daria knows the look in his eyes.
Gets the subtext.
DARIA
... Just talk?
Odion's drinking her in.
ODION
... No.
A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into
Odion's, smiling at him --
Su and Archie.
SU
They have boxing matches in the day?
ARCHIE
Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.
No gloves. No rules. Big money.
Very illegal... Started holding 'em
during the daytime to fool the cops.
SU
The man you remembered -- how do you
know he will be here?
ARCHIE
I don't. But Chambers owns the
operation, so I figure it's a good
place to start.
(then)
This is it.
They turn into...
As they park --
52.
SU
How will you recognize him?
ARCHIE
I didn't see his face.
But I'll know
his pinkie ring when I
see it. Ten
carats. Round cut with
square mount.
Good color and clarity.
I remember
thinking what it would
do to my face
if he hit me.
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
help disguise himself...
Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a
gate to the fight arena beyond.
SU
How do we get in?
ARCHIE
Leave that to me.
Then, to the Guard --
ARCHIE
Hey, man, how you doing? Got a
fighter here I want to enter.
Su shoots him a surprised look.
ARCHIE
My man's gonna put the rest of these
bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there
and get all Chinese on 'em -- the
teeth are gonna fly, the blood's
gonna run... Gonna be fun.
GUARD
Whatever... You're number twelve,
Bruce.
He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make
their way toward the arena --
SU
I didn't come here to fight.
ARCHIE
You won't have to. That was just to
get us in.
53.
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.
Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the
shit out of each other.
Like at
a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of
plastic
over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch
lands,
the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield
themselves from flying blood.
ARCHIE
Good day, over a million dollars'll
pass hands in here.
SU
Find the ring.
ARCHIE
Yeah.
Okay.
He looks around.
Lotta African-American males.
ARCHIE
Could take a little while.
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,
and Su follows...
Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts
to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him
back toward a sofa.
DARIA
Sit down.
Odion sits.
DARIA
Put on some music.
Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.
Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
DARIA
Nah.
Something slower.
Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.
A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
DARIA
That's good... Now just relax... And
watch...
54.
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the
music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.
And Odion's eating it up.
Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.
TOMMY
Here come da bug man.
Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.
Showing skin.
Odion's starting to salivate.
What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A
large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of
the room.
The door opens.
The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
in amazement.
TOMMY
... Look.
At.
This.
DOORMAN
Just do your thing and go,
bro.
TOMMY
Roger that.
He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.
He sets off
one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --
TOMMY
Just keep the door closed and be sure
to give this shit a full hour before
anyone comes in.
OFF the closing door...
57.
Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
and toss them out.
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
bigger.
BLEEE.
He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
FAIT
Safe.
He kneels.
Removes a desk panel.
And...
There it is.
The safe is small but highly secure.
FAIT
Take it down.
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
cal."
Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
sexy for Odion.
Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
Barrett.
MILES
Even with the music, they're gonna
hear it when I fire this tank buster.
FAIT
Daria.
Get ready to move.
(then)
58.
Do it.
Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.
Miles
FIRES. BIG BANG.
Odion starts.
ODION
What was that?
Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.
Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.
Looks back at
Daria. A realization dawning.
ODION
'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
He steps toward Daria.
Backhands her.
Hard.
Then opens
the door.
A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
CHAMBERS MAN
It came from the office.
ODION
Watch her.
Don't let her leave.
Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.
Fait's tossed the safe.
No stones.
MILES
Not here?
FAIT
They're here.
Somewhere else.
MILES
What're you talking about?
59.
FAIT
I'm telling you, they're here.
MILES
What're we gonna do?
FAIT
Everyone out.
Fait's started searching the room.
Tearing it apart.
MILES
What about you?
FAIT
I gotta save Vanessa.
I gotta find
'em.
MILES
I'm not leaving you.
FAIT
Yes, you are.
Go.
Now.
Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.
Fait doesn't stop.
MILES
T. Come on, man. They're outside.
Give it up.
FAIT
Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
That's an order!
Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.
Daria finishes dressing.
When...
CHAMBERS MAN
... Y'know, I got the big one...
Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
DARIA
Keep it in your pants.
CRASH!
Odion and his men break down the door.
60.
Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
then...
The guns are out.
All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.
Daria walks out the front door.
Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
Chambers is addressing.
CHAMBERS
... If you're willing to pay five,
you're willing to pay ten.
CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
You're
willing to pay ten, you're
willing
to pay twenty. Twenty,
forty.
Forty, eighty... I'm not
selling
till I know exactly where the
ceiling
is.
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:
Ling.
CHAMBERS
You like foreplay?
LING
How much money do you want for the
stones?
CHAMBERS
I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
drills -- girl's gotta get in there
and be ready to score points. Bring
it straight to the motherfucking
hoop. You understand?
(beat)
So, instead of us going back and
forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
you to think of a number. A very
high number. A very final number. A
number so high and final it'll get me
off good, bam, right when I hear it.
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.
Still isn't
looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...
61.
Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
big man.
But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
blood and swelling --
CHAMBERS
Okay, okay...
Ling stops.
CHAMBERS
Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
five and call it a game.
Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
nothing --
LING
Mr. Chambers is resting.
He says not
to bother him.
OFF which, as Ling walks away...
FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.
The lobster
fork driven deep into the base of his skull.
Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
pinkie-ring. Su still following.
ARCHIE
... By the way, when we do find him,
what then?
SU
I'll handle it.
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.
62.
The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
RING ANNOUNCER
Seven advances, eleven's out...
Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
versus twelve. Fighters report to
the cage.
As Archie and Su continue the search --
ARCHIE
You're after the stones, too, huh?
No response from Su.
Beat.
ARCHIE
... I did some more checking around
to see what anyone knows about 'em...
Guess who get back to me? My Defense
Department connection. Now, I think
he's calling me about this surplus F-
14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
on. But no. Turns out he's calling
to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
about black stones --
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
midget calls out --
RING ANNOUNCER
Number twelve!
ARCHIE
(to Su)
-- only they're not jewels --
RING ANNOUNCER
Number twelve!
ARCHIE
They're --
Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
FIGHT CLUB FAN
Twelve's right here!
Su pulls his arm back.
FIGHT CLUB FAN
I'd be scared of him, too.
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.
63.
BRUISER
Let's go, chickenshit!
Su waves them off.
SU
Not today...
The catcalls start.
Archie leans into Su.
ARCHIE
I know it
wasn't the plan. But if
you don't
fight, they're gonna toss
us out on
our asses. We might never
find the
guy.
A long beat.
Su hates this place.
Su hates Archie.
Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
Odion, as they pass him --
COP #1
He's pretty beat up.
ODION
Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy
the jail sex, Fait.
As they continue up the stairs --
COP #2
Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
head.
Fait's heard.
FAIT
64.
Not yet.
The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.
PARAMEDIC
What?
FAIT
Nothing.
CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
His cuffed hands.
Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
recess in the belt. Where...
Fait has a hidden handcuff key.
CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
struggling against their duct-tape bonds.
REVEAL...
Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
nearby, but she's not watching.
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
scared.
DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
leaves his corner and advances on Su.
Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until...
Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
carries him headfirst into a metal post.
Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
Su uses the chance to find...
65.
ARCHIE
still checking out the hands of African-American men in
the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.
SU
Number eight's on his feet.
Moving in again.
When...
ARCHIE
Suddenly, he sees it.
The ring.
SU
dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
SU
You win.
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
path.
RING ANNOUNCER
No quitting.
Get back in there.
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.
HOT DOG STAND - DAY
Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two
extreme MOTO-RIDERS
dressed in leathers have pulled up
in a truck and gotten out
to eat. In the back of the truck
is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle
Daria. To her --
MOTO-RIDER #1
Looking good.
She ignores them.
To each other, so she can hear --
MOTO-RIDER #2
Nice rack.
MOTO-RIDER #1
Like the upstairs, like the basement,
66.
too.
DARIA
Shut up, assholes...
Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops
talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the
truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The
Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --
PARAMEDIC
He's all patched up.
A Cop calls inside to Fait.
COP #1
Let's go.
Fait stands.
Starts out.
Into his mike --
FAIT
Get ready to move.
And we see...
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.
Vanessa still taped up.
TV still ON.
When...
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... We go now to this breaking
story...
ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... You're watching a man on an all-
terrain vehicle leading police in a
high-speed chase through downtown Los
Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
the man, Anthony Fait --
Vanessa looks over in surprise.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
-- commandeered the A.T.V. after
escaping from police officers while
being treated at a local hospital for
injuries resulting from his earlier
arrest for robbery... And this is
certainly one of the wildest chases
we've witnessed here in L.A...
The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
versus the five fighters. And the midget.
The different fighters use different fighting styles against
Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
fighting...
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
fighting staff.
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.
Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.
One floor.
Two
floors. Up and up.
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.
Nowhere left to go
except...
Out the window at the end.
And...
That's just where he goes.
69.
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.
DARIA
Here.
FAIT
Above ground parking garage in
Chinatown?
MILES
Know it.
FAIT
Get there.
It's down to Su and the kick boxer.
The kick boxer spins
and kicks and punches, and...
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.
Ties him into a
pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
Looks for Archie.
Can't find him. Can't find the guy
wearing the ring.
And hurries out of the cage.
On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... And it looks like this chase will
end here, as police seal off the
building...
OFF Vanessa, watching...
Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
SU
Where is he?
ARCHIE
Decided to leave early.
SU
Where'd he go?
ARCHIE
Right here.
Su looks inside the car.
ANGLE - CAR
Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
ARCHIE
Good thing I brought my stunner.
He ZAPS the air.
Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
ARCHIE
Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?
On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.
71.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... Here's a car coming down the exit
ramp...
We see the police approach the car.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... The police apparently talking to
the driver...
The police let the car pass.
TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... Now letting this car drive on as
the search inside continues...
Vanessa notices something about the car.
Looks carefully.
When...
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
of the people inside, and...
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
Which could mean only one thing:
her daddy's safe.
And
soon he'll be coming to get her.
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.
The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over
and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the
bed. Then turns around and
picks up the
necklace behind her
back. Holding it as taut as
she can
between her hands,
she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.
MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down
the hall toward Chambers' office.
FAIT
No Chambers' guys.
I don't get it.
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
listen. Hear nothing.
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.
Then Su opens
the door.
Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
Odion and the other Chambers' men.
Dead.
Skull shot.
FAIT
I get it now.
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
FAIT
Are they there?
Su doesn't answer, still searching.
FAIT
No. This can't fucking happen.
They
gotta be there.
Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:
one
black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.
73.
FAIT
... What?
That's it?
SU
The rest are gone.
Fait can't believe it.
FAIT
... What the hell happened?
Who got
'em?
SU
... Ling.
FAIT
How do you know?
SU
I know.
FAIT
... How'd he get here before us?
SU
He's good.
Beat.
Failure.
Summed up in one word:
FAIT
Vanessa...
(then, trying)
He has the stones. There's
no reason
to keep her. Hell, she's a
little
girl, she's eight years old
-- she
can't hurt him. He can let
her go...
He can just fucking let her
go...
Su just looks at him.
Not a chance.
And he knows Fait
knows it, too.
It's over.
For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
FAIT
... What the hell am I gonna do?
SU
... We need to go.
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
exotica, destroying it.
Beat.
Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.
Then --
74.
SU
Come on.
OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go...
Ling pours the black stones out on a table.
To Sona and
Charles --
LING
We're back in business.
CHARLES
Good. I don't have to baby-sit much
longer.
SONA
I hate kids.
LING
Is everything else ready?
SONA
We just have to test the device.
Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption
nearby, speaks up.
RUSSELL
Dye master oscillator. And not test,
calibrate. Which I'm now ready to
do... Goggles.
When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.
And...
Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin
bombarding a sensor. OFF which...
Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace
as a saw to free her
wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly
rips the tape from her
mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries
to figure out what to do
next. Begins searching the camper for
anything that might help
her escape or fight. When...
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An
old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...
The phone turns on.
Sort of.
CLOSEUP - CELL PHONE
75.
"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.
Rock bottom.
Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.
Daria
tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.
Even Archie's quiet for once.
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
to someone who is obviously his superior.
SU
... I lost the stones. Ling has
them... I don't know where he is... I
have no way to find him... What do
you want me to do?
Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.
And...
Fait's too upset to care about answering.
Vanessa's on the old cell phone.
We hear RINGING on the
other end.
VANESSA
... Answer, Daddy, answer...
CLOSEUP - PHONE
"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...
The PHONE'S still RINGING.
After another moment...
MILES
Want me to get that?
Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.
MILES
Hello.
INTERCUT WITH:
76.
Vanessa whispers urgently.
VANESSA
Daddy?
FAIT
Vanessa!
Which gets everyone's attention.
VANESSA
Come get me!
Please!
I want to go
home!
FAIT
Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.
Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his
superior. Still in Chinese --
SU
I'll call you back.
FAIT
(continuing, to
Vanessa)
Where are you?
VANESSA
I don't know. I'm in a van inside a
big building. They painted the
windows. I can't look out.
FAIT
Try.
Try to see something.
Vanessa puts her eye to the window.
Finally finds a small
gap in the paint.
VANESSA'S POV
Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from
Russell's contraption.
CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE
"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...
BACK TO SCENE
77.
VANESSA
I see chairs.
And there's green
light.
Fait repeats for the others' benefit.
FAIT
You see chairs and green light?
Where's the light coming from?
VANESSA
I can't tell.
SU
Is it bright?
FAIT
The green light, baby -- is it
bright?
VANESSA
Yeah.
Really, really bright.
FAIT
(to Su)
It's real bright.
VANESSA
Daddy, hurry!
I'm scared!
FAIT
I know, baby.
Just hang in there
CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE
Fait's voice drops out as the battery dies.
BACK TO SCENE
VANESSA
... Daddy?!
Daddy?!...
END INTERCUT.
FAIT
... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!
Fait slams the phone down in frustration.
But Su's mind is on what she told them.
SU
... He's doing it here.
Tonight.
78.
TOMMY
What?
SU
Selling the stones... A dye laser
emits green light. He needs it to
activate them.
MILES
What the hell you talking about?
DARIA
What are these stones?
Archie answers it.
ARCHIE
Doomsday in disguise.
All eyes go to him.
ARCHIE
They're some kinda new synthetic
plutonium. Small and portable, but
mega-powerful.
TOMMY
This fucker's making bombs?
SU
Not making them.
ARCHIE
Yeah, he'd need a big operation for
that. Why bother? Just demonstrate
the stones work and sell 'em to
whichever international scumbag
offers the highest bid. He makes
millions, they make the bombs,
then... 'look out, world.'
FAIT
... Okay, so we know what he's up to.
How's it get us to Vanessa?
Su considers it a moment.
SU
The buyers will want to arrive and
leave quickly... Somewhere private...
Accessible by aircraft.
FAIT
Vanessa said she's inside a big
building. Could be a hangar.
79.
MILES
Man, there's dozens of little
airports around here. We'd never get
to 'em all.
SU
... Flight plans.
ARCHIE
Hey, yeah. Flight plans show
destinations. All aircraft file 'em
with the Aviation Administration. If
we could get a list, we could maybe
figure out where the sale's going
down.
FAIT
... Daria, call the aviation people.
Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We
need flight plan info for all private
aircraft in this area tonight...
Everyone else get ready to move...
Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.
You break out the heat... Tommy, you
gotta get us a diversion.
ARCHIE
I can help with that.
FAIT
... Do it all fast.
Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.
Russell finishes testing his contraption.
Switches it OFF.
Then, removing his goggles --
RUSSELL
We're operational.
The others remove their goggles.
Sona checks her watch.
SONA
The buyers arrive in less then an
hour.
Beat.
Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.
LING
... So small. So deadly... We're
selling conscience for money...
A look at the others.
Serious.
Then a broad smile of
80.
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.
LING
... But it's a lot of money...
Beat.
He puts down the stone.
A glance at the camper.
LING
Be ready to kill the girl and go as
soon as the sale's over.
CLOSEUP - TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF LOS ANGELES AREA
Fait's finger indicates a spot.
FAIT (O.S.)
Wick Airfield...
PULL BACK TO...
Fait, Su, Daria and Miles.
FAIT
... Five private choppers arriving
tonight within minutes of each other.
DARIA
Sounds like our best shot.
FAIT
.. It better be, or my baby's dead.
He and Su exchange a look.
Then --
FAIT
Let's go.
CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other
high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the
hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard.
Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the
windows.
VANESSA'S POV - HANGAR
81.
An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
arrivals.
In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
to three bodyguards.
Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...
Charles standing nearby.
Too close for her to escape.
Charles turns, and...
BACK TO VANESSA
Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the
window.
There's no way out.
LING
You're the world's foremost arms
dealers. You all know that weaponry
equals power. And in the world of
weaponry, nukes rule.
(MORE)
LING (CONT'D)
But nuclear material is hard to
obtain and difficult to handle... But
what if it weren't?... That's the
question that brought you here
tonight... And here's the answer.
Ling holds up a single stone.
LING
In its present state, it's completely
inert. Zero radiation, zero
volatility...
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
with a mallet.
He unfolds the velvet.
The stone's smashed to pieces.
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
inserts the capsule into his contraption.
RUSSELL
Goggles on.
Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone, which begins to glow.
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
readout on the contraption races up the scale --
RUSSELL
... Firecracker... .44 magnum...
R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...
Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter...
Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas...
And it just keeps going.
Until, finally --
83.
RUSSELL
... New World Order.
As the buyers absorb this...
Russell shuts off the beams.
RUSSELL
Goggles off.
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
holds it up.
LING
One small
fragment. Transformed into
a source
of immense energy. More
powerful
than weapons-grade plutonium
a hundred
times its size.
A beat as this sinks in.
SONA
The purpose of today's sale is to
begin trading a new commodity on the
black market and establish its
value... There are fifty stones
available in the first sale. The
opening price is one million per
stone... Bids, please?
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
analysis for Sona to consult.
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
out the situation.
RUSSIAN BUYER
Five at one million.
Sona is silent.
Silence means "No."
AFRICAN BUYER
Five at one-point-two.
Silence.
PAKISTANI BUYER
Three at two million.
SONA
84.
We'll take that.
FRENCH BUYER
Six at one-five.
Silence.
EGYPTIAN BUYER
Ten at two million.
Silence.
High above the floor, Su steps onto a catwalk.
The sale
continuing below. More heated now.
RUSSIAN BUYER
Eight at three.
Silence.
FRENCH BUYER
Nine at three.
Silence.
EGYPTIAN BUYER
Ten at three-one.
SONA
We'll take that... There are now
thirty-seven stones available.
And now, in more and more rapid-fire succession --
AFRICAN BUYER
Five at three-five.
PAKISTANI BUYER
Eight at three-five.
FRENCH BUYER
Twenty at three.
The sale's now a frenzy.
PAKISTANI BUYER
Five at five million.
RUSSIAN BUYER
Six at five.
FRENCH BUYER
Seven at five.
AFRICAN BUYER
Ten at five.
EGYPTIAN BUYER
Ten at five-one.
FRENCH BUYER
Five-two.
When suddenly...
KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
into the hangar.
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
machine gun on the stunned group.
TOMMY
Freeze, motherfuckers!
87.
Russell watches the advancing tank.
RUSSELL
I knew it!
I knew it!
ANGLE - BEHIND TANK
Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the
Abrams for shelter.
Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's
happening.
VANESSA'S POV
Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.
BACK TO VANESSA
She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet
amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...
SMASH!
She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.
MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.
MILES (V.O.)
Vanessa's out of the camper.
Running
this way.
To Daria --
FAIT
Stay.
And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...
VANESSA
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar
doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to
motor open.
88.
CHARLES
hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.
Turns.
Sees Vanessa and
goes after her.
SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.
MILES (V.O.)
She's out.
Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --
MILES (V.O.)
There's a guy after her.
PHUT!
A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just
behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.
SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Charles rolling out under the door.
MILES
SHOOTS again.
PHUT!
CHARLES
The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In
a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness
of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...
In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes
its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
TOMMY
Just be cool!
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.
89.
TOMMY
I said don't move, motherfucker!
Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
Russell vaults in and takes aim.
RUSSELL
Fucking amateurs!
He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.
TOMMY
Shit!
What do we do?
ARCHIE
Shoot back!
TOMMY
How?
The question's answered for him.
He somehow does the right
thing. And...
Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
gun's more in control of him. But...
Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.
ARCHIE
Twin .50's some major firepower.
How'd that little shit get one?
TOMMY
Motherfucker.
Couldn't fucking
listen.
INTERCUT WITH which...
ACROSS HANGAR
Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees
90.
Ling getting into the limo.
To Archie and
Tommy, as he
signals --
SU
Don't let him get away!
As a result of which...
TOMMY AND ARCHIE
Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.
LIMO
Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...
SU AND SONA
Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limo
DARIA
Get him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...
Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
LING
Go!
Ling hears the THUMPS.
Looks out.
LING'S POV - SU'S LEG
swinging beneath the Agusta.
LING
To the pilot --
LING
Retract the gear!
CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.
And...
SU
The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
SU
Shoot it down!
Now!
And then... Su lets go.
Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.
Archie aims the cannon.
TOMMY
Can you hit it?
ARCHIE
No problem.
Absolutely... Load.
Tommy slides a shell into the breech.
95.
Archie's locked on.
He hits the trigger.
And...
ABRAMS TANK
BOOM!
The big CANNON FIRES.
And...
SKY
The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.
Archie and Tommy exult.
TOMMY
Shot him right in the ass.
ARCHIE
I did it.
I can't believe it.
TOMMY
Thought you said it was no problem.
ARCHIE
What do I know?
The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing.
