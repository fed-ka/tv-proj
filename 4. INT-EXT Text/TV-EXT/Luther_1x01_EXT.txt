A DECAYED, POST-INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE. Wasteland. 


  A MASSIVE POLICE OPERATIONoutside an ORDINARY SUBURBAN HOUSE. 

  A UNIFORMED OFFICER emerges, mud covered. Approaches DETECTIVE 
  SUPERINTENDANT ROSE TELLER - who s looking at a PHOTOGRAPH OF A 
YOUNG GIRL.

                                    TELLER
                  Nothing?

The UNIFORMED OFFICER shakes his head.

Teller exchanges a pained, anxious look with DETECTIVE 
  INSPECTOR IAN REED. Who shrugs.

                                    REED
                  John said she s here, so she s here. 
                  Keep trying.

  UNIFORMED OFFICER nods, exits.

                                    TELLER
                Her oxygen ran out two minutes ago.


Teller glares at her watch. Five minutes past midnight.


Reed s phone rings. ANGLE ON THE PHONE: JOHN LUTHER.

                                    REED
                  John?
                        (listens.Runs)
                  LIVING ROOM! 


  A converted farm. Mist. Early morning crow-calls. An original 
Mini parked outside.


As POLICE UNITSarrive, Alice stands at the front door - still 
holding the phone. Wide eyed, blood-smeared. Terrified almost 
beyond sanity by what she s witnessed.

She s an ISLAND OF BLOODY STILLNESS in the BLUE-FLASHING CHAOS. 

                                                                          FADE UP TO:


Outside waits JUSTINRIPLEY, sheepish in new suit and colourful
tie.

                                    TELLER
                  DCIJohn Luther. DS Justin Ripley.

Luther offers his hand, they shake.

                                    RIPLEY
                  Morning, Sir.

                                    LUTHER
                  Good to meet you.

                                    RIPLEY
                  Actually, you and I, we sort of worked 
                  together once. On the Sidney Jackson 
                  thing.

                                    LUTHER
                  Yeah, yeah! I remember. You did good 
                  work on that thing. 

                                    RIPLEY
                So, um, welcome back. And whatever. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Thank you.

He glances at Teller. Who gives him a nod. Off you go. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Car s this way, Boss. If you re ready.

                                    LUTHER
                I m ready.

They head to Ripley scar. Teller watching


Luther and Ripley get in. Ripley hands him a BUFF ENVELOPE. 
Luther takes it, doesn t open it yet.

                                    LUTHER
                So - do we need to have the chat? 

                                    RIPLEY
                  What chat?

                                    LUTHER
                  I was ill. I got better. I m back. Et 
                  cetera.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 12.


                                    RIPLEY
                  Then no. We don t need the chat.

Luther scrutiniseshim. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  I lobbied to be stationed with you. I 
                put in the request nine months ago. I 
                  chased it up three times a week, in 
                  writing.  

Ah. 

  A moment of mutual embarrassment. Luther hides it by rifling 
through the file.

                                    LUTHER
                So what vewe got?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Home invasion, murder. Victims are 
                  Douglas and Laura Morgan.

                                    LUTHER
                Who called it in?

                                    RIPLEY
                The daughter. Alice Morgan. She was 
                out when it happened.

                                    LUTHER
                  Doing what?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Buying milk and bread.

                                    LUTHER
                She live there?

                                    RIPLEY
                No. She s a Research Fellow, some 
                  Department of Physics. Lives in a flat 
                  near campus.  

                                    LUTHER
                So why was she there? 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Douglas Morgan s birthday.

Luther raises an eyebrow at that. As Ripley pulls away.


  Ripley's car pulls up. Luther gets out, Ripley a step behind. 

SOCO. POLICE CARS, VANS.UNIFORMED OFFICERSguarding the scene.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 13.


HEADS TURN to FOLLOW LUTHER. He ignores them. Just takes a 
private moment, considering the scene. Good to be back.

Then tucks his tie into his shirt, ducks under the yellow tape. 
Holds it up for Ripley. Who follows.


Luther and Ripley duck under the tape, head back to the car. In 
the background, an ambulance arrives.


Luther and Ripley walk to the station. Luther produces his 
phone - nods for Ripley to go in ahead of him. Then paces as he 
dials.

SCENE 30 - 33 INCLUSIVE OMITTED


  Establishing a hyper-modern office building. On a plaque by the 
door: FORD AND VARGAS LAW CHAMBERS. Through the glass we see a 
small figure, ZOE LUTHER, cross the lobby and enter the lift. 
The lift goes up.


Luther drives. Watching the city go by.


Alice in back of a police car. Watching the city go by.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 30.



Luther walks from his car to the door.


Alice walks to her door. 


Luther rings the bell. He s agitated. He waits there for a 
moment. Then Zoe answers the door. Doubly devastating in an 
evening dress.

                                    LUTHER
                  Wow! New dress!
                        (realisingit s not for his 
                          benefit)
                Oh - you had a dinner. Of course. You 
                  look nice! 

                                  ZOE
                  Come in.


Luther crosses to his car. He gets in. Sits. Lost.

SCENE 58 - 59 INCLUSIVE OMITTED


Reed and Luther step out, wincing in the DAYLIGHT. Luther 
  straightens his tie. He s been in these clothes since we met 
him. He looks like he s been awake since Christmas. 

                                    REED
                  Where you going?

                                    LUTHER
                You ever get a song stuck in your 
                  head? It goes round and round? 

                                    REED
                  T Pau.China in Your Hand. Deep 
                  strangeness, that song. High 
                  weirdness.

                                    LUTHER
                So I keep thinking. She s a narcissist 
                She needs constant recognition, needs 
                to exaggerate accomplishments. How 
                  does somebody like that keep secret 
                the best, the most perfect thing she 
                  ever did? 

                                    REED
                You don t need to be thinking about 
                  Alice Morgan right now.

                                    LUTHER
                  Why? What do you suggest I think 
                  about. Henry Madsen? My wife?

                                    REED
                  I dunno.Normal stuff. Breakfast.

                                    LUTHER
                  Thing is, the way Alice sees it, the 
                  world is full of people who ve
                  offended her, embarrassed her, let her 
                  down - and those people deserve to be 
                  punished. She got away with it once. 
                  She s already eyeing her next victim. 
                And she won t stop until somebody 
                  stops her. 

                                    REED
                So be patient. Build a case. 

                                    LUTHER
                  There is no case! She didn t leave 
                  one. She didn t leave anything.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 34.


                                    REED
                  Then what are you thinking?

                                    LUTHER
                  She s compelled to impress - people in 
                  general, but right now me in 
                  particular. She needs to show me how 
                  brilliant she is. She needs to be 
                  admired.

                                    REED
                And  -?

                                    LUTHER
                  I give her what she needs. Then take 
                it away. Make her angry. See how 
                  careless it makes her. 

He walks off.

                                    REED
                  John -

                                    LUTHER
                  What?

                                    REED
                  Slow down. 

Luther just gives him a look. Shrugs. Walks off.


Luther is waiting, lost in grim introspection, as Alice Morgan 
approaches on the walkway.

Alice holds open her bag - an urn inside.

                                    ALICE
                  They burned my dog.

                                    LUTHER
                  It s protocol. It s what happens. 

                                    ALICE
                He was only a dog. It seems unduly 
                  pitiless to me, to burn someone s dog.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 35.


                                    LUTHER
                It seems kind of pitiless to shoot the 
                dog in the first place.

She reads him. Sees his weariness. Reaches out. Touches him. 
Scans him with laser-bright eyes.

                                    ALICE
                You look exhausted. Would you like to 
                  come in?


Luther is deep in thought. More shaken by Alice s words than he 
first appeared. Thinks. Checks his watch. Scowls. Makes a 
  decision. Walks towards the building.


Through the glass we see Luther enter via the main doors. He 
strides past reception. Badges the security guards. Vaults the 
  turnstile and strides to the lift.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 39.



Luther is ejected onto the street - almost into the arms of 
Ripley - who graciously pretends not to notice anything amiss. 
Luther takes a moment to straighten himself. Then they walk.

                                    LUTHER
                  How dyou know I d be here?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Your phone was off. DIReed said:  try 
                the wife.  

                                    LUTHER
                So is it good news? Good news wins a 
                  prize. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  I don t know if it s good news.

                                    LUTHER
                  See, that was a test. News is neither 
                  good nor bad. So -

                                    RIPLEY
                So, the morally neutral news is - 
                  ballistics came back on the bullets 
                  fired at the Morgan house. 

                                    LUTHER
                  And?

                                    RIPLEY
                  They were 9mmParabellum.Designed for 
                  ultra-compact weapons. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Excellent work, Sergeant Ripley! 

They head for Ripley's car. 


Zoe, flustered, walks along the building, pouch and lighter in 
hand.

                                  ZOE
                  Raus, Raus. Mother of God.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 44.


Alice is waiting in a recess, out of view. As Zoe passes, Alice 
steps up behind her. Tucks an elbow round her NECK. Presses a 
HAT-PIN into her ear.

                                    ALICE
                  Don t look at me. 

Her voice is low, almost sexy. Lips very close to Zoe s ear.

                                  ZOE
                  Okay! Okay!

                                    ALICE
                  Shhhhh.

                                  ZOE
                        (low)
                  Okay. Okay.

                                    ALICE
                  Your husband assaulted me.

                                  ZOE
                  What?

                                    ALICE
                He touched me. Intimately. He made me 
                do things. He hurt me. Because of you.

                                  ZOE
                  What do you mean?

                                    ALICE
                As he touched me, he talked about you. 
                He told me you were dead. 

Zoe frozen - as Alice caresses her cheek with a fingernail.

                                    ALICE
                  That you d been very badly burned. 
                  Your skin was gone. Your face was 
                  gone. You d been abducted. Right off 
                the street. By a man, a very sick man. 
                He kept you alive for days. He used 
                  knives. A blowtorch. He kept pieces of 
                you for souvenirs. 
                        (very close)
                I m worried someone might want to hurt 
                you like that. 

                                  ZOE
                  Don t. Please don t. Please.

                                    ALICE
                  Shhhh. Shhhhh. Don t turn around.

And Alice slips away. Leaving Zoe in horror-struck silence.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 45.



Luther is looking down onto Alice s main entrance.

Alice steps out and walks away.

He watches her leave. Approaches the building door, takes a 
WALLET of THIEF S TOOLS from his pocket. 

SCENE 81 OMITTED8181


Alice walks. Turns left.


Alice turns left again - fighting hard to control a smile -


Alice turns left one more time. And she s back where she 
  started. She allows herself to grin and enjoy the moment. Gets 
her keys. Unlocks the door. Steps inside.


Luther exits.


Luther parks outside Mark s place - walks to RIPLEY S CAR. 
Squats there, as Ripley opens the window.

                                    LUTHER
                  Thanks, Justin. But you can go home 
                  now. 

                                    RIPLEY
                        (uncertain)
                You sure?

                                    LUTHER
                  Yeah. I m fine. I m good.

                                    RIPLEY
                        (worried beat)
                  Sure, okay. You sure?

                                    LUTHER
                  Very sure.

                                    RIPLEY
                  Okay.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 54.


With great reluctance, he starts the engine, pulls away. Luther 
looks at the house. Unreadable. Steeling himself.

He walks to the door -


Luther keeps his finger on the doorbell. It rings and rings. 
  Relentless.


The door opens. Mark steps out. 

                                    LUTHER
                Hi. Mark, right?

                                    MARK
                  It s Mark, yeah. You need to leave 
                  John. I called the police.

Luther laughs at that.

                                    MARK
                  This is mad. What do you want?

                                    LUTHER
                  I just, I need to speak to Zoe.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 55.


                                    MARK
                  That s not going to happen. Not today. 
                You need to go.

                                    LUTHER
                  Okay, I can see that. But here s the 
                  thing - I need to speak to her. I 
                  really do.   

                                    MARK
                  Give her some time. Then call her, 
                  okay? But she ll need time, a few 
                  days.

                                    LUTHER
                One minute. I know I ve got no right 
                to ask. But just one minute.

                                    MARK
                No. You need to go. 

                                    LUTHER
                  I can t. 

                                    MARK
                        (shoves him)
                  Leave her alone. Just leave her.

Luther stumbles. Steps forward again.

                                    LUTHER
                  Seriously.

Mark hits him. Luther falls. Then stands, grabs Mark - throws 
him with back-breaking force into a parked car.

Which is when TWO POLICE CARS pull up. FOUR UNIFORMS emerge. 

                                    LUTHER
                Oh, come on.

The FIRST OFFICER takes Luther s elbow. Luther shakes him off. 
The officer grabs him again. Luther shakes him off, more 
  aggressively. 

                                    LUTHER
                  I just need to speak to my wife. All I 
                  want to do is speak to my wife.

Shaking them off becomes resisting - resisting becomes a 
scuffle - then he disengages - backs away - holds up his hands - 

                                    LUTHER
                  Whoah!All right! I m done! I m done!


But they grab him - manhandle him - probably with excessive 
force, to the car.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 1Page 56.


Zoe is at the window, watching.

Luther allows himself to be taken - he s humbled - beaten - 
  compliant - 

SCENE 97 OMITTED9797


Zoe emerges. Tentative, upset. One of the officers is about to 
slam the car door.

                                  ZOE
                  Wait! Please! 

The officer hesitates. Leaves the door open. Luther is disabled 
by the beating and the CSSpray. Hands cuffed in front of him.

                                  ZOE
                Oh, look what they did to you.

He grins through blood and chemical tears. A moment.

                                    LUTHER
                  I just came to tell you something.

                                  ZOE
                To tell me what?

                                    LUTHER
                  That - y know.It s okay. You need to 
                be where you need to be. That s good. 
                  I love you. And I m sorry.

                                  ZOE
                        (emotional)
                  Don t be sorry. Don t be sorry.

The police officer has waited long enough. 

Zoe stands. Steps back. The door is slammed. Police cars pull 
away. As Zoe stands there, watching. 

  Ripleyat the kerb, handkerchief pressed to his bloody nose.


Luther in the back of the car. Calm now. Watching London go 
past. He smiles to himself. Produces his phone. Dials.


Luther on the phone.

                                    LUTHER
                You might be clever, Alice. But you re 
                  wrong. So you lose.

He hangs up before she can speak. Pockets the phone. Sits 
there. 

  Helpless. Vanquished. And triumphant.
