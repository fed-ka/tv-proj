Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
over the snow-patched countryside.
Only the
laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
the century, lingers in the driveway.
Beyond all
this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.
A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
KNOCKS on it impatiently.
AT THE DOOR
2
The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
toward:
36
In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
less wintery day.
The visitors are boarding the
carriage that awaits them in the drive.
DR. HILLYER
Come on, Bridewell.
Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
moves off.
37
The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
way, waves to them.
THE CARRIAGE
38
As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.
From
the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.
In early New Year's Eve
REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.
BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER
39
Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
cottage.
84
Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
passing through its phases and the sun shifting
its position with the seasons.
BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)
85
Leaves grow quickly.
Flowers appear and turn into
small green apples.
Growing larger, they turn red
and fall.
The leaves gradually become amber and
disappear.
Suddenly the bare branches are covered
with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
green leaves and blossoms.
86
Through the window we see the trees grow and
change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
green; they spread, shiver and pass away.
Snow
flashes across the country, vanishes and is
followed by the brief bright green of Spring.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
fifteen...sixteen...and then...
Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

87
His brow is beaded with perspiration.
Alarmed,
he grabs the handle of the Time Machine.
INSERT:
THE DIALS

The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
the lever.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
I stopped.
The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.
The dial
stops on "13 September 1917".
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
89
The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
and glances with astonishment around the interior
of the laboratory.
The once clear windows are now
dirty and boarded up.
The world outside is
completely obscured from view.
Only faint light
penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
doors.
He crosses to the door.
Dust falls as he
opens it and enters the corridor.
93
The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
curiously around.
Everything is overgrown with
vines and flowers.
The house is boarded up.
He
starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.
(NOTE:
The house is situated upon a site with
distinctive landmarks that will stay
recognizable during his journey into
the future, thereby giving a clear
conception that time-travelling does
not involve geographical movement.
For instance, the sharp curve of the
River Thames in the distance will
remain even after the house itself
has disappeared.)
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
94
Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
catches his attention.
He looks puzzled toward:
95
Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.
The
CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
the street.
The sign above the entrance reads:
"Filby's Department Store".
A MANNEQUIN,
dressed for the period, is in the window.
The
driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
the First World War, steps out of the car.
The
Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
sans moustache.
TWO SHOT
96
TIME TRAVELLER (glibly)
Going to a masquerade, David?
You
look rather silly without your
moustache, old man!
FILBY (puzzled)
Were you addressing me, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER
(positively)
Filby!
I expected more of an
enthusiastic greeting from...
FILBY (smiles as he
interrupts)
I'm afraid you have me confused
with my father, sir.
There was a
remarkable resemblance. - I'm
James Filby.
TIME TRAVELLER
Was?
JAMES FILBY
Were you a friend of father's?
TIME TRAVELLER
Yes...yes...I've been away.
JAMES FILBY
He was killed in the war...a year
ago.
TIME TRAVELLER (aghast)
No!...it can't be...
(then, as he realizes its
truth)
I'm sorry to hear that.
(pause, then hesitantly
points)
And the gentleman who used to live
across the street?
JAMES FILBY
Oh, him.
Some inventor who
disappeared around the turn of the
century. - If you're interested in
that house, forget it.
You can't
buy it or even go inside.
TIME TRAVELLER
Why is that?
JAMES FILBY
My father was executor of the
inventor's estate and he refused to
liquidate it.
(adds with a smile)
I often chided him on that account,
but he felt positive that the owner
would return some day. - Some people
hereabouts think it's haunted.
(stares at Time Traveller
curiously, studying the
strange cut of his clothes)
Who are you, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER
Just a stranger who once knew your
father.
JAMES FILBY
I see.
(still curious at the Time
Traveller's abstract attitude)
Have you been at the front, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER
Front?
What front?
JAMES FILBY
Why the war, of course.
TIME TRAVELLER
What war?
JAMES FILBY
Great heavens, man, don't you know
we've been at war with Germany
since nineteen fourteen?
I thought
perhaps you had seen action in
France...or maybe...
(noticing confusion, adds
with a note of compassion)
Perhaps a cup of tea would make
you feel better.
Won't you come in?
TIME TRAVELLER
No...no, thank you.
JAMES FILBY
You're sure you're alright, sir?
TIME TRAVELLER
Yes, I'm quite alright.
JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
Then...goodbye, sir.
The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
Department Store.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
97
He speaks almost to himself.
TIME TRAVELLER
Goodbye, Jaime.
With the bitter taste of death for his old
friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the
street and returns to the cottage.
101
With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across
the pavement.
The bright lights of the night pop
out one after another leaving a sparingly
illuminated street.
The HUMMING SUBSIDES.
The
mannequin previously seen in the show window now
wears the clothing of the "Roaring Twenties".
A
distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN.

just how far women would permit
this to go.
He pushes the lever ahead.

As the years speed by INTERRUPTED BY SHORT BLURS,
the dresses of the mannequin change.
The skirts
get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch
while the hair styles vary.
The bosom appears to
swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as
the neckline rises.
During this:
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
I began to grow fond of that
mannequin.
Maybe because, like me,
she didn't age.

Suddenly he hears the SOUNDS OF AIRPLANES and
EXPLOSIONS in a strangely ACCELERATED manner.
He looks down at the instruments.
INSERT OF DIALS

108
He stares at the dials with much concern as he
is PITCHED back and forth in his Machine.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
Suddenly, in nineteen forty I began
to be buffeted from side to side.
My first thought was that the Machine
had a mechanical defect or a part
had worn out.
The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
PLANES.
He stops the Machine and looks up at:
SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOCK)
109
Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear
but limited glimpse of the night sky that is
swept by beams of searching lights.
ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
cross beams of light.
The sky is pierced with
ack ack.
Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.
Several of the
planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of
streaking flame and fire.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
110
Gazing up at the grim spectacle.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
The last time I had stopped was in
nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
ago.
And the war with Germany was
still waging - now in the air with
flying machines.
It didn't seem
possible they could go on fighting
all these years and still have the
means of fighting.
Then I realized
the truth of the matter.
This was a
new war.
There must have been an
interval of peace in between these
wars.
Yet they had learned nothing
but to prepare even more effective
means of destroying one another.
I
decided to push on into time and see
the outcome.
He looks down at:

Denoting the movement of the Machine through time.
The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the HUMMING
NOISE SUBSIDES and the dials again come to a stop.

The fighting in the sky lasted only
a few moments.
By nineteen forty five
it was over, but I continued on a
few more years before pausing for
another glimpse of my silent, never
aging friend.

His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees.

People are racing along the sidewalk.
The SOUND
OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
comes over.
Drivers leave their cars of the period
in disorder.
The running is purposive, however.
All are entering
particular buildings or, like those closest to the
Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
sidewalk down below street level.
Some glance sky-
ward.
A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
as her FATHER returns from the shelter.
He gathers
her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.
In a few seconds the streets are deserted.
TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT

The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
confused.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
At first I wondered if my Machine and
I were the cause of the panic.
I was
to soon find out we weren't.
He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
MOVING with him.
At the descending subway stair-
way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
below.
Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
attention.
119
A TELEVISION CABINET on display.
The set is
operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra
led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
the two broad glass doors.
As he steps forward he
intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
fly wide open.
He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
them.
Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.

(SPLIT, ANIMATION)
Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
passenger.
The black rock on the surface slowly melts
away and the flickering sunlight returns.
The Machine

object in the whirling transparent landscape.

which no longer changes color even though trees
spring up like plumes of green smoke.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
Thousands of centuries passed, but

There was

As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
DECREASES and the dial freezes on:
"23 November
802,701".
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
The CAMERA
ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
over.
The friction caused by the intrusion creates
a pitiless HAIL, and we
SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
unconscious.
Blood seeps from a gash across his
forehead.
He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.
Then
he looks up.
145
The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
immense Sphinx.
The figure has the face of a
woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
serpent.
A weeping birch tree barely touches its
outspread wings.

He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED

Still half-
dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.
LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)
147
It looks like a garden untended for centuries.
The
trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
exotic fruits.
In the distance there is a building that might once
have been a temple.
Vines mat the ancient walls,
seemingly holding them together.

Every sense he possesses is on the alert.
His eyes

As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
or movement.
The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
as he moves along.
The apprehension mounts into
tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
the state of horror that a human being would
experience in a strange place where he had just
come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
weird vacuum.
162
As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
he hesitates, then moves into the forest.
SERIES OF SHOTS
163-166
The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
to penetrate the maze.
The Time Traveller walks
with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
But all this is imaginary on his part.
There is
nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The SOUND
SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.
He hurries to some
dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.
167
The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
the leaves.
At considerable distance upstream, the
PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
They are small, but delicately formed.
Their grace
and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
world.
The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
from a high waterfall.
Below the pool the stream
emerges in a swift torrent.

Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
He turns.

Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she

they move on with lack of interest, completely.
He
sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
utter indifference.

Seated on the steps leaning against a column.
He

appears from behind the column.
He looks at her and
smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
returns his jacket.
While he slowly slips it on,
she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

Why did you?
TIME TRAVELLER
Why did I what?
THE GIRL
Come after me.
TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
I did it to save your life, young

much meaning for you or anyone else.
THE GIRL (simply)
It doesn't.
TIME TRAVELLER
Must have been fifty of your friends
watching you drown.
Not one of
them so much as lifted a finger. -

Aren't you the least bit interested
in what I am...where I come from?
THE GIRL (innocently)
Should I be?
TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
Perhaps you'd better take me to
someone a bit older I can talk to.
THE GIRL
There is no one older.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
of her words.
All of the little people seem to be
of the Girl's age or younger.
TIME TRAVELLER
Doesn't anyone age in this land
of yours?
The Girl makes no reply.
Instead she gazes off at the
sun which is low in the heavens.
Shadows have already

Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
his free hand.
After he passes one of the bushes,
a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
disappears in the darkness.
Unaware of this, the
Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
where the Machine was last seen.
(NOTE:
The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)
He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.
Then, sud-
denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
the grass.
THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.

The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
exploratory KNOCK.
It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.
The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
claws of the sphinx.
With both hands now free,
he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
to right or left or up or down.
Taking a penknife
from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
edge hunting for a secret latch.
No success.
Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
loosened flagstone.
He picks it up.
With this
heavy weight he batters the panel.
At each blow
it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.
Four times
he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
shatters in his hands.
He stops in despair.

Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
to:
THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)
208
The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
the torch light.
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER
209
He turns and peers toward:
THE BUSHES
210
In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
flame of the torch.
TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT
211-213
He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
paces toward the nearest bush.
But as he ap-
proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
fleeing creatures.
The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
direction.
The same thing happens.
Then he has an idea.
Bending, he beats the torch
against the moist soil and extinguishes it.
Now
in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.
THE PATH
214
Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
approaches slowly.
It emerges onto the lawn.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
215
The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
other figure and bears it to earth.
For a moment
there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
perfectly still.
The Time Traveller rears back to
get a look at it.
THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT
216
It is Weena.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
expression of helpless terror.
She appears to be
waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
not come, she slowly opens her eyes.
She sees the
Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
relief.
The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.
WEENA
I heard you pounding...I came to
tell you...
TIME TRAVELLER
How do you open that panel?
WEENA
No one opens it.
Only the Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER
Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
She drifts
her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
her to face him.
TIME TRAVELLER
Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?
Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
head back so that her eyes meet his.
TIME TRAVELLER
Tell me.
WEENA
When they call, we must go below.
TIME TRAVELLER
Do the Morlocks live beneath the
earth?
(Weena nods)
Why must you obey their command?
WEENA
They give us the food we eat, the
clothes we wear.
We must do as
they command.
TIME TRAVELLER
What happens to your people when
they go below?
WEENA (repressing an in-
voluntary shudder)
No one knows.
No one has ever
returned.
TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
at her warmly, reassuringly)
It won't happen to you.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky
and the old fear returns.
WEENA
It is night.
TIME TRAVELLER
Only children are frightened by
the dark. - But then you are a
child, aren't you?
(Weena glances around
warily into the shadows,
her anxiety mounting)
I'll build a fire.
WEENA (taking his
hand, rises)
Let us go from here.
TIME TRAVELLER (getting
up)
I can't, child.
(walking toward the sphinx)
My Machine is inside there, I
intend to wait here 'til morning,
then find some way of getting
inside.
WEENA (catching up)
No, you must not.
TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
then)
Help me gather some wood.
THE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT
217
Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
she hands over to him.
WEENA
Where are you from?
TIME TRAVELLER (picks
up dry branches)
As a matter of fact, I'm from
right here.
(gesturing)
There's where my house stood many
thousands of years ago.
Here - to
that monument, was my laboratory.
About there was my library where I
once sat talking with friends about
my Time Machine.
Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
bushes in the f.g.
CLOSE ON WEENA
218
She watches every move he makes.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
(continuing)
I hoped to learn a great deal.
I
hoped to take back the knowledge,
the advancement, mankind made...
instead what do I find?
Vegetables!
Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
from behind her.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT
219
With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.
TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
The human race reduced to living
vegetables!
BACK TO WEENA
220
The hairy hands grab her shoulders.
The fear
paralyzes her.
She is unable to scream.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
221
He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
more wood.
Without turning he calls back to Weena.
TIME TRAVELLER
Get me a few more twigs.
When there is no answer he turns and looks.
AT THE BUSHES
222
Weena is gone.
The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
slowly disappearing under the brush.
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT
223
We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
toward the bush.
He helps Weena to her feet and draws
her to the pile of dry branches.
TIME TRAVELLER
(after calming her)
What was it?
WEENA (low)
Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER (strikes
match and holds it to twigs)
This seems to keep them away.
CLOSE ON WEENA
224
She gazes into the fire, with fascination.
Slowly
she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
flame.
TWO SHOT
225
The Time Traveller grabs her hand.
It is almost
too late.
She looks at her burned hand with more
amazement than pain.
TIME TRAVELLER (while
examining her hand)
What ever made you put your hand in
the fire?
WEENA
I never saw it before.
Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
her hand.
He shakes his head in amazement and sits
down beside her.
TIME TRAVELLER
(after a long silence)
Do you know that the first thing
which separated man from the rest
of the mammals was his knowledge of
fire?
(he looks at her)
No, I suppose you don't.
(pokes at fire)
The next great stride came with
the discovery of the wheel.
(turns to her)
Do you know what that is?
(she shakes her head)
I'm sorry I was angry with your
people.
I had no right to be.
No more than if I had visited the
Island of Bali in my own time.
You were safe inside your great
house, yet you came out into the
night to warn me.
The one
characteristic which distinguished
man from the animal kingdom was the
spirit of self sacrifice.
You have
that quality, Girl.
I'm sure all
of your people have it.
All it
requires is someone to reawaken it.
I shall try if you'll let me.
Will
you?
WEENA
I do not understand you, but I
believe you.
TIME TRAVELLER
That's a good start. - Now try to
tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
(Weena looks at him blankly)
Are they people or animals?
(her expression remains unchanged)
What do you know about yourself?
The
past?
Don't your people ever speak
of the past?
WEENA
There is no past.
TIME TRAVELLER
Don't you ever wonder about the future?
WEENA
There is no future.
ANOTHER ANGLE
226
The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
the words.
TIME TRAVELLER
Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
for survival, but there have been
moments when a few voices have spoken
up.
These rare moments have made the
history of man a glorious thing.
I
refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
We've had our dark ages before and
this is only another of them.
All
you need is for someone to show you
the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
mechanic, but there must be this
hidden spark in one of your people.
If I can only kindle that spark, my
coming here will have some meaning.
During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
her cheek touching his knee.
He looks down at her
and sees he has made a friend.
He places his hand
gently on her hair.
She looks up, her eyes no
longer showing fear.
Their faces are illuminated
by the dancing flames.
THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT
227
It CRACKLES reassuringly.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
228
The ring of flames from the previous scene is
seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.
The
CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
where more wells are visible in the distance,
each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.
Their
roofs are shining brass-like disks.
Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
My efforts next morning to open the
panel were fruitless.
I had to find
another way to retrieve my Machine.
Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:
THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE
229
It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
seen handholds in an irregular pattern.
The
THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.
AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT
230
The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.
TIME TRAVELLER
Listen!
(pause)
Do you hear?
WEENA (fearfully)
Yes.
TIME TRAVELLER
Machines!
WEENA
No...Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER
(straightening, amazed)
You mean those animals run machines?
WEENA
They are Morlocks.
TIME TRAVELLER
(as he walks to her)
I know, but have you seen the
machines?
CLOSE ON WEENA
231
She shakes her head.
WEENA
No, only heard of them.
The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
as he reaches her.
TIME TRAVELLER
Who told you?
WEENA
The talking rings.
TIME TRAVELLER
(moves closer to her)
What sort of rings?
WEENA
(with a shrug)
Rings that talk.
TIME TRAVELLER
Can you show me these rings?
Weena nods and starts off.
He follows her.
DISSOLVE TO:
241
The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
to grasp his arm.
WEENA
No...don't go...please.
He shakes her off.
AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT
242
The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
sight by the current from the shaft.
Then he looks
around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
listens.
After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
to descend.
Weena rushes to his side to stop him.
WEENA
You will not come back.
TIME TRAVELLER
I'll be back.
Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
pocket.
The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
appears.
FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE
243
Locking from below, the top of the well appears
like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
The Time Traveller gropes his way.
Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.
Weena straightens.
CLOSE ON WEENA
244
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
PITCH.
The Two make a grating dissonance.
Slowly
she turns in the direction of the sound.
BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER
245
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
BACK TO WEENA
246
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
Weena's fear is gone.
In its place is an expres-
sion of utter resignation.
Like someone in a
trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
ahead.
Then, as though she is summoning all her
strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
walking away.
The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.
(NOTE:
During the above and throughout the follow-
ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)
REVERSE SHOT
247
Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
in the b.g.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
248
Looking for Weena.
She is nowhere to be seen.
His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.
TIME TRAVELLER
Weena!
Where are you, Girl?
WEENA - FULL SHOT
249
She continues to walk toward the source of the
SIRENS.
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT
250
The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
as he pauses to watch:
251
Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
a woman.
They are several paces apart and pay no
attention to one another.
Both have exactly the
same manner as Weena.
They walk along, eyes
straight ahead, faces expressionless.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
252
As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.
VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)
253-254
In the open country now, the forest behind them.
In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
across the green landscape.
All are converging toward a single point somewhere
ahead.
WEENA AMONG ELOI
255
They walk close together, paying no attention to one
another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.
BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER
256
His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
to grasp the meaning of what he observes.
257
(MINIATURE)
It is the source of the sound.
There are little
bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
organ behind the Sphinx.
TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI
258
All of them walk in the same direction.
The Time
Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
ahead, eyes forward.
The Time Traveller breaks into a run.
TWO SHOT
259
The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
his arm and jerks him to a halt.
Around them pass
the shadows of the marching Eloi.
TIME TRAVELLER
What's happening?
Tell me!
The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
free himself.
His movements are almost mechanical.
This unnerves the Time Traveller.
He stares at
him, releasing his grip.
The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
and continues his march.
The Time Traveller re-
mains motionless, watching him go.
The ECHOING
SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.
260
(DAY)
The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
a trance-like state.
261
From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
are moving, singly and in long files.
The impres-
sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
is marching to some unknown doom.
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT
262
He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
But it is not Weena.
Disappointed, he releases
her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
reason.
SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)
263-265
At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.
The
WAILING is DEAFENING.
CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER
266
He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.
267
It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
been marching.
But now the panel, upon which the
Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.
And despite their previous repugnance to the
Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
the lawn resolutely to it.
AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT
268
The Young Man is the first to reach it.
He enters
the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
terranean darkness.
Others follow, Weena among
them.
TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
Weena!
Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT
269
He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
past others in his haste to overtake Weena.
The
crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.
TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
despair)
Weena!
THE PANEL
270
Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
DIES AWAY.
The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
it shuts tight before he can touch it.
He spreads
his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.
What
he sees astonishes him.
GROUP OF ELOI
271
They no longer approach the sphinx.
The ceasing of
the sirens seems to have released them from their
hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
they are retreating.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
272
As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
and calls out angrily.
TIME TRAVELLER
Stop!
BACK TO ELOI
273
Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.
They halt
and stare back.
The Time Traveller's voice comes
over like a whip.
TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
What are you running from?
None of the Eloi answer.
TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT
274
Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
the shadow of the white sphinx.
He steps slowly
forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
semi-circle of his audience.
TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
gesturing back toward the panel)
Where have they gone?
(no answer)
What happens to them?
(no answer)
Don't stand there like a fatted
cattle grazing contentedly in lush
pastures. - Answer me!
What's
wrong?
MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
There is nothing wrong.
It is all
clear.
TIME TRAVELLER
What do you mean, all clear?
MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
All clear!
TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
rapidly, talking to himself)
Once....in the middle nineteen
hundreds I heard a man...
(it bursts upon him)
The falling bombs!
(to the Man in white
and the crowd)
That's over.
Gone.
Dead for
hundreds of thousand of years.
There are no more flying machines.
No bombs.
No wars!
MAN IN WHITE
Yes, the rings have told us that
story.
TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT
275
TIME TRAVELLER
But you didn't listen.
You didn't
learn anything.
All that is left
is fear...a blind animal fear.
Ages ago men were taught to hide in
the ground when the sirens blew...
taught to run from a raining death...
but those men are dead!
And so are
the men who slaughtered them.
Don't
you understand?
(looks around pleadingly)
You are slaves of a dead past... You
don't even own your souls.
You're
led to slaughter like sheep!
MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
But there is nothing to fear now,
it's all clear.
TIME TRAVELLER
What about those who went below?
How are they to come back?
MAN IN WHITE
276
He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.
MAN IN WHITE
They never come back.
Nobody can
bring them back.
Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
in White following them.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
277
Calling after them.
TIME TRAVELLER
You can try.
Won't any of you
even try?
He sees that the situation is hopeless.
TIME TRAVELLER (almost
to himself)
Well, someone has to try!
He runs off.
SERIES OF SHOTS
278
The Time Traveller running through the forest.
(a)
He is laboring up the open hillside.
(b)
The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.
A few
(c)
of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.
279
Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
to descend.
Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
heard.
SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE
280
The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
with his hands and feet.
The depth beneath him is
dizzying.
THROBBING LOUDER.
IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT
281
As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
him, step after step.
The deeper he goes, the darker
it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
well.
Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.
He barely
saves himself.
Not without fear he pauses to rest,
glancing upward.
FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE
282
A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
the Time Traveller's progress.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER
283
A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
to the opening of a transverse passageway.
In almost
complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
belt, but decides not to light it.
He bends and peers
ahead.
357
As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
of approval.
The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
ing wood down in to the well.
SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE
358
The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.
BACK TO SCENE
359
The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
the other wells.
The Young Man first, then the rest of
the Eloi grasp the idea.
They also light branches
from the torch and dash for the various wells to
duplicate the Time Traveller's action.
VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI
360-362
Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
wells and dumping the fire below.
TWO SHOT
363
With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
with approval at the Eloi's work.
364
It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
surface of the Earth.
A WELL - (MINIATURE)
365
It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
forest nearby.
366
(SUNSET)
Smoke drifts out of its windows.
The Eloi hurry
out, led by the Man in White.
They stop and stare
at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
below.
367-368
The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
the smoke.
Several trees fall over, blazing.
LOW
UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.
WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER
369
They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
safety together.
Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.
370
Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
than the one before.
The earth shudders and the
blazing forest begins to collapse.
It does
not explode into the air.
Rather, the solid
earth seems to give way so that the entire
surface of the ground begins to fall into the
subterranean chambers.
ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)
371
A section of the earth sheers away and falls
in an ever widening rift.
A WELL - (MINIATURE)
372
As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
belch of steam.
BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)
373
Leveled off by the earthquake.
There are no more
flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
obelisks.
There is no movement -- only the
flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
the gentle breeze.
GROUP OF ELOI
374
Staring into the vast destruction.
TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA
375
He holds her hand.
The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
we begin to hear the
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
(calmly)
The underworld of the Morlocks was
gone...and so was the life of leisure
for the Eloi.
He looks o.s.
GROUP OF ELOI
376
The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
headed by the Young Man.
The two men look at each
other, their gestures and expressions showing their
joy at release from centuries of fear.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
From now on they would have to work
to survive.
And looking at their
faces, I somehow knew that they could
start over again.
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA
377
He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
Another night was coming, but this
night no Eloi needed to fear.
The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
up in concern.
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
But what of me? - I was imprisoned
in a world in which I did not belong.
DISSOLVE TO:
378
This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
saved Weena's life.
The peaceful SOUND of the
RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.
There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".
Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
She glances over to the Time Traveller.
WEENA
Are you sorry?
He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
He turns.
TIME TRAVELLER
Sorry? - Sorry for what?
WEENA
That you have to stay.
TIME TRAVELLER
(gazing into the night)
Yes. - I am sorry because I could
tell so much to the people of my
own time... I could tell them about
the happiness and sorrow the future
has in store for them.
They could
learn from it...or would they?
WEENA
You don't want to stay, do you?
TIME TRAVELLER
It isn't that, but I don't fit here
anymore than you would in my time.
WEENA
(a pause, and then)
I would like to see your time.
TIME TRAVELLER
No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
happy there.
WEENA
Do you have someone like me -
there?
TIME TRAVELLER
No.
No one like you.
But there
are friends who will miss me. - As
a matter of fact, I'm probably late
already.
WEENA
(stealing a glance,
then quietly)
Women?
TIME TRAVELLER
No, men.
(teasing)
There is a woman too, of course!
(noticing her disappointment,
he relents)
She looks after my house for me.
She is sixty-two years old. - Much
older than you are.
Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
into a new arrangement.
WEENA
(suddenly)
How do they wear their hair?
TIME TRAVELLER
Who?
WEENA
The women in your time.
TIME TRAVELLER
(after a thought)
Up!
WEENA
Up? - How?
TIME TRAVELLER
(with awkward gesture)
Like this.
WEENA
Show me.
The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.
WEENA - MED. SHOT
379
The Time Traveller appears behind her.
He first
hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.
She
smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
toward him.
WEENA
(innocently)
Would I be pretty?
The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
his cheek.
TIME TRAVELLER
(slowly)
Yes...you would be.
More than
pretty.
(his voice sinks to a whisper)
I wish we could go back together,
Weena, back to my own time...or to
times before that when the world
was young.
We could...
EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.
They
both look in the direction of the voices.
380
A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
revealed by the rolling smoke.
The face is
broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.
The
panel is open.
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA
381
Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
breaks into a run.
GROUP OF ELOI
382
The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.
The
Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
then the Eloi follow them.
383
(MATTE)
The face is broken in half.
It is left with only
a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
remaining eye.
The rest of the statue and the
sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
of the pedestal.
Beyond it the hill is gone and
gray haze covers the once green world.
The Time
Traveller and Weena come through the charred
bushes onto the lawn.
Here they stop.
THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.
384
The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
smoke.
The flames, licking at the inside walls,
have not yet reached the Machine.
TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT
385
He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
will not function.
TIME TRAVELLER (without
looking at her)
Come, Girl!
He walk, toward the panel.
Weena follow,
hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
halt before the threshold.
Unmindful of this,
the Time Traveller enters.
419
No light shines through its windows.
BACK TO FILBY
420
He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
door.
It is unlocked.
He steps into the house.
432
Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
path and starts walking the long way home.
SLOW FADE OUT.
