      INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY

      OPEN on TIGHT, STYLISTIC SHOTS of a MAN and a WOMAN having 
        half-clothed, passionate sex under the intense and 
        titillating pressure of having to be quiet.   Cuts of LIPS on 
      LIPS, on the NAPE of a neck, her shoving his tie in his mouth 
      to keep his voice the hell down...  Interrupted by:

                                    KATIE (PRE-LAP)
                    So what woke you up in the middle 
                    of the night?


      INT. ND LOCATION - DAY

        A handsome, confident man, JOHN GREY (50's) smiles and talks 
      with a pretty 38 year-old woman, KATIE.  We can't tell where 
      they are, but no one and nothing can distract them from one 
      another.

                                    JOHN
                    An ant had crawled into my ear.

                                    KATIE
                    Ew.  Wrath of Khan.  

                                    JOHN
                    Loud, too, like a battalion of tiny 
                    feet crunching their way toward my 
                      brain.

                                    KATIE
                    Well, you know what Ann Lamottsays-
                    -  My mind is a neighborhood I try 
                    not to go into alone.   

                                    JOHN
                    I was not alone.  
                          (smiles with awe)
                    You referenced Wrath of Khan.

                                    KATIE
                    And you avoided talking about 
                      anything real for 45 minutes.  How 
                    are you this week?  

      PULL BACK to reveal we are in a THERAPIST'S OFFICE.  We wait.  

                                    JOHN
                      Well... this week and every week 
                    from now on... I m sick, Katie.

                                    KATIE
                    What?    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/122.

                                    JOHN
                    The anxiety attacks, the shortness 
                    of breath; I got it checked out.  
                    An x-ray showed a huge mass on my 
                    lung. One of the many things 
                      pressing on my heart right now.

                                    KATIE
                    Oh, John... I m sorry.

                                    JOHN
                    Makes my marital problems seem 
                      trivial.  Makes me appreciate 
                      Maggie and all of the history we 
                    have.

                                    KATIE
                    Yes.

                                    JOHN
                    And it makes me know what I've 
                      suspected for years now.  That you 
                    are, unequivocally, the love of my 
                    life.

      Katie is stunned he's said the words. 

                                    KATIE
                    What have they said about 
                      treatment?  

      His silence tells the hopeless story.  Her eyes well. 

                                    JOHN
                      I don't want to die, Katie.  But 
                    more than that, I don't want to die 
                    never having kissed you.  Or held 
                    you.  Or touched you.

      INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY

      The sexual escapade from the first scene-- the end of 
      breathless ravaging.  TIME CUT to them lying there, 
      satisfied.  JOSSLYN (28) and MAC (40 s).   He means it:

                                  MAC
                      I love you.

                            (tenderly)
                    It ll pass.

      She pecks him on the lips and pulls down her skirt.

                      I just can t leave her right now,

                    Oh, don t you dare leave her.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    And don t get careless either; it d 
                    be a disaster if she left you.   

                                  MAC
                      I have never met anyone like you.

                                    JOSSLYN
                          (on her way out)
                    Oh, I want to start showing the 
                      Goshen house next week.

                                  MAC

      He nods, it s hers.  As she winks and heads out...

      INT.  HIGH END LINEN SHOP - ROBERTSON BLVD- DAY

      APRIL, 38, charming and girlish, tries to focus on her one 
      customer, a handsome but smarmy Iranian MAN; but she keeps 
      hearing Awwyeahcoming from somewhere.

                                    APRIL
                    What did you say?

                    Is this the sexy section?

                                    APRIL
                    Uhh, this is the satin section.  
                    What is sexy to one person is a 
                      slippery elbow-in-the-eye kinda
                      surface to someone else...
                            (nervous laugh)

                                    APRIL
                      I don't recommend black satin in 
                    that you're aiming for romance and 
                    you end up with... just an episode

      April looks down, takes her iPHONEout of her pocket - to see 
      that - yes -- Awwyeahis indeed coming from the phone in her 
      pants.  She looks at the SCREEN.  

                                    APRIL
                    What is this?   Willing men in the 
                      vicinity?

      INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON another WEDDING BAND on a manicured hand.  A classy, 
      beautiful woman, SAVANNAH (Savi, 38) drinks alone at the bar.   

      She fingers her RING, not seeming at all deterred by it, 
      crosses her legs seductively, the smoothness of one against 
      the other getting her in the mood.  

      A few BUSINESSMEN at a nearby table look at her. She feels 
      their stares and likes it.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Care to join us?

                    I m good, thanks.

      A SEXY MAN in a suit walks in.  Looks around.  Sidles up to 
      the bar.  Looks directly at Savi.  She looks away, coy.  But 
      he keeps staring.  She meets his eyes, grins at his boldness. 

                                    SAVI (CONT D)
                      Meeting someone?

                    Well, I thought I was, and then I 
                    saw you, and I suddenly feel like 
                      changing my plans.

      She smiles, considers him.

                                    SAVI
                    Nice suit.  No tie, huh?

                      Where s your wedding ring?

                    Put it back on.

      He raises a brow-- interesting, and complies.  The men at the 
      table watch, impressed with how well he s doing.       MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/126.

      She swivels her barstoolto face him; close enough so only 
      they can see what happens between their bodies.

                    Nice to meet you, Harry Dillon.

      She shakes his hand and guides it to her thigh, opens her 
      knees, moves his hand up her toned leg, over the lace band of 
      her sexy black stocking.

                                    HARRY
                    Here?

      She nods, slides his hand under her dress and it's clear from 
      the inhale she takes and the look on his face that she's not 
      wearing panties.

                    Let s go to my room.

                      supporting him all those years.

      Savi sneaks in, grabs her purse, trying not to wake Harry.  
      She stares at her sleeping husband.

      DOMINIC MONTGOMERY, 30 s, handsome and driven, his piercing

      each other, have chemistry, respect each other's intellects.

      INT. CHURCH - DAY

      Somber people fill the pews, say sober hellos, shake hands, 
      hug.  April enters with her 13 year-old daughter, LAUREN.

                      Sweet, an open casket.

                                    APRIL
                      Lauren, these people have lost 
                      someone.

                      I lost someone and I never got to

      April strokes Lauren s hair.

                                    APRIL
                    Is this funeral obsession a forever

      April leads her to a pew, sees Katie through the crowd.

      The end of the previous therapy session.

      sits down, she can t help but wonder just what Sam meant.

      Savi and Dominic slink in.  They find a bunch of LAWYERS

                    All those doctors around?  And no 
                    one saw it coming?  What was his 
                      emotional state like?  Did you feel 
                    he was giving up?

                                    KATIE
                    Sam, you know I can t reveal 
                      anything he--

                                  SAM
                    Yes, I know.  Your relationship was 
                      sacred.  More than I can say for 
                    his and mine, I guess.

                    Your father loved you very much.

                      Katie!! Katie!!

      Sam and Katie look to see Savi, April and Lauren approaching 
      from across the street.  Sam leaves her.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1214.

                                  SAM
                    Can we talk more at the wake?  
                    There are things I want to 
                      discuss... that I can t talk about 
                    with my mother.

      Before Katie can ask what he means, Savi and April are there.  
      Katie turns to them, spinning:  

                                    KATIE
                    Savi?  April?  Oh my God!  Hi!

      INT.  KATIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 

      LAUGHTER.  Glasses of wine and COLLEGE PHOTOS of Savi, Katie, 
      and April (some of Harry) are strewn on the table.  They 
      study a picture.

                                    APRIL
                    Look at us, we re so happy.

                                    SAVI
                    Of course we re happy-- we re young 
                    and gorgeous and high out of our 
                      minds.

                                    APRIL
                      I wasn t.

                                    KATIE/SAVI
                    Yes you were.

                                    APRIL
                          (to Katie)
                    Ohhh, that was that DilloDay where 
                    you said:  Here take this little 
                    tab-- it ll only last an hour.   
                      Thirteen hours later I m scared of 
                    my own limbs.

      Katie and Savi laugh.  April shakes her head at Katie:

                                    APRIL (CONT D)
                    You were such a pusher.

                                    SAVI
                    Still is.  

                                    KATIE
                    Guess you can say that.

                                    SAVI
                      Though you do much more counselling 
                    than most prescribing 
                        psychiatrists.  From what you said 
                    about John it seems like you were 
                    his weekly therapist.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1215.

                                    KATIE
                    You connect with some patients, and 
                    they want to pay the fee...

      Uneasy, Katie gets up and goes to the kitchen for more wine.  
      April and Savi exchange a look-- did she say something wrong?

                                    APRIL
                    So you have this whole place to 
                      yourself now, Katie?

                                    KATIE
                            (calling from inside)
                      Evan s 14 and wants Dad, so he s 
                      staying with Vince for a while. I 
                      caught Vince sleeping with one of 
                    his students five years ago...?

                                    APRIL/SAVI
                    Yeah.  We heard.

      Katie returns with a bottle. 

                                    KATIE
                      Anyway, we split, he married the co-
                    ed, and I m strangely at peace with 
                    it.  
                          (off Savi and April)
                    Go ahead, say it.

                                    SAVI
                      Because he was a dick?

      The three girls laugh.

                                    KATIE
                      Because I always knew he wasn t the 
                    love of my life. 

      Silence.

                                    APRIL
                    You are beautiful and accomplished; 
                    you will meet him soon, Katie.

      Katie smiles, covering her painful secret. 

                                    KATIE
                    We should all find our Harry, 
                      right?

      Savi forces a smile.

                                    SAVI
                      April, what about you?

                                    APRIL
                    Oh, I haven t been on a date since 
                    Paul died.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1216.

                                    SAVI
                    Not one in three years?

                                    APRIL
                      I feel like I m cheating on him.  
                    He was the best man I ve known.  

      Katie and Savi exchange a look.

                                    APRIL (CONT D)
                    Don t look at each other like I 
                    have him stuffed and sitting in a 
                    wing chair in my living room...

                                    SAVI
                    Don t you think Paul would want you 
                    to move on?

      April looks down, unsure if she can trust them...

                                    KATIE
                      April?  What is it?

                                    APRIL
                    So after years of legal headaches 
                    the insurance check finally arrives 
                    two weeks ago--  a milestone, 
                      right?  Feels real. Feels final.   
                    So I do all these symbolic things-- 
                    like take his name off our bank 
                      account and change his dirty 
                      pillowcase-

                                    KATIE
                      You ve been sleeping with his dirty 
                      pillowcase?

                                    APRIL
                    And then the phone calls started.

                                    KATIE
                    What phone calls?

                                    APRIL
                    Every so often, I get these calls, 
                      I pick up and... just silence.  In 
                    my heart I know it s Paul.  

                                    SAVI
                    Alive Paul?

                                    APRIL
                    Dead Paul.  Sending me messages not 
                    to move on. 

      KATIE S PHONE RINGS.  They all jump.  Then laugh.  Katie 
      looks at it, the caller ID reads-- JOHN GRAY HOME.  She goes 
      ashen, presses IGNORE.  Savi focuses on April...    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1217.

                                    SAVI
                    There was something that John said 
                    to a client a few weeks before he 
                    died.  We were handling her divorce-
                      - gruesome, cynical stuff.  She s 
                      lonely and hopeless and he puts his 
                    hand on hers and says:  There is 
                      nothing like the feeling of your 
                    first love. Especially when it 
                      happens the second time around. 

      All three women have tears in their eyes.  Each for their own 
      reasons.  Then April sees a clock...

                                    APRIL
                    Oh shoot! It s so late.  I have to 
                    pick up the girls from soccer.

                                    KATIE
                    And I m pretty tired.

                                    SAVI
                    ... onelast toast to John?  

                                    KATIE/SAVI/APRIL
                    To John.

                                    APRIL
                    And to bringing us back together. 
                    Can we see each other again soon?  
                    Find out what s really going on in 
                    each other s lives...?  

      Beat.  Reluctance, then.

                    Yes, sure./ Definitely.


      INT. SAVI AND HARRY S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Savi s in bed, waiting for Harry in a pretty nightie.  He s 
      too tired to notice, gets undressed.

                                    SAVI
                      Really late tonight, huh?

                      You re just so... excited.

                                    HARRY
                    Well yeah, of course. They were my 
                      friends, too.

                                    SAVI
                    I was thinking of inviting them to 
                    the restaurant this Friday night.

                    Great idea. I ll make something 
                      special. Is Katie still a

                                    SAVI
                    It didn t come up.

                    If you want to ask me how she

                      I don t care how she looks.  

      A beat-- history here.  He kisses her head and laughs.

                    Come on, Sav.

      Then heads into the bathroom.   She calls after him:

                    Well, she looks frickingorgeous.

      EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY

      Katie sits with John in the empty bleachers, in their casual 
      clothes, looking over the field.  They rock into each other 
      like teenagers, smiling.

                                    KATIE
                    Thank you for bringing me here, for 
                      sharing this memory with me.  

                                    JOHN
                      I just want to be as close to you

                      I know, I ll stop asking.  

      He strokes her face, is beyond that now.  

                                    JOHN (CONT D)
                    Do you love me, Katie?

                                    KATIE
                    Yes, I do.

                                    JOHN
                    Then when it's time, will you help 
                    me die?

      She looks at him.  Does he mean what she thinks he means? 
      BUZZZZ-we are startled out of this reverie BACK TO 

      Katie's bathroom.  She opens her eyes at the sound of her 
      front door BUZZING.  She pads downstairs.  She looks at the 
      security monitor and sees a face&. Can it be&.?  It is.  It's 
      Sam Grey.  

      Off Katie, letting it BUZZ, pretending not to be home.

      EXT. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY

      Katie s LONG PRETTY LEGS get out of her car.  She takes a 
      breath and faces the day.

      INT. KATIE S OUTER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

      Katie passes her ASSISTANT s desk.

                                    ASSISTANT

                    She leave a message?

                     Go Wildcats ...?

      Katie smiles, of course she did.

                                    ASSISTANT (CONT D)
                      And... your updated schedule.  Two 
                    new patients today.

                                    KATIE
                      Thanks, Nancy.  

      Katie scans the page.  Sees SAM GREY s name. Stops cold.

                                    KATIE (CONT D)
                    When did Sam Grey make his 
                      appointment?

                                    NANCY
                      I walked in this morning to a 
                      couple of desperate messages from 
                    him. You had an end-of-day 
                      cancellation.

      Katie heads to her office, panicked...

                                    NANCY (CONT D)
                    Did I do something wrong?

      INT. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY

      Katie closes the door, nearly hyperventilating. FLASHBACK TO:

      INT. JOHN GREY S HOUSE - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON a PRESCRIPTION for MORPHINE.  Katie signs her name 
      and hands the page to Maggie and John.  He takes it-- Maggie 
      can hardly look at the thing.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1221.

                                    JOHN
                      Maggie and I have discussed this at 
                      length.  She can t do it.  And I 
                      probably won t be able to do it for 
                      myself at that point.  We d like it 
                    to be you.

      Katie looks at them both, then nods. BACK TO PRESENT.

      Katie sits down, her FAST BREATHING taking us to...

      INT. BEACH FRONT CONDO - DAY

      SOUNDS of HEAVY BREATHING and MOANING...  OVER glossy OCEAN

      CARDS with JOSSLYN S VANITY PHOTO.

      WE TRAVEL through the gorgeous, pristine LONELY condo, 
      through a hall, and into a BATHROOM, where Josslyn and Mac 
      slump in each other s entangled limbs, on the sink, finished.

                    Do you know how long it took me to 
                    stage those throw pillows?  You

      She beams, and kisses him.  Her phone rings.

                    Don t get it.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    Let me see who it is.

      She answers her phone and slinks away.  

                                    JOSSLYN (CONT D)
                    Hi.  Yeah, sure.  I ll be free

      INT. HIGH END LINEN STORE - DAY

      April folds shams in her quiet store.  The door JINGLES OPEN, 
      April gasps.  An adorable mid-30'sman tentatively walks in. 
      The guys is out of his element here, afraid to touch 
      anything, oozing self-conscious charm.  This is RICHARD.  

                                    APRIL
                    Can I help you, Sir?

                                    RICHARD
                    Um... I hope so.  I m recently 
                      divorced and my single friends, and 
                    some of my married-friends-who-wish- 
                        they-were-single, helped me find a

      Off April, smiling--  the answer she wanted. 

      INT. NAUGHTY LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

      Savi shops, or more accurately-tries not to look intimidated 
      by the apparatus.  Josslyn enters.

      Katie talks in a quiet voice.

      Katie hangs up. Composes herself. And gets back to work.

      INT. APRIL'S CAR - DAY    

      April applies lipstick in her visor mirror.  She stares at 
      her wedding ring, takes it off, and opens her glove

      her right hand instead.  Her CELL RINGS.

                    car.

      Bolstered, April hangs up, and grabs her samples...  

      EXT. APRIL S CAR - CONTINUOUS   

      From across the street, THROUGH SOMEONE S SPYING EYES, we see 
      April get out of her car and head to a door.  April knocks.  
      Richard answers.

                                    RICHARD

      INT. NAUGHTY LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

      Josslyn stands outside the dressing room.

                    So why dyou and Katie stop 
                      speaking?

                                    SAVI
                    We drifted; people drift.

                    And Harry hated her husband.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    Well, he was a dick.

                    This is complicated stuff.  There 
                    are like nine leg holes in this 
                      thing. 

                                    JOSSLYN
                    So this condo Mac wants for me? Is 
                      gorgeous.  Though who lives in a 
                      high-rise in LA? If I'm going to be 
                    in a doorman building I should be 
                    in a doorman building in New York. 

                                    SAVI
                    Being a kept woman doesn t phase 
                    you, but the doorman thing-- you 
                      pause.  Okay. Come in. 

      Josslyn peeks in the door to see Savi in a risque get-up.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    Wow.

                                    SAVI
                      Really?

                                    JOSSLYN
                    You look... amazing.

      Savi peeks at herself in the mirror when her phone RINGS.

      INT. LAW FIRM - DAY

      Dominic calls.  We see their boss, MOSTOW in the BG.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Where are you?

                                    SAVI
                    At the doctor, what s going on?

                                    DOMINIC
                      They ve replied to the court. 

                                    SAVI
                    Smith and Smith?  That s set for 
                    next week.

                                    DOMINIC
                    They replied and didn t tell us.  
                      They re on their way over now.

                                    SAVI
                    I ll be there in five minutes.

      She hangs up, shitshitshit.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    Turn around, let me help you.

      They try to undo Savi, but it's an intricate operation. Savi 
      pulls the tags, gives her purse to Josslyn.

                                    SAVI
                    Pay for this, please.  Go, go, go.  

      Off Savi, putting her work clothes on over her teddy.

      INT. RICHARD S PLACE - DAY

      April finishes fitting some samples on Richard s bed.  He 
      watches.  The place is indeed a lair.  Dark, cheesy, mirrors.

                                    RICHARD
                      I feel weird watching you make my 
                    bed.  

                                    APRIL

                      I feel weird watching me make your 
                    bed.  God, this guy really liked to 
                    look at himself, huh?

      He laughs.  They are cute together.  

                                    APRIL (CONT D)
                    Okay, so-- I gave you a bunch of 
                      options here, but I would go plain.  
                    The wallpaper does enough talking.

                                    RICHARD
                    Have you felt it?  Feel it.  It s 
                      furry.

      He walks to the wall.  She giggles, follows him tentatively.  
      They stroke the wall,  She shrieks and recoils. They laugh.

                                    APRIL
                    It is furry!  That s disgusting.

                                    RICHARD
                    Will you have dinner with me 
                      tonight?

                                    APRIL
                    What?  Tonight?

      He nods.  She looks away, then:    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1229.

                                    APRIL (CONT D)
                    Well, I ll have to go home and 
                      change.  And get a sitter.

      He smiles -- great.  She smiles, nervous.

      INT. LAW FIRM - BULLPEN - DAY    

      Savi rushes in, Dom briefs her on a fast walk and talk.

                                    SAVI
                    Okay, tell me.

                                    DOMINIC
                    The freezing order was made on 
                    April 23rd...

      INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Savi and Dominic sit close to one another across a table from 
      OPPOSING LAWYERS.  Mostow, their boss, stands in the doorway.

                                    OPPOSING LAWYER #1
                    The difficulty arises in the 
                      parameters of the order.

                                    SAVI
                    The parameters were made perfectly 
                      clear.  Your client can t touch the 
                      proceeds from the sale of the 
                      matrimonial home.

                                    OPPOSING LAWYER #1
                    Then he s unable to pay his 
                      employees  salaries.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Yes, that s the argument you put 
                      before the judge.  He didn t like 
                    it then, and we hate it now.

      Savi smirks.  They are dominating.  As usual.  As Lawyer #1 s
      voice recedes into the BG, Dominic and Savi feel one 
      another s energy.  He eyes her upper thigh, sees the GARTER. 

      Savi sees Dominic see it.  She catches his eye; he s brimming 
      with curiosity and desire.  Off Savi, pulling her skirt down. 

      INT. KATIE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

      A DOOR OPENS and Katie leads Sam Grey in to have a seat on 
      the couch.  She sits across from him, cool, professional.

                                    KATIE
                    Come on in, Sam.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1230.

                                  SAM
                      I thought this would be the most 
                      appropriate place to see you. I 
                    came to your house last night.

                                    KATIE
                    You did?

                                  SAM
                    I m sorry.  I m not in my right 
                    mind.  And I can t talk to my 
                      mother.  She didn t have much more 
                      insight into my father than I did.

                                    KATIE
                    You keep saying that, I don t know 
                    why.  I understood you to be close.

                                  SAM
                    He told you that?

      Katie stops.  This is a breach.

                                    KATIE
                    Yes.  Many times.  

      Sam looks away, clearly tormented, and in need of compassion.

                                    KATIE (CONT D)
                    He didn t want you to see him sick.  
                    He didn t want you to see him 
                      suffer.

                                  SAM
                    Maybe he just wanted to create some 
                    space to spend all his time with 
                    her.

      Katie blanches. 

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    He was having an affair.  Then I 
                    guess you might have known.

                                    KATIE
                    No, I-- didn t.  Why would you 
                    think this?

                                  SAM
                      I don t think, I know.

      Sam pulls out a PIECE OF STATIONERY.  Katie s heart races. 

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    It s a letter he wrote to his 
                      mistress, started writing to her, 
                    never finished.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1231.

      Katie wants to grab it-- both evidence that could ruin her 
      and the last words her love wrote to her before he died.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    No name, just  My Darling...   
                    Could be anyone.  I wouldn t put it 
                    past half my mother s bridge club.    

                                    KATIE
                    Would you like me to read it?

                                  SAM
                            (withholding)
                    It doesn t say more than she broke 
                    it off with him that day, and then 
                    he goes on, begging for her back.

                                    KATIE
                    Where did you find it?

                                  SAM
                    Why does it matter?

      The more frightening question:

                                    KATIE
                    Has your mother seen it?

                                  SAM
                      I don t think so.  If she had I 
                    would have heard about it.  She 
                    seems like a gentle woman, but she 
                    was fiercely jealous.  If she saw 
                    this, God knows, she d have had a 
                      strong reaction.

      Off Katie, wondering just how much danger she s in.

      INT. LAW FIRM - BULLPEN - LATER - EARLY EVENING

      Last ones in the office, Savi and Dom work at their desks. 
      Dom notes Savi s frustration as she looks at her watch.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Date night?

                                    SAVI
                    Not at this rate.

      They go back to work.  She can't help but look up at him; he 
      looks at her when she looks away.  His eyes linger on her.   

                                    DOMINIC
                    I ll have all your work done and on 
                    your desk by 8 am, if you let me 
                    take a look at you in that thing.

      She looks at him.  Can t believe what he s proposing.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1232.

                                    SAVI
                      That s quite an offer.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Your work and mine for a mere ten 
                      seconds.

      She holds his gaze... and surprising them both:  

                                    SAVI
                    Five seconds.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Done.

      He can't believe it, she's going to do it.  She gets up, he 
      swallows hard.  He watches her slowly position herself.  He s 
      been dreaming of this for a year.   She lifts her skirt at an 
      aching pace, showing him stockings then garters then sexy 
      black panties.  It s hot for them both.  Their eyes lock...

                                    SAVI
                      1-2-3-4-5.  

      She gathers her things, leaving Dominic speechless, and she 
      heads off turned on, with a mischievous smile.

 ACT THREE

      INT. SAVANNAH S (HARRY S RESTAURANT) - EVENING

      Savannah enters the hip, loft-like place, guarded... and then 
      relieved to see it s pretty crowded.  She smiles, approaches 
      the striking young hostess, KYRA, with familiarity.

                                    SAVI

                    I ll tell him that you re here.

                                    SAVI
                      That s a good idea.

      Savi watches Kyra walk off, her CHEERFUL LITTLE ASS making 
      Savi grind her teeth.  She watches her with Harry in the OPEN 
      KITCHEN, studies the interaction.  Seems harmless enough. 
      Harry looks up, smiles at Savi.  Comes out in chef whites. 

                                    HARRY
                    Hi!  What are you doing here?

                                    SAVI
                      Wanted to see you in action.

      Smiling, they kiss.  He s glowing with pride.

                                    HARRY
                      Pretty busy tonight.

                      I see! I thought maybe if things 
                    were slow you could hand the reins 
                    to Patrick and come home early, but 
                    I m happy to just hang at the bar.

                    you.

                    Oh and Harry...?

      She opens her top and gives him a peek of her teddy.

                                    HARRY
                    Wow.

      She cocks a brow, smiles and heads to the bar.

      INT. APRIL S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

      The kitchen s a mess.  April rushes to pack Lauren and 
      GINGER s (9) food for a sleep-over.  

                                    GINGER
                    Why are we sleeping at grandma s?

                    we get radical on your diet 
                      tomorrow and choose something?  Or 
                    you can eat your grandma s cooking.

                                    LAUREN
                    No way.

      Lauren plucks some choices.  Off April, looking at her watch.

      EXT. JOHN GREY'S HOUSE - EVENING

      Katie knocks on the door.  Maggie answers, surprised.

                      Katie. Come in.

      INT. JOHN GREY S HOUSE - DEN - MINUTES LATER 

      Katie is careful, sussingout what Maggie knows.

                    Can I get you something?      MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1235.

                                    KATIE
                    I m fine.  How are you?  How s Sam?

                                    MAGGIE
                    He keeps moving his date to return 
                    to grad school, I m afraid he s 
                    going to quit altogether.  

                                    KATIE
                      I think he should go back.  I don t 
                      recommend him making big life 
                      decisions in a time of crisis.

                                    MAGGIE
                    He s fixated on not having had a 
                      chance to say goodbye to John.

                                    KATIE
                      I don t blame him.

                                    MAGGIE
                      I keep thinking it would bring him 
                      peace.  To know what John wanted, 
                    what we did for him. 

                                    KATIE
                    We haven t had a chance to talk,

                      I know it wasn t as we planned.  
                    But, he was in so much pain that 
                      night.  Begging me to end it, I 
                    tried to reach you many times--

                                    KATIE
                      I didn t get any messages.

                                    MAGGIE
                    Maybe I didn t leave any-- I was 
                      frenzied.  I d never heard him like 
                    that.  Moaning and crying out. 

      Katie shudders at the thought of John in this agony.

                                    MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    What choice did I have?  I had the 
                      morphine you gave us... I had his 
                      relief in my hand.  I was 
                      terrified, but as I did it... it 
                      seemed only right that it was just 
                    John and me at the end.

      Katie nods-- painful for her to hear on one hand, good news 
      on the other.  

                                    KATIE
                    It seems that things between you... 
                    that you felt close to him when he 
                    went.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1236.

      Maggie nods.

                      I wouldn t tell Sam what you did, 
                      Maggie. I don t know if he d ever 
                      forgive you.

      Just then they hear Sam come down the stairs.  

                                  SAM
                    Dr. Roden?

      The women pull it together, smile at him.

                                    MAGGIE
                    Hi, sweetheart.  

                                    KATIE

                    what Dr. Laura says... 

      Josslyn rolls her eyes, swivels her chair to see MRS. MAC 
      entering Mac s office (through the paned glass wall).  He 
      kisses his wife.  She moves aside, revealing an 8 year-old 
      DAUGHTER.  Josslyn s eyes fix on the girl, moved.  Perhaps 
      it s that she reminds Josslyn of herself as a little girl.  
      As the Daughter sees her through the glass and locks eyes 
      with her curiously... for the first time, we see regret cross

      INT. SAVANNAH (HARRY'S RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

      Savi s at the bar on her second glass of wine.  She looks 
      over to see Harry waving to her from the kitchen, mouthing: 
      sorry.  Savi smiles: it s okay.   

      Savi adjusts her garter.  It s tight.  And her thong isn t 
      doing her any favors either.  She's feeling less sexy when...   
      Her phone BUZZES.  A text.  She reads it.

                    And I ve done exactly the opposite.  

      Savi leaves.  Off Harry, feeling his wife slip away.

      Katie and Sam get out of her car, she leaves her headlights 
      on, shining on the empty baseball field.  (The same one from

                    Yeah, you do.  

      Peering into the closet...

                                    SAVI (CONT D)
                    So you still have Paul s clothes?

                      I can t bear to get rid of them.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1240.

                                    SAVI
                      I have never seen a man with so 
                    many rope belts.

                                    APRIL
                    What do you think?

                                    SAVI
                    The other shoes looked better.

                                    APRIL
                    You know, I could never have asked 
                    any of my adult-made friends to 
                    dress me for my first widow-date. 

                                    KATIE
                    Why?

                                    APRIL
                    The PTAset? Please. With the Uggs
                    and the pilatesand the kids my 
                    kids  age?  Because we re all so 
                      over-identified with one another... 
                      there s no room for me to have an 
                      experience.  You should have seen 
                    the way they looked at me when Paul 
                    died.  Like it happened to all of 
                    us.  As a community.  I wanted to 
                    smack them.

                                    SAVI
                            (heartfelt)
                    I m sorry I wasn t there.

                                    APRIL
                            (shrugging it off)
                    It s okay.

                                    SAVI
                    Not really.

      They look at each other.  Something healed.  The DOORBELL 
      RINGS.  April looks at her watch.

                                    APRIL
                    Oh my God!  He can t be here 
                      already!  He can t be here at all, 
                    we re meeting at the restaurant.


      INT. APRIL S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

      Savi cracks open the front door.  Katie is standing there.

                                    SAVI
                      Katie, hi. What reyou doing here?

                                    KATIE
                    I got a message from April, saying 
                    she needed help with outfits...?    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1241.

      From the bottom of the stairs...

                                    APRIL
                    Oh, yeah I called Katie and-- 

                                    SAVI
                    Then tried me, that s fine.

      Beat.  Old dynamic.  Katie holds up a bag.

                                    KATIE
                      I brought tequilla.

      As they head inside...

                                    APRIL
                       Paul  called today. 

                                    KATIE
                      Another crank call?

                                    SAVI
                      That s it.  I m putting one of my 
                    PI s on the case.  We re having it 
                      traced.

                                    KATIE
                    Good idea.

                                    APRIL
                    You can do that?  

                                    SAVI
                      Whoever s screwing with you needs 
                    to stop.  And you have to move on 
                    to some sex with this Richard.

                                    APRIL
                            (allowing a giddy grin)
                      I don t think I m ready for that, 
                    but I really might like him.

                                    SAVI
                      You re lucky, in a way.  To be at 
                    the beginning of something, to be a 
                      mystery to someone.  

      April s land line RINGS.  Katie picks it up, protective:

                                    KATIE
                      Hello?
                            (listens, hands to April)
                    It s Richard.

                                    APRIL
                          (in phone)
                    Hi. I m running ten minutes late.

      Savi and Katie have a moment while April s on the phone.     MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1242.

                                    SAVI
                    So you wanted to talk?  Maybe after 
                    this we can...? 

                                    KATIE
                    You know, it settled itself, 
                      miraculously.  Turns out I was 
                      worried for nothing.

                                    SAVI
                          (a bit disappointed)
                    Oh, well good.

      They turn to see April, crestfallen.

                                    APRIL
                    His ex-wife got called away to Cabo 
                    on a business thing, and he s gotta 
                    take his daughter tonight.  

                                    KATIE
                    Aw, shit.

                                    SAVI
                      Should we order in or go out?

      April smiles at her dear old friends, grateful they re here. 

      EXT. SAVI AND HARRY S HOUSE - NIGHT

        A HEADLIGHT goes out with the quieting of an engine.  From 
      her car, Savi looks at her house, hesitant to go in.

      INT. SAVI AND HARRY S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

      Savi enters to find Harry coming in the side door.  

                                    SAVI
                    Hi.

                    I m so sorry about before.

                                    SAVI
                    It s okay.

                                    HARRY
                    You looked gorgeous tonight.

                                    SAVI
                      I did?

                    Until you started crying, I hate

                      I should hop in the shower.

                                    SAVI
                          (arms around his neck)
                    No, don t.  The smell of hard-
                      working man turns me on.  

                                    HARRY
                      Really?  Thought you preferred the 
                    smell of three piece suit.

                                    SAVI
                    Just kiss me.

      He does.  And it starts to get hot.  He flirts:

                                    HARRY
                      When s your husband coming home?

                                    SAVI
                    Not til late.  

                                    HARRY
                    Oh yeah, you do things for me my 
                    wife could never do.

      She smacks him.  Pretty hard.  OUCH!!!  

                                    HARRY (CONT D)
                      Hostile.

                                    SAVI
                    I m sorry. 
                          (trying to save it)
                    Let s just be us, okay?

                                    HARRY
                      Whatever you say, boss.

                                    SAVI
                      What s that supposed to mean?

      The married couple look at each other, desperate for a map 
      through the mine-field they ve created. 

                                    HARRY
                    I m gonnatake that shower.

      Savi doesn t fight him, watches him go.  Her PHONE BUZZES.  
      She looks-- it s a text.  FROM: DOMINIC.

       I got the better end of the deal.   Off Savi, smiling, and 
      resisting writing back.

 ACT FOUR

      INT. SAVI AND HARRY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

      Savi lies awake in a tank and sweats-- hasn t slept all 
      night.  Harry s sound asleep.  

      She hears NOISE from the kitchen.  Then a THUD.  She looks 
      over at Harry-- sleeping through it.  She inches to the door.

      INT. SAVI AND HARRY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

      Savi peeks around a corner to find Josslyn dragging a HUGE 
      suitcase through the kitchen door.

                      I didn t want the painters to steal

                    have talked to you first.  But, the 
                    pool house just sits there and 
                    she s homeless; she s my sister.

                                    HARRY
                    How long is she going to be living 
                    here?

                                    SAVI
                    You know what, I can tell her no; I 
                    can tell her--

                                    HARRY
                    What?  You changed your mind?

                                    SAVI
                            (agreeing with him)
                    No.  She ll know it s coming from 
                    you.  She knows you don t like her.

                                    HARRY
                    She s got no morals.

                                    SAVI
                    She s got no hang-ups.

      Harry sees this is headed for disaster.

                    Good, because there s an insurance 
                      investigation into John Grey s 
                    death and I need to give it my full

                                    SAVI
                    Why s there an investigation?

                                    MOSTOW
                      Apparently he made an appointment

                    No, he trusts you with all of this.  
                    These are important cases.  You re

                      sliding to one corner of the cover

                    you might consider re-entering my

                    Mac.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1253.

                                    HARRY
                    In his classiest move yet, he s 
                      offered to buy her a condo.

                                    APRIL
                    And you re not ready to move in 
                    with him?

                                    HARRY
                    He didn t ask her to move in with 
                    him.  

                                    SAVI
                    He s married.

                                    APRIL
                    Oh. Oh!  

                                    JOSSLYN
                    And I won t be a kept woman.

                                    HARRY
                    But you ll be an other woman, that 
                      you ll do.  

                                    JOSSLYN
                    His betrayal of his wife is his 
                      business, my control of my life is 
                    mine.

                                    HARRY
                      That s quite a moral universe 
                      you ve created.

                                    SAVI
                    Why do you care so much?!

                                    HARRY
                    Why don t you care at all?!

      Silence.  April and Josslyn look at each other.

                                    JOSSLYN
                      Katie s here.

      They all look over to see Katie at the entrance.  Scopingfor 
      them.  Harry gets up.

                                    HARRY
                    I ll get her.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    We re gonnahave so much fun, the 
                    three of us, all-night gab-sessions 
                    and s moresin the kitchen.  

                                    SAVI
                    Hey, you re gonnahave to be 
                      respectful of him, Josslyn.      MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1254.

                    At the very least while you re 
                      living in our house.

                                    JOSSLYN
                       Cause he ll never do anything 
                      wrong...

      They follow her eyes to the door.

      THEIR POV:Harry and Katie cheek kiss, then hug.  Look at 
      each other, talk very warmly.

                                    JOSSLYN (CONT D)
                    They ever hook up?

                                    APRIL
                    Hook up?  Harry dated Katie before 
                    Savi stole him away.

                                    SAVI
                          (off of them)
                    It was eighteen years ago.  What 
                      happened to moving on?

      Savi s phone RINGS.  More than happy to take the call...

                                    SAVI (CONT D)
                      Excuse me a sec.

      Savi gets up and takes the call a few feet from the table.

                                    JOSSLYN
                          (seeing April s phone)
                    You have Love Tracker?

                                    APRIL
                    You know it?

                                    JOSSLYN
                      Awwwyeah.

      Harry and Katie have arrived at the table.  She and Josslyn 
      hug and squeal.

                                    KATIE
                    How are you more gorgeous than you 
                    were when you were 20?

                                    JOSSLYN
                      I love you, I ve always loved you.

                                    APRIL
                          (kiss, kiss)
                    Hi, Katie.

                                    KATIE
                    Hi.  We did it.  We made this 
                      happen.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1255.

                                    SAVI
                    I m sorry, guys, I have to go.

                                      KATIE/APRIL/JOSSLYN
                    What? Noooo.

                                    SAVI
                      Things are crazy at the office, 
                      especially since John died.  A lot 
                    of scrambling, there s an insurance 
                      investigation into his death...

      ON Katie, horrified.

                                    APRIL
                    What?  Why?

                                    SAVI
                    I ll tell you details when I can.  

      Savi blows rushed kisses to the group and takes off.

                                    SAVI (CONT D)
                    We ll do this again, I promise.  

      Katie sits down next to April, wracked with anxiety.

                                    APRIL
                    Did you know about this 
                        investigation?

      Dying to confess, Katie shakes her head and downs April s 
      wine.

      INT. LAW FIRM - LIBRARY - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Savi enters to find Dom alone in the empty office, happy to 
      see her.  He pours through depositions in the dim light.   

                                    DOMINIC
                    If we can t find this statement, he 
                    may get away with constructive 
                      trust.

                                    SAVI
                    Good thing you ve never been one to 
                    give up.

      She sits across from him.  He loosens his tie, unbuttons his 
      collar.  She sees his bare skin, his strong Adam s apple.  
      His thick rugged hands.  He looks up, she's back to work.  
      Twirling her hair.  He studies her.  Looks away when she 
      looks up.  Their hunger for each other is palpable. 

      INT. HARRY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Harry, Josslyn, Katie and April sit, kindadrunk, over ten 
      half-empty plates of fabulous-looking food.  Josssmiles.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1256.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    Harry Dillon!

                                    HARRY
                    What?

                                    JOSSLYN
                    This food is amazing.  

                                    APRIL/KATIE
                    Yes, it is.

                                    JOSSLYN
                    You are a talented, talented self-
                      righteous asshole.

      Everyone but Katie laughs.  April notices this.

                                    HARRY
                    Thank you, you homewrecker, now I 
                    must return to my kitchen.

                                    KATIE
                      Where s the ladies  room?

                                    APRIL
                    I ll go with you.

      They leave Jossalone at the table.  Awwwyeahcomes from the  
      LOVE TRACKER APP.  Josslooks at it, looks up, sees a HOT GUY 
      at the bar on his APP, staring at her.  Off their smiles...  

      INT. LAW FIRM - NIGHT

      Savi sits alone, hard at work.  She feels Dominic behind her, 
      placing take-out over her shoulder and onto the desk in front 
      of her.  They touch briefly.  It s electric.

                                    SAVI
                    You scared me.

                                    DOMINIC
                      Sorry.

                                    SAVI
                    I m starving.

      He offers her a bite of something from his hand. 

                                    DOMINIC
                      Careful, it s hot.

      She goes for it.  Puts her mouth around the morsel. It's 
      sexy.  He sits down and gets back to work.

                                    SAVI
                    Thank you.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1257.

                                    DOMINIC
                    Uh huh.

      INT. SAVANNAH S - LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

      April helps Katie steady herself on the sink.

                                    APRIL
                      Katie?  What is it?  

                                    KATIE
                    You can t say a word--

                                    APRIL
                      I won t.

                                    KATIE
                    I can lose everything.  My entire 
                      practice.  

                                    APRIL
                      Katie, you can trust me.

                                    KATIE
                    John and I were in love.

                                    APRIL
                    What? John Grey?  You were having 
                    an affair.

                                    KATIE
                    You could call it that.

                                    APRIL
                    You were sleeping together.

                                    KATIE
                            (breaking down with grief)
                    No, I drew the line.  But, God I 
                    wish I hadn t.  What for?  To be 
                    good?  To be right?  I loved him so 
                    much.  Now I will never know what 
                    it feels like to--

      April holds her.

                                    APRIL
                    Does anyone know?

                                    KATIE
                    His son suspects.

                    Sam?      MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1258.

                                    KATIE
                    He s come to see me.  He has no 
                      proof, but he has a strong feeling 
                    and God knows what evidence he ll 
                    find if he looks more.  Or what 
                      investigators might find...

                                    APRIL
                    You have to cut off all contact 
                    with him.  You have to move on and 
                      forget that any of this has 
                      happened.

                                    KATIE
                      I can t just cut him off.  He s 
                    alone and in pain and he thinks 
                    that he needs me. He s John s son.

      April has to say it...

                                    APRIL
                    But, he s not yourson.  And you 
                      weren t John s wife.

      Katie hears the stark truth.  

                                    KATIE
                      You re right.  You re right.

      Off Katie, ready to end it.

      INT. LAW FIRM - LIBRAYNIGHT

      Savi stands, searching the bookcase.  Dom leafs through a 
      document.  

                                    DOMINIC
                    Here it is.

      He approaches her, gives her the paper, stands behind her.

                                    SAVI
                      Perfect, Dominic.  Exactly what we 
                    need.

      He gently turns her around, his lips close to the skin on her 
      neck. He traces her clavicle with his hand. She doesn t 
      flinch.

                                    SAVI (CONT D)
                    You can t do that.

      He looks in her eyes hungrily, she doesn't look away.  He 
      moves to touch her, she doesn't stop him, he goes in to kiss 
      her and she is unable to resist.  They kiss soft then hard 
      and tear at each other passionately.  

      INT. APRIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1259.

      April sees the BABYSITTER out, hands her money.

                                    APRIL
                    Thank you, Isabel.

                                    BABYSITTER
                    They were no trouble at all.

      Babysitter walks down the path passing two figures we can t 
      make, but they re heading for April s door.  April looks 
      closer.  They come into focus.  It is the Young Woman from 
      the motel and a 3 YEAR OLD BOY.  

                                    APRIL
                    What?  What is this?  What are you 
                    doing here?  How did you find me?

                                    YOUNG WOMAN
                      I wasn t expecting you today.  I 
                      wanted to talk to you when we were 
                      alone.  I ve been trying to work up 
                    the nerve for weeks to actually 
                    talk to you when I called...

                                    APRIL
                    What do you want?

                                    YOUNG WOMAN
                    The money we deserve. I was Paul s 
                      mistress.  And I was pregnant when 
                    he died.

      April stares in disbelief at this stranger and her boy-- who 
      looks so much like her dead husband.  Off April, turning to 
      look at a nearby PHOTO OF PAUL... 

      EXT. KATIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Katie gets out of her car.  Walks up her path.  Sees Sam at 
      her door.  He's drunk.  

                                    KATIE
                    Sam, you shouldn t be here.

                                  SAM
                    Can I please come in?

                                    KATIE
                    No.  I m sorry.  You can t.  

                                  SAM
                    I ve been thinking about you non-
                    stop.

      He moves to her, a strange and undeniable chemistry there.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Were you sleeping with my father?    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1260.

                                    KATIE
                          (pales; the truth)
                    No, Sam, I wasn t.

                                  SAM
                      Because if it was you he loved I 
                    can see why.  You are an incredible 
                      woman.

      He leans, in, tries to kiss her.  She pushes him off.

                                    KATIE
                    You have to go now, Sam.  

      He grabs her and kisses her on the lips, then walks away, 
      down the street. Katie is rocked, quivering with feeling.

      She catches her breath, and heads back to her car.  Where is 
      she going?

      INT. EXT SAVI AND HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Harry is in the kitchen, turning lights off.  The doorbell 
      rings.  He opens the door.  It s Mac.

                                  MAC
                    Hi.  I m Mac, I m looking for 
                      Josslyn George.  Is she here?

      Harry points him around back.

      Harry closes the door, shakes his head, rolls his eyes.

      INT. SAVI AND HARRY S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Harry hears Josslyn GIGGLE and SHRIEK outside.  He looks out 
      the bedroom window and into the backyard to see...

      JOSSLYN NAKED and gorgeous and free.  Getting ready to join 
      Mac for a skinny dip in the pool.  Off Harry, unable to tear 
      his eyes away.

      INT. KATIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Katie enters her office, furtive in the near darkness... she 
      pulls a file from drawer and sits at her desk.  Then starts 
      shredding its contents by the light of her phone.
