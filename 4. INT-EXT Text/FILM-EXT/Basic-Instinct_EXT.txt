Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.
Cop cars everywhere.
The lights play through the thick fog.
Two Homicide detectives
get out of the car, walk into the house.
NICK CURRAN is 42.
Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face
urban, edged, shadowed.
GUS MORAN is 64.
Crew-cut, silver
beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face
worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.
It is more a mansion than a house.
They ring the bell.
An
Hispanic MAID answers.
They flash their badges.
NICK
I'm Detective Curran, this is
Detective Moran.
We're with the
San Francisco Police Department.
We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.
THE MAID
(after a beat, an
accent)
Just moment.
Come in.
She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room
that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.
THE MAID
Sit, please.
Just moment.
They look around, impressed.
There is a Picasso on the wall
here, too.
GUS
Ain't that cute?
They got his and
her Pig-assos, son.
NICK
(smiles)
I didn't know you knew who Picasso
was, Gus.
GUS
(grins)
I'm a smart sonofabitch.
I just
hide it.
Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks
into the room.
She looks like she has been asleep.
She is in
her early 20's.
She wears a very sheer robe.
NICK
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd
like to ask you some --
THE WOMAN
Are you vice?
GUS
(after a beat)
Homicide.
THE WOMAN
What do you want?
GUS
When was the last time you saw
John Boz?
THE WOMAN
Is he dead?
NICK
(after a beat)
Why do you think he's dead?
THE WOMAN
You wouldn't be here otherwise,
would you?
GUS
Were you with him last night?
THE WOMAN
You're looking for Catherine, not
me.
NICK
Who are you?
THE WOMAN
I'm Roxy.
(a beat)
I'm her -- friend.
She looks at them a beat.
ROXY
She's out at the beach house at
Stinson.
Seadrift.
1402.
NICK
Thanks.
They start to head out.
ROXY
You're wasting your time. Catherine
didn't kill him.
A beat, they look at her, and go...
Foggy.
Cold.
It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.
Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming
pools.
There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black,
one white.
They get out of the car in front of the house.
They see a
woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring
at the sea, a blanket around her.
As they get to her --
NICK
Ms. Tramell?
She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.
CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.
She has long blonde hair
and a refined, classically beautiful face.
She is not knockout
gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about
her.
NICK
I'm De...
CATHERINE
(evenly)
I know who you are.
She doesn't look at them.
She looks at the water.
CATHERINE
How did he die?
GUS
He was murdered.
CATHERINE
Really.
Maybe that's why you're
from Homicide.
How?
Nick glances at Gus.
NICK
With an ice pick.
She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see
a thin smile.
They see it, too, and glance at each other.
NICK
How long were you dating him?
CATHERINE
I wasn't dating him.
I was fucking
him.
They glance at each other again.
GUS
What are you -- a pro?
Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.
CATHERINE
No.
I'm an amateur.
She looks away.
NICK
How long were you having sex with
him?
CATHERINE
About a year and a half.
NICK
Were you with him last night?
CATHERINE
Yes.
NICK
Did you leave the club with him?
CATHERINE
Yes.
NICK
Did you go home with him?
CATHERINE
No.
We had a drink at the club.
We left together.
I came here.
He went home.
NICK
Was there anyone with you last
night?
CATHERINE
(looks at Nick)
No.
I wasn't in the mood to have
sex with anyone last night.
They look at her a beat.
NICK
Let me ask you something, Ms.
Tramell?
Are you sorry he's dead?
Catherine looks at him.
CATHERINE
Yes.
I liked fucking him.
They stare at her.
She looks out at the water.
CATHERINE
I don't really feel like talking
anymore.
GUS
Listen, lady, we can do this
downtown if you --
CATHERINE
Read me my rights and arrest me
and I'll go downtown.
She doesn't even look at them.
CATHERINE
(quietly)
Otherwise, get the fuck out of
here.
Please.
A long beat as they look at her.
They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.
They ring the bell.
They hear typing inside.
The typing stops.
She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.
NICK
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come
downtown and answer some questions
for us.
CATHERINE
Are you arresting me?
NICK
If that's the way you want to play
it.
They look at each other a beat.
CATHERINE
(smiles)
Can I change into something more
appropriate?
It'll just take a
minute.
He nods.
CATHERINE
Come in.
The black Ferrari is in the driveway.
He sits in an unmarked
police car on a hillside above the house, watching.
It is a
bleak, leaden gray day.
Catherine comes out of the house.
She is dressed casually.
She gets into the Ferrari.
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
He stands there a beat, thinking.
He walks down to the beach
entrance of the house.
He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing
inside.
He stands there.
The door suddenly opens.
Catherine
stands there, smiles.
She wears very tight-fitting spandex
leotards.
CATHERINE
Hi.
He looks at her a beat, then --
NICK
Am I... disturbing you?
CATHERINE
No.
Come in.
They have their eyes on each other.
A beat, and she turns to
go in.
He gets into his old Porsche.
He STARTS the car up.
Gus Moran
comes up to the window.
They look at each other a
GUS
What's goin' down, son?
NICK
Nothin'
(a beat)
I'll be okay, pop.
They look at each other a long beat.
GUS
No, sir.
You won't.
There's smoke
off yonder on the horizon.
They're
gonna want your badge.
NICK
(after a long beat)
I got tired of being played with.
GUS
(after a beat)
You sure got real conclusive ways
of demonstrating that.
They almost smile at each other, then --
NICK
(almost to himself)
She knows where I live and breathe.
She's coming after me.
GUS
(after a long beat)
What is it you got between you?
NICK
(after a beat; to
himself)
I don't know.
GUS
Somethin', though.
A beat, and then Nick looks at him.
NICK
Yeah.
(a beat)
Somethin'.
He walks down the alley.
There are lots of police cars,
flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.
As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several
of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.
They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.
They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.
He can see into the car now.
Martin Nilsen lies against the
front seat.
He has been shot in the head.
Nick stares.
GUS
One shot.
Close range.
Probably
a .38 caliber revolver.
Nick stares at Nilsen's body.
They watch him.
LT. WALKER
Give me your gun, Nick.
A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.
Walker smells it,
shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.
NICK
(to Walker)
You think I --
GUS
I don't son, but I got the minority
opinion.
They get outside.
Beth kisses him quickly, softly on the cheek.
BETH
Get some rest.
Promise?
He nods.
She starts walking toward her car.
NICK
Beth.
I didn't mean what I said.
About --
BETH
(smiles)
Yes you did.
I'm a big girl.
I
can handle it.
She goes to her car.
He is cleaning his desk out, putting things into a duffel bag.
Only Andrews is in the room.
We see Lt. Walker sitting in his
glass-enclosed office.
He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.
Andrews is watching him.
He goes up to Andrews
ANDREWS
(after a beat)
Take care, you hear?
NICK
(after a beat)
Did you find out about her parents?
ANDREWS
You're on leave, man.
(a beat)
You're on psycho leave.
I'm talking
to a possible whacko here.
NICK
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd
you find?
A beat, and Andrews opens the file.
ANDREWS
The boat blew.
There was a leak
in the gas line.
There were two
previous repairs.
There was a
five-mil policy on both of 'em.
A
real heavy investigation.
Zilch.
Goose-egg.
It was an accident.
NICK
(after a beat)
Thanks.
He sees Lt. Walker looking at him.
He goes into Walker's
office.
LT. WALKER
I.A.'s going to talk to you more
about Nilsen.
They're handling
the investigation, we're not.
Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner,
it'll help on the evaluation.
NICK
(after a beat)
She killed him.
LT. WALKER
Beth?
Now you've got Beth killing
people?
NICK
Catherine Tramell.
It's part of
her game.
LT. WALKER
First you've got her buying your
file.
Now you've got her killing
Nilsen.
Forget her, willya?
Go
someplace.
Sit in the sun.
Get
away from this goddamn fog.
Get
her out of your system.
NICK
You don't but it, do you?
She
knew nobody would but it.
(he smiles)
She knew I'd say she did it.
And
she knew nobody would buy it.
Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.
LT. WALKER
She's screwing with your head,
Nick.
Pretty soon you're gonna
look in the mirror and think you're
seeing her.
It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.
He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there.
She is sitting on the front stoop.
She wears an Indian jacket,
jeans and a T-shirt.
He goes up to her. She looks at him a
beat.
CATHERINE
I heard about what happened.
What
good's a shooter without his gun?
She smiles.
NICK
(a beat)
How exactly did you hear?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I have attorneys.
They have
friends.
I have friends.
Money
buys you a lot of attorneys and
friends.
NICK
(after a beat)
I don't know about that I don't
have any money I don't have any
attorneys Gus is my only real
friend.
CATHERINE
(smiles)
I wasn't talking about real friends.
Why doesn't Gus like me.
NICK
(after a beat)
I like you.
CATHERINE
Do you?
NICK
(smiles)
Yeah.
Would you like to come up
and have a drink?
She looks at him a beat.
CATHERINE
I didn't think you'd ask me.
He looks at her a beat.
NICK
(smiles)
I'm not that easy to figure.
They start walking inside.
She walks ahead of him.
He watches
her.
She turns suddenly.
CATHERINE
You're not easy to figure.
I'm
just very good at figuring.
NICK
(after a beat)
Don't get too cocky.
CATHERINE
Why not?
NICK
You can make a mistake.
CATHERINE
(smiles)
Not me.
And she turns, heads inside; he follows her.
A cold and foggy day.
He gets out of his old Porsche, walks
down the driveway.
He sees her out on the beach by the water.
A small bonfire is near her.
He walks towards her.
Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of
the house.
He doesn't see her.
He walks up to Catherine.
She has an Indian blanket over her
and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose
underneath.
NICK
(expressionless)
'Morning.
She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.
She doesn't smile
and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.
She walks
along the beach.
He walks with her.
A long beat.
NICK
I think Roxy got jealous.
She looks at him.
He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
She's seen me fuck plenty of other
guys.
That wipes the hidden smile off his face.
He looks at her,
walks with her.
A long beat.
NICK
Maybe she saw something she didn't
see before.
CATHERINE
She's seen everything before.
She looks at him; he's smiling now.
NICK
She's never seen us before.
He's serious.
She looks at him.
She smiles slowly.
CATHERINE
Did you think it was so special?
NICK
I told her it was the fuck of the
century.
He can't hide his smile anymore.
She says nothing, keeps
walking.
NICK
(after a beat)
What did you think?
CATHERINE
I thought it was a pretty good
beginning.
They look at each other.
They keep walking.
A long beat.
NICK
How about Roxy?
Is she a fuck to
the century, too?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Do you want her to join us sometime?
He looks at her: she's serious.
NICK
I didn't mean for me -- I meant
for you.
She looks at him.
CATHERINE
I'm not as judgmental about women
as I am about men.
They keep walking.
A long beat.
NICK
How's your shoulder?
CATHERINE
Fine.
How's your back?
NICK
It hurts.
She stops, looks at him.
A long beat.
CATHERINE
We're alike, you know.
A beat, he looks at her --
NICK
Are you kidding?
You think this
is my idea of morning-after
conversation?
CATHERINE
(keeps walking)
Do you want personal insights and
adolescent secrets?
I don't do
those.
The keep walking.
NICK
You mean getting inside you isn't
going to get me any deeper into
your character.
She looks a him.
A beat.
She smiles slowly.
CATHERINE
Not unless you confuse my character
with my body parts.
They keep walking.
A long beat.
CATHERINE
Were you frightened, Nicky?
He looks at her.
NICK
(after a beat)
I thought that business with the
scarf was pretty nifty.
CATHERINE
I told you I had a vivid
imagination.
They look at each other.
A long beat.
CATHERINE
You shouldn't play this game.
NICK
(after a beat)
I don't have a choice.
Their eyes are into each other.
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
You're in over your head.
NICK
(after a beat)
I know.
A long beat.
They look at each other.
CATHERINE
I've got a book to write.
I'll
see you around, Shooter.
A beat, and she walks away towards the house.
He watches her.
He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage
Cadillac.
NICK
You all right, pop?
You want me
to drive you?
GUS
In that little pissant car of yours?
Hell, no.
I ain't gettin' no back
pain disability retirement -- I'm
gettin' me a full pension and a
real gold-plate Seiko watch.
NICK
Come on, I'll drive you in this
thing.
GUS
You think I'd let you drive my
Cadillac car?
I ain't lettin' no
hear-up-his-ass person drive my
Cadillac car.
And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick
to get out of the way.
Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes
his head.
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding
the car.
He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out
It is a black Ferrari.
The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping
them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.
The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in
North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining
ground behind it, making turns.
The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the
air, almost out of control.
But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking,
almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.
And lands on the next street.
Nick makes a wild right turn
onto the street.
And the black Ferrari appears from around a
curve to the right, heading right for him.
And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari
tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of
control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls
down the hillside.
The Ferrari has landed right-side up.
He runs down the hillside and gets to it.
A beat, and he opens
the car door.
Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.
Her neck is
broken.
She is dead.
Police lights have been set up.
He stands there with Lt.
Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.
LT. WALKER
Tell me again.
I want to hear you
say it again.
NICK
(after a beat;
sheepish)
It was an accident.
LT. WALKER
You're driving around North Beach
for no particular reason and this
car won't get out of the way --
NICK
I don't think she meant to go off
the hill, do you?
LT. WALKER
(quietly)
Don't fuck with me, Nick.
I don't
need a reason to put your ass in a
sling.
He and Nick look at each other a long beat.
Andrews comes up
to them with a piece of paper in his hand.
ANDREWS
Full name, Roxanne Hardy.
Last
address -- Cloverdale, California.
No priors, no convictions.
The
car is registered to Catherine
Tramell.
Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.
Nick
looks calmly away.
LT. WALKER
You knew her, didn't you?
NICK
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's
house.
All we did was write her
name down.
LT. WALKER
(after a beat)
I told you to stay away from
Tramell.
NICK
(after a beat; smiles)
Yeah.
But you didn't tell me to
stay away from her car.
Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.
AN I.A. MAN
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office
at nine o'clock.
You're out of
control, Curran.
NICK
(to the I.A. Man)
Who are you guys gonna sell my
file to this time?
They stare at him.
He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.
Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.
He is
driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and
twisting road.
It is a bright, sunshiny day.
He is out there looking at the
water.
She comes up behind him, hugs him.
CATHERINE
(full of life)
Isn't it just beautiful?
I love
it here like this.
He looks at her.
NICK
(cold)
We're still playing games, aren't
we?
She looks hurt.
CATHERINE
No.
NICK
(cold)
No?
CATHERINE
No more games, Nick.
I'm tired of
playing games!
They have their eyes on each other.
NICK
Then tell me about Nilsen.
She turns away from him.
He watches her.
CATHERINE
You won't believe me.
NICK
Try me.
A beat, she looks at him.
CATHERINE
I paid him $50,000 in cash for
your psychiatric file.
NICK
(after a beat)
When?
CATHERINE
About three months before I met
you.
NICK
Why?
She turns away from him.
CATHERINE
I'd read about your shootings in
the papers.
I decided to write a
book about a detective.
I wanted
to know my character.
NICK
You paid $50,000 for your character?
CATHERINE
I would've paid more.
I wanted to
know everything about you.
Then
you came down here after Johnny
got killed... it gave me a chance
to get to know my character better.
NICK
(after a long beat)
What about the other night. What
about last night?
Was that to get
to know your character?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Maybe I'm losing interest in my
book.
Their eyes are on each other.
CATHERINE
Do you believe me?
NICK
(after a beat)
I don't know.
CATHERINE
I'll convince you.
And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the
lips.
The cordless phone on the deck table goes off.
It keeps
RINGING.
She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up.
CATHERINE
Hello?
She listens a beat, then hands him the phone.
CATHERINE
It's Gus-who-doesn't-like-me.
He takes the phone.
NICK
Catherine says you don't like her.
Catherine sees him smile.
CATHERINE
What did he say?
NICK
He asked if I had an icepick in me
yet.
CATHERINE
(smiles)
Funny.
NICK
I don't believe it.
They are going to their cars, parked side by side.
The Porsche
looks pretty badly banged up.
GUS
It sure makes you wonder what they
talked about when they set
themselves down in front of the
campfire at night.
You ever met
any of her friends who hasn't killed
somebody.
Nick looks at him.
GUS
It musta beat your ordinary everyday
girl talk.
Nick get into his car, sits there a beat.
NICK
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
GUS
(after a beat)
Which one you talkin' about now,
son?
We know ole Hazel did it; we
know young Roxy did it -- and the
other one Well, hell, she's got
that magna come lawdy pussy on her
that done fried up your brain.
Nick looks at him.
He gets out of the Porsche, starts to go in.
He looks disturbed
Catherine comes out of the house with Hazel Dobkins, the old
woman we saw with her in Mill Valley.
Nick watches them a
beat, then goes up to them.
CATHERINE
Hazel , this is Nick.
I told you
all about him.
This is Hazel
Dobkins.
HAZEL
(smiles)
You're the Shooter, aren't you?
How are you?
He looks at her a long beat.
NICK
Fine.
Thank you.
He looks at her sort of warily.
NICK
( to Catherine)
Can I talk to you a minute?
CATHERINE
(to Hazel)
Honey, why don't you go in the
car?
I'll be right there.
The old woman starts going to the Ferrari.
HAZEL
(brightly)
Goodbye, Shooter.
Nick looks at Hazel a beat, then at Catherine.
NICK
You like to hang out with murderers
or what?
Did you know Roxy --
CATHERINE
Of course I knew.
He looks at her a long beat.
CATHERINE
(casually)
Look.
Sometimes when I do my
research, I get involved with
people.
It happened with you,
too.
She smiles.
He looks at her, doesn't know what to say.
CATHERINE
Killing isn't like smoking.
You
can quit.
He looks at her What did she say?
CATHERINE
(preoccupied)
I've go to go.
I promised to get
her home by six o'clock.
She just
loves "America's Most Wanted."
America's Most Wanted?
She turns to go.
NICK
There was no Lisa Anderson at
Berkeley when you were there.
She stops, looks at him a beat.
CATHERINE
What were you doing, checking up
on me?
What for?
He says nothing.
A long beat, she looks hurt.
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Henderson.
And she's gone.
He gets out of his Porsche.
He walks toward the door.
He walks in; it is a small valley hospital.
He goes up to the
desk.
There are two women there.
NICK
Hi, I'm looking for a Dr. Gardner?
ONE WOMAN
(after a beat)
We don't have a Dr. Gardner on
staff here.
THE OTHER WOMAN
Dr. Joseph Gardner?
NICK
(after a beat)
Yeah.
THE WOMAN
He died -- about five or six years
ago.
NICK
(after a beat)
He was shot.
He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck,
a portable word-processor in front of her.
She is smoking.
He goes up to her.
NICK
(smiles)
Hi.
I missed you.
I finished my
research.
He moves toward her.
She moves away, kills her cigarette.
CATHERINE
I finished my book.
NICK
How did it end?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I told you.
She kills him.
They look at each other a long beat.
CATHERINE
(quietly)
Goodbye, Nick.
He stares at her.
A long beat.
CATHERINE
I finished my book.
(a beat)
Didn't you hear me?*
(a beat)
Your character's dead.
(a beat)
Goodbye.
He stares at her.
He can't believe what she is saying.
CATHERINE
What do you want, Nick?
Flowers?
I'll send you some flowers.
NICK
(after a beat)
What is this -- some kind of...
Joke?
(a beat; he almost
smiles)
Are we playing games again?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
The games are over.
You were right.
It was the fuck of the century,
Shooter.
He stares at her.
A VOICE INSIDE
Catherine?
Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.
Catherine still has her eyes on him.
CATHERINE
Right there.
A beat, and then she turns to go inside.
Hazel Dobkins smiles
slowly at him.
He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.
He is parked next to
Gus' Cadillac.
Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.
GUS
(excited)
Catherine Tramell's roommate her
freshman year.
I got a call from
her.
I've been calling people who
were in her dorm all day.
She
must've heard I was trying to talk
to her.
She says she knows all
about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.
She's over in Oakland.
You wanna
come with me?
Nick just stares ahead.
GUS
You look like you seen a ghost,
son?
Nick looks at him.
Gus gets out with Nick.
It is an old building.
GUS
Where the hell you goin'?
NICK
(after a beat)
I'm going with you.
GUS
She said alone -- suite 405.
It
ain't gonna take long.
A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.
Nick sits there, staring ahead.
NICK
(suddenly, screaming)
Gus!
He parks his car.
It is dark.
Foggy.
He starts heading inside.
