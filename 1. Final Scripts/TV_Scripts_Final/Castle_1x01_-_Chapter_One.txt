      CLOSE ON:

      A LANDSCAPE. Sand colored, stretching to a horizon of black. 
      Very serene. And then we see a bead of red, rolling like a 
      teardrop, and we realize this is no landscape. It s a body.

      A GLOVED HAND reaches into a ziplockbag and withdraws a 
      fistful of rose petals. The petals tumble slowly through 
      space, landing on naked skin.

    We follow the gloved hand as it picks up bloody clothing from 
    the floor and stuffs it into a plastic bag. Bag in hand, the 
      killer leaves the room. 

      We re left looking at the victim, a YOUNG WOMAN IN HER EARLY 
      TWENTIES, staring out at us with lifeless eyes. And we hear a 
      woman s voice whisper:

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (OVER)
                  Murder...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ROOFTOP, PUBLISHING PARTY - NIGHT

      This is not your Daddy s publishing party. Waiter dressed as 
      murder victims serve drinks, while hardcorehottiesmingle 
      with middle-aged men.

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (OVER)
                  Mystery... 

      A hush falls over the crowd. Around the room, GIANT PLACARDS 
      display the PHOTOGRAPH of a handsome, roguish man - NICK 
      CASTLE - and advertise his latest potboiler,  STORM S END.  

                                  WOMAN S VOICE (CONT D)
                  The macabre.

    The woman, standing at the podium in front of the crowd, is 
      GINA COWELL, 39 and holding. She s the President of Black 
      Pawn Publishing. 

                                  GINA
                  What is it about a dark and stormy 
                  night that sets our pulses racing? 
                  What is it about a hard-boiled 
                  detective, a femme fatale, and the 
                  cold steel of a gun that keeps our 
                  bedside lamps glowing until the wee 
                  hours of the morning?        Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     2.


      Waiting nearby is NICKCASTLE himself, late-thirties and a 
      rock star of the literary world. Dressed in jeans, leather, 
    and three days growth, he s the kind of trouble every woman 
      hopes to find. And a couple of them have, much to his delight. 

                                  BLONDE
                  Are you really NickCastle?

                                  CASTLE
                  Are you really a blonde?

    And somehow from Nick, it sounds charming. Back at the podium-

                                  GINA
                  However the spell is cast, tonight we

                  and celebrate the launch of  Storm s 
                  End,  the stunning conclusion to his 
                  best-selling DerrickStorm mystery 
                  series.

      Gina glancesover in time to witness this. A fleetingglimpse 
    of disapproval crossesher face.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  You know, on the way over here

                    DetectiveStorm and I have been 
                  together longer than both my marriages 
                  put together. And when I thought of it 
                  that way, it made me realize 
                  something.

      Gina and Castle stand for the photographers. Gina speaks 
      through her grittedsmile.

    The Photographer nodsthanks. Immediately, the smiles drop.

                                  GINA
                  Is that what you redoing? Punishing
                  me by killing the golden goose?

                                  CASTLE
                  I may be petty and short-sighted, but 
                  I mnot that petty and short-sighted.        Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     4.


                                  GINA
                  Then for godsakeswhy?

    As they move through crowd, people hand Castle books to sign.

                                  CASTLE
                  I told you, I was bored.

                  Well, they rewrong.

    But he says it a little too quickly.

                                  GINA
                  They better be, because Storm or no 
                  Storm, you restill under contract. 
                  And if I don t have a manuscript on my

                  of your advance.

                                  GINA
                  Try me, Cortez.Just try me.

    As Gina walks away, Castle calls after her...

                                  CASTLE
                  I already returned the advance. I 
                  spent it divorcingyou!

      Gina smiles at him and gives him a  Not my problem  shrug.

                  Unless you rea genuine psycho.

                                  BECKETT
                  Or trying to send a message.

      Something about the scene strikes Beckett. She stares
      intensely.

                  You okay?

                                  BECKETT

                  Familiar, how?

                                  LANIE
                  I think that s something we d all 
                  pretty much remember. Why?

                                  BECKETT

      MARTHA HEATH (60s), a classic broad in the Broadwaymold, 
      touches-upher over-done make-up. A former actress on the 
      Great White Way, Martha never made it nearly big as she 
      thinks she did.

                                  MARTHA
                  Come on, dollface.Lemmegive you a 
                  touch up.

                                  ALEXIS
                  No thanks, Gram.

      ALEXIS CASTLE, 15, sits at the bar in a party dress, studying 
      from a physicstext book. She s a natural beauty, the kind of 
    old soul more at home with adults than kids her own age.        Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     9.


                                  MARTHA
                  A word of advice, kiddo.When it comes 
                  to real life, galsneed makeupa 
                  helluvalot more than we need physics.

                                  ALEXIS
                  What if I become a physicist?

                                  MARTHA
                  Then not even makeupcan save you. 
                  Look, it s a party. Let s at least 
                  glossthose lips.

      Alexis relents, offering her lips to her grandmother.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Feels more like a funeral, the way 
                  he s been acting lately.

                                  MARTHA
                  He killed off his main character. 
                  Doesn t take Freudto see he s. 
                    workingthrough the five stages of 
                  grief. Anger, denial, booze, blondes, 
                  and rehab.Good news is he s up to 
                  blondes.

                                  ALEXIS
                  I venever seen him this way. He s 
                  always been able to write.

                                  MARTHA
                  That s debatable. Hot lead poured 
                  from the cold steel.  Let s face it, 
                  Shakespeareit ain t.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Gram, I mbeing serious. 

                                  MARTHA
                  Way too serious. Who does homeworkat 
                  a party? 

                                  ALEXIS
                  I have a test next week.

                                  MARTHA
                  So do I. Liver function. You don t see 
                  me studying. Speaking of which -

    She turns to the bartender.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     10.

                  Did you tell Gina I was having trouble 
                  writing?

                                  MARTHA
                  I told her nothing of the sort.
                          (offhis look)
                  I may have said you spend your days 
                  mopingaround the house in your 
                    underwearwaiting for post time at 
                  Belmont, but hey, you rean artist. 
                  It s expected, right?

                                  CASTLE
                  We had an agreement. I let you live 
                  with us and you don t talk about my 
                  work.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     11.


                                  MARTHA
                  What s there to talk about? You 
                  haven t done any since I moved in. 

                                  ALEXIS
                  Gram!

                                  MARTHA
                  Well, he hasn t.

                                  CASTLE
                  Whatever I have and haven t done, I d
                  appreciate it if you wouldn tshare it 
                  with my ex-wife.

                                  MARTHA
                  Oh, what s the harm? If you ask me, 
                  she s still in love with you.

                                  CASTLE
                  If by  love  you mean  hate , then 
                  yes, she is still very, verymuch in 
                  love with me.

                                  MARTHA
                  Right. So what s the big deal?

                                  CASTLE
                  You remissing the point...

      Martha holds up her hand.

                                  MARTHA
                  Hang on. I just got a hit on my Grey-
                  dar.

      She s locked in on a SILVER FOX (70s) across the room. 
      Country club looks, spray-on tan.As he liftshis glass of 
      champagne to his lips Martha scanshis fingers.

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)

                                  ALEXIS
                  For letting her move in? I think it s 
                  sweet.

                                  CASTLE
                  Won t be sweet when I strangleher in 
                  her sleep.

    The bartenderputs the two glasses of champagne on the bar. 
      Castle slides one of the champagne flutesdown to Alexis.

                                  ALEXIS
                  You do know I monly fifteen right?

      Castle shrugsit off.

                                  CASTLE
                  You rean old soul.

                                  ALEXIS

                                  CASTLE
                  You know, when I was your age...
                          (he stops himself)
                  Ah.Can t tell that one... Wildly
                    inappropriate. Which is, oddly, my 
                  point. Don t you want to have wildly
                  inappropriate stories that you can t 
                  tell your children?

                                  ALEXIS
                  I think you vegot enough of those for 
                  both of us.

                                  CASTLE
                  Life should be an adventure.
                          (beat)
                  You know why I killed off Derrick?
                  There were no more surprisesanymore.I 
                  knew exactly what was going to happen 
                  at every moment in every scene. It s

                  this party.  I myour biggest fan  
                   Where do you get your ideas?  

      Alexis smirks.

                  Most of my claims tend to be on the 
                  large side. 
                          (eyes Beckett)
                  What s this got to do with me?

                                  BECKETT
                  Fiskwas murdered in his office two 
                  weeks ago. I didn t put it together 
                  until I saw the Tisdalecrime scene 
                  tonight.

      Beckett slides him a photoof the Tisdalecrime scene. The 
      rosesand sunflowercovered body. 

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  This is how we found her.

      Castle leansforward, and recognizes the scene.

                  Flowers for Your Grave.

      Beckett slides another photoof Martin Fisklying face down 
    in a pentagram.

                  This is how we found Martin Fisk.
                  Right out of Hell HathNo Fury.

      Castle looks up at Beckett, his tone serious.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     16.

                  Looks like I have a fan.

                                  BECKETT
                  A really derangedfan.

                                  CASTLE

                  Y know, Patterson, Grafton, King. I 
                  can t tell you how jealous these would

                                  BECKETT
                  Jealous?

                                  BECKETT
                  People are dead,Mr.Castle. Doesn t 
                  that mean anything to you?

                                  CASTLE
                  I mnot asking for the bodies. Just 
                  the pictures.

                                  BECKETT
                  Doesn t it bother you that these 
                  people were killed because of you?

                                  CASTLE
                  They weren t killed because of me,

                                  BECKETT
                  I think we redone here.

      Beckett heads out of the room. Castle watches her go, a 
      little bit pleased he s gottenunder her skin. We hear the 
      flourish of a piano, accompanied by the strains, and I do 
      mean strains, of a woman singing...

                                  MARTHA (V.O.)
                  It ain'tso much a question of not 
                  knowing what to do.

      INT. CASTLE S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Castle enters his Penthouseapartment. From the living room 
    he hearsthe sound of his mother beltingout  I Can t Say No  
      from Oklahoma!(As we move through Castle s Penthouse, we ll
      notice that it is the home of someone who has a lot of money. 
      Central Park West. Park View. Art. GourmetKitchen. etc.)      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     18.


                                  MARTHA (O.S.)
                    I knowedwhut'sright and wrong since

                  and I reckon they are true/
                  About how girls'reput upon by men.

      Castle checks his watch (12:45am) and shakeshis head.

    IN THE LIVING ROOM

      MARTHA is center room, dressed in a leotardand tights, 
      performing like she s center stage at the Winter Garden. 

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                  I know I mustn'tfall into the pit/

    At the piano is the SILVER HAIREDFOX ticklingthe ivories 
    and drinking a Martini.As Castle crossesthe living room, 
      Martha notices him.

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                  Hey dollface.Just showing Burthere 
                  how we did it at the Palace.

                                  CASTLE
                  Does he know it s your theme song?  

    She makes a face at him, and then...

                                  MARTHA
                  Five. Six. Seven. Eight...  I always

      Castle heads down the hallway.

      INT. CASTLE S KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Martha can be heard faintlyin the background as Castle 
      enters and crossesto the fridge.As he grabsa can of 
      WHIPPEDCREAM, he notices Alexis at the kitchen table doing 
      homework.

                                  CASTLE
                  You remissing the late show.

                                  ALEXIS
                  I saw it in previews.

    He shakesthe whippedcream can and spraysa moundof it into 
      directly into his mouth.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     19.


                                  CASTLE
                  Looks like we vegot a new lead.

                  you.

                                  ALEXIS
                  So you wannatell me, or do I have to 
                  read it on the fan sites?

                  pornyou want. Just stay away from the 
                  fan sites. 

                                  ALEXIS
                  Seriously, Dad. Are you in some kind 
                  of trouble?

                                  CASTLE
                  Despite my best efforts, no. They want 
                  my help on a case... 

    He holds the whippedcream above her mouth, offering.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Baby bird?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Already brushed.

                                  CASTLE
                  Your loss.

    He gives himself another squirt.

                                  ALEXIS
                  What s the case?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     20.


                                  CASTLE
                  Apparently, someone s been killing 
                  people the way I do in my books. 

                                  ALEXIS
                  Oh god. That s horrible.

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.

                                  ALEXIS
                  How many?

                                  CASTLE
                  Two so far.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Are you okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.It s just so senseless.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Murder usually is.

                                  CASTLE
                  No. Murder usually makes a great deal 
                  of sense. Passion, greed, politics. 
                  What s senseless here are the stories 
                  the killerchose.

    And we see Castle is bothered.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Flower For your Grave? Hell HathNo 
                  Fury?My truly lesser works. Why would 
                    a psychoticfan pick those?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Maybe because he s psychotic.

      Castle isn t sure. Alexis takes the can of whippedcream from 
    her father.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                    Now, come on. It s bed time.

      INT. ALEXIS  BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Castle tucksAlexis into bed.

                                  ALEXIS
                  She s coming into town next month. She 
                  wants to take me shopping. That okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  What? And miss that awesomelyawkward 
                  experience of being the creepymiddle- 
                  age man loiteringoutside the dressing 
                  room of JuicyJeans?MethinksI lllive.

      Castle gives her a kiss on the foreheadand heads toward the 
      door.

                                  ALEXIS
                  You think it was a mistake, don t you?

                                  CASTLE
                  What?

                                  ALEXIS
                  Killing off Derrick.

      Castle stands in the dark. He doesn t respond.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                  That s why you can t write, isn t it? 
                  You think you renever going to find 
                  another character that good again. 

      Again, Castle doesn t reply, but we see she s struck a chord.

                                  ALEXIS (CONT D)
                  You will, Dad. I know you will. You 
                  just need something to inspireyou.

                                  CASTLE
                  Goodnight.

      INT. HALLWAY -NIGHT

      Heading to his bedroom, Castle passes by a doorway. He stops. 
      Staresin. An empty chair is visible in the glow of a 
      monitor.

      A window is open on the computer screen. A document, blank 
      except for  CHAPTER ONE.  Castle takes a step, but can t 
      bring himself to enter the room. Disappointed, he turns and 
      heads back down the hall.

                  It s all odd.

                  How about death threats?

      INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      Beckett comes in with UNIFORMScarrying the bags of mail. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Set these up in interrogation three. 
                  We hear from the lab?

      Esposito looks up from his desk.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     23.

                  Any connection between Fiskand 
                  Tisdale?

                  Other than your boy there, no.

      Esposito nodsacross the bullpen. Beckett sees Castle across 
    the way, talking with CAPTAIN ROYMONTGOMERY -- African-
      American, mid-fifties -- Beckett s gruffbut paternalboss.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s he doing here?

                                  ESPOSITO
                  Maybe he likes you.

                  It s the least I can do for the city I

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Given the circumstances, I think it s 
                  a good idea.

                                  BECKETT

      INT. POLICE STATION, BULLPEN - DAY

      Beckett comes out and sees a smiling Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s so funny?

                                  CASTLE
                  You got your asschewed.

                                  BECKETT
                  Hardly.

                                  CASTLE
                  I read lips.

      Beckett heads to interrogation. Castle follows -

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      - trying to keep up.

                                  CASTLE
                  Look, why don t we just start over.

                                  BECKETT
                  What s the point?       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     25.


                                  CASTLE
                  I think we got off on the wrong foot. 
                  I came off as a...

                                  BECKETT
                  A callous self-centered jackhole?

                                  CASTLE
                  Something like that.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, aren t you?
                            (offCastle s look)
                  Yeah.So why start over?

      Beckett pushesthrough a door into... 

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      UNIFORMSare dumping the contents of the bags onto a large 
      table. Beckett grabssome evidence glovesand pullsthem on.

                                  BECKETT
                  Okay, people. I want two piles--
                  Ordinary fan mail here, and anything

                    Alrightpeople. Let s go.

    The UNIFORMSbegin tearingin. Castle pullson his own pair 
    of evidence glovesand takes a seat by Beckett.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - HOURS LATER

    We pan over stacks of letters. Envelopes litterthe floor.  
      Dead coffee cupsscattered across the table.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     26.


    But everyone is still at it.  Beckett looks up and catches 
      Castle looking at her.

                                  BECKETT
                  What?

                                  CASTLE
                  Nothing. It s just, the way your brow
                  furrowswhen you rethinking. It s 
                  cute.

                  Then it dbe deadly, but otherwise -

                                  BECKETT
                  Can I ask you a question? 

                                  CASTLE
                  Shoot.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why are you here? You don t care about 
                  the victims, so you aren t here for 
                  justice. You don t care it s your 
                  books, so you aren t here for outrage. 
                  So what? Are you here just to annoy
                  me?

      A beat as he considers her question.

                                  CASTLE
                  I mhere for the story. 

                                  BECKETT
                  The story?

                                  CASTLE
                  Why thosepeople? Why thosemurders? 
                  Why my books?

                                  BECKETT
                  Sometimes there is no story. Sometimes 
                  the guy s just a psychopath.

                                  CASTLE
                  There s always a story, always a chain 
                  of events that makes everything make 
                  sense. Take you for example... Under 
                  normal circumstances, you shouldn t be 
                  here. Smart, good looking women become 
                  lawyers, not cops.And yet here you 
                  are. Why?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     27.


                                  BECKETT
                  You rethe novelist. You tell me.

                                  CASTLE
                  You renot bridge and tunnel, no trace 
                  of the burroughswhen you talk. That 
                  means Manhattanand that means money. 
                  Odds are you went to college, probably 
                  a good one. You had options, lots of 
                  options, better options, more socially 
                  acceptable options. And yet you chose 
                  this. That tells me something must 
                  have happened. Not to you - you re
                  wounded but not that wounded. It was 
                  someone you cared about. Someone you 
                  loved. And you could veprobably lived 
                  with that, except the person 
                  responsible was never caught. And 
                  that, DetectiveBeckett, is why you re
                  here.

    He can see by the look on his face that he s right.

                                  BECKETT
                  Cutetrick. But don t think that means 
                  you know me.

                                  CASTLE
                  Point is, Detective, there s always a 
                  story. You just have to find it. 

      Beckett looks down at the letter in her hand. Scrawledon it 
    are very disturbing childishpictures of murders, including 
    the rose petalmurder, the pentagrammurder.

                                  BECKETT
                  I think I just did.

                  This time of year, no one uses it 
                  much. We were gonnadrain it at the 
                  end of the week.

                                  BECKETT
                  When were you up here last?

                                    MAINTENANCE MAN

                  No. Of course.

      Beckett starts to follow, but sees Castle hovering over Lanie 
    as she examines the body. She sighs.

                                  BECKETT
                  Anybody have a leash?

    ON LANIE - examining the body. Castle leansin close behind 
      her, startlingher.

                  I told you to wait over there.

                                  CASTLE
                  I got lonely.

    She turns to Lanie.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have a C.O.D?

                                  LANIE
                  Not until the full exam.But I don t 
                  think she was stabbed.

                                  BECKETT
                  She s got a knife stickingout of her 
                  back.

      Castle jumpsin.

                                  CASTLE
                  Lack of blood around the wound suggests 
                  she was dead before it was inserted. 
                  And there s no foamaround the mouth, 
                  so we know she didn t drown.

                  Mr.Castle. Can I have a word?

      Beckett pullshim aside. Castle flasheshis innocent eyes.

                                  CASTLE
                  Something wrong?

                                  CASTLE
                  What about motive? 

      Beckett s phone rings.

                                  BECKETT
                  He s a serial killers. He doesn t need 
                  motive.
                          (answering)
                  Beckett... Yeah.You have an address? 
                  Yeah... Got it. Thanks.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

      Beckett s car pullsup followed by SQUAD CARS.

      INT. CAR - DAY

      Beckett unholstersher gun and turns to Castle, vaguely
      threatening.

                                  BECKETT
                  Stay here.

                  Scout shonor.

    And Beckett is out of the car, moving with the cops.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Copswith weapons drawn flank a door. Beckett knocks.

                                  BECKETT
                    KyleFogerty!NYPD!Open up!

    No answer. Beckett steps aside and two officers slama ram 
      into the door. It burstsopen. Beckett s the first through, 
      weapon at the ready.       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     34.


      Moving through the apartment, the copsbreak off into 
      different rooms, yelling  Clear  as they clear the rooms. We 
      follow Beckett up the front hall and into the living room. No 
      one s there. Beckett turns to see a BOOKCASE.

      It s filled with NickCastle books, and only NickCastle 
      books. Most are dog-earredfrom mutiplereads. She pullson 
      glovesand takes one off the shelf.The pages are highlighted
    and notes are written in the margin.

      INT. BEDROOM - DAY

    The copopens a closet.Inside is a psychomuralcollageof 
      NickCastle photos and crude childishdrawings just like the 
      letter Beckett found. It s a veritibleshrine.

                                  CASTLE
                  Well that s creepy.

      Beckett turns around to see Castle right behind her.

                                  BECKETT
                  You promised you dstay.

                                  CASTLE

                  Detective.

      Another coppullsa garbage bag out from under the bed. 
      Sticks his glovedhand in and pullsout bloody clothing. We 
      recognize it from the Tisdalemurder.Beckett checks the 
      blouse, two bullet holes in it.

    And then the coppullsout a gun. Beckett looks grim.

      With Castle, Beckett and Montgomery. 

                                  BECKETT
                  State medical records say he s got 
                  pervasive developmentaldisorder.

                                  CASTLE
                  That explains his fixation.PDD

                  with a single subject.

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                  OK, let s get him a P.D.and send it 
                  up to the D.A.

                                  CASTLE
                  What? That s it? 

                                  ESPOSITO
                  We got the guy, Chief. What more do

                                  CASTLE
                  That s the problem. It s too easy. The 
                  reader would never buy it.

                                  BECKETT
                  This isn t one of your books, Castle. 
                  We think what the evidence tells us to 
                  think. Out here, we find a guy 
                  standing over a body with a gun, he s 
                  the guy who did it.

      They continue up the hall, leaving Castle a little stunned.

      INT. PENTHOUSE, POKERLOUNGE- NIGHT

                  The copsare able to track him down, 
                  and in the apartment is all the 
                  evidence they need for a conviction.

                                  SUE GRAFTON
                  OK.Then what happens?

                                  CASTLE
                  That s it. 

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  That s it?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah.They arrest him.

      A beat. The other writers look at each other. And then laugh.

                                    JAMESPATTERSON
                  Jesus, that s terrible. No wonder 
                    you reblocked. 

                                  SUE GRAFTON
                  Guy doesn t leave prints at the scene, 
                  but sendsa letter with prints? Right 
                  there, you lost me. 

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  Yeah, I mean where s the twist?

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah, there s gottabe a twist. Like 
                  maybe this kidwas set-up.

                                  STEPHEN KING
                  That s what your story needs - the 
                  character that thinks the kid s
                  innocent and keeps digginguntil he 
                  finds the truth.

      A funny look crossesCastle s face. He smiles.

                                  CASTLE
                  I know just the guy.

      Castle layshis cards down on the table. The others groanas 
    he takes the pot.

      INT. POLICE STATION, DETECTIVE SBULLPEN - DAY

      Beckett enters to find Castle sitting at her desk, reading 
      through her papers. 

                                  BECKETT
                  What are you doing?

      Beckett snatchesthe papers from his hand and slipsthem back 
      into their file.

                                  CASTLE

                  medicine cabinets, reading other 
                  people s mail. 

                                  BECKETT
                  My files are confidential. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Worse than that. They reboring.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why are you here?

                                  CASTLE
                  I just came down here to give you 
                  this. A little something to 
                    memorializeour brief partnership.

      From his bag, he hands her a gift-wrappedbox.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Don t look so suspicious. Go on. Open 
                  it.

    She does. It s a copy of Storm s End. He opens it up to the 
      first page.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Look. I even signed it for you. Not 
                  that I think you rea fan. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Thank you. That s actually kind of 
                  sweet.

    He catches her with his eye and turns on the sexy.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     40.


                                  CASTLE
                  Well...

                                  BECKETT
                  Well.

                                  CASTLE
                  Nice to have met you, Detective
                  Beckett.

    He leansin and gives her a kiss on the cheek, and walks 
      away. 

    As she watches him go her face betraya little emotion. She s 
      a little bit smitten.She sinksdown in her chair, takes a 
      moment and then turns back to her desk. She shufflesher 
      files a beat and then...

      Wait. Something s missing. She sorts through her papers a 
      little panicked.

                                  BECKETT
                  He didn t.

    She looks through them again and her eyes narrow.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  He did!

    She springs up.

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                    CASTLE!

      INT. RECEPTION - DAY

      Castle hearsBeckett calling. He burstsout the door...

      EXT. PRECINCT - DAY

    And boundsdown the steps, his arm waving.

                                  CASTLE
                  TAXI!

      BECKETT burstsout the front door to see Castle disappearing
      into the rear of a yellow cab. Beckett seethes.

      INT. CAB - DAY

      Castle looks back at her on the steps of the precinct and 
      smiles a little grin. He reaches into his bag, pullsout the 
      case files and starts to read.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     41.


      EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

      Stone lions stand guard on either side of the statelysteps.

      INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

      Castle sits in the corner of the long READING HALL with the 
      case files spread out in front of him. He picksthrough the 
      arrest reports, jotssome notes, and examines crime scene 
      photographs with a magnifyingglass.

      JEANHILLPEPPER, a LIBRARIANin her late 50s, places a stack 
    of books on the table next to him. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Thanks, Jean.

    The two of them go back a long way.

                                  HILLPEPPER
                  Just glad to see you back. I was 
                  worried you dstopped writing.

                                  CASTLE
                  Never.

    At the far end of the READING HALL, Beckett enters with two 
      uniforms.She crossesto Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  You rea conniving, scheming, 
                  despicableliar.

                                  CASTLE
                  You say that like it s my fault.

                                  BECKETT
                  Of course it s your fault. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Would you have showed me the files if 
                  I dasked?

                                  BECKETT
                  No.

                                  CASTLE
                  So you admit you left me no choice.

      Beckett shakesher head, exasperated.

                                  BECKETT
                  Cuffhim...       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     42.


      Castle seems non-plussedas the uniformsbegin to cuffhim.

                                  CASTLE
                    Mmm.Bondage.What s my safe word?

                                  BECKETT
                  NicholasCastle, you reunder arrest 
                  on charges of felonytheft and 
                  obstructionof justice.

                                  CASTLE
                  You forgot  Making you look bad. 

                                  BECKETT
                  Y know, for a minute there you made me 
                  think you were human.

                                  CASTLE
                  How dyou find me anyway?

                                  BECKETT
                  I ma detective.It s what I do.

                                  CASTLE
                  My mother told you, didn t she?

                                  BECKETT
                          (to the cops)
                  No need to be gentle.

      Beckett begins packing upsthe files, starting with the photo
    of a flower covered AlisonTisdale.

                                  CASTLE
                  By the way, the rose petalsin the 
                    Tisdalemurder?  They regrandiflora, 
                  not hybridteas.

                                  BECKETT
                  I llmake a note of it. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Yeah, you probably should. Because it 
                  means that KyleFogertyis innocent.

      INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - DAY

      Beckett drives. Castle s in the back seat in cuffs.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     43.


                                  CASTLE
                  The kind of rose petalmight not be 
                  important to you or to the murderer, 
                  but to a PDDwith an obsessive 
                  fixationit would vebeen impossible 
                  notto get the details right. 

                                  BECKETT
                  So he was sloppy.

                                  CASTLE
                  An obsessive s incapable of being 
                  sloppyabout their obsession. The 
                  release comes from getting the details 
                  absolutely right.

      Castle leansforward.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  If you ask me, these killing are the 
                  work of a second rate mind.

                                  BECKETT
                  No one asked you.

                                  CASTLE
                  The M.E.report says Fiskwas 
                  strangledwith a neck-tie, not 
                  suffocatedby a plastic bag like in 
                  the story. And we both know Kendra s
                  dress was green, not blue like it was 
                  in the story.

                                  BECKETT
                  And the evidence all over his 
                  apartment? His knowledge of all three 
                  victims? I suppose you have a theory 
                  about that. 

                                  CASTLE
                  I said he didn t do it. I didn t say 
                  he wasn t framed.

                                  BECKETT
                  And I suppose Elvisis still alive, 
                  and the CIAkilled JFK.

                                  CASTLE

                  Well, I wish I could say I was 
                  surprised. It s my fault really. He 
                  never had a father figure.

                                  CASTLE
                  That s not true, Mother. I had lotsof 
                  father figures. I see you vemet

                  Yeah.We understand each other.
                  But tell me something, Captain. When 
                  did pursuing the truth become a bad 
                  thing?

      Castle shootsBeckett a disapprovinglook. She shrinksfrom

      EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      Beckett watches the three of them get into a town car. Castle

                  get away with murder, someone who knew 
                  enough about KyleFogerty sfixation
                  with me to use it to cover his tracks.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You resupposed to drop the case.

                                  CASTLE
                  But it s just starting to make sense! 
                  The killerhad to have known bothhis 
                  intended victim andKyleFogerty.But 
                  the only victim that had any real 
                  knowledge of Fogerty scondition was 
                  AlisonTisdale.I think that s how he 
                  found out about Fogerty.I think 
                  Alisontold him.
                          (intophone)
                  No. In Manhattan.

      There s a gleein Castle s voice. He s enjoyinghimself.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  I think Alisonwas the killer starget 
                  all along.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     46.


                                  ALEXIS
                  What about the other victims?

                                  CASTLE
                  Red herringsto throw off the cops.
                  Even if our guy pinsAlison smurder 
                  on Fogerty, the copsare gonnawant 
                  motive. It s not open and shut. So 
                  instead of offingjust Alison, he 
                  targets people that can be linked back 
                  to his patsy.No one looks for motive, 
                  because mentally unstableserial 
                  killers don t have motive. 
                          (intophone)
                  Yes? Thanks...

    He jotsdown a number.

                  It s no use, kid.Might as well enjoy 
                  the ride.

      Castle hangsup the phone and dialsthe number.

                                  CASTLE
                  But our guy had motive. He wanted 
                    AlisonTisdaledead. I just need to 
                  find out why.

                                  ALEXIS
                  Dad, if I have to keep bailingyou 
                  out, I mgonnato seriously need you 
                  to raise my allowance.

                  You need to raise it by a lot.

                                  GINA
                  Why aren t you writing?

      INTERCUT: Castle crossing the building s ATRIUM.

                                  GINA
                  Because you answered the phone. Now 
                  when am I going to see some pages?

                                  CASTLE

                  You reright. I msorry. That was 
                  childish.

    And with that, Castle just hangsup the phone. He arrives at 
    the RECEPTION desk where a pretty YOUNG WOMAN waits.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Hi. NickCastle. I have an appointment 
                  with Mr.Tisdale.

    The receptionistchecks her list. Finds Castle s name.

                                  RECEPTION
                  Go on up, sir. He s expecting you.

                                  BECKETT (O.S.)
                  Is he now?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     48.


      Castle turns to see Beckett walking toward him.

                                  CASTLE
                  This isn t what it looks like. 
                          (offher look)
                  Okay. It s exactly what it looks like. 
                  But I can explain.

      Beckett sighs. She heads toward an open elevator and gets in.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, are you coming?

      Castle looks around, confused, and then follows her into the 
      elevator. The doors close behind them.

      INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

      Beat. Castle looks at Beckett who stares straight ahead.

                                  CASTLE
                  Aren t you going to arrest me?

                                  BECKETT
                  I haven t decided yet.

                                  CASTLE
                  Great. What are you doing here anyway? 
                  I thought the case was closed.

                                  BECKETT
                  It is.

    The doors open, Beckett steps out into...

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

                                  CASTLE
                  Oh I get it.
                          (cracksa grin)
                  You think I mright, don t you?

                                  BECKETT
                  You know the difference between 
                  playing a copand being a cop, Nick?
                  It s important to you to be right. 
                  Whereas we can t afford to be wrong.

    She lets that hang a beat, then...

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  So while you spent the morning, doing 
                  what? Playing Guitar Hero and drinking 
                  Bloody Marys?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     49.


    He half nods, she s not so far off. 

                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  Yeah, I was re-interviewingwitnesses, 
                  victim s friends, families, co-
                  workers.Y know, copstuff.

    She rings the doorbell.

                                  CASTLE
                  What dyou learn?

                                  BECKETT
                  Nothing to make me change my mind.

                                  CASTLE
                  Yet.

      JONATHANTISDALE answers the door. He s a gauntman in his 
      late sixties. The last few days haven t been kind to him.

      INT. TISDALE APARTMENT LIBRARY - DAY

      Wood paneling, somber, with a God s eye view of the world. 
      Tisdale, with sad and sunken eyes, holds a picture of Alison.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  It s against the natural order for a 
                  man to outlivehis own child.

                                  BECKETT
                  Did Alisonever mention having enemies 
                  or being threatened?

        Tisdaleshakeshis head.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  People loved her. All she wanted was 
                  to make the world a better place and 
                  this is how she s repaid.
                          (beat)
                  I told all this to the other 
                  detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  We rejust following up.

                                  CASTLE
                  Do you know of anybody who would ve
                  profitedfrom Alison sdeath?

                                    JONATHANTISDALE

                  What little she had went to charity.
                          (toBeckett)
                  What s this all about? I thought the 
                  killerwas in custody?

                                  BECKETT
                  He is, Mr.Tisdale.Thank you for your 
                  time. We resorry to have bothered 
                  you.

      Beckett rises to go, but Castle holds his ground.

                                  CASTLE
                  Mr.Tisdale, Fortune Magazine 
                  estimates your net worth at nearly a 
                  quarter of a billion dollars. Is that 
                  true?

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  I don t keep track day to day.

                                  CASTLE
                  But it s in the ballpark.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  I vebeen lucky, yes.

                                  CASTLE
                  Out of curiosity, what happens to all 
                  that money if something happened to 
                  you?

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle...

      Castleshootsher a look - Just go with this.

                                    JONATHANTISDALE
                  Half my estate goes to my charitable 
                  foundation. The rest goes to my 
                  children...
                          (painful pause)
                  I mean my son. Why?

                                  CASTLE
                  Just curious. Thank you for your time.

    But Beckett knows this means something to Castle.

      EXT. BUILDING - DAY

      Castle and Beckett emerge.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     51.


                                  BECKETT
                  What was that about?

                                  CASTLE
                  He s dying.

                                  BECKETT
                  Who s dying? Tisdale?

      Down the street is a Sabrettsvendor.

                                  CASTLE
                  You want a hot dog? I want a hot dog.

      Castle crossesto the hot dog stand. Beckett catches up.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Two please.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle...

                                  CASTLE
                  A Buddhistwalks up to a hot dog 
                  vendor. Vendor says  What can I get 
                  you, pal?  The Buddhistsays Make me 
                  one with everything.

    She looks at him. What the hell are you talking about.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  The guy says that llbe two fifty. The 
                  Buddhisthands him a five and asks for 
                  change. The guy just smiles and says 
                   Change comes from within. 

      With unbelievable speed, she grabshis nose between her thumb
    and forefinger.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  OWOWOW.What are you doing?

                                  BECKETT
                  Getting your attention. Now that I 
                  have it, what makes you think he s 
                  dying?

                                  CASTLE
                  Okayokayokay.

      Beckett looks over at the hot dog vendor.

                                  BECKETT
                  No onionson mine. I mnot a Buddhist.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     52.


    She releases Castle. He rubshis nose. 

                                  CASTLE
                  Okay.First clue - the pictures on the 
                  wall. He s thinnernow. Sick thin, not 
                  workoutthin.

                                  BECKETT
                  His daughter was just murdered...

                                  CASTLE
                  Second clue - the way he touched his 
                  hair. Like he was self-conscious. 

                                  BECKETT
                  You think it was a piece?

                                  CASTLE
                  A good one, but it s new for him. The 
                    chemo srelatively recent.

                                  BECKETT
                  So he s fighting cancer. That doesn t 
                  make him terminal.

                                  CASTLE
                  It s a much better story if he is. You 
                  interview the brother?

                                  BECKETT
                  There was never a reason to.

                                  CASTLE
                  Well, now there is.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Yeah.Hey Mitch!Why aren t these 
                  palletson the truck?       Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     53.


                                  BECKETT
                    DetectiveBeckett. NickCastle. We d 
                  like to ask you some questions about 
                  your sister.

      INT. HARRISONTISDALE SOFFICE - DAY

      Strictly functional. Papers piledon desks. White board 
      calendarswith routinginfoon them.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Last time I saw her? About a month ago 
                  at Dad s.

                                  BECKETT
                  Were you two close?

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Not really. Honestly, we didn t have 
                  much in common, aside from our last 
                  name. She always wanted to see the 
                  best in everyone...

                                  CASTLE
                  And you live in the real world.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  That s right. Like that guy who killed 
                  her. She did everything to help him. 
                  Even brought him here and begged me to 
                  give him a job.

                                  BECKETT
                  But you didn t.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  This is a business, not a charity. My 
                  employees mess up, I lose my bond. 
                          (hesoftens)
                  I don t know... Maybe if I had helped 
                  him, things would be different. Maybe 
                  she d still be alive. Or then again, 
                  maybe we d both be dead.

                                  BECKETT
                  How did your sister react when your 
                  Dad informed you he was dying?

      Beat. We see Harrison ssurprised they know but he covers.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  She was upset. We both were.

      Beckett and Castle share a look. Confirmation.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     54.


                                      HARRISONTISDALE(CONT D)
                  What does that have to do with her 
                  murder?

                                  BECKETT
                  We did a little digging.Your business 
                  is struggling. Your tens of millions 
                  in debt. With her out of the way, your 
                    inheritencestands to double.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Is this some kind of joke? You already 
                  caught the killer.

                                  BECKETT
                  Yeah, and the first thing his 
                  lawyers lldo is shift suspicion to 
                  someone else, someone with motive. And 
                  then they llput me on the stand and 
                  ask me why I didn t investigate. Then 
                  the jury s gonnahave doubts. You want 
                  justice for your sister, right?

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Of course.

                                  BECKETT
                  Then you won t mind telling us where 
                  you were the night of her murder.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  I was travelingon business.

      Harrisonopens his desk drawer and pullsout a passport. He 
      hands it to Beckett.

                                      HARRISONTISDALE(CONT D)
                  Check the stamps and you llfind I was 
                  out of the country for all three 
                  murders.

                                  BECKETT
                  And a total lie.

      Castle looks at her, surprised.

                                  CASTLE
                  What happened to  We think what the 
                  evidence tells us to think? 

                                  BECKETT
                  I get him knowing exactly when his 
                  sister was killed, but the other two 
                  victims? He didn t pause. He didn t 
                  ask what the dates were. He didn t 
                  even look at his calendar and he was 
                  still ready with an alibi.In my 
                  experience, innocent people don t 
                  prepare alibis.

                                  CASTLE
                  So what now?

                                  BECKETT
                  I llcall passport control and check 
                  their logs. See if those stamps were 
                  forged.

                                  CASTLE
                  That s not how he would vedone it.
                  It dbe too easy to get caught.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have a better theory?

                                  CASTLE
                  Second passport. Black market. Leaves 
                  the country on his own. Comes back on 
                  the other, commitsthe murder, flies 
                  back, and then returns home on his 
                  own. Airtightalibi.Perfect murder.

                                  BECKETT
                  And almost impossible to prove.

                                  CASTLE
                  Unless you find the passport.

                                  BECKETT
                  If it even exists. If we reeven 
                  right.

                                  CASTLE
                  Oh, come on. We were having fun. Don t 
                  go all skepticalon me now.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     56.


                                  BECKETT
                  Here s a fun fact. Judges don t grant 
                  search warrants based on conjecture.
                  We need evidence.

                                  CASTLE
                  That shouldn t be much of a problem 
                  for the youngest woman ever to make 
                  detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  You just better be right.

                  That was the Parishotel Tisdalestayed 
                  the night of his sister s murder. 
                  Housekeeping remembered him because his

                                  BECKETT
                  I got the same story from the hotel in

      INT. HARRISONTISDALE SAPARTMENT - DAY

      Harrison crosses to his desk and sits down at his computer. 
    He clicks open a file - photographs of KYLE FOGERTYand the 
      victims. He highlights them and clicks delete. As he s doing 
      that, he opens a locked drawer and pulls out a manila 
      envelope. Inside it is a thick file folder. Scrawled on it 
    tab in sharpie -  KYLE FOGERTY . Below that, on the line 
      marked CASEWORKER, it reads  Alison Tisdale. 

      INT. NEW YORK SUPERIOR COURT - DAY

      CASTLE sits on a bench outside the Judges  chambers, waiting. 
      Across the way from him, sitting on a bench is a young boy 
    and his mother. The mother is buried in a magazine.

      Castle locks eyes with the boy. He makes a funny face. Beat. 
    The boy makes a funny face back. Castle makes an even funnier 
      face. The boy, not to be outdone, uses his hand to spread his 
      mouth wide, and sticks out his tongue. Castle, getting 
      competitive, pulls his lips up and his eyelids down. 

      BECKETT grabs CASTLE by the hand and yanks him off the bench.

                                  BECKETT
                  You re like a child.

                                  CASTLE
                  Did you get it?

      Beckett nods to the paper in her hand.

      INT. HARRISON TISDALE SAPARTMENT - DAY

      Harrison is shredding the Fogertyfiles in his home shredder. 
    He tries to feed too many sheets in, and the shredder jams. 
    He switches his shredder between forward and reverse, trying 
    to get the papers to shred.

      EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

      Beckett s car pulls to a stop around the corner from 
      Tisdale sapartment building. Two SQUAD CARS pull up behind 
      her. Beckett gets out of the car, followed by Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, do me a favor and grab the 
                  warrant from the glove compartment.

      Castle reaches back into the car and pulls out the warrant. 
    As he does, Beckett grabs his wrist and HANDCUFFS him to the 
      grab handle above the car door. She smiles.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     59.


                                  BECKETT (CONT D)
                  This time you re staying put.

      Beckett snatches the warrant and heads up the sidewalk.

                                  CASTLE
                  OK.Very funny. C monKate!Joke s 
                  over! Kate!

    She rounds the corner and is gone. Castle looks at his cuffed
      hand, and then slides his other hand into his pocket and 
      pullsout his wallet.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Cuffme once, shameon you. Cuffme 
                  twice...

    He opens his wallet, fishesinside. Pullsout a HANDCUFFKEY.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  ... Shameon me.

    But the key slipsand with one hand cuffedhe can t catch it. 
    It hits the ground. He goes to pick it up, but because he s 
      cuffedhis hand can t reach the ground.

      open. Evidence spillingeverywhere. Harrison sees Castle 
      racing toward him and Beckett descendingfrom the fire

                  Castle, stop!

                                  CASTLE
                  I got  em!I got  em.

      Castle s still holding his shoe as he runs. He finally tosses
    it aside. Beckett swearsunder her breath as she finally gets 
    to the bottom of the fire escape. She drops down to the 
      pavementin time to see Harrisonand Castle disappear around 
    the corner. She chasesafter them both, gun drawn.

    She ROUNDS THE CORNER to find Harrisonusing CASTLE as a 
      shield, holding a gun to his temple. Castle s a tadsheepish.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                  Whoops.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Stay back!

      Harrisonbacks away, pulling Castle with him.

                                  BECKETT
                  Don t be stupid. There s nowhere to go.

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  I said stay back.

    But Beckett keeps her gun trained on him. Harrisonpulls
      Castle around the corner, heading for a subway entrance.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, you okay?

                                  CASTLE
                  Fine. Except psychohere needs a 
                  breath mint.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     62.


                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  Shut up.

                                  CASTLE
                  No, you shut up.

                                  HARRISON TISDALE
                  I llblow your head off.

                                  BECKETT
                  Castle, you renot helping.

      They reach the subway entrance, HarrisonpullsCastle down 
    the steps, keeping him as a shield. Beckett follows. Some 
      UNIFORMShave joined her.

      BUZZZ.The gate opens and HarrisonpullsCastle through.

                                  CASTLE
                  But I guess the money was worth it.

                                  HARRISON TISDALE

                  didn t deserve it.

                  And you needed it, didn t you? And then 
                  she introduced you to Kyle, the perfect

      A train screamsinto the station.

                                  BECKETT
                  It s over, Harrison.Let him go!

                                    HARRISONTISDALE
                  It s not over. Now drop your guns or I 
                  blow his brains out.

                  For chrissake.How cliche can you get?

    And with that, Castle puncheshis elbowinto Harrison snose, 
    and snapshis gun away. Harrisonslumpsagainst the subway 
      train, his nose eruptingin blood. Uniformsswarmhim. 
      Beckett storms up to Castle.

                                  BECKETT
                  What the hell were you thinking? You 
                    could vegottenyourself killed.

                                  CASTLE
                  I don t think so.
                          (handsher the gun)
                  Safety was on the entire time.

                                  BECKETT
                  Why didn t you tell me?

                                  CASTLE
                  I wanted to hear him confess.

      LATER : Castle ties his shoe as the UNIFORMShaul away 
        Harrison.Beckett crossesto him.

                                  BECKETT
                  Well, I guess this is it.

                                  CASTLE
                  It doesn t have to be. How about a 
                  dinner? We can debriefeach other.

                                  BECKETT
                  What? So I can be just another one of 
                  your conquests?

                                  CASTLE
                  Maybe I could be one of yours.

                                  BECKETT
                  It was nice meeting you, Nick.

                                  CASTLE
                  Too bad. It would vebeen great.      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     64.


    She leansin and whispersin his ear.

                                  BECKETT
                  You have no idea how great.

      Smiling, she turns and walks away. Castle watches her go. 
      there sa look on his face... something... He smiles.

      around her shoulder to reveal inside the case file is a copy 
    of STORM S END. She s on the last chapter and diggingit.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Beckett. My office. Now!

      Startled, she closes the file.

      INT. MONTGOMERY S OFFICE - DAY

      Montgomery looks over Beckett.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  I just got a call from the Mayor. 
                  Apparently, you have a fan.

                                  BECKETT
                  A fan, sir?      Marlowe    -     Castle Pilot     -    02.29.08   -     65.


                                  MONGOMERY
                  NickCastle. Seems he s found the main 
                  character for his next set of novels. 
                  A tough but saavyfemale detective.

                                  BECKETT
                  I mflattered.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Don t be. He says he needs to do 
                  research.

                                  BECKETT
                  Oh no.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Oh yes.

                                  BECKETT
                  No way.

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  Beckett...

                                  BECKETT
                  He s like a nine year-old on a sugar 
                  rush... totally incapable of taking 
                  anything seriously. 

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  He did help solve the case. And 
                  Beckett. When the Mayor s happy, I m
                  happy.

                                  BECKETT
                  How long, sir?

      Montgomery nodsover Beckett s shoulder to Castle, now 
      sitting at Beckett s desk. 

                                  MONTGOMERY
                  That s up to him.

      Castle grinsand waves. We push in Beckett s  son-of-a-bitch  
      look, but as she turns away we see a hintof a smile.
