ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.
There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
the building. He can't help himself.

ERIC
Robertson!
SARAH does not respond.
ERIC (cont'd)
Sarah Robertson!
This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she
should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to
her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
personal belongings in it.
ERIC (cont'd)
You shut off my phone???
SARAH ROBERTSON
Eric... I didn't do anything.
They stare at each other.
ERIC
Fuck you.
They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little
shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the
ground and walks away.

This time they are really stuck in traffic, the car is not
moving at all.

They walk over towards the edge. It is a very clear night.
SETH

PETER
Wow.
WILL EMERSON
Yeah.
SETH
Shit, that's a long way down.
WILL EMERSON
Yeah, it is.
They sit down on a girder, then light up. WILL'S look and
tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the
night. Long Pause.
39
39
THEY are all still smoking and looking out over the city.
Finally WILL stands up and goes over to the edge and looks
over. He jumps up and sits on the edge.
(CONTINUED)

PETER
Careful.
SETH
Jesus man.
WILL EMERSON
Did you know the fear most people feel
when they stand on the edge like this is
not actually a fear that they will fall
but instead it's the subconscious fearing
that they might jump? ....It's a fear of
losing faith.
SETH
Well that's a little deep and depressing,
thank you.
WILL EMERSON
Yeah well, I can get a little dark
sometimes.
SETH
Will, come on. Get down.
WILL jumps down and comes back over to sit down. They stare
out again.
WILL EMERSON
Not today!
(beat)
So it looks like they are gonna have us
dump this shit.
SETH
What?
WILL EMERSON
Yeah, you watch.
SETH
How?
PETER
A trillion bucks??
WILL EMERSON
I'm just saying.
PETER
How would they even do that?

WILL EMERSON
You can't... it's impossible. But they'll
figure out a way. I've been at this place
for ten years and I've seen some things
that you wouldn't believe... and when all
is said and done... they don't lose
money. They don't care if everyone else
does, but they won't.
Long silence.
SETH
Will?
WILL EMERSON
Yeah?
SETH
Did you really make two and half million
bucks last year?
WILL EMERSON
Yeah... I did.
PETER
What do you do with all that money?
WILL EMERSON
I don't know really. It goes pretty
quick. You learn to spend what's in your
pocket.
SETH
Two and a half million goes quickly?
WILL EMERSON
Well the tax man takes half of it up
front. So now you got what... million and
a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I
gave 150 to my parents to live off, so
now you got what??
PETER
Eight hundred.
WILL EMERSON
I bought a car last year for 150.
Probably another 100 eating... 25 on
clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...
SETH
Smart. (smiles)

WILL EMERSON
And what's that?
PETER
125 left.
WILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette.
WILL EMERSON
I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers,
and whores.
PETER
76,520?
WILL EMERSON
Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was
able to write most of it off, as
entertainment.
With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the
building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes
sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over
their heads.
THEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise.
PETER
SETH
Whoa!
Whoa!
WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
What time is it?
SETH
3:30!
WILL EMERSON
Oh, here they go. They are bringing in
the cavalry! We better get down there.

There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the
buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size
headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders
around the almost completely empty city and the further he
walks the less his face changes.
57

PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart.
He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The
wind blows.

COFFEE GUY
One fifty.
PETER
Thank you.
PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he
see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is
immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps
slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other
squarely.
LUCY
Hey...
PETER
Hi. It's really good to see you.
She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be
a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.
LUCY
You too. You look tired.
PETER
I am.
LUCY
What are you doing here?
PETER
I never left work. Just had to get out
for a walk.
LUCY
You're still working there?
This cuts him a bit, why wouldn't he be?
PETER
Yes, of course...
LUCY
Oh. I thought...
PETER
How are you? Are you happy? You look
happy.
LUCY
I am.

PETER
Well, I should get back... How's your
father?
She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.
LUCY
He's good. Thanks for asking.
PETER
OK. Be safe.
He starts to leave.
LUCY
Hey... You got any inside tips for him?
This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet
clarifies. Finally.
PETER
Sell.
She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a
smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the
cheek, and part.

WILL gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs. He
is about to knock on the door when from behind him he hears
ERIC coming walking up the block. He is still in his work
clothes and it looks like it's been a long night.
ERIC
What are you doing here?
WILL EMERSON
Peter finished that model you were
working on.
ERIC
Really?
WILL EMERSON
It's created a bit of a shit storm.
ERIC
Yeah, I bet.
WILL EMERSON
Do you want to see it... the model?

ERIC
No.
WILL EMERSON
Really?
ERIC
No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.
WILL EMERSON
Do you think he's right?
ERIC
I'm sure he's right.
They both sit down on the stoop.
WILL EMERSON
Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting
of the partners tonight. John Tuld has
decided to liquidate our entire position.
ERIC looks over at Will
WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
Today.
ERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised
and sincere.
ERIC
Well, I am very sorry to hear that.
WILL EMERSON
They want me to get you back there, they
are worried about you being out here.
ERIC
(with pleasant disgust)
Please.
WILL EMERSON
I'm just saying.
ERIC
(cuts him off cold)
Not a chance.
WILL lets it sit for a few beats.
WILL EMERSON
This is serious shit Eric.

ERIC
You don't think I know that. I've been
warning that cunt Robertson about this
shit since last March.
WILL EMERSON
Well...
ERIC
Fuck her... Fuck her.
WILL EMERSON
Look...
ERIC
I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've
got nothing on me anymore.
WILL EMERSON
They'll pay...
ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that
they mean real money.
ERIC
I've already been paid enough by them.
ERIC looks back out onto the empty street.
ERIC (cont'd)
Did you know I built a bridge once?
WILL EMERSON
I'm sorry?
ERIC
A bridge.
WILL EMERSON
No, I didn't.
ERIC
I was an engineer by trade.
WILL EMERSON
Well...
ERIC
It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to
Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912
feet over the Ohio river. Steel through
arch design. 12,100 people a day use the
thing.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

ERIC (cont'd)
It cut out 35 miles each way of extra
driving to get from Wheeling to New
Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000
miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000
miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a
year saved.
Now ERIC'S mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he
goes.
ERIC (cont'd)
I completed that project in 1986... 22
years ago. Over the life of that one
bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million...
240 thousand miles that haven't had to be
driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour
that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020
days... so that one little bridge has
saved the people of those two communities
a combined 1531 years of their lives not
wasted in the car... give or take.
WILL EMERSON
Jesus.
ERIC
One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one
years...
WILL EMERSON
Fuck...
They sit and let it sink in.
ERIC
That's what I did.
(beat)
Look... you better get back over there.
WILL EMERSON
Yeah.
ERIC
Crazy shit.
WILL EMERSON
True. Dumping the whole fucking
motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well...
alright.
ERIC
Thanks for stopping by.

WILL EMERSON
No problem.
WILL looks out down the street as a black towncar comes
pulling up to the house.
ERIC
Who the fuck is this?
WILL EMERSON
I'd guess it's the firm's people.
ERIC
What?
WILL EMERSON
Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.
ERIC
They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em.
WILL EMERSON
Just come back with them, take the bonus,
and you're home tonight by five. Either
that or they are going to fight you on
everything, the package, the options...
ERIC drops his head.
WILL walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of
Eric's house. The windows are tinted, but they know who it
is. WILL walks around to his car.
WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
You're a better man than I.
ERIC
Well that's always been true.
WILL EMERSON
Yes it has.
ERIC
See ya.
WILL is about to climb in his car.
WILL EMERSON
The house looks great by the way.
ERIC
Thanks.

over this shit.
ERIC
Yeah.
WILL EMERSON

ERIC nods.
WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
Some people like driving the long way
home.
He gets in his car and drives away.

PETER is still walking around on the street with the music
playing. He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza.
As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in
front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then
finally decides to take off the headphones. The music stops
and the wind kicks in.
PETER
Hello.
SAM ROGERS
Peter.
(silence)
You want one?

PETER
I don't smoke.
But PETER holds his place comfortably.
SAM ROGERS
That's good. I don't much either.
PETER
It's kinda beautiful out right now.
They both look out. Slow pacing.
SAM ROGERS
Yeah, I guess it is...
(almost surprised)
I've never really liked this town much.
PETER
How long have you been here?
SAM ROGERS
Forty years.
PETER
I think it's beautiful. The whole place.
Forty years, that's something... Are you
tired?
SAM ROGERS
Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard
as you do.
PETER
That's not true.
SAM ROGERS
No it is, actually.
Long silence.
PETER
Are we all getting fired after today?
SAM looks out and thinks about it for a while.
SAM ROGERS
Probably.
PETER
They're going to fire you?
(CONTINUED)

SAM ROGERS
That's not what they'll call it,... it'll
be a mercy killing really.
SAM looks at PETER.
SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
You don't have to stand out here for me.
PETER
I don't really want to go back in there
just yet.
SAM ROGERS
I understand that.
Long beat.
PETER
I think I know your son.
SAM ROGERS
Really?
PETER
Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed
like a nice person.
SAM ROGERS
He is a nice person.
A taxi honks and flies by.
SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
I guess you could say alot worse about a
guy.
PETER
Have you told him what's about to happen?
They look at each other to check the nature of the question.
SAM ROGERS
What do you mean?
PETER
This whole thing.
SAM ROGERS
No... I hadn't even thought of it.
PETER
I guess it's illegal anyway?
(CONTINUED)

SAM ROGERS
Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore....
and even if it was you'd sure as hell
never get caught.
PETER
He's already pretty rich anyway though
right? He doesn't need the help.
SAM ROGERS laughs quietly.
SAM ROGERS
That's very true.
PETER
He works with a friend of mine.
SAM ROGERS
He's a hell of alot richer than me, I
know that much.
PETER
But you are taller.
Laughs again.
SAM ROGERS
That's true. It's not much... but it's
something... What did your father do?
PETER
He's a doctor.
SAM ROGERS
Really?
PETER
Eyes.
SAM ROGERS
Now that's something.
PETER
Yeah... it is.
SAM ROGERS
Did he want you to do that?
PETER
No, never.
SAM ROGERS
Oh.

PETER
He was always a pretty miserable guy
actually...
Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building.
Peter looks up.
PETER (cont'd)
They're all coming in now.
SAM ROGERS
Yes they are.
PETER
Have you ever done anything like this
before?
SAM ROGERS
No... never.... not even close.
SAM takes a deep drag off his cigarette.
PETER
Oh...
SAM ROGERS
Yeah.
PETER looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say
next.
PETER
Do you really think this is the only...
or the... right thing to do?
SAM ROGERS
For who?
PETER
I'm not sure.
Now SAM looks around and thinks.
SAM ROGERS
I'm not either.
PETER
So this is gonna make a pretty big mess
of it, then?
SAM ROGERS
I don't even want to think about it.

PETER
Yeah.
SAM ROGERS
Just doesn't quite seem...
Takes another long drag.
PETER
I know.
SAM ROGERS
(Very slightly shakes his head.)
PETER
Well. I guess we should get back.
SAM ROGERS
Yeah.
They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn
and head into the building.
74
Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.
He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the
house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the
door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY
ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.
MARY ROGERS
Hello! ... I've called the police.
SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel
handle.
SAM ROGERS
Mary.
MARY ROGERS
Sam?
SAM ROGERS
Yup.
MARY ROGERS
What are you doing?

She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next
to the hole.
MARY ROGERS (cont'd)
What are you doing?
SAM ROGERS
Ella died.
MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.
MARY ROGERS
Oh God.
SAM ROGERS
Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.
MARY ROGERS
Well I'm very sorry.
SAM ROGERS
Yeah... I really loved that dog
MARY ROGERS
I know, but Sam you don't live here
anymore.
SAM ROGERS
I was driving home from the vet and this
is the only place I could think to bury
her. This is where she belongs...
She looks at him deeply.
MARY ROGERS
Well. You should have called.
SAM ROGERS
I know.
MARY ROGERS
Are you alright? You look terrible.
SAM ROGERS
Yeah. Tough day all around.
MARY ROGERS
I heard, Sammy called.
SAM ROGERS
Is he alright?

MARY ROGERS
He said they got hammered, but got out

SAM ROGERS
Good, I was going to call him this
morning... but...
MARY ROGERS
Well, I am going to go back in to bed.
The alarm is on so don't try to break in.
(Sam smiles)
Well, you take care of yourself.
SAM ROGERS
Is it alright if I finish up here?
MARY ROGERS
Yes.
MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off
the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts
humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming
then kicks in with the full version.
FADE TO BLACK.
