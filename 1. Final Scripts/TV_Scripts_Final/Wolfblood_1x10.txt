      EXT. STREAM - STONEYBRIDGE WOODS 16:45 DAY 1 (TUESDAY)11
      MADDY, SHANNON, TOM, RHYDIAN, CERI

      A small stream in the woods.  Trees and bushes cluster 
      thickly along the bank: ideal cover&

      With a SHRIEK of delight, SHANNON SWINGS ACROSS THE STREAM on 
      a rope suspended from an ancient oak.  She lands safely -

                                  MADDY
                    Go, Shannon!

                                  TOM
                    My turn.

      Even RHYDIAN s applauding.  

      She swings the rope back, TOM catches it.  Makes a comedy 
      routine out of spitting on his hands, psyching himself up as 
      if this was some impossible feat -

      But as he swings out over the stream, SOMETHING RUSTLES in 
      the bushes.  TOM looks towards the movement - his grip slips - 

      And he falls into the stream!

                                  MADDY
                    Tom!

                                    SHANNON
                    You all right?

                                  TOM
                    Someone s there!

      Scrambling upright, dripping, he points into the thicket:

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Someone s spying on us!

      A HOODED FIGURE: can t tell if it s male or female, let alone 
      who it is.  Then the bush RUSTLES, and the figure is gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. BUSHES - STONEYBRIDGE WOODS - 16:50, DAY 122
      SHANNON, TOM, MADDY, RHYDIAN

      SHANNON crouches to examine broken and trampled twigs. 

                                    SHANNON
                    This is where he was standing.

      TOM, MADDY and RHYDIAN stop a couple of paces back, wary of 
      trampling the evidence.

                                  TOM
                    So was he spying on us?

                                    SHANNON
                    How am I supposed to tell that from 
                    a few broken twigs?  Come on, let s 
                    get out of here&

      She leaves, followed by TOM.  MADDY and RHYDIAN hang back -
      just long enough to SNIFF THE AIR and catch a SCENT TRAIL.  

                                    RHYDIAN
                    The same scent.

                                    RHYDIAN (CONT D)
                    The wild Wolfblood from the woods.  
                    The one who attacked you.

      TOM  looks back.

                                  TOM
                    Come on.



                                                                            CUT TO:

      BERNIE, TOM, MADDY, RHYDIAN, SHANNON, N.SCUSTOMERS

      WATER DRIPS into a small PUDDLE under a chair - dripping off 
      TOM.  Preoccupied with prodding his sore knee, he doesn t 
      notice.  MADDY sits across the table from him.

                                  MADDY
                    Haven t you got a big game Friday?

                                  TOM
                    Yeah, it s the county cup final and 
                    we re playing Baron s Mill High 
                    School.  The team we always lose 
                    to.

      Weaving through the few other CUSTOMERS, RHYDIAN and SHANNON 
      arrive with a tray.  Hot chocolate all round.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    So your leg won t make a difference 
                    then.

                                  TOM
                    Thanks, mate.

                    Who cares about football?  I want 
                    to know who the creep in the bushes 
                    was!

      Bernie overhears.

                                  MADDY
                      Probably just a dog-walker.

                                  TOM
                      I didn t see a dog.  
                          (to Shannon)

      Clearing tables nearby, BERNIE decides to butt in.

                                  BERNIE
                    Seen her too, have you?

      INT. KITCHEN - MADDY S HOUSE - 18:30, DAY 155
      EMMA, DANIEL, MADDY

      MADDY is setting the table for dinner.  EMMA is carrying 
      condiments and sauces from cupboards to put on it. DANIEL is 
      stirring something on the stove.

                                  EMMA     
                    Whoever she is, she shouldn t be on 
                    our territory! 

                                  MADDY
                    What if she s in trouble?

                                  DANIEL
                    If she needs help, why does she 
                    only appear to you two, and never 
                    to me or your Mum?

                                  MADDY
                    Maybe she s nervous - you know, 
                    because she s trespassing?

                                  DANIEL
                      Nervous?  Her kind aren t nervous 
                    about anything.  Especially  tame  
                      Wolfbloods.

                                  EMMA
                    Daniel!

                                  DANIEL
                    Maddy needs to know what they think 
                    of us.  To them, we re weaklings, 
                      traitors to our heritage.  Pets.

                                  MADDY
                    You re making out she s our enemy.

                                  EMMA
                    We re just saying: if she 
                      approaches you, or Rhydian, call 
                    us.  Don t try to handle her alone.

      Sitting down to dinner, MADDY nods.  Sounds scary.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JIMI, SAM, LIAM and some other FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBERS are 
      having a kick-around.  Meanwhile, TOM talks to SHANNON.  

                                  TOM
                    What d youmean, you re not coming?

                    To watch you kick a piece of 
                    leather round a field? Dull!

      The 3K soverhear and chime in:

                                  KARA
                      Football s so lame even Shannon 
                    doesn t like it!

                    It s the cup final. Aren t you 
                    coming to support us?

                    You lost to Baron s Mill High last

                    That s why we need you.  The crowd 
                    are like the twelfth man in the

                    -It s way more fun than football!

                    Yeah!  With costumes.  And pompoms!
                    We ll be the stars of the show!

      The girls gather round to discuss, now ignoring TOM.

      Meanwhile, the kick-around culminates in SAM taking a kick at 
      goal.  LIAM, the goalie, jumps the wrong way.  GROANS from 
      the team.  LIAM scrambles to his feet, furious -

      TOM runs over to join in as the kick-around begins again.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The kick-around s still going on.  MADDY and RHYDIAN, deep in 
        conversation, watch idly.

                                    RHYDIAN*
                    If she can hide from us when she *

                                  MADDY*
                    It s because she wants us to.*

      TOM kicks the ball hard, clearing it away from goal.  But 
      he s kicked it much too high.  It soars straight towards the 
      school building - and a large window!

      TOM gulps, just waiting for the glass to shatter&

      But the ball s passing over RHYDIAN s head.  He jumps -

      And just gets a hand to the ball.  Deflected, it bounces 
      harmlessly off the wall.   

      But suddenly the whole team are STARING AT HIM!

                    going in the net. 

                                    RHYDIAN

                                  TOM
                    Just play along, mate.  

      JIMI takes the penalty kick - Rhydian doesn t move, the ball 
      goes into the back of the net.

                                  JIMI
                    Didn t you hear what I said? Stop 
                    the ball. Or are you too cool to 
                    dive?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Do it again.

                                  JIMI
                    Don t want to embarrass you.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Just do it again. Please.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Jimi, take the penalty.

      Kicking the ball towards the top corner.  No one s going to 
      be able to save that.

      But RHYDIAN jumps/dives like he has springs on his feet - and 
      saves it one-handed.

      Grinning from ear to ear, JIMI turns to MISS GRAHAM:

                                  JIMI

                    maybe they are.  But you can t be

                    Oh yeah, it s great for you and 
                    your team - you ve got what you 
                    want&  But what s in this for me?

      TOM fumbles to explain his philosophy of football - and life.

                                  TOM
                    On the field, all the stuff you re

                    get on with, fade away.  You re

      EXT. STONEYBRIDGE WOODS - 17:00, DAY 21212
      RHYDIAN, CERI

      RHYDIAN walks home through the woods, rucksack on his back, 
      boots in them.  Everything s right with the world.

      But things are catching his attention.  A RUSTLE among the 
      leaves; the SNAP of a breaking branch; 

      He slows down, moving more softly, trying not to rustle the 
      dead leaves or snap any twigs.

      He turns on his WOLF-HEARING. He hears movement.  Parallel to 
      him, keeping pace, but hidden in the trees.  

      There s someone here.

      RHYDIAN stops, half-closing his eyes: letting his Wolfblood 
      senses take over.  We sense things the way he does -

      EVERY SOUND MAGNIFIED - the distant STREAM like a waterfall, 
      we can even hear the hum of that INSECT over there -

      A SNAPPING TWIG.

      And out of nowhere, SOMEONE s standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!

      Still working on instinct, RHYDIAN JUMPS BACK, putting 
      distance between them - his mouth forms a defensive SNARL -

      But CERI (36) - straggle-haired, torn clothes, looks like 
      she s lived rough forever - simply stares at him.

      Her intensity, her obvious amazement as she looks him over 
      rings bells in RHYDIAN s head.  He half-knows where this is 
      going, who she s going to turn out to be, and that just makes 
      him ever more angry -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    What d youwant?  Who are you?

                                  CERI
                    I m your mother.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I don t have a&  You re not, you 
                    can t be&  

      He can t breathe.  He takes a step back - the world is 
      spinning, her voice seems to be coming from a long way away -

                                  CERI
                    I am, Rhydian.  I am your mother.

      She reaches hesitantly to embrace him - not sure he s ready, 
      but she can t help herself, she just wants to hold her son -

      But RHYDIAN, leaning on a wall, brooding, ignores him. 

      Until he sees MADDY heading across the yard towards him.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      RHYDIAN, TOM, JIMI, LIAM, SAM, N.SFOOTBALL TEAM, MADDY, MISS 
      GRAHAM

      RHYDIAN stands in the goal.  LIAM takes a corner.  JIMI leaps 
      and heads the ball.  It hits RHYDIAN, bounces off - and TOM 
      scores.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                      Concentrate, Rhydian!

      LIAM retakes the corner. The ball bounces off someone, 
      trickling past RHYDIAN, who hasn t moved.

                                  JIMI
                    Wake up, Welshie!

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Jimi!

      JIMI marches up to RHYDIAN, getting right in his face - and 
      RHYDIAN s certainly not going to back down&

                                  JIMI
                    Are you taking the mickey?  We give 
                    you a place on the team, and you 
                    can t even be bothered to try?

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    That s enough!  Go work with the 
                      defenders.

                                  JIMI
                    Good idea.  With him in goal, we re 
                    going to need them.

      JIMI stomps away.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    A team is only as strong as its 
                    weakest link.

                    All we ask is that everyone does 
                    their best.  Is that too much to 
                    ask?

      RHYDIAN glowers.  Shakes his head.

                                  MISS GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Good.

      She blows her whistle -

      As RHYDIAN notices MADDY looking grimly at him.  His 
        behaviourhasn t gone unnoticed.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      RHYDIAN, TOM, JIMI, LIAM, SAM, N.SFOOTBALL TEAM, MISS GRAHAM

        Footiepractice is over, everyone s changing, and the mood is 
      sour.  Muttering and angry glances directed at RHYDIAN.  TOM 
      tries to cheer him up:

                                  TOM
                    Don t worry about it, mate.  Match 
                    day s always better.

                                  SAM
                    It had better be.

                                  JIMI
                    Always the same, loners.  Afraid of 
                      failure, so they won t try -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Are you saying I m scared of 
                    losing?

                                  JIMI
                    I m saying you re not team 
                    material.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Fine!

      He hurls the boots at JIMI.  They end up under a bench.

                                    RHYDIAN (CONT D)
                      I wouldn t be on your team if you 
                    paid me!

      Grabbing his stuff, he heads for the door - almost knocking 
      over MISS GRAHAM as she enters.  

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Rhydian?!  Rhydian!

      But he s gone.

                                  MISS GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Liam, looks like you re back in 
                    goal.

      LIAM sinks onto a bench with a GROAN.  But SAM s already down 
      on his knees as if celebrating a goal!

                                  SAM
                    Yessss! 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. PLAYGROUND - SCHOOL - 16:45, DAY 32727
      MADDY, RHYDIAN

      Everyone s long gone.  Except RHYDIAN, slouching towards the 
      gates - to find MADDY waiting for him.

                                  MADDY
                    I m not going to give up, you know.

                                    RHYDIAN
                            (finally resigned to 
                            telling her)
                    I know.

      PUPILS  VOICES somewhere in the school, larking about.

                                    RHYDIAN (CONT D)
                    We can t talk here.

      MADDY jerks her head - come on.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MADDY, RHYDIAN, BERNIE, CERI*

      MADDY and a pale, nervous RHYDIAN settling down with *
      milkshakes.

                                  MADDY
                    You spoke to her?  When?

                                    RHYDIAN
                      Yesterday, on the walk home.
                          (small voice)
                    Maddy, she s my mum.

      MADDY reacts, shocked.  Then reaches across to lay a hand 
      over his hand.  They re silent for a moment.  Dealing with 
      the enormity of this.

                                  MADDY
                    Why is she here now?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Dunno.  I ran away.  I couldn t 
                    talk to her.  
                          (abrupt anger)
                    She can t just turn up like this!  
                    She left me in the middle of 
                      nowhere.  I could have died. What 
                    kind of mother does that? 

                                  MADDY
                    You don t know what really 
                    happened.  No one does.  Except 
                    her.  So if you want to know the 
                    truth, you have to talk to her.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I know!  But I can t.  

      And then - together - they look up -

      CERI has entered the cafe.

      She s tidied herself up - scruffy hippy rather than full-out 
      vagrants - but the customers still look strangely at her.

      She heads for their table.  Her body language less confident 
      than before - head bowed, a subtly submissive pose.

                                  CERI
                    Please...

      MADDY looks to RHYDIAN.  His choice.

      His expression unreadable, RHYDIAN gestures to the chair.  
      CERI sits down.

      They look at each other across the table.  We can feel that 
      just being here together is a huge step for both of them.

      MADDY gets up, laying a hand briefly on RHYDIAN s shoulder - 
      she s here for him - 

      Then she takes her milkshaketo the counter, sits down there.  
      BERNIE stops polishing the coffee machine to frown at CERI.

                                  MADDY
                    He s, urm, interviewing her.  For 
                    the school magazine.

                                  BERNIE
                    Is she buying anything?

      MADDY sighs and fishes coins out of her pocket.

                                  MADDY
                    She ll have a coffee.

      BERNIE starts making it.  MADDY cocks her head - engaging her 
      Wolfblood hearing to eavesdrop on RHYDIAN s reunion.

      ANGLE ON RHYDIAN AND CERI -

      Where you could cut the atmosphere with a knife.  RHYDIAN 
      doesn t know what to say.  And CERI s having problems just 
      being here.  Can t get comfortable on the chair, for a start:

                                  CERI
                    Don t know how you can sit on this.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It s just a chair.

                                  CERI
                    It s not natural.  Not for us.

                                    RHYDIAN*
                    What are you doing here?  You re on 
                    Maddy s territory -

                                  CERI
                            (contempt)
                    And what will the tame wolves do 
                    about it?

      BERNIE arrives with the coffee.  About to say something, he 
      senses the atmosphere and just leaves.

      CERI sniffs the coffee - a big, animal sniff which draws 
      looks from the other patrons.  Bends down to it rather than 
      lifting the cup - laps some with her tongue -

      And recoils, spitting it out!  

      RHYDIAN wants the ground to open up and swallow him.  And 
      CERI can see that.

                                  CERI (CONT D)
                    You don t need to be afraid.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I m not afraid.  I m embarrassed.  
                    There s a difference.

                                  CERI
                    Different word, same human emotion.

      The way she says  human , it s not a good thing.

                                  CERI
                    My beautiful boy.

                                    RHYDIAN
                      Newsflash,  Mum  - you re twelve 
                    years late. 

                                  CERI
                      I couldn t find you!  I d left you 
                    safe while we went hunting.  When I 
                    came back they were taking you away 
                    in their machines. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You could have gone to Social 
                    Services, told them you were my 
                    mother.

                                  CERI
                    They d have locked me up.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Not if you d lived like a human 
                    being.

                                  CERI
                    That s worse than being locked up.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    So why come back for me now?

                                  CERI
                      I sensed your first transformation.  
                    Knew it was time for you to live 
                    the life you were born for.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    And you found me how?

                                  CERI
                    A true wolfblood can always find

                    Hey, Bernie!

      JIMI, SAM and LIAM have taken a table nearby.  Pretending to 
      be talking among themselves, while actually well aware 
      RHYDIAN can hear.

                                  JIMI (CONT D)
                    Has something gone off in here?

                    I think it s coming from that 
                    table.

      RHYDIAN grits his teeth.  But he has more important things to 
      concentrate on than those idiots.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You don t know anything about my

                    Yeah, better be careful, he might 
                    punch me.  But he d probably miss!

      LIAM and SAM cackle with laughter.

                    You brought this on yourself, 
                    trying to live by their rules.  You 
                    can t go over there and teach them 
                    the lesson they deserve without 
                    revealing yourself.  You can t be 
                    human - but as long as you re 
                    hiding, pretending, you can t be 
                    truly Wolfblood either.

                                  JIMI
                    So who d youthink his new friend 
                    is?

                                  LIAM
                    Maybe it s a self-help group.  
                    Weirdos Anonymous!

      More LAUGHTER.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Can we just go somewhere else?

                                  CERI
                    Of course.

      She and RHYDIAN get up.  

      JIMI pulls a face, holds his nose.  SAM and LIAM snigger-

      CERI seems not to have noticed but as she turns, her hand 
      flashes out, wolf-fast - GRABS AND TWISTS JIMI s EAR!

      JIMI shrieks.  As she raises her hand, he has no choice but 
      to scramble out of his chair, let her drag him closer, or the 
      pain would be worse -

                                  BERNIE
                    Pack it in!

      MADDY is on her feet, RHYDIAN s grabbed her arm but...

      CERI pulls JIMI close and SNARLS into his face. The most 
      terrifying thing he s ever seen.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Stop it!

      He pulls her off JIMI who falls back into the table.  MADDY 
      and BERNIE scramble to help JIMI up - SAM and LIAM are just 
      staring, paralyzed by fear

                                  JIMI
                    She s an animal!  She should be 
                    locked up!

      RHYDIAN bundles the still snarling CERI out of the door.

                    We are shadow and night and the

      RHYDIAN is transfixed.  Whatever she s talking about, he 
      wants it.

                      concentrate.  They think.  We don t 
                    think.  We listen to our instincts.

      Lying on a rock, trying not to think, he feels like an idiot.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Right.  Instincts.  Listen to my

      hypnotic, but it s not so much the words, it s her eyes.

      RHYDIAN is slipping into another state of being.

      RHYDIAN slips into EOLASMODE.  

      RHYDIAN S POV - WOLF SENSE -

      This is the Wolfblood version of astral projection.  He can 
      see and hear EVERYTHING.

      At first, just an overview, an aerial photograph from a high 
        perspective, with an overlay of every noise for miles - wind, 
      animal noise, burbling streams -

      But as he concentrates on a feature, it suddenly leaps into 
      SHARP CLOSE-UP. The stream flowing in the moon light.

      ON RHYDIAN -

      As he realises what he s doing, what he s sensing.  The most 
      wonderful thing he s ever felt.

      In order to get it to fit, he has to take something out and 
      put that in the locker separately.

      It s a sleeping bag.  Folded clothes under it in his bag.  
      He s packed to leave home.

      MADDY approaches his locker.  She s seen the sleeping bag.

                                  MADDY
                      Rhydian, what are you doing?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I m going with her.

                                  MADDY
                    What?

                    She s my mother. She can teach me

                                  MADDY
                    You can t just run away.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It won t be the first time.  It s 
                    just the first time I ve had people 
                    I m sad to leave behind.

                                  MADDY
                    I ll tell Jeffries.  Or ring your 
                    foster parents.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You won t.  Tom or Shannon would - 
                    they d think they were doing the 
                    right thing, saving me from a 
                      hopeless mother.  But you know the 
                    truth.  I m going to live the life 
                    I was born for.

                                  MADDY
                    And what if it isn t?  What if you 
                    get there and you hate it?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Maybe I will.  But you have to let 
                    me try.

      MADDY can t believe he s asking her to keep this secret.  But 
      she also knows he s right.

                    When you re in a team, you ve made

                    Right.  Penalty kick, bad.  I can t

      Both teams clear out of the penalty area as the opposing 
      team s STRIKERreadies himself to take the kick.  

      It s one on one: him against RHYDIAN.  

      RHYDIAN takes a deep breath.  Focusing with all his Wolfblood

      CHEERING CROWD DROPS AWAY-

      The STRIKER is in SLO-MOas he runs at the ball - he kicks -
      the ball soars towards what looks like an open goal -

      RHYDIAN leaps like he s never leapt before - and saves it!

      Back to NORMAL MOTION and NORMAL SOUND as the crowd go wild!

                                  MADDY
                    Wooo, Rhydian!

      The striker just stands there - how on earth did the goalie 
      save that?  The 3KSbreak out their best routine -

      But play continues!  TOM s up the field, waving for the ball.

      RHYDIAN throws the ball to him - TOM takes possession, the 
      opposing team scramble to catch up, but it's too late -

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Go on, Tom!

      TOM dribbles past a tackling defender, takes the kick-

      ANDscores the winning goal!  Hysteria from the home crowd as 
      the whistle blows.  SAM leaps off the subs bench, ecstatic.  

      The REFEREE BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.  The game s over.

      SPECTATORS invade the pitch to congratulate TOM and RHYDIAN -

      Almost trampling the 3KS, who abandon their routine in a 
      temper tantrum as they realiseno one s watching anyway&

        Congratulations for TOM, the goal-scorer: but everyone s 
      going nuts over RHYDIAN.  He s hoisted onto the team s 
      shoulders and carried off the pitch in triumph.

      RHYDIAN looks around the crowd: MR. JEFFRIES applauding him, 
      genuinely pleased that the  bad boy  has come good -

      A proud JIMI.  SHANNON, cheering.  A grinning TOM. 

      MADDY, smiling bravely at him as she lines up one final 
      photo.

      We end the scene on her PHOTO - RHYDIAN and TOM, surrounded 
      by team-mates and fans, joint heroes of the hour.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Everyone's changing, and leaving.  JIMI, about to leave with 
      LIAM, SAM, and TOM, stops to look back at RHYDIAN.

                                  JIMI
                    Burgers at Bernie s.  You coming?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Maybe later.

                                  JIMI
                    Great save.  Great throw.  

      He sounds almost puzzled by that - how did this weirdo save 
      the day? - but he s happy all the same.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Cheers, Jimi.

                                  TOM
                    Laters, yeah?

      They leave.  RHYDIAN s alone in the dressing room.  Packs up 
      his bulging rucksack.  Holds up the football boots, looks at 
      them long and hard.

      He s having second thoughts about his decision.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      RHYIAN, MADDY, CERI

      RHYDIAN emerges from the changing rooms.  MADDY is waiting 
      for him.

                                  MADDY
                    Hey, it s the Man Of The Match.

                                    RHYDIAN
                            (actually, he s loving it)
                    Tom scored the winner.  I ve never 
                    seen him so happy.

                                  MADDY
                    I ve never seen youthat happy.  
                    Not in human form, anyway. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It was a buzz.  Winning. Being part 
                    of the team - 

                                  MADDY
                    Belonging somewhere.

      RHYDIAN agrees, knows exactly what she means and where she s 
      going, but he plays it cool:

                                    RHYDIAN
                      I guess.

                                  MADDY
                    You know, it s not too late to 
                    change your mind.

      They re almost at the school buildings - and a figure is 
      waiting in the mouth of an alley between buildings.

      It s CERI.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Or is this where I say goodbye?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It s my choice, Maddy.

      MADDY gets upset.

                                  MADDY
                    I hate goodbyesanyway.

      She hurries off.  RHYDIAN watches her go.  Torn.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      RHYDIAN, CERI, TOM, *

      An alley, a patch of dead space between two buildings.  CERI 
      paces, agitated, as RHYDIAN approaches.

                                  CERI
                    We should be gone by now.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I said I d meet you when I was 
                    finished.  

                                  CERI
                      Finished what?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Playing football.  Did you watch?

      CERI looks at him like he s crazy.  Of course not.

                                  CERI
                    I don t watch humans playing their 
                    games.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You should have.  Then you might 
                        understand...why I can t come with 
                    you.

      CERI s genuinely shocked.  

                                  CERI
                    You want to stay here-?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It might be a game but I was part 
                    of something.  Something I was good 
                    at, something I wanted - not 
                    something I was born into. It was 
                    my choice.

      CERI s eyes flash YELLOW - real anger at his stupid decision&

                                  CERI
                    I m offering you freedom!  The 
                    Wolfblood life!

                                    RHYDIAN
                    There isno  Wolfblood life !  We 
                    all get to choose how we live - and 
                    I can t live like you.  Maybe if 
                    you stay, we can see each other -

                                  CERI
                    Did she do this?  Your tame wolf 
                    friend -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Don t you evercall Maddy tame.

      CERI snarls - her head drops, her hands form claws, we think 
      she s about to take wolf form and attack&!

      But RHYDIAN stands firm, defying her.  CERI knows she s lost 
      this fight before it even starts.   This has devastated her.

                                  CERI
                    She s corrupted you - I m your 
                    mother -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    - Who wasn t there.

      CERI, rather then allow her distress to show, turns and leaps 
      the perimeter wall at the end of the alley in a single bound - 
      and she s gone.  RHYDIAN stares after her.  Shaken-up.

                                  TOM  (O.S.)
                      Rhydian?

      RHYDIAN swings round.  TOM appears.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Who were you talking to?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    No one.   I thought you d gone to 
                      Bernies.

                                  TOM
                    I decided to come back for our man 
                    of the match.   Shannon said she d 
                    meet us up there.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Cool.

      They start walking off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MADDY, RHYDIAN. TOM

      MADDY brooding, tearful.  She senses something. Sniffs.  
      Rhydian s scent trail wafts up her nose.  She turns.   

      Sees TOM and RHYDIAN walking out the gates.  Amazing.

                                  MADDY
                      Rhydian!

      TOM and RHYDIAN stop. She runs towards them. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    We re going up to Bernies!  You 
                      coming?!

      MADDY runs between them, looping her arms through theirs.
