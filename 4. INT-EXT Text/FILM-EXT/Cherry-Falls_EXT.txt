TOWN - NIGHT
The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'
We see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is
Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of
town. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are
drawn.
Dissolve to:
LOVER'S LANE
A romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by.
Crickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on
the lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts
through the streamed up windows.
LOVER'S LANE
There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight. It's an old beat
up Imperial from the late sixties. Someone is watching them. It's probably
a psychopath.
ROAD
She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.
ROAD
Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.
ROAD
She pays no attention to him.
ROD
Please get back in the car, Stacy.
She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where
he can't follow.
ROAD
As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at
lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.
Stacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her
breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her.
Suddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.
STACY
Rod?
No answer.
STACY
Is that you Rod?
Still no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.
Again she
hears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there
stops too. She looks around in every direction.
STACY
Come out Rod.
This SCREAM bull shit ain't
gonna work with me!
No answer. Even the birds have stopped chirping.
STACY
(terrified)
Rod? You're freaking me
out. Game's over. I lose.
Come out and we'll fuck.
She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the
silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.
The wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that
whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very
long, jagged, steel nail in the other.
STACY
(in full panic)
NO!
Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.
STACY'S
Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the
woods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.
WOODS
Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to
elude her pursuer.
STACY
Help!
The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against
a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.
WOODS
Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into
the woods.
STACY'S
Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark
woods.
WOODS
Rod's POV - The woods are pitch black.
ROD
Stacy?
STACY(O.C.)
(struggling, in the distance)
ROD!
WOODS
The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her
and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the
killer.
WOODS
Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.
Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.
WOODS
Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against
a tree trunk.
WOODS
Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.
WOODS
The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of
Stacy's outstretched palm.
The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.
Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing
battle.
ROD
Stacy?!
WOODS
The hammer descends on the nail.
Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to
the tree.
WOODS
Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.
Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.
Another nail is readied.
Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.
Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample
fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.
Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each
tree. She almost looks crucified.
Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's
terrified eyes. She's looking behind him.
Rod quickly turns around but he's too late.
A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.
Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping
her palms on the nails.
Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.
Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.
The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.
Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.
A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is
placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like
it's an ordinary pencil.
Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never
experienced such pain.
Blood drips to the ground.
Dissolve to:
NIGHT SKY
The full moon looks down on the town.
CUL DE SAC
Another romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the
sleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making
out drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the
first scene.
CUL DE SAC
The car squeals away.
MARKEN HOUSE
Jody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to
see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A
car backfires in the distance. A nearby noise
startles her. Something's
behind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing
behind the house.
Brent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there.
A trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene.
WOODS
The murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree.
Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.
Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy,
JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him.
DEPUTY
Her parents reported her missing about
an hour ago.
A flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his
flashlight to better survey the carnage.
He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy,
looking at one nailed hand, then the other.
BRENT
What kind of a person wakes
up in the morning and says
to themselves, 'Think I'll nail
a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
DEPUTY
The same type that decides to carve into
her stomach.
Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into
her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE
High school kids are getting ready for school.
Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare
teenage legs.
Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests.
Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned.
The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking.
IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but
alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd
splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads,
cheerleaders, nerds.
The killing is on everyone's mind.
SCHOOLYARD
Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks
it in the bike rack.
Jody's POV - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl,
SHARON.
Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else. As she starts
toward the front door of the school, a few other CLASSMATES run up to her.
She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her.
CLASSMATE 1
Jody!
JODY
Hi.
CLASSMATE 2
Was Stacy raped?
JODY
I dunno. My dad never came home
last night.
Jody's POV - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second.
CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
I bet she was. I heard someone
stuffed a tent spike up her ass.
CLASSMATE 2(O.C.)
Gives new meaning to the idea
of getting 'nailed'.
CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.
Jody doesn't respond. She stares at Kenny.
Jody's POV - Kenny walks into school with Sharon.
CUT TO:
SCHOOL
All the kids charge out. Jody walks out with Sandy.
SANDY
(flustered)
What am I supposed to say?
'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you
buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
JODY
(teasing a bit)
You could tell him you really
liked the way he chews with his
back molars.
SANDY
You're so fucking lucky your
dad is the sheriff.
JODY
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
SANDY
You get to be a little Chelsea
Clinton. Everyone wants to meet
you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
JODY
But you can't do any of it.
So it sucks. I always have to
'set an example'.
Jody stops, noticing something.
PARKING LOT
Jody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon.
Sandy sees how upset Jody is.
SANDY
He's just trying to mess
with your head. Ignore
him.
JODY
Does she fuck?
SANDY
(trying to comfort)
I doubt it. Who'd want
to fuck her. She probably
reeks worse than the docks
down in those panties.
DISSOLVE TO:
Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy.
JODY
(frustrated)
Mr. Jenkins called on me in
class today. It was so embarrassing.
I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking
about Kenny for over twenty minutes.
When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic.
I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.
STACY
What did you say?
JODY
That I was sorry. I'd drifted off.
That I'd been thinking about Stacy
and Rod.
SANDY
Oh nice save.
JODY
I was desperate. It was gross.
SANDY
Kenny'll come running back.
This is just his way of pressuring
you.
JODY
He says he loves me.
SANDY
Personally I think he has a deep,
almost pathological desire to corrupt
you. But I suppose that's a type of love.
I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
JODY
(musing)
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of
Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
SANDY
No!
JODY
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
SANDY
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me
or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best
friend.
Jody laughs.
JODY
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
SANDY
Want to come in for awhile?
Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men,
head into a private S&M; chat room . . .
JODY
How do you know what to type back when
they start to cyber with you.
SANDY
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books
hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Jody laughs.
JODY
I promised I'd go right home after school.
SANDY
OK. increase the peace.
Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike
and pedals off down the street.
Dissolve to:
Night has set again on the town. An OWL HOOTS. THE STREETS ARE QUIET.
STREET
The killer's car, the black IMPERIAL, lurks in the shadows of a suburban
street. The killer is staking out a specific house.
ANNETTE'S HOUSE
Annette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front
door. Her MOTHER and FATHER are going out.
They kiss ANNETTE goodbye, get in their car and drive away. Annette heads
back inside and double locks the door.
RESTAURANT
Annette's parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside.
THE KILLER'S IMPERIAL PULLS up across the street.
ANNETTE'S
A gloved finger pushes in the back doorbell.
Someone is standing there in the shadows.
KILLER(O.C.)
HI. Annette?
It's a WOMAN'S VOICE.
INTERCUT WITH:
HOUSE
Annette's parents pull into the driveway:
They are still giggling. It's been a great night. They are sauced.
CORRIDOR
Her mother frantically tugs at the door. Her dad appears.
MOTHER
Annette!!
Her dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door.
It begins to splinter.
COP Cars are everywhere.
CHERRY FALLS
It's a new day. As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying. Everyone
is a little more on edge. The same tribes exist but kids are starting to
glance and listen to kids from other tribes. The social structure is
starting to fray.
TOWN HALL
The town bell rings in the steeple. It's eight o'clock.
MAIN STREET
The shops close down. All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall.
SCHOOL
The parents arrive. They are all concerned. They've all heard rumors by
now. They hurry into the school, whispering to one another.
TOWN
A match lights a long fuse.
Fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and
Roman candles. They ignite. The firecrackers explode as balls of fire
shoot into the night sky. TEENAGERS howl.
HOUSE
The killer's imperial pulls up across the street from Jody's.
HOUSE
Someone is standing in the shadows below. All Jody can make out is that
it's a woman.
BACK DOOR
There's someone in the shadows.
Jody opens the door a crack.
JODY
Yes?
KILLER(O.C.)
Are you Jody?
Once again, a woman's voice.
JODY
Yeah.
KILLER(O.C.)
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
JODY
Kenny's aunt?
KILLER(O.C.)
Yes. He asked me to come over
and talk to you.
Jody senses something is off.
JODY
On what side of the family?
KILLER(O.C.)
His mother's side.
JODY
His mother's an only child.
Jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is
too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house.
Jody fights to push the door shut but she can't. The killer is stronger.
The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch.
Jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric
screwdriver sitting in the back pantry. She grabs for the screwdriver with
one hand as the killer pushes harder.
Jody drills the killer's elbow.
The killer screams and lets go. Jody slams the door shut, double locking
it.
HOUSE
She notices a shadow move across the back window. The killer hasn't left.
The killer seems to be following her.
ROOF
Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull
herself out.
ROOF
Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and
screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. She screams and
kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her
rolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the
gutter, hanging from it.
The gutter starts to break.
Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.
The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.
Jody knows she has no choice.
Jody lets go of the gutter.
Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below.
JODY
Help!
Jody smashes to the ground.
NEIGHBOR'S
A neighbor hears the clatter and comes running out to see what's going on.
BACKYARD
Jody lies still on the ground.
ROOF
The killer, still in silhouette, looks down from the roof.
BACKYARD
Jody's neighbor runs over to help her.
Jody rolls over, still groggy.
Jody looks up to the roof.
ROOF
THE KILLER IS GONE.
BACKYARD
Jody looks back down at her bloody leg. There is a 'V' carved into it.
CUT TO:
HOUSE
Later that night. Police cars are lined up outside the house.
CHERRY FALLS
Another morning in CHERRY FALLS. The town may look peaceful but it isn't.
SANDY'S HOUSE
Sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her.
MOTHER
SANDY?!
No way is Sandy turning around.
SCHOOL
The kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast
about Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little
extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity
everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.
The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are
sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids
together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds,
cheerleaders with potheads.
In the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's IMPERIAL is parked. The killer
is close by.
FRONT OF SCHOOL
Sandy arrives at school. She looks around.
She spots Mark talking with Cindy and BEN. She gathers her confidence up,
unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has, and starts
towards them.
Cindy is laughing at Ben.
CINDY
I'm not fucking you.
Not for all your CDS.
BEN
You want me to die? I thought
you and I were tight.
CINDY
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
BEN
WOULD that impress you?
IS that what it takes to
impress the empress?
CINDY
Your mind is just twisted enough.
I believe you'd do all this just to
get a dip or two.
Sandy walks up.
SANDY
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
MARK
Hi Sandy.
They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance.
BEN
Did you want something?
Sandy freezes. She doesn't known what to say.
SANDY
(almost frozen)
Yes.(beat) I was just curious
Mark, if you brought a Twinkie
today?
Ben and Cindy crack up. That was a really lame, stupid question.
BEN
(sarcastically)
You wonder about that everyday Sandy?
MARK
Shut up Ben.
(to sandy)
Actually, my mom always
packs two.
SANDY
You got a great mom.
I'm lucky to get a zucchini
stick.
MARK
Did you want one?
SANDY
(trying to cover)
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies
the other day and I realized I hadn't had one
in years. Then I remembered seeing you with
one.
MARK
They're tasty.
He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her. She unwraps it and takes a
bite. Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained.
SANDY
Thanks.
Sandy gets
a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue,
a little embarrassed. The sight of her tongue turns Mark on.
MARK
You can have both if you want.
SANDY
No, you keep one.
Cindy laughs. The pairing up has started.
CUT TO:
HIGH SCHOOL
As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the
attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture.
She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a
Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone
badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more
feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's
just a
couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.
Jody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of
kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's
up.
BLEACHERS
Cindy is setting with a group of girls, the center of attention.
CINDY
You all are such hypocrites.
All year long you sit on your
judgmental little butts and
call me the slut from hell.
NOW YOU RUN TO ME, quaking in fear,
BEGGING for advice...
HYPOCRITE GIRL 1
Yeah. SO?
HYPOCRITE GIRL 2
What were we supposed to call you
Cindy?
GIRL 1
The slut from heaven?
GIRL 3
Just answer our questions please?
Sandy runs up.
CINDY
(loving the role)
What do you want to know?
GIRL 3
What to do.
CINDY
You have to do everything
Boys are totally clueless when
it comes to sex.
This answer terrifies the audience.
CINDY(cont'd)
It starts with them trying to
unhook our bras, fumbling around,
and never changes. Wait until they try
to put their dicks in you.
GIRL 2
Please don't say they need our help
with that.
CINDY
Always. Unless you want them to just
poke around endlessly.
The girls had no idea.
PARKING LOT
Two HOMELY GIRLS, one rail thin, the other slightly overweight, walk back
towards the school.
HOMELY GIRL 1
We'll meet someone at the party.
HOMELY GIRL 2
You don't know that.
HOMELY GIRL 1
If we don't, we sit back and watch
everyone else camel.
That's got to be better than
hanging at your house.
HOMELY GIRL 2
I'm not going.
They notice a group of kids huddled around a car.
HOMELY GIRL 1
What's that?
They walk up.
'VIRGIN' has been written in blood on one of the windshields.
A mutilated
boy looks out of the driver's window of the car.
The girl's faces go
white. IT'S ANOTHER BODY!
More and more kids gather around the murder site. The kids are all
freaked, giving each other the eye. No one wants to be next.
All of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the
kids out. The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids
and teachers run over. Everyone heard the scream.
Homely girl 2 whispers to her friend.
HOMELY GIRL 2
(whispering)
Ok. Pick me up at seven.
SCHOOL
Kids charge out, ready for a memorable evening.
HIGH SCHOOL
MIKE STANTON turns around toward the high school to report on the day's
events but before he can get a word out a young GIRL who has recognized
him, walks up to him. Her GIRLFRIENDS giggle behind her.
GIRL
Hi.
MIKE
Hi, I'm Mike Stanton.
GIRL
I know.
She grabs him and kisses him. He's shocked. She runs off giggling with her
friends. A boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip
humping gesture at the TV camera.
HOUSE
Jody walks in the back door.
POLICE STATION
The deputy walks Brent to his car.
DEPUTY
As bizarre as it may sound,
seems someone is planning to
have a big party tonight.
BRENT
No?
DEPUTY
Should we close down any eruption?
BRENT
Are you sure?
DEPUTY
We're seeing all the signs in town.
BRENT
I like the idea of all the kids in
one place. If it happens, just keep
a man outside until you hear from me.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
He jumps in his car and speeds away.
LIBRARY
The gray old ivy-covered town library. Jody rides up and heads inside.
LIBRARY
A beautiful garden on the edge of the library. The autumn wind is blowing.
The leaves are at the height of foliage. Jody and her mom are seated on a
carved stone bench.
MARGE
Years ago, something horrible
happened in this town. When I
was still in high school. A girl
named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by
four drunken seniors.
JODY
Attacked how?
MARGE
She was raped. At least that's
what she claimed.
JODY
You didn't believe her?
MARGE
(confessing)
No, I believed her. She was in
pretty bad shape. Inside and out.
But the boys were never formally
charged.
JODY
Why not?
MARGE
They were children of our leading
citizens, stars of the football team.
And she was
a loner. An angry girl
that no one really liked. She'd called
them 'queers'.
JODY
People thought these guys had a
right to rape her because she called
them 'queers'?
MARGE
They were proving to her they weren't.
They were very drunk. Things were different
back then. You think kids are sexually
bottled up today....
JODY
And the police did nothing?
MARGE
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
JODY
How could you?
MARGE
I don't know. We just did. I guess
I was kind of scared going against the gain.
Against the whole town.
JODY
The word is Mob.
MARGE
I've regretted it ever since.
Never run with the herd just because
they're the herd.
JODY
Who were they?
Marge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that.
MARGE
Who?
JODY
The men. Do any of them still
live around here?
MARGE
Two men left town right after
it happened.
JODY
You're not telling me something.
Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say.
MARGE
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
JODY
(shocked)
The principal?
MARGE
Yes.
JODY
Who was the fourth?
Marge is stricken. She looks down.
MARGE
God. It's like everything that was
ever repressed in this town is suddenly
bubbling up through the ground.
Jody gets it.
JODY
Dad?
Her mother can't deny it any longer.
JODY(CONT'D)
(horrified)
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first.
He was one of them.
MARGE
Not a day has gone by where your
father has not torn himself to shreds
for what happened. We both have...
JODY
NO!
Jody gets up.
MARGE
He dedicated his life to law
enforcement after...
Jody runs off, very upset.
LIBRARY
Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off.
GARDEN
Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed.
INDIANA DIRT ROAD
The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman'
Brent's police car turns into the driveway.
LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE
It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign
stands crookedly in the front yard.
Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty
tools and old auto parts.
FRONT DOOR
Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a
circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after
all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks.
No one answers.
He knocks again.
No one answers, again.
A WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house.
CARETAKER
Hello?
BRENT
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
CARETAKER
She's not here.
BRENT
You know where I can find her?
CARETAKER
St. Michael's.
BRENT
She works at a church?
CARETAKER
She resides there. Out back.
She died a year and a half ago.
Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also
terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her. It's been a
long
time since he's confronted his hidden past. He puts his gun away.
BRENT
Of what?
CARETAKER
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
BRENT
She was murdered?
CARETAKER
No. She ate a pistol for lunch
one day.
Brent can't help but feel responsible.
BRENT
Can you describe her? How old
was she?
CARETAKER
I never met the woman. I'm just taking
care of the place until they sell it.
BRENT
Can you get inside?
CARETAKER
I can.
BRENT
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago.
It's extremely important that I
get inside and try to verify that it's the
same woman who lived here.
CARETAKER
I don't give a fuck what your reasons
are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside
Otherwise, get a warrant.
He pulls out his wallet.
Cut to:
KENNY'S HOUSE
Jody rides up to Kenny's house.
FRONT DOOR
Kenny, opens the front door, very excited.
KENNY
Jody!
(he kisses her)
Yes! You're here.
Jody wipes a tear from her eye. Kenny notices how upset she is.
KENNT(CONT'D)
What's the matter?
Jody bursts into tears. She hugs him. He hugs her back and leads her
inside.
STREET
Carloads of kids head toward Cherry Falls, howling out the windows,
guzzling beer.
STREET
Police cars screech to a stop, barricading the entrances to town,
preparing for the onslaught.
STREET
It's ST. MICHAELS church. Brent pulls over.
GRAVEYARD
Lisa Sherman's headstone. It's a modern one. Her picture is on it. It's
the same woman as the sketch artist drew.
Brent stares at the headstone, alone in the cemetery, feeling ashamed.
BRENT
Lisa, I'm so sorry.
WOODS
Kids from other towns park cars at the edge of town and try to sneak into
Cherry falls through the woods.
Police try and cut them off.
TOWN
Jody pedals quickly down the street. She's going nowhere. She starts to
cry.
ROADHOUSE
Brent pulls into the roadhouse to look for Tom Sisler. As he walks inside
we notice the killer's Imperial is parked there as well. Brent's in
trouble.
HOUSE
All sorts of kids make their way across the front lawn. They are carrying
pillows, sheets, blankets, anything and everything that will make the wood
floors more comfortable.
One couple runs towards the front door howling.
Another boy pulls his obviously frightened girlfriend into the house,
reassuring her that everything will be fine.
Lots of kids are milling around outside because two big football players
and their dates are guarding the front door. There's a big sign that says
"Couples only". Lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn.
NEIGHBOR'S YARD
Two computer nerds are hidden behind a tree, watching the other kids
arrive. They spot the two homely girls we saw earlier.
NERD 1
There's Jan and Heather.
Let's grab them quick before
someone else does.
NERD 2
Ok.
NERD 1
Hide your laptop here.
NERD 2
No.
NERD 1
You can't bring it.
NERD 2
I'm not leaving it here.
Nerd 2 heads toward the girls, taking his laptop. Nerd 1 follows, pissed
off. They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact. After
several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window.
GIRL IN WINDOW
Marisa! Find someone fast.
Floor space is almost gone.
This only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside. One of the homely
girls looks at the laptop.
NERD 2
Ever play QUAKE?
HOMELY GIRL 2
What's that?
NERD 2
A computer game.
The four just gravitate toward each other, now 'coupled'. They enter the
house next to each other, all four terrified, none even acknowledging yet
that they're all in danger.
Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can.
She's in her own world, very upset.
A car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow
down, knowing the light is about to change.
A boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor.
Jody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids
into the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off
the road, into a few garbage cans.
The car nicks another car and pulls over.
Across the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red
light.
Jody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched.
The OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.
OWNER
Are you O.K.?
JODY
I'm ok.
CAR OWNER
Are you sure?
JODY
Yes.
LEONARD(O.C.)
You don't look OK.
Jody turns around. Her teacher Leonard Marliston is there. The killer's
IMPERIAL is parked behind him. Jody wipes away the tears.
JODY
(starting to cry)
I am.
LEONARD
My house is just a couple of blocks
away. Why don't you come on over and
clean those cuts up.
JODY
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back
of your car?
LEONARD
Can you just follow me?
The back is full?
JODY
Sure.
CUT TO:
PARTY HOUSE
Kids are still arriving from all over but there's no more room in the
house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard.
One couple spreads out on the roof.
A cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on
the house.
TOWN SQUARE
Kids are starting to gather and hook up in the town square. As the police
try to break up one gathering, another one starts.
CUT TO:
STREET
In Leonard's rear view mirror we see Jody pedaling behind him.
A couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite Jody to the go to the
party. Sirens scream out in the distance.
LEONARD'S HOUSE
Leonard pulls into his driveway. Jody pulls in behind. She leans the bike
on the front porch and they head into the house.
LEONARD
You aren't going to the party?
JODY
You know about that too?
LEONARD'S HOUSE
Leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back.
STREET
Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch
his breath for a second.
He notices something.
LEONARD'S
Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch.
STREET
Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's
hers.
HOUSE
Kenny rings it again. No one answers.
He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the
curtains.
HOUSE
Kenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one
answers.
Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time.
HOUSE
Jody and Kenny limp out of the house. Kenny grabs Jody's bike.
KENNY
Climb on.
HOUSE
Kenny and Jody are peddling away down the driveway.
BACK DOOR
Leonard bursts out of the house and jumps into his car.
HOUSE
The car squeals out of the driveway, rims sparking wildly.
SUBURBAN STREET
Kenny frantically pedals the bike up the pristine suburban street. Jody
hangs on for dear life.
JODY
Go to the police station!
KENNY
Deputy Webber's at the party.
It's only three blocks away.
Leonard's car squeals around the corner behind them.
JODY
Fuck! It's him.
STREET
Kenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that
doesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind
Kenny, ready to run him over.
Kenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up
everywhere.
Kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto
the other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several
cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way.
Leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street,
destroying it.
Leonard pulls up right behind them. He hits the gas. Kenny has to turn
hard to avoid getting hit.
Kenny can't hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them.
BACKYARD
Kenny and Jody tumble up someone's driveway, smashing into their fence.
STREET
Leonard can't hold the car straight and it 360s across several lawns.
Finally stopping, smashing into a parked car.
BACKYARD
Kenny helps Jody to her feet.
BACK OF HOUSE
The GERMAN SHEPARD that lives in the house comes charging out of the dog
door towards them, barking and snarling.
KENNY
Shit.
Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German
Shepard snaps at
him.
He jumps down on the other side, safe.
The German Shepard smells something else and tears away.
FRONT OF HOUSE
Leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the
German Shepard comes charging out the open fence.
Leonard screams. The
dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The
dog thrusts away.
CLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his
eyes. He pushes the dog off of him.
It lets out a panted growl, almost
like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car,
speeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk
about being left with a hard-on.
PARTY HOUSE
The house is dark. The lights are all out.
ROAD
The deputy checks his watch. A policeman comes running up.
POLICEMAN
We just found another body.
DEPUTY
Who's?
POLICEMAN
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
Two kids went into his office to fuck and
they found him, with his tongue cut out and
his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also
chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his
pencil holder.
DEPUTY
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
POLICEMAN
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown.
Kids from other towns are starting to congregate
in the parks and at the high school. It's turning
into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
DEPUTY
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What
he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
POLICEMAN
Ok.
The deputy jumps into his car.
DEPUTY
Don't leave this party until you
hear from me.
The policeman looks up at the house.
POLICEMAN
But I shouldn't shut it down?
DEPUTY
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn
party I've ever seen.
SUBURBAN STREET
Jody and Kenny climb over a fence into another backyard. Jody is limping
badly.
Kenny is helping her along.
JODY
Thanks for coming back for me.
KENNY
I love you.
She kisses him. He kisses her back.
STREET
Kenny and Jody appear from a backyard, across the street from the party.
CAR
Leonard is looking in the window.
PARTY
Jody and Kenny limp up to the party. There are no police outside.
JODY
Where are the police?
Jody looks down the road, lets out a blood curdling scream. LEONARD is
slowly limping towards the house, gore dripping razor in hands.
JODY
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
KENNY
Quick! In the house. He
won't look for us in there.
Kenny and Jody limp toward the front door.
HOUSE
Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight.
Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung
upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost
bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.
BALCONEY
Kenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway
back into that room.
KENNY
Jody?!
The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle.
The banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase,
onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.
HOUSE
Leonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front
steps.
HOUSE
KIDS start circling Leonard.
Leonard gets to his knees, still holding the razor. They start taunting
him.
BOY 1
It's the freak!
The kids inch closer to Leonard.
GIRL 1
He's still got the blade!
One kid kicks him. Leonard slashes at the kid, but misses. Another boy
kicks the knife out of his hands. A third picks it up.
BOY 3
Come on! It's fuck him up time!
One boy kicks Leonard in the face. Another kicks him in the ribs, another
in the balls. Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all
descend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out
of him. It's a feeding frenzy.
He disappears under the angry mob of
teenagers.
FRONT YARD
Police cars screech to a stop out front. The kids are all disappearing off
down the street.
JODY AND KENNY emerge out the front door, look down at LEONARD, barely
alive, lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps.
LEONARD
J-Jody. P-please help me.
Please.
Leonard spits up blood. Jody squeals. Kenny covers her eyes.
CLOSE on the BALCONY overhead. The railing breaks off and the balcony
comes crashing down, falling on Leonard, killing him. Jody embraces Kenny
tightly.
KENNY
It's all over now.
dissolve to:
AVON LAKE CEMETERY
Cemetery- Brent's coffin is in a grave. People are leaving the funeral.
Jody is with her Mom. They are the last ones there. They watch as the
workers start to throw dirt on the coffin.
Jody takes her mom's hand in her own. They're close again.
Dissolve to:
BEDROOM
Someone is in the shadows outside, climbing up to her bedroom window.
CHERRY FALLS
The entrance to the town. The hanging sign reads 'Entering Cherry Falls,
Ohio'.
The beautiful town is now peaceful again. The crickets are chirping, the
robins begin cooing. Suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign
begins to sway back and forth, almost on its own.
CUT TO BLACK
