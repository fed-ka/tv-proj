      EXT. SANTA MARTA BEACH - DAY (D/1)11

      Early morning in Paradise.  Through a LONG LENS it s a 
      perfect California postcard -- bright blue sky, waves 
      crashing up and down the sand.  Hardly anyone out this early, 
      but a few hardy SURFERS out on the water and --

      A little GIRL, 7, at tide s edge.  Droopy drawers and a 
      clumsily tied bikini top.  Playing with a doll.  She spies 
      something washed up on the sand, we can t see what.  A 
      jellyfish, maybe.  Moves closer, curious.  It s covered with 
      seaweed.  

      The Blond Girl reaches out, tentative, and pulls aside the 
      seaweed to reveal --

      A DEAD TEENAGE GIRL.  Swimsuit, thin braids tangled in 
      seaweed.  The little Blond Girl SQUEALS for her mom as a wave 
      washes over the body and we --

      INT. CBI HQ. SACRAMENTO - DAY (D/2)22

      A flurry of activity -- CHO and LISBON organize gear, load 
      guns, pack kits -- preparing to head out. 

      (In the b.g., JANE and VAN PELT walk around the room close 
      together (we don t know why yet), drawing closer to Lisbon.)  
      ON A MONITOR near Lisbon, a YEARBOOK PHOTO of our Teenage 
      Victim, smiling and happy (and wearing braids).  As RIGSBY 
      enters --

                                  LISBON
                    Victim is Christine Tanner, 
                    fifteen.  Drowned.  Washed up on 
                    the beach in Santa Marta.
                          (to the room)
                    Who s got the ultraviolet?

      Rigsby tosses her the ultraviolet wand, starts packing.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So she drowned.  Why us?

                                  LISBON
                    Coroner found a head wound 
                      consistent with getting hit by a 
                      surfboard, and found water in her 
                    lungs, only it was ditch-water.   
                    No salt.  Lot of bugs.    

                                  JANE
                      Excellent.
                          (off Lisbon)
                    The killer s clever, but not quite 
                    as clever as he thinks he is.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    The Santa Marta Sheriff s not 
                    taking this one?

                                  LISBON
                    State beach, State case.

      Lisbon eyes the photo of Christine on her computer screen.  
      The girl looks so happy.  

      Jane and Van Pelt near Lisbon, occasionally turning this way 
      or that.  Now Lisbon, puzzled, sees Jane has his hand lightly 
      on Van Pelt s wrist, as if taking her pulse while they walk.  
      Jane s very intense, eyes half-closed as if seeing something 
      no one else can.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    All right, what are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    Grace is mentally telling me where 
                    she hid the keys to the van.  If I 
                    find them, I get to drive.

                                  LISBON
                    So now you are a psychic.

                                  JANE
                    No no.  It s all science. 

      Jane, still touching Van Pelt s wrist, pirouettes away with 
      her, an eerie, slow-motion waltz.  Lisbon and the others 
      can t help watching...  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keep concentrating, Grace... With 
                    your mind only, tell me forward, 
                    backward, right, left...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       3.

                    How is that science?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ssssh!

      Rigsby s enthralled.  

      Jane puts out his hand as if feeling a vibration in the 
      air... 

                                  CHO
                          (to Van Pelt)
                    He watched you hide the keys.

                                  JANE
                    From the men s room?  Now that 
                    would be a trick.

      Jane reaches past Van Pelt, into the planter behind her.  
      Pulls out the keys.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Who s got shotgun?

      Off him, a smile as he leaves the others, flummoxed --

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SANTA MARTA BEACH - DAY (D/2 CONT D)33

      A memorial service on the rocks: A group of six or so TEENAGE 
      SURFERS, leis around their necks, stands on the rim of rocks 
      as crashing waves spray up at them.  Amongst them, featured 
      but not focussed on particularly -- Fit, tan, various shades 
      of blond -- are DANNY, 16, HOPE, 15, WIN, 15 and ANDY, 16.  
      (A few other locals watch the ceremony from the sand, 
      including SURFERS, 20 s to 50 s.)  

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby walk down the beach, toward this scene, 
      hot and awkward in their suits --

                                  CHO
                    You had the keys in your hand the 
                    whole time.

                                  JANE
                    Nope.

                                  CHO
                    Van Pelt told you beforehand.  

                                  JANE
                    If I tell you how it s done, the 
                    Magic Circle sends a team of 
                    assassins to kill us all.  It s the 
                    law. 

      They arrive at a MAKESHIFT SHRINE in the sand where people 
      have left flowers, candles, teddy bears, handwritten notes 
      around an old surfboard. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (pointing)
                    Her body was discovered right 
                    there.  Coast Guard says that means 
                    she was put in the water somewhere 
                    within a mile north of here.  Any 
                    further along the coast, the 
                    current would have taken her to 
                    Mexico.  

                                  JANE
                    How long was she in the water? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    We re waiting on the coroner s 
                    report.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       5.

      The mourning surfers toss their leis into the crashing surf, 
      then they clamber down from the rocks.

      Jane s gaze rakes the beach.  He zeroes in on one of the 
      spectators on the sand.  A surfer, 30's, more like a BEACH 
      BUM.  Stringy braids, unkempt; he seems very upset, pacing 
      and muttering to himself.  Jane starts to move toward the 
      bum, but Hope tentatively approaches the CBI trio.  Her 
      friend Win kinda scootches up behind her, drawing closer as 
      the conversation continues.  Danny and Andy walk away, up the 
      beach with their boards.

                                  HOPE
                    Hey.  Excuse me.  Are you guys 
                    cops?

                                  RIGSBY
                    CBI.

                                  HOPE
                    What s CBI?

                                  JANE
                    Cops.

      Hope turns toward Win.

                                  HOPE
                    They are cops.  
                          (to Jane et al)
                    I told him you were cops.  He 
                    thought you were like, men in 
                    suits.  So is it true what they re 
                    saying?  Somebody killed Chris?

                                  JANE
                    It s true.

      Hope and Win are appalled.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Christine was your friend?

                                  HOPE
                    Yeah.  We hang at the same breaks.  
                    I love Chris.  What happened?

                                  CHO
                    We don t know yet.  What s your 
                    name?

                                  HOPE
                    Hope.  That s Win.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       6.

                    Uh, three days ago?  Sunset patrol.  
                    Epic north-east swell.  Chris loved 
                    to go out at sunset.  She d stay

        ESTABLISHING a rundown little dump in a bad neighborhood.

      INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTINE S HOUSE - DAY66

      A dark cluttered wreck of a room.  Decent TV.  Lisbon and Van 
      Pelt talk to JACK TANNER, mid-30's, Christine s father.  
      Hollow-eyed and beaten down, a drinker -- Christine s loss 
      only the latest blow.  Also in the room is LISA, a tough 12,  
      and MICAH, 7, playing on a battered old Gameboy.  Both are 
      pale and exhausted from weeping. 

      Van Pelt s watching Lisbon like a hawk, trying to learn.

                                  TANNER
                    Excuse the mess.  Chris was the 
                      house-proud one around here.

                                  LISBON
                    We understand.  Mr. Tanner, we may 
                    have to ask some tough questions.  

      She looks at the kids meaningfully.

                                  TANNER
                    Huh?  Oh, that s okay.  Can t tell 
                    Lisa nothing she hasn t heard 
                    before, and Micah don t give a

                    that might have reason to do this?

      Darlene looks sly.

                                    DARLENE
                    Now that you mention it.  There was 
                    a guy... What was his name?

      Lisbon has heard that tone before.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, Darlene.  If you help us, I ll 
                    talk to the prosecutor.  See if I 
                    can help you on these charges 
                    you ve got pending.  

                                    DARLENE
                    OK.  Last year, Chris was banging 
                    an older guy.  Like old.  She 
                    called him Pops.

                                  LISBON
                    No name?  Just Pops?

                                    DARLENE
                    Pops.  That was it.  One time, she 
                    said he was getting weird, and she 
                    was talking about dumping him.  
                    But I don t know if she ever did.  
                    Like I say, we haven t been tight 
                    for a while now.

      Lisbon thinks she has a live lead.

                                  LISBON
                    That s interesting.  But it s not 
                    enough for a call to the D.A.  
                    Didn t she say anything else about 
                    him?  Anything at all?

                    likes fifties music.  You know --

      EXT. TRAILER PARK. NEAR BEACH - DAY1515

      An ancient trailer in the back row.  From deep inside the 
      dark interior we HEAR the muffled sound of sinister THRASH 
      METAL MUSIC, cranked high.   

      Lisbon and Rigsby cautiously approach.  No guns drawn, but 
      definitely ready for trouble.  Lisbon steps forward and BANGS 
      on the door with authority.

      THEIR POV - INSIDE THE TRAILER

      Makes Jame Gumb s basement look very done, very Hamptons 
      WASP.   The music is BANGING now.  Tension is high.  They

      A sullen  Flipper  in the chair.  Fancies himself a rebel  
        philosopher.  Lisbon and Jane seated opposite.

      Cho, Rigsby, Van Pelt working in the b.g. as Lisbon talks to 
      Jack Tanner.  Kids, Micah and Lisa, in tow.  Tanner is 
      agitated.  And drunk.  

                                  TANNER
                    Whaddaya mean  person of interest ?  
                    This guy kill my Chrissy or what? 

      He s loud.  The kids shrink back, but resignedly.  Used to 
      it.  Lisbon clocks it.  Her mouth tightens.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Tanner.  If we make an arrest, 
                    I will call you first, I promise.  
                    I m having someone take you home.

      She nods to a Deputy who tries to usher Tanner out.  But 
      behind Lisbon, Rigsby leads Handler out.  (Note:  Handler is 
      not under arrest so he is not handcuffed.)  Tanner sees them, 
      pushes by Lisbon, belligerent -- 

                                  TANNER
                    Is this him?  Is this him?

      Lisbon intercepts him.

                                  LISBON
                    Go home, Mr. Tanner.  Look after 
                    your children.

                                  TANNER
                    You re dead, bastard!  You re dead!

      Lisbon grabs him and shoves him toward the door.

                                  LISBON
                          (screaming)
                    Go home!  Now! 

      Tanner busts into tears.  Lisbon stands and looks at him, 
      frozen.  Lisa, leading Micah, comes and takes her father s 
      hand.

                                  LISA
                    Let s go home, Dad.

      Tanner obediently follows his daughter out with the Deputy.

      INT. BULLPEN.  SHERIFF S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER2020

      Lisbon briefs Cho, Van Pelt, and Rigsby.  They re all looking 
      at her like kids at the quiet calm teacher that just screamed 
      for the first time.

                                  LISBON
                    Coroner just told me Christine was 
                    put into the water sometime early 
                    Tuesday morning.  So this Monday 
                    night party is critical.  Somebody 
                    who was there must know what 
                    happened later that night.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY (D/3)2121

      Nice campus -- this school has money.  A memorial has just 
      been held for Christine Tanner.  A blown-up PHOTO of her sits 
      on an easel near the double doors.  Stragglers are still 
      leaving.  Danny, Win, Hope and Andy congregate on the steps.  
      The way Andy and Hope are casually entwined tell us they are 
      a couple.  Lisbon approaches.

                                  LISBON

                          (groans)
                    I already got the developer way up 
                    my tail-pipe -- we re three weeks 
                    behind thanks to the crappy labor 
                    pool here.

      He and the Cement Truck Driver exchange a glare --

                                    RAYBURN (CONT D)
                    An economy like this and people 
                    just don t show up for work?  
                    Boggles my mind. 

                                  LISBON
                    Anybody not show up lately?

      Jane clocks the remnants of a BONFIRE nearby, a circle of 
      stones and charred wood.  Lisbon looks at the waves crashing.  
      Gorgeous.

                                    RAYBURN
                    The night guard, just this week.  
                    Walked off the job.  Cement trucks 
                    show up in the morning, they can t 
                    get on the freaking site.  That 
                    alone put me back six hours.

      Lisbon and Jane exchange a glance.  Jane starts to look 
      around more intently.

                                  JANE
                    What section were you working then?

      He turns back to Lisbon, blank.  A beat.

                                  LISBON

                                    RAYBURN
                    Right.  So you think he might have 
                    done this murder?

      He leads the way.  

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon.  Come and have a look at 
                    this.

      Lisbon turns --

      Jane is crouched to study a new cement floor.  Lisbon comes 
      over and bends low like Jane.  

                                  LISBON
                    It s cement.  What.

                                  JANE
                    You have to let the light hit it 
                    right. 

      She sees what he sees.

                                  LISBON
                    Oh yes.  
                          (calling out)
                    Mr. Rayburn?

      Rayburn comes over and grudgingly bends down to look at the 
      cement floor in the same way.  

      RAYBURN S POV - When the light hits the cement right, out in 
      the middle of the floor, you can see a little pink bump, an 
        imperfection in the smooth surface.  

                                  JANE
                    See that?

      Rayburn walks over to the bump, bends down and touches it,  
      screams and falls on his ass.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY (D/3 CONT D)2525

      The body of Eddy Garcia, encased in a shroud of cement, is 
      lifted by a front-end loader toward the nearby Coroner s 
      wagon.  It s now a crime scene:  yellow tape, Deputies and 
      BFS doing their jobs.

      Lisbon and Jane talk with Rayburn. 

                                  LISBON
                    How is it you don t notice a nose 
                    in your floor? 

                                    RAYBURN
                    It s what I m telling you. 
                    We re trying to finish this thing 
                    too fast.

                    What the hell is going on here?

      DANE KURTIK - a large rich man - emerges from a black merc 
      that seemed to creep up unseen like a cat.  From the car 
      stereo comes the FAINT THUMP of clearable (1950 s) ROCKABILLY 
      music.  Kurtik sees Garcia s body.  

                                  KURTIK (CONT D)
                    Oh for heaven s sake.  That s a 
                    person?  Someone I employ?

                                  LISBON
                    We think so.

      Kurtik sighs wearily, pinches his nose.  

                                  KURTIK
                    God help me.  If it s not one 
                    thing...

      He turns on his heel and walks back to his car.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Kurtik, Dane Kurtik?

      Kurtik pauses impatiently, eyeing Jane and Lisbon.

      Two DEPUTIES launch on Kurtik.  Roaring with anger, he is

                                    MINELLI
                    You brought him all the way back 
                    here why?

                                  LISBON
                    The local Chief begged me not to 
                    put him in his jail.  Kurtik s a 
                    big cheese down there.  

                                    MINELLI
                    That is a signal, is that not a 
                    signal to cut the man loose?  

                                  LISBON
                    He hit Jane pretty good.  People 
                    were watching.  I had to arrest 
                    him. 

                                    MINELLI
                    This guy is connected.  This guy 
                    has the governor s home number.

                    And we both know Jane asked for it.   *
                    You couldn t give Kurtik a stern  *

                    What about Christine Tanner, sir?   *
                    If Kurtik was having sex with her,  *
                    that s motive to kill.   *

                                    MINELLI
                    If.  It s a hunch.  Based on 
                      rockabilly.

                                  LISBON
                    It s a Jane hunch.  You keep him 
                    around for a reason.
                          (beat)
                    Let us work Kurtik until his lawyer 
                    arrives, maybe we ll get something 
                    more.

                                    MINELLI
                    Work him gently.  

      Minelli walks on.  Turns.

                                    MINELLI (CONT D)
                    Is Jane okay?

                                  LISBON
                    Bruised.  I ll tell him you asked.

      Kurtik sits opposite Cho.  Both silent, gazing placidly at 
      each other.  Finally...

                                  CHO
                    Do you have a thing for youngsters 
                    in general, Dane?  Or was it 
                    Christine in particular that 
                    appealed to you?  That, I can 
                      understand.  Because you know, you  
                    meet some fifteen-year-olds, 
                    they re just as smart and mature 
                    and articulate as any adult.  
                    Right?  They are adults, basically.  
                    Maybe Christine was one of them.

                    Amazing.  People are stupid.  
                    Listen, I admire cops.  You do a

      He exits.  Lisbon sighs.

      Jane gathers his stuff, preparing to head out the door for 
      Santa Marta.  Dane Kurtik walks past with his fancy Lawyer, 
      enjoying the taste of freedom.  Kurtik sees Jane, tells the 
      Lawyer to wait and comes over.

                                  KURTIK
                    Just so you know, I m going sue the CBI

      He turns to go... Lisbon s right behind him.

                    Keep walking, Mr. Kurtik.  I might

      Late afternoon.  Spooky shadows growing.  Danny, Hope, Win 
      and Andy walk toward the fence.  Danny in the lead, as usual.  
      Hope, timid, clutching Andy s hand.  The gate ajar.

      He s suddenly right beside them, matching their stride.  The

                    the guard stumble across Chris

                    Bust my own dad?  It s not like he 
                    was forcing Chris to do it.  She

                    head.  No offense.

                                  JANE
                    That s the thing with hypnosis.  
                    I can t mesmerize you against your 
                    will.  It s not possible.  You re 
                    in control the whole time.
                          (a pleading smile)
                    What do you say?  Christine really 
                    needs your help.

      Off the kids, what else can they do but...

      EXT. SECRET BEACH/CONSTRUCTION SITE -NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER3333

      The kids now sit on a log near the crackling flames.  Jane 
      stalks among them.  We get a sense of the showman Jane once 
      was.  CU on Jane s fingers tapping his leg in rhythm, 
        establishing an  anchor  for the kids... He walks behind them 
      slowly --

                                  JANE
                    Close your eyes... Listen, listen 
                    only to my voice... And think of 
                    that night... the bonfire... the 
                    sound of the ocean... The sound of 
                    the ocean.  

      The kids fall into varying degrees of trance.  Andy resists, 
      but Hope is completely under, it seems.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you will recall 
                    of that night, but you will recall 
                    something because it s all there in 
                    your memory and all you have to do 
                    is go back to that night and be 
                    there, and there you are.  

                                  HOPE
                    Aaah!

      The others jump out of their trance states.

                                  JANE
                    What is it, Hope?  What do you see?

      Hope, eyes wide open, is still inside her memory.  She points 
      to the bluff.

                                  HOPE
                    I see, I see Danny s father.  
                    There.  Above the rocks.

                    him?

      Jane touches her shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    Come back now, Hope.

      Hope shakes off the trance state, looks confused.

                                  HOPE
                    What?  What happened?

      Danny splutters, lost for something to say.

                    Danny, wait.  Don t be mad...

      She disappears after him.

                    Wait...

                    Yeah, well, it s late anyway.

                    No problemo.

      Win walks off into the dark.  Andy scrambling to catch up.  
      Jane is left alone with the ocean and stars and crackling 
      fire.  A beat.

                                  JANE
                    You still there, Teresa?

      Lisbon emerges from the shadows.  She was watching his back.

                                  LISBON
                    Of course.  What would you do 
                    without an audience?  

      Jane grins appreciatively.

      INT. BULLPEN. SHERIFF S OFFICE - NEXT DAY (D/4)3434

      Morning.  Lisbon and Jane, near the big double doors, sipping 
      coffee and eating doughnuts.  Lisbon eyes her watch.

                                  LISBON
                    What do you think?  Did it work?

      Jane eyes his watch.

                    Three, two, one... Now!

      A beat.  Lisbon eyes Jane.  Jane laughs.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How cool would it have been if one 
                    of them had walked in?

      Just then the doors open.  It s Hope.  She smiles diffidently 
      at Jane and Lisbon, shy and childlike in the unfamiliar 
      surroundings.

                                  HOPE
                    Hi.  Did you arrest him?  Did he

                    Thing is, Hope, Mr. Kurtik has a  *

      Danny steps forward, drunk from booze and being 17 and 
      immortal.  An argument, Garcia grabs Danny s shoulder, Danny 
      breaks free, punches Garcia across the jaw with his fist.  
      Garcia goes down --

      A wet THWACK as Garcia s head hits the bulldozer blade.  
      Garcia doesn t move.  A beat and Christine runs to check

      Danny looks stricken as Hope repeats her story in his 
      presence.  Lisbon and Jane between them.

                    How can you do this?  I knew you 
                    had a cold streak, but this...

                                  HOPE
                    I m sorry, Danny.  I had to tell 
                    the truth.  You re only making it 
                    worse by lying.  You re only 
                    deceiving yourself. 

      Danny points at Hope.

                                  DANNY
                    It was her.  It was her who killed 
                    Chris.  Hope was jealous of her 
                    ever since she started hanging out 
                    with us.  Used to be it was Hope 
                    who was all that.  Then Chris 
                    arrives and we only hook up with 
                    Hope when, you know, Chris isn t 
                    around.

                                  HOPE
                    That s so distorted and not true.

                                  DANNY
                    No.  I m telling the truth now...

                    ...The guard -- it was an accident.  
                    But then Chris says she s going to 
                    call the police.  We can t cover it 
                    up she says.  It s wrong.   And 
                    Hope, I don t know, Hope just went 
                    crazy.  Killed her.

                    I am good to them.

      A defensive tone.  Don t get personal.  Tanner starts to walk 
      away and Lisbon is about to let him.  But then she goes after 
      him.
