      Under a twilight sky, a PICKUP TRUCK surges into the lot of 
      an isolated and iconic 1950 s motel. The sign above the 
      office reads: Glen Capri.

      Stepping out of the truck, a dark figure of a MAN quickly 
      pulls a heavy BAG from the inside and slams the door shut. 
      With a noticeable limp, he hurries to the motel office.

      As the door clatters shut, a NEWSPAPER lying under the murky 
      glass of its dispenser reveals the date: March 5th 1977.


      The KEY for ROOM 217 shakily approaches the door. Knuckles 
      bruised and speckled with DRIED BLOOD, the Man steadies his 
      hand and unlocks the room.


      A SHOTGUN BLAST tears through the night as the window of ROOM 
      217 lights with a FLASH and then turns red. 


      The view of the Glen Capri changes, exterior updating as 
      modern cars whip past while buildings rise up to surround the 
      still iconic but no longer isolated motel.

      A SCHOOL BUS rumbles into the lot, doors swinging open. Coach 
      and his Cross Country team disembark. An exhausted Scott and 
      Stiles step out, followed by Allison and Lydia.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ve seen worse.

                    Where have you seen worse?

      A WHISTLE BLOWS and Coach holds up a handful of ROOM KEYS in 
      front of the gathering students.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/133.

                    Listen up. The Meet s been pushed 
                    to tomorrow morning. This is the 
                    closest motel with the most 
                    vacancies and least amount of good

                      degenerates like yourselves. You ll 
                    be pairing up. Choose wisely.

      He begins handing the keys.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    You and you, fine. Scott, Stiles. 
                    Ethan, Danny--behave yourselves. 
                    Allison, Lydia... Allison, Lydia?

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks Coach.

      Allison grabs a key as a confused Coach looks after them. But 
      then gets back to addressing his team.

                                  COACH
                    And I ll have no sexual perversions 
                      perpetrated by you deviants. Got 
                    that? Keep your dirty little hands 
                    to your dirty little selves.

      Keys taken, the team heads for their rooms while the bus 
      moves on to park. But one person remains, still gazing up at 
      the motel with concern--

                                    ALLISON
                    Lydia?

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t like this place.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think the people who own 
                    this place like this place. It s 
                    just for a night.

                                  LYDIA
                    A lot can happen in a night.

        Reluctantly, she follows Allison to the motel.


      While the other team members hurry past, Allison pauses to 
      glance at Scott down the balcony corridor. He gives her a 
      reassuring smile and disappears inside his room with Stiles.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/134.

      Stepping into her own room, Allison drops her bag. But then 
      notices Lydia still at the threshold, unwilling to enter.

                                    ALLISON
                    You re really freaked out, aren t 
                    you?

                                  LYDIA
                    I just have this feeling like 
                    coming here wasn t an accident.

                                    ALLISON
                    What do you mean? Like we were 
                    supposed to come here? Like fate?

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t know. Something.

      Allison takes her by the hand, drawing her inside.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t believe in fate.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, maybe you should start.

      As Allison draws her inside, the door slowly closes behind 
      them to reveal the room number: 217.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Boyd s reflection appears over the plexiglass of a vending 
      machine. He gazes over the selections of chips and candy bars 
      with an oddly vacant expression.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/137.

      Stiles arrives behind him, smoothing out a dollar bill. He 
      watches Boyd slowly and methodically depress each button, 
      choosing the candy bar under number 201.

                                  STILES
                    Same thing I was going to get.

      The coils unwind to release the candy bar, but at the last 
      moment, it sticks.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Oh, don t worry, dude. I got a 
                    patented method for this.

      Stiles reaches up for the top of the vending machine to swing 
      it forward. But then he snaps his hands back when Boyd 
      PUNCHES a fist RIGHT THROUGH THE PLEXIGLASS. 

      Shards falling aside, Boyd calmly plucks the candy bar from 
      the steel coils. Then he turns and walks away, leaving a 
      shocked Stiles watching after him.


      Bursting through the door, Lydia hurries to the next room. As 
      Allison catches up behind her, she tries the knob. The door 
      swings open and--


      A STEEL BUCKET dives into an ICE MACHINE outside the motel s 
      office. Filling the bucket, Boyd reaches to close the lid. He 
      pauses, however, noticing the tiny cubes as they tumble in to 
      fill the recess. 

      Leaning closer, he notices a DARK SHAPE underneath the ice.

      Boyd lightly brushes the cubes aside with the tips of his 
      fingers. Something lies underneath the ice.

                                  GIRL S VOICE
                          (barely a whisper)
                    Don t...

      Boyd pulls back, breath caught in his throat.

                                  GIRL S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Don t leave me.

      Boyd inches forward again. He slowly pushes away the ice 
      trying to reveal what s underneath.

                                  GIRL S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Why did you leave me?

      The voice whispers up from the depths of the machine.

                                  BOYD
                    Alicia?

      Boyd digs in, ice spilling to the pavement below.

                                  GIRL S VOICE
                    You weren t supposed to leave me.

      Finally, Boyd stops as he uncovers the dead face of a YOUNG 
      GIRL in the ice. Her eyes snap open--

                                  GIRL S VOICE (CONT D)
                    YOU WEREN T SUPPOSED TO LEAVE ME.

      Boyd stumbles back in terror, letting the lid clatter shut as 
      he turns to run. THE ICE BUCKET drops from his hand, cubes 
      bouncing about the pavement as--


      Out past the first floor rooms, Ethan hurries with his arms 
      wrapped tightly around him. When he sees a group of STUDENTS, 
      he diverts past them to the stairs, heading up to the second 
      floor.


      With Allison and Lydia behind him, Stiles twists the knob on 
      Room 216 but the door won t budge.

                                  LYDIA
                    It wasn t locked before.

                                    ALLISON
                    Forget it. We need to get Scott, 
                    Isaac and Boyd and get them out of 
                    here.

      Stiles nods, starting away. Lydia, however, holds still when 
      she hears a surge of ELECTRICITY and the odd sound of BUZZING 
      coming from behind the door.

                                  LYDIA
                    I m not the only one who heard 
                    that, am I?

                                    ALLISON
                    It sounds like someone turned the 
                    hand saw on.

                                  STILES
                    Hand saw?


      Ethan hurries down the stairs to the first floor with Stiles, 
      Lydia and Allison trying to keep up.

      They watch him step into his room, door slamming shut.

                    What now?

                    I ll find Scott. You guys grab 
                    Isaac and Boyd. The best we can do 
                    is get them out of this place.

      She quickly hurries back up the stairs while Lydia notices 
      Stiles s eyes on her.

                    What? Why are you looking at me

                    Okay, I didn t want to say it. But 
                    we ve kind of been through 
                    something like this before. A lot 
                    like this.

                    What do you mean? When?

                    Your birthday party. The night you 
                    poisoned everyone with wolfsbane.


      Stepping quickly down the balcony, Allison reaches Scott and 
      Stiles s room. When she knocks on the door, it drifts open.

                                    ALLISON

      Stiles follows Lydia, trying to catch up with her.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia, I didn t mean you re trying 
                    to kill people. I meant that maybe 
                    you re somehow involved in getting 
                    people to kill themselves. Which 
                    now that I ve said it aloud sounds 
                    just as bad and yes, I will stop 
                    talking now.

      No longer listening to him, Lydia pauses at a SEWER GRATE 
      near her feet. A strange sound emanating from beneath it.

      A BABY CRYING.

                                  LYDIA
                    Stiles? Do you hear that?

      Fearful, Stiles shakes his head.

                    Stop. Please, just stop.

      The baby s cries turn to insistent SHRIEKS.

                    What do you want? I don t know what 
                    you want?

      on it.

      Allison hurries around a corner, nearly running into TWO 
      STUDENTS.

      A slow response of head shakes and shrugs sends her to the 
      next door, while below--


      Stiles runs to the bus in the lot. Yanking open the rear 
      door, he finds a ROADSIDE EMERGENCY BAG containing THREE ROAD 
      FLARES. He grabs two of them and slams the door shut again.


      Stiles and Lydia rush down to the first floor to meet with 
      Allison.

                    Yeah, I ll get it.

      Just as he s starting off, however, they all hear the 
        unmistakable SPARKING of an already LIT FLARE.

      All eyes turn to find Scott standing just past the parked 
      cars and holding the flare in one hand. Strangely, he s 
      dripping wet. Literally soaked all over. But the trail of 
      liquid leading to a tell-tale ORANGE CONTAINER nearby tells 
      them it's not water. 

      It's gasoline.

                    Every time I try to fight back, it 
                    just gets worse. People keep 
                    getting hurt. And the harder I try 
                    to protect everyone, the more 
                    people get hurt, the more people 
                    get killed.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1339.

                    That s not true.

                    It is.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, this isn t you. This is 
                    someone in your head telling you to 
                    do this.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if it s not? What if it is 
                    just me? What if doing this is 
                    actually the best thing I could do 
                    for everyone else?


      With the flare lowering dangerously close to the pool of 
      gasoline, Scott turns to Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    All of it started that night. The 
                    night I was bitten. Remember what 
                    it was like before that? You and 
                    me? We were nothing. We weren t 
                    popular. We weren t good at 
                    lacrosse. We weren t important. We 
                    were no one.
                          (softly)
                    Maybe I should be no one again. No 
                    one at all.

      Stiles takes a step forward, an odd calm replacing the panic.

                                  STILES
                    But you are someone. You re my best 
                    friend. You re my brother.

      He looks down at the line of gasoline leading toward the pool 
      in which Scott stands.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1340.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    So, I guess you re going to have to 
                    take me with you.

      And Stiles steps into the line of gasoline.


      One careful but deliberate step at a time, Stiles approaches 
      Scott. He reaches out. Scott s fingers tighten around the 
      flare. But Stiles gently grasps it and slowly pulls it from 
      his hand. 

      As the others breathe in relief, Stiles tosses the sparking 
      flare aside.

      Lydia watches it tumble across the pavement. Until a strange 
      GUST OF WIND sends it rolling back, right toward the pool of 
      gasoline.

                                  LYDIA
                    NO!

      Darting forward, she pushes Scott and Stiles to the ground as 
      a FIREBALL ERUPTS behind them.

      Flames flickering toward the sky, Lydia spots something 
      within the black smoke. Something appearing out of the 
      darkness, almost right out of hell--

      A FACE with severe lacerations scarring the ashen skin, as if 
      it had been slashed over and over by claws. Its round eyes 
      focused on Lydia, the creature bares rotted teeth at her with 
      a hate-filled SHRIEK.

      And then VANISHES into the shadows.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
