  FADE IN:


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - MORNING

  A glaring, oppressive sun fills the frame. Muddled, 
  INDISTINCT SOUNDS echo as if from a great distance.

  CAMERA TILTS DOWN

  away from the sun, SWAYING and REELING. Glimpses of the 
  bustling morning market fall in and out of frame. MERCHANTS 
  gawk at us, voices muted as if underwater. A WOMAN gasps. A 
  FRIGHTENED CHILD stares and points. As SOUND RUSHES into 
  full clarity, reverse to REVEAL we are in the POV of

  BATIATUS

  Bloody and severely beaten. Disoriented. Lurching through 
  the streets. As he winces in pain...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  FLASHES OF THE VIOLENT BEATING from the end of HB1. BLOOD, 
  DIRT, FISTS, PISS. VETTIUS and his MEN rain blows on 
  Batiatus, TULLIUS looming over him.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

  Batiatus staggers, desperately groping for assistance. He 
  keels sideways, losing consciousness. Just as his face is 
  about to connect with the ground --

                                                                            SMASH TO:


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus startles awake, alone in his bed. Face battered, 
  but now a week into healing. A moment of panic, quickly 
  passing as he gains his bearings. Just another torturous 
  nightmare of his humiliation.

  BATIATUS PAINFULLY RISES

  Naked. Body still dappled with ugly bruises and cuts. He 
  grimaces, gathering his robes with some difficulty.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  LUCRETIA

                        broach subject again.

  She spots Batiatus, freezes in disapproving surprise.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Why are you from your bed? Medicus 
                        gave plain instruction. You are to 
                        rest.

                        A week upon my back sees advice 
                        well heeded. More and even my cock 
                        will cease knowing how to stand.

                                        GAIA
                                  laughs)(
                        His spirit returns.

                        Help him with his robes.

  Batiatus waves them off, flaring as he dresses himself.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am not a babe newly dropped from 
                        fucking womb.

                        Yes, Domina.

  Diona and Naevia exit. Gaia, sensing Batiatus' prickly mood, 
  makes excuse to leave.

                                        GAIA
                        I always follow the wine...

  She forces an encouraging smile, exits. Batiatus glowers.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Has she not yet found some fool's 
                        bed to fall to? Or is her sole 
                        intent in Capua to drink us dry?

  Lucretia falters slightly under the weight of her recent 
  sexual indiscretions with Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She has been of great comfort.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And seeks the word for herself.

  He winces. Lucretia gently helps him with his robes. He 
  reluctantly accepts it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Who do you think wiped my tears, 
                        when my husband was returned to me, 
                        bloodied and broken? His life in 
                        question?

  Fresh tears well in her eyes. He takes her hand, softening.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I live. And have thoughts towards 
                        continuing so. I would not have my 
                        injuries wound you as well.

  He gently kisses her. She draws strength from his touch.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is a balm, to see you upon your 
                        feet. You will speak to the 
                        Magistrate about this?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Towards what end?

                      He is a puppet. What redress would 
                        Sextus offer, when the man who 
                        grieved me holds his strings?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Tullius has always been beloved by 
                        Capua.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A man of ambition is capable of 
                        anything.

  OFF BATIATUS, darkening at the thought..


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - CAPUA - DAY

  TULLIUS walks with VETTIUS. THERON, Tullius' bodyguard, 
  trails. Tullius smiles and nods at MERCHANTS and 
    TOWNSPEOPLE. A man indeed much beloved.

                                          TULLIUS
                                to Vettius)(
                      My dealings with the Magistrate 
                        take precedence tomorrow. I would 
                        have you greet Varus in my stead.

                                          VETTIUS
                        The honor would be mine. The man 
                        pisses wine and shits gold.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Varus is but a stream leading to an 
                        ocean of coin. One I would see 
                        break wave upon our steps.

                                          VETTIUS
                      He comes to choose men?

                                          TULLIUS
                        For the games of the Vinalia, to 
                        ensure his vines bear fruit in the 
                        coming year.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I will present only our finest 
                        gladiators.

  Tullius spots SOLONIUS with a WINE MERCHANT.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I would enrich our stock, and offer 
                        him Gannicus as well...

    A calculating smile bends his lips.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  ON SOLONIUS

  as he argues with the Merchant over an AMPHORA of wine.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  re: wine jug)(
                        This had best be the Falernian 
                        promised. If I find you have 
                        foisted your usual swill, we will 
                        have words.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S)
                        Put mind to ease.

  Tullius appears at his elbow with Theron, sans Vettius. 
  Solonius tenses, forces a smile.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius.

  Tullius points to the SEAL on the wine jug.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Note sun and mountains etched in 
                        the amphora. Proof of its 
                          authenticity.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Oh. Yes, of course.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I was unaware you had an 
                        appreciation for such tastes, 
                        Solonius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A gift for a friend recovering from 
                        unfortunate injury.

  Tullius smiles knowingly, fishes coins from purse.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Please. Allow me.

                        Appreciated, but unnecessary.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I believe it is.

  Solonius acquiesces.

                      To be returned in kind.

  Solonius eyes him uncomfortably.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I have done nothing to deserve it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A matter shortly to be rectified. 
                        Come. I would discuss message to be 
                        delivered with our gift. Better 
                        received from your tongue than 
                        mine.

  Solonius reluctantly moves off with Tullius, WIPING US TO:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  GLADIATORS and RECRUITS trade bone-jarring blows with 
  practice swords. GANNICUS spars with BARCA and AUCTUS, 
  taking both men on with a grin and a laugh. ASHUR, DAGAN, 
  and INDUS run drills under the watchful eye of DOCTORE.

  A BLOODIED CRIXUS

  spars with OENOMAUS. Crixus attacks with a roar, swinging 
  wildly.

  BALCONY

  Gaia sips wine. Naevia and DIONA attend her.

                                        GAIA
                        The Gaul is quite the beast.  What 
                        name does he take?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies. I do not know.

                        His name is Crixus. He trains in 
                        the style of Murmillo.

  Gaia catches the excitement in Diona's eyes.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

                      Or does it land only upon the men 
                        who play them?

  Diona flushes, embarrassed. Gaia laughs.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                      So easily made to blush. A sign of 
                        tragic inexperience. I have not 
                        turned such a color since before 
                        you were born.

  Gaia brushes a stray lock of hair from Diona's face. A 
  gesture loaded with underlying sensuality.

  Her eyes dance as she glances back down to the

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Oenomaus counters, smashes him to the ground.

                        stronger opponent, draw him to you 
                        and counter. Again!

  Oenomaus attacks. Crixus defends, driven back. Oenomaus 
  thrusts at his midsection. Crixus sidesteps and counters, 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

  Crixus grins, hustles over to Ashur, Dagan, and Indus.

                        Dagan expresses his joy at finding 
                        you yet among us. We feared you

                        sand you have been eating.

  Ashur attacks. Crixus counters, sends him face first into 
  the ground. Ashur spits sand. Crixus laughs good-naturedly.

                                        CRIXUS
                      An acquired taste. Come. I would 
                        serve you more.

  Ashur laughs as Crixus offers a hand to help him up. Doctore 
  nods in approval to Oenomaus, who takes a cup of water from 
  the rain barrel.

                                          DOCTORE

                        Crixus is undisciplined. But not

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I will think upon the matter.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius requires answer.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And I require a fucking moment!

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He wishes to present your man to 
                        Quintilius Varus tomorrow.

  Gaia perks up.

                                        GAIA
                        Varus? He comes to Capua?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Vettius is to meet him as he enters 
                        the city midday.

                        I held his acquaintance in Rome. A 
                        man of great influence. And coin.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Solonius)(
                        You would beg for Tullius' scraps?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Without them, I fear we shall both 
                      go hungry.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

  Solonius places a warm hand on Batiatus' shoulder.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Think upon it. And know that I 
                        stand with you, whatever your 
                        decision.

  Solonius nods to Lucretia and Gaia, exits.

                                        GAIA
                        I have witnessed more rigid spine 
                        within a snail.

  Batiatus moves to the railing, looking out at his men. His 
  eyes fall on Gannicus as he playfully spars with Oenomaus.

                        What are your thoughts?

  He doesn't answer, the conflict roiling in his eyes.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Indus crashes to the ground. Dagan is on him in a flash, 
  practice sword to his throat. Indus holds up two fingers. 
  The missio, a sign of surrender. Batiatus erupts.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore! Send that man to the 
                        fucking mines!

  The men react in surprise. Doctore attempts to intervene.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Dominus --

                                        BATIATUS
                      We do not surrender in this fucking 
                        house! I will see these walls fall 
                      to ruin before missio is given!

  Doctore barely holds his tongue, nods to the Guards. Indus 
  is led off. A forboding sight for Crixus, Ashur, and Dagan. 
  Gaia considers Batiatus with increasing appreciation.

                                        GAIA
                      It appears decision is made.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Tullius but brokers interest. If a 
                        man of wealth and position such as 
                        Varus requested my men, even he 
                        would be unable to refuse.

                        But he meets with Vettius. You 
                        expect that fucking child to make 
                          introduction?

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. I expect him to bleed, as I rip 
                        Varus from his grasp.

  OFF Batiatus, reveling in the thought...


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  GRUEL slops into a bowl. WIDEN TO REVEAL Crixus, Ashur, and 
  Dagan receiving their evening meal after the gladiators have 
  had their fill. They pass Barca sitting with Auctus, who 
  feeds a PIGEON crusts of bread.

                                        BARCA
                                (calling to

                        Your numbers shrink like frightened 
                        cock.

  The Gladiators LAUGH. Dagan glares, not caring for the tone.

                                        DAGAN

  Dagan takes a step towards Barca. Ashur stops him.

                      If it were a brother lost, you 
                        would find the mood solemn. We must 
                        earn the fucking mark to gain 
                        respect. Or follow Indus to his

                                        CRIXUS

                        forgotten by history.

                      We shall rise together. One day all 
                        the Republic will marvel at the 
                        sight of us.

  Ashur takes a mouthful of porridge, immediately spits it. 
  Barca, Auctus, and the Gladiators bellow with laughter.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Fucking savages. They pissed in the 
                        porridge.

  Crixus sniffs his bowl, glares. OFF the humiliation...


  INT. OENOMAUS' CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Gannicus freshens Oenomaus' cup from a jug of wine. Both are 
  bruised by the day's sparring.

                        victory.

  The cell door opens, revealing Melitta escorted by a GUARD.

                        Finally, someone who can hold their

  He pours her a cup. Melitta hits Oenomaus with a questioning 
  smile.

                        I do not hold you at a distance.
                                  including Oenomaus)(
                        You are my two favorite women in 
                        the world.

  Gannicus cracks up. Oenomaus suppresses a smile.

                                          MELITTA
                        And what happens, brave Gannicus, 
                        when presented with circumstance 
                        you cannot laugh or fight your way 
                        clear of?

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then I suppose I will have to fuck 
                      my way out of it.

  Gannicus laughs, exits. OFF Melitta, not caring for the 
  exchange...


  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Gannicus passes Barca's cell. Pigeons COO in their wooden 
  cages as Barca and Auctus kiss. Auctus grins in pleasure, 
  Barca's hand moving rhythmically BELOW FRAME as he jerks his 
  lover off. Gannicus laughs, but there's a sadness to it.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Everyone's in fucking love.

                        Gannicus --

  Gannicus WHIRLS around and pins Crixus with a forearm to the 
  throat.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Never come up upon my back.

                        Apologies. I sought only advice 
                        towards the coming days.

  Gannicus gauges him, removes his arm.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Heed Oenomaus' instruction and you 
                        will earn your brand. Till then, 
                        stay from fucking sight.

                                        CRIXUS
                      It is not the brand that concerns 
                        me. It is becoming champion.

  Gannicus eyes him, laughs. The kid's got balls.

                                        GANNICUS
                        There is only one way to become 
                        champion, little man. Never fucking 
                        lose.

  Gannicus exits, leaving Crixus to ponder the weight of his 
  advice. MOVE OFF CRIXUS, rising into the rafters as we 
  TRANSITION TO:


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - MORNING

  RISING UP FROM THE FLOOR, night shifting to morning. Naevia, 
  Diona, and other SLAVES bustle about, preparing the villa. 
  Batiatus walks with the Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See Barca readied. He is to 
                        accompany me into the city.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Another stunt in the market?

                        the Syrians also prepared. Absent 
                        shackles and clothed for the 
                        streets.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                                        BATIATUS

  Doctore bristles.

                                          DOCTORE
                        With respect, Dominus, I am the 
                        Doctore.  The men are my only

                        A duty awarded you by my father.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A man who would not have condemned 
                        a promising recruit to the mines 
                        out of a mood.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Recruits, gladiators, even you are 
                        but slaves. Mine to command, 
                        despite my fucking moods.

  Doctore reins himself back in, nods in deference. Batiatus 
  considers Doctore, wheels turning.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You truly believe this man ripe

                                          DOCTORE
                        Indus will never be champion. But 
                      he is not without skill.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See him loaded with the Syrians. I 
                        will give him opportunity to yet 
                        prove his worth.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Dominus.

  Doctore exits, satisfied. Lucretia passes him as she enters 
  dressed in her finest. Batiatus beams at the sight of her.

  OFF Batiatus' determination...


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

  The streets are a crush of activity. FIND Barca standing 
  sentry at the mouth of an alley. Behind him Batiatus 
  instructs Ashur, Dagan and Indus, all in robes with hoods.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Each of you know your part. See the 
                        act to successful completion, and 
                        earn the Mark of the Brotherhood.

  Indus grins, cheered by this reversal of fortune.

                                        INDUS
                        Without proving ourselves in the 
                        test?

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is your test. But turn 
                        thoughts toward escape or fail in 
                        your charge... and I will see you 
                        parted from your cocks and 
                        crucified.

  Ashur, Dagan, and Indus raise their hoods and disappear into

  Batiatus heads out into the market with Barca, WIPING US TO:


  EXT. CAPUA STREET - DAY

  The nearly completed arena looms in the distance at the end 
  of the street. ADJUST TO FIND Gaia and Lucretia approaching, 
  attended by Melitta and ATTENDING SLAVES. Lucretia eyes the 
  scene nervously.

  Gaia takes her in with appreciation, adjusts a bit of fabric 
  at Lucretia's breast.

  coming down the street.

  Gaia adjusts her ample cleavage. OFF Lucretia, her concerned 
  doubled now that Gaia has revealed an agenda of her own...


  EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

  Batiatus glances at a MERCHANT's wares, keeping half an eye 
  on the crowd. He spots VETTIUS walking with purpose, flanked 
  by two huge BODYGUARDS. Batiatus nods to

  INDUS

  across the square, indicating Vettius. Indus nods, his 
  target acquired. Batiatus fades into the crowd with Barca 
  before Vettius can spot him.

  He starts to move on.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Wait.
                                  forced smile)(
                        Varus is honored guest. As such, I 
                      am but humble servant.

  Vettius indicates for Indus to lead the way. OFF Indus' 
  grin, the plan working...


  EXT. ALLEY - CAPUA STREETS - DAY

  Indus leads Vettius and his Bodyguards down an alley removed 
  from the crush of the marketplace.

                                        INDUS
                        Apologies for the inconvenience. 
                        Dominus will be most pleased that 
                        you have accompanied me.

  Vettius stops, frowning at his surroundings.

                                          VETTIUS
                        You have turned yourself about. 
                        This is not the direction of the 
                        fucking arena.

                                        INDUS
                                  with a smile)(
                        No. It is not.

  WHAM! Indus suddenly kicks Vettius hard in the balls. 
  Vettius crumples in agony. His Bodyguards start for Indus.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  emerge from the shadows behind them, hoods raised. They set 
  upon the men with daggers, brutally stabbing them to death.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                        continues kicking until Vettius is 
                      an unconscious, bloody mess. Ashur 
                        finishes his grim work, pulls Indus 
                        off.

                                        ASHUR
                      We are to leave this one alive, you 
                        simple fuck!
                                (to Dagan, in 
                                  Aramaic)
                        'Aved-leh. [Do it.]

  Dagan grins as he reaches down OUT OF FRAME, parts his 
  robes, and PISSES on Vettius' battered face. Indus laughs in 
    adrenaline-fueled relief.

                                        INDUS
                        Our charge is met. I will not see 
                        the mines.

                                        ASHUR
                        I fear they would have been a 
                        blessing.

  Ashur suddenly SLITS INDUS' THROAT. Indus gurgles in shock. 
  Ashur catches him, gently easing him to the ground.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Apologies, brother. Vettius saw 
                        your face. Dominus gave 
                        instruction.

  The life fades from Indus' eyes. Ashur and Dagan raise their 
  hoods and disappear down the alley, WIPING US TO:


  EXT. CAPUA STREET - DAY

  QUINTILIUS VARUS, 40s, glowers by his litter. He is a high-
  class Roman, adorned in colorful robes and jewelry. Carries 
  himself as if the rest of the world is steeped in shit. He 
  frowns at the crowd, growls to an ATTENDING SLAVE.

                                        VARUS

  Varus turns to find Gaia approaching. Gaia beams at their 
  "chance" meeting.

  She motions Lucretia over, who has busied herself pretending 
  to examine a MERCHANT'S JEWELRY.

                        are the saving grace of this ill-
                        bred town.

  Lucretia joins them. Gaia introduces her.

                        This is Quintilius Varus, an

                        I fear it shall be tragically one 
                        sided.  The sun threatens to bake 
                      me senseless.

  Gaia looks to Lucretia, a subtle smile bending her lips.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband's villa is but a little 
                        ways from here. You are more than

                        Gratitude. But I would seek Vettius 
                        out, and place foot to ass for his 
                        delay.

  Varus motions for his Slaves to prepare the litter. Lucretia 
  shoots Gaia a nervous look. Varus slips from grasp.

                        They can just as easily bring him 
                      to her villa when discovered. It 
                        would give us much needed pause to 
                        reacquaint ourselves.

  She produces an irresistible smile. He laughs, gives in.

                                        VARUS
                      It would be ungrateful, to refuse 
                        such kind offering.
                                to Lucretia)(

  OFF Lucretia's smile of relief and victory...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Varus sips wine, regaling Lucretia with stories of Rome. 
  Diona and Naevia stand with other Attending Slaves.

                                        VARUS
                        The last time I was blessed with 
                        Gaia's presence was at this sober,

  Lucretia rises to meet Batiatus as he enters. Batiatus acts 
  surprised to find Varus.

                        warm hospitality.

  laughs in embarrassment.

                        I was told by good Tullius his 
                        stable was well stocked.

                        quantity, of the lowest quality. 
                        Come. Let us sample a finer 
                        vintage...

  She takes his arm, tossing Batiatus and Lucretia a wry smile 
  as she leads him out, WIPING US TO:


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' VILLA - SUNSET

  Practice swords CLASH as the men train. Gannicus and 
  Oenomaus spar. Gannicus lands a blow, laughs.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Bested me in training, did you?

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  laughs)(
                      As I shall again today.

  Oenomaus rears back to attack, but is interrupted by 
  Batiatus appearing on the balcony with Varus, Gaia, and 
  Lucretia. Naevia accompanies.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore! Call the men to form.

  Doctore CRACKS his whip.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Present yourselves!

  The men stop training, fall in for review. Gaia eyes them 
  with hungry appreciation.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                        Did I not tell you? The finest 
                        gladiators in all of Capua.

  Varus takes them in, considering. Melitta enters with Diona, 
  carrying more wine.

                                        VARUS
                          A demonstration, perhaps?

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of course.
                                  calling down)(
                        Gannicus! Step forward.

  Gannicus grins, complies.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Behold! My finest champion! No man 
                        stands his equal.

  Oenomaus feels the sting of that, shares a pained look with 
  Melitta.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And who would you have face this 
                        god of the arena?
                                  indicating choices)(
                        Barca, perhaps? Or Oenomaus, who 
                        once fought so bravely against --

                                        GAIA
                                  indicating Crixus)(
                        What about the Gaul? Who would not 
                        marvel at seeing such a creature 
                        locked in mortal embrace.

  She shoots a knowing smile to Diona, who averts her eyes in 
    embarrassment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus? Apologies, the man does not 
                        yet bear the Mark of the 
                        Brotherhood.

                                        VARUS
                        Yet he is presented.

                        I fear the contest may be overly 
                        brief.

                        A blessing, considering the heat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let us move to it then.

  He gives Gaia an unhappy look. She responds with a disarming 
  smile, impervious to such things.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Crixus! Step forward!

  Crixus registers surprise. So do the other men as he steps 
  forward.

                                        AUCTUS
                                  soft, to Barca)(
                        A fucking jest.

  Doctore looks questioningly to Batiatus. Batiatus shoots him 
  a frown. Keep fucking quiet.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The House of Batiatus is humbled by 
                        the attentions of Quintilius Varus. 
                        Show him they are not unwarranted.

                                        VARUS
                        Apologies, are they to use those 
                        little wooden sticks?

                                        BATIATUS
                      It is the tradition, when blood is 
                        not the purpose.

                                        VARUS
                      So they are to fight as children? 
                        Not men?

  Batiatus squirms. Gaia gives him a veiled look, urging him 
  to acquiesce. Batiatus smiles, nods.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would not see you to such 
                        impression. Doctore! See wood give 
                        way to steel.

  Doctore barely holds his tongue, not caring for this at all. 
  He barks to the LUDUS SLAVE.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Gladius!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.
  CONTINUED:

  Real swords are produced. Crixus takes his, doubt clouding 
  his eyes. Gannicus grins, gripping his usual twin blades.

                                        GANNICUS
                        The gods must have heard you. They 
                        present opportunity to become 
                        champion.

  Crixus licks his lips, pushes his doubt aside. Gannicus is 
  right: this is his chance. Gaia tenses with excitement. 
  Batiatus raises his fist, brings it down.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus CHARGES with a whirlwind of blows. Gannicus laughs, 
  impressed as he blocks each one.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus has trained you well.

  Gannicus counters, draws blood.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        Yet you are pale imitation of the 
                        man.

  Crixus snarls, redoubles his assault. They trade thunderous 
  blows, but Crixus is obviously outmatched.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  emerge from the ludus barracks, returned to proper attire. 
  Ashur registers surprise -- and sadness -- at the fight.

                                        ASHUR
                                (in Aramaic, re: 
                                  Crixus)
                        Nasha Hrena minnan nafel yawma 
                        dena. [Another one of us falls this 
                        day.]

  Gannicus drives Crixus back, hacking and slashing. Batiatus 
  glances over to Varus to gauge the man's interest. And is 
    disappointed to find him barely watching, instead whispering 
  to Gaia. She laughs, playfully swatting at him.

                                        GAIA
                        You lie! I did no such thing!

  Batiatus shoots Lucretia a sour look. What the fuck is that 
  woman doing?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.
  CONTINUED:

  GANNICUS

  presses his attack, laughing. But Crixus suddenly sidesteps 
  and spins around, as Doctore taught him. Lucretia gasps in 
  surprise as Crixus draws blood. The Gladiators are just as 
  shocked as Gannicus.

  CRIXUS

  surges, pressing his advantage. He catches Gannicus across 
  the jaw with his shield, sending him to a knee.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus leaps, sword swung high, ready to sever Gannicus' 
  head from his body. Melitta's eyes widen in horror. Batiatus 
  constricts, the impossible happening.

  TIME RESUMES

  as Crixus descends -- and Gannicus CATCHES the strike with 
  his swords crossed in front of him. A frozen moment.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  sincerely)(
                        A fine attempt.

  WHAM! Gannicus disarms Crixus and sends him crashing to the 
  sand. Crixus reaches for his sword but Gannicus is on him in 
  a flash, his weapon at the Gaul's neck. Gannicus looks to 
  Batiatus for instruction. Batiatus laughs, delighted.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Now that is demonstration unlike 
                        any before it! What say you, good 
                        Varus? Should the Gaul live or die?

  Varus glances down, only marginally interested.

                                        VARUS
                        Gaia chose the man. The choice is 
                        hers.

  Gaia considers Crixus, smiles.

                                        GAIA
                        Let him live. He may yet find his 
                        use.

  Batiatus nods to Gannicus. Gannicus grins, offers Crixus a 
  hand up. He takes it, relief washing across his face.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                        What of my man Gannicus? Did you 
                        find --

                                        GAIA
                        The man is weary from his travels.

                        business.
                                to Varus)(
                        Come. See yourself inside, to 
                        sample other indulgences. Some 
                        delights from Cyprus, perhaps...?

  Varus smiles, his interest returning.

                                        VARUS
                        A region I am most fond of.

                      As I recall.

  Gaia motions him in. Batiatus stops her before she can 
  follow.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hissing)(

                        What I do best. Varus is a man of 
                        particular appetites. Which grow 
                        large under influence of wine and 
                        opium. See your man Gannicus oiled 
                        and scented, to be presented as the 
                        hour passes.

  She slips into the villa to join Varus. Batiatus seethes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I risk all to lure Varus to our 
                        house, only to find I am no longer 
                        the master of it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She knows the man more intimately. 
                      We must lend our trust.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And pray it is not soiled upon 
                        return.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Lucretia, increasingly uncertain of 
  where exactly Gaia's true intentions lie...                                                                                    37.


  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Doctore trails in Batiatus' agitated wake.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See Gannicus prepared to my 
                        instructions and brought up to the 
                        villa.

                                          DOCTORE
                        What will be required of him?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Whatever I fucking desire.

  Batiatus heads off. Doctore calls after him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ashur and Dagan returned absent 
                        Indus.  Did he not prove himself?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He did. And was well rewarded.

                                          DOCTORE
                        And the Syrians? Are they to be 
                        "rewarded" as well?

                                        BATIATUS
                        With the Mark of the Brotherhood.

  Doctore barely contains his disgust.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The mark? Without proving 
                        themselves in the test?

                                        BATIATUS
                        They proved themselves in my test. 
                        See it done.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your father would not approve.

                                        BATIATUS

                        A fact well known.

  Batiatus locks eyes with Doctore, his eyes flashing murder. 
  Doctore holds Batiatus' gaze in defiance.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        Syrians. And inform Oenomaus he 
                        will be assuming mantle of Doctore.

                        Shadows of the past, soon to fade 
                        from memory.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Doctore, his world disintegrating...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Smoke from braziers of HEMP SEEDS waft through the 
  triclinium. Diaphanous curtains have been drawn to trap it. 
  A den of sensual decadence. Melitta attends Lucretia and 
  Gaia. Varus is fanned by his Slaves. Naevia and Diona are 
  not present.

  GAIA

  sprinkles OPIUM POWDER in a golden bowl of wine, presents it 
  to Varus.

                                        GAIA
                        Look at how it caresses the wine. 
                      Is there anything so enticing?

  Varus eyes her with a smile.

                                        VARUS
                        I have seen its rival.

  Varus sips the opium wine, passes the bowl to Lucretia.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                        This house indeed offers many 
                        pleasures.

                        With more yet to be presented.

  She hesitates, drinks.

  OUTSIDE THE CURTAINS

  Batiatus approaches with Gannicus, instructing in hushed 
  tones.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Pleasing this man must now become 
                        your sole fucking purpose.

  Gannicus eyes him, not liking the sound of that.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Please him? In what manner?

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hissing)(
                        I have had fill of being questioned 
                      by slaves. If Varus wishes you to 
                        suck his cock dry, you will savor 
                        each fucking drop. Are we of 
                        singular mind?

  Gannicus sees he has no choice.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Dominus.

  Batiatus parts the curtains, making grand entrance.

                                        BATIATUS
                      In honor of distinguished guest, I 
                        present my finest man for personal 
                        viewing. Behold Gannicus. Yours to 
                        command.

  Gannicus shoots Melitta a worried look. Varus chuckles, the 
  opium beginning to take affect.

                                        VARUS
                        You are quite the lanista, 
                        Batiatus. I have never been so well 
                        plied towards aid of a sale.

                                        GAIA
                        This is not about business. This is 
                        how they live. They grab life. And 
                        squeeze until the juice flows...

                        How do you always come by such 
                        marvelous acquaintance?

                      It is a gift.

  Varus' eyes crawl over Gannicus.

                                        VARUS
                        One among many set before me.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Is he not of a form, our champion?

                                        VARUS
                        I have not seen his like. And more 
                        than a few have stood before me...

  He circles Gannicus, his fingers gently tracing oiled flesh. 
  Gannicus remains as stoic as possible, but his eyes belie 
  humiliation -- and dread.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man stands as a god. The arena 
                        his Olympus. He once thrust his 
                        blade so deep into his opponent's 
                        breast, tears turned to blood.

                                        VARUS
                        I am not impressed by inflated 
                        tales. My interests are grounded... 
                      By what I can see... What I can 
                        touch...

  Varus slips his hand down into Gannicus' subligaria. 
  Gannicus' jaw clenches. Varus smiles.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                        Now that... is impressive. Are you 
                      as skilled in its use as you are 
                        with a sword?

  Gannicus looks to Batiatus. Batiatus glares a warning.

                                        GANNICUS
                                to Varus, soft)(

                        I would have demonstration.

                        privacy.

  Batiatus motions for Gaia and Lucretia to exit. Varus 
  laughs.

                        You mistake intent. I have had too 
                        much wine and other pleasures for 
                        such rough exertion. No, I would 
                        prefer a feast of the eyes.

                        Have him fuck this one, and I shall 
                        watch.

  Melitta reacts, shocked. Gannicus shares it. Lucretia 
  stammers.

                        Apologies...

                                        BATIATUS
                        She is. And will do as commanded.

  Batiatus nods to Melitta, his eyes flashing a warning. OFF 
  Melitta, realizing she has no choice but to betray her 
  husband...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON a HOT BRAND brought to bear on flesh. WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Doctore roughly applying it to a kneeling Dagan. A 
  small crowd of Gladiators has gathered to watch. Crixus 
  stands at the back. Dagan grunts in pain.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Welcome to the fucking Brotherhood.

  He kicks Dagan to the ground, stabbing the brand back into 
  the fire. Ashur, kneeling beside Dagan, eyes it in 
    trepidation. Oenomaus appears from the barracks, surprised.

                                        OENOMAUS

                        upon sacred rites.

  Doctore brands him, grinding the hot metal into his forearm. 
  Ashur half screams in pain.

                        think yourself a gladiator, you 
                        little cunt.

  Doctore raises the brand to club Ashur with it. Oenomaus

  OFF Doctore's confusion and shock...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Melitta stands frozen as Gannicus approaches her. She 
  glances to Lucretia, who is sympathetic, but offers no 
  solution. Varus sits eating a bowl of cherries.

                        Remove her dress.

  Gannicus hesitates. Batiatus glares. Gannicus reluctantly 
  complies, slipping Melitta's dress off. Her eyes well with 
  tears as it hits the floor, TRANSITIONING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Swords CLASH as Doctore unleashes his fury on Oenomaus. 
  Oenomaus defends himself, but does not return the attack. 
  Crixus and the other men watch the battle in silence, 
  trading uncomfortable glances.

                                          DOCTORE
                      Is this what I taught you? How to

                        yourself worthy!

  Doctore slices Oenomaus across the chest. Oenomaus grunts in 
  surprise. His own eyes fill with pain and rage as he 
  unleashes a vicious assault. Doctore counters, slamming him 
  to the ground.

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Gannicus lays Melitta down, his face wracked by guilt and 
  regret.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        See it done.

  A tear crests her cheek. Gannicus enters her. She gasps. He 
  begins moving inside her. Slowly at first, but with building 
  intensity.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  The blood flows as Doctore and Oenomaus trade blows. A 
  battle of the titans.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Gannicus thrusts with increasing purpose. Despite the 
    circumstance, he begins losing himself in the moment.

  VARUS

  watches, delighted and aroused. He slips a hand into his 
  robes BELOW FRAME and begins to masturbate. Gaia eyes him, 
  reaches over BELOW FRAME -- and retrieves a cherry. She 
  bites into the fruit with a satisfied smile.

  MELITTA

  begins to react to Gannicus, a mixture of guilt and passion 
  swirling across her face. She groans, inching towards 
  unexpected climax.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Doctore relentlessly attacks, driving Oenomaus back to the 
  edge of the cliff. At the last second before tumbling off 
  the edge Oenomaus counters, driving his blade through the 
  lower left side of Doctore's leather chestplate.

                                                                            SMASH TO:                                                                                    45.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Melitta cries out as she climaxes. A frozen moment as she 
  locks eyes with Gannicus in the aftermath, guilt and shame 
  seizing her heart.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Oenomaus stands frozen, his sword deep within Doctore's gut. 
  Oenomaus' own guilt and shame well in his eyes. But the rage 
  fades from Doctore's. He grins in love and appreciation, 
  blood dripping from his mouth.

                                          DOCTORE
                                  soft)(
                        I have taught you well.

  Doctore slides to the ground, dead. OFF Oenomaus' shock...


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus stands removed from the curtained-off area of the 
  triclinium, speaking in a hushed whisper to a bloodied 
  Oenomaus. Two GUARDS have escorted him in.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man is dead?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I did not want it. He forced me to 
                        fight. I do not know the cause of 
                        his anger towards me.

  Batiatus nervously glances at the shadows moving on the 
  other side of the triclinium curtains, moves so Oenomaus' 
  back is towards them.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The reason falls to my own tongue. 
                        Earlier I revealed intent of 
                        raising you to position of Doctore.

  Oenomaus wrestles with the shock of that.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I am not to return to the arena?

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are beyond such things now, 
                        proven by your training of Crixus.

                        look to future glories.

  He nods to the Guards to remove him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      My wife.

  Batiatus tenses.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        I know it is not our time, but I 
                        would ask to see her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I will send her to you. When she 
                        has finished her duties.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gratitude.

  He moves off with the Guards, the recent events weighing 
  heavy. Batiatus watches him go, his face unreadable.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - CURTAINED AREA - NIGHT

  Gannicus and Melitta can't look at each other as they dress. 
  Their friendship marred forever. Batiatus reenters with a 
  smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies. The demands of a lanista 
                        seldom offer respite.

  Varus smiles lazily, the effects of the opium lingering.

                                        VARUS
                        None required. This night has been 
                        filled with unexpected joys.

  He kisses Gaia on the cheek.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                        You remain in Capua?

                                        GAIA
                        Until more adventurous opportunity 
                        presents itself.

                                        VARUS
                        I will take my leave, then. With 
                        promise of further discourse.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

  He starts to exit, pauses.

                        Your man. Gannicus. I would see him 
                        perform again. In the primus of my 
                        games.

  Batiatus barely contains himself. Gannicus reacts, 
  excitement competing with the guilt of how this was 
  achieved.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And you shall have him.

  He drifts out, followed by his Slaves.

                        The primus!

                        May the gods strike me for 
                        entertaining doubt.

  Batiatus turns his attention to Gannicus and Melitta.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have elevated this house. Yet 
                        speak of how we came by such honor, 
                        and see brotherhood shattered.
                                to Melitta)(
                        And a husband lost.

  Gannicus and Melitta feel the full weight of the warning. 
  MUSIC FADES UP, carrying us through the following scenes:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  SLOW MOTION. The Gladiators watch in silence as GUARDS carry 
  Doctore's body away. Oenomaus holds Doctore's chestplate at 
  his side, eyes filled with pain and regret. The Guards move 
  past, WIPING US TO:                                                                                    48.


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  SLOW MOTION. A shell-shocked Melitta sits alone in the bath, 
  absently washing herself. She breaks down, tears of shame 
  coursing down her cheeks.

  HEMP SMOKE

  swirls across the tragic scene, TRANSITIONING US TO:


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  SLOW MOTION. Hemp smoke swirls. Batiatus drinks from the 
  opium laced bowl, wine spilling as he laughs in triumph. He 
  grabs Lucretia, kissing her hungrily. She responds in an 
  opium haze.

  GAIA

  joins them, her hands exploring. Lucretia looks to Batiatus, 
  unsure of his reaction. He hesitates, kisses Gaia as well. 
  Batiatus and Lucretia's hands move across Gaia's body, 
  undressing her. Her gown falls away, WIPING US TO:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  SLOW MOTION. Gannicus stands at the cliff, looking out at 
  the valley below. He turns to see Melitta being escorted by 
  Guards, heading for Oenomaus' cell. She meets his eyes, then 
  looks away, unable to bear the guilt. Gannicus turns back to 
  the valley, TRANSITIONING US TO:


  INT. OENOMAUS' CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  SLOW MOTION: LOW ON THE CELL DOOR as it opens and Melitta 
  enters. She moves to Oenomaus, who sits on the floor before 
  the lit candles of Melitta's altar. Doctore's blood- 
  splattered chestplate is in his hands.

  OENOMAUS

  turns to look up at Melitta, ending the SLOW MOTION.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  a whisper)(
                        I have done a terrible thing.

  Tears cloud his eyes. Melitta bites back her own, remorse 
  for what happened with Gannicus barely concealed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                      We do what we must in this house.

  She takes him into her arms, trying to ease his guilt. And 
  her own...

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
