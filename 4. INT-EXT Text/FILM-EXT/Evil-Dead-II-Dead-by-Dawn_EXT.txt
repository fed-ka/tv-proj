Unsure of how to react to this strange

Hail he, who has come from the sky,
to deliver us from the terrors of
the deadites!

Hail!
WARRIOR #5
Hail!
The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
bow.
Then twenty.
Then fifty.
All remove their
helmets and kneel silently in the dust.
Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.
Ash stands
frozen.
Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
Knowing only for the present, he is alive.
As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
familiar pose.
It is the same image of the "Hero
from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.
The
strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
rears up INTO FRAME.
It is seen to be the castle of
Kandar.
The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
film.
Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
new.
As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
the distant ROAR of some dying animal:
The SCREEN cuts
to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.
