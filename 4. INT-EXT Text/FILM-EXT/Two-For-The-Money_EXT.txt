A DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.
The boy swings, connects,
sends the ball flying.
DAD smiles.
BRANDON LANG'S VOICE
That's me.
Five years old.
I remember that day.
Believe it
or not, I remember that hit.
I remember it because of the smile
that spread over my dad's face...
BRANDON shooting hoops.
DAD drinks a Bud, frowns as he misses.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
I would've stood there all day to sink one.
Just to see that
smile...
BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads.
A DOG chases
him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and --
BRANDON VOICEOVER
To pop, sports were a religion.
To me, it was about purity,
a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily
forgotten.
I was going to fill the whole house with trophies
for him.
There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make
him happy...
BRANDON catches the ball.
Blinding light, loud CHEERING and
--
Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.
It's a night game.
Stands packed.
A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.
It's the fourth
quarter.
Seven seconds left.
Score:
CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST
NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.
A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK
gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back
to the huddle.
The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG.
10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S
every word --
BRANDON
Last play.
Slant red, right back on two.
On two, Scottie.
It's a lock.
A guaranteed TD.
I've already seen it.
So relax.
There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win
and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear
any "Hi moms."
Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it
and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.
See
you in the end zone.
The teams breaks, approaches the line.
Loud CROWD roar.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.
Set high school
records.
Won state championships.
I wasn't driven by joy, it
wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of
losing.
TV ANNOUNCERS
South West Nevada needs a score.
Seven seconds on the clock.
22 yard line.
Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season
for Lang.
The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until
-- Lang's got the snap--
BRANDON drops back.
A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey.
BRANDON pulls free, runs.
OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON
vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.
BRANDON rolls on his
back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to
stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg.
Sickening sound.
BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week.
Then
I puked.
TEAMMATES surround BRANDON, many turning from the sight and --
Vegas desert.
It's raining.
A SWNU car pulls up.
The COACH
helps BRANDON out, on crutches now.
A middle-aged WOMAN and
a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
It doesn't rain much in the desert.
Maybe it was that, or maybe
the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting
me up the steps, but I swore then and there -- no matter what,
I'd get back -- I would play again...
Sprinters dart by.
Here comes BRANDON.
Several months have
passed.
Big ass brace on his leg.
A GIRL'S TRACK TEAM bounds
past like a herd of gazelles.
BRANDON presses on, possessed.
The TEAM'S practicing for a new season.
BRANDON'S on the sideline,
flanked by the COACH and TEAM DOCTOR.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
Doc told me it would take years to heal.
One bad hit and it'd
be over.
But the team needed me and I had to play to get drafted.
I figured I'd take a chance...
BRANDON looks at the field, the PLAYERS, the empty stands and--
CROWDED arena.
Electrifying scene.
BRANDON'S suited on the
sidelines.
Kick-off.
A SWNU PLAYER returns the ball.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
Every minute of recovery I'd dreamt about this moment.
There
were NFL scouts in the stands.
I knew what happened next.
BRANDON leads his team onto the field.
Into the huddle --
BRANDON
Let's ease back into it with our bread
and butter -- TD first play.
We're going
deep.
Split right.
Deep two on three!
(coming up to the line)
Red 38!
Red 28!
Set!
Set--
BRANDON drops back.
Blitz.
Brandon about to throw when one
of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance.
Too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment...
it buckles.
BRANDON falls.
The play whistled dead.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
...It was over.
I could've gone out with class, a gritty smile
and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher, instead I opted
to go psycho on national tv.
The PLAYER who hit him leans down to help.
BRANDON grabs his
face mask, starts punching.
Pure rage.
A REFEREE steps in and
BRANDON slugs him, slams his face in the turf.
LINEMEN yank
BRANDON off as the bloody REF struggles to get free and --
TV SCREEN -- jim rome sports show
A highlight reel plays a tape of the incident -- BRANDON seen
struggling with PLAYERS as the roughed-up REF crawls away --
JIM ROME
Welcome to the jungle!
Hey clones, do you believe this idiot?!
That cannot happen!
This is college football, not the ultimate
fighting championship!
What we have here is too much muscle
and not
enough brain mass -- this is why we need a life-time
ban!
Make an example out of him!
Because the sport deserves
better than this!
Talk to me!
CAMERA PUSHES IN -- ECU on the TV as we hear --
BRANDON VOICEOVER
It made all the highlight films.
People wrote editorials.
Overnight
I became the poster boy for the "Dark Side of Sports."
The college yanked my scholarship and I was kicked out of school.
The ref piled on, pressed charges.
My probation included counseling.
BRANDON rides a beat-up bike through downtown.
BRANDON rides up.
His younger brother, DENNY (18, Metallica
t-shirt) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle
car in the garage.
DENNY
I scrounged some old headers, B!
Check it out!
DENNY turns the key.
The car rumbles to life.
He revs the bored-out
engine, flashes a shit eating grin.
BRANDON
... Awesome dude.
That's a righteous ride, Denny.
BRANDON pedals to work when his cell phone rings.
Answering:
BRANDON
Hello.
MAN'S VOICE
Brandon!
BRANDON
Yeah?
MAN VOICEOVER
Congratulations!
You went 9-2 last Sunday!
20-4 college!
Picking
77 percent winners since opening weekend!
I've been following
you!
I'm a big fan, Brandon!
A big fan.
BRANDON
How'd you get this number?
If you want picks, call my 900 line.
MAN VOICEOVER
What I want, Brandon, is for you to come to New York and work
for me.
BRANDON
Who is this?
MAN VOICEOVER
This is Walter Abrams.
I don't know if you know me but I run
the biggest sports service in the country.
Hell, I started the
industry.
Ask around.
Ask anyone,
even that reprobate boss of yours.
It's
my job to keep track of who's doing what and what you're doing
should be rewarded.
Focus, Brandon.
Focus.
One day you'll
look back, see this was one of life's defining moments.
Allow
me to paint a picture for you.
Right now I'm getting a massage,
looking out my window at the greatest city in the world and all
I'm asking you to do is come up with a number.
Write down what
you make now, cross it out and write what you should be making
and then toss in how much it'll take to get you to fly here first
class and come work for me -- did I mention free room and board
-- and speak up when you've got something to share.
(aside to MASSEUSE)
Right there.
Yeah.
Deeper.
Yes.
Fuck that hurts.
BRANDON
Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta go to work.
BRANDON hangs up and --
BRANDON hefts a duffel bag -- sees an ASIAN DRIVER, chauffeur
uniform, mirrored shades, holding a sign reading B. LANG and
--
Five stories.
Next to the Brooklyn Bridge.
Manhattan rises
across the East River.
The limo pulls up.
BRANDON steps out,
regards the structure.
Exhaust fans dot the second floor.
Satellite
dishes on the roof.
Security cameras everywhere.
BROWNSTONE.
CAMERA favors the ground floor windows.
WALTER vo
The apartment on the first floor is yours.
You have satellite
tv, a gym, you want to relax there's a jacuzzi tub the size of
a kiddie pool.
The upstairs window flies open and a CD sails out.
WALTER VO
Wrong!
BRANDON riding his bike hard across the Brooklyn Bridge.
Wearing
earphones while he listens to a radio sports show.
RADIO ANNOUNCER/keith jackson vO
--Talking about college defenses you have to include Oklahoma.
The Okie boys are 2nd-ranked going into this weekend and facing
an offensive powerhouse in Oregon.
That game and more coming up after the break.
A commerical's heard as BRANDON pedals away, glances up and --surreal
sight -- Brandon hurtling at an ELEPHANT'S ASS -- he swerves
-- looks back at the TRAINER walking the pachyderm across the
city span and --
WALTER catches up to TONI, walks through the party with her.
WALTER
He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners.
Talk
about fit.
Go
take a peek, see him with his shirt off.
I did.
He's a serious side of beef.
TONI
Enjoy your daughter's party.
WALTER
Check him out, you know you want to.
TONI
Get out of your head, Walter.
It's a bad neighborhood.
TONI kisses him, walks with WALTER through the party and --
Satellite dishes aim at the sky.
ANNOUNCER CHATTER continues
OVER, giving non-stop COLLEGE football scores.
BRANDON comes
down the street, carries a bag of take-out.
BRANDON'S POV -- a second floor window opens as someone blows
cigarette smoke into the night.
Activity seen inside before
the window shuts.
BRANDON left staring and --
BRANDON rides a bike.
Wears headphones.
Sunday's NFL scores
coming in now.
BRANDON'S reactions indicate he's doing well.
Looking down Fifth.
Thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere.
Here comes BRANDON and WALTER.
BRANDON
Where are we going?
WALTER
Continue your education.
The silver SL500 pulls to the curb.
License plate reading "900
KING."
A pair of $500 shoes emerge.
BRANDON stands on the sidewalk
as the DOORMAN comes up, eyes the car.
Doorman
I'll watch it for you.
(seeing the license plate)
What's "900 King?"
BRANDON
(handing him a card)
I don't lose.
BRANDON heads into the bar, meets WALTER and a group of HEAVY
HITTERS outside.
John ANTHONY instantly comes alive and --
Denny on his cell, crouched under the dash of his car, wiring
a new stereo.
He touches two wires and the sound system BOOMS
to life, deafening hip-hop before Denny disconnects the wires.
DENNY
It's the bomb, B!
BRANDON
Sure sounds like it!
I'm heading out with some people, everything
else cool?
DENNY
Everything's great.
Did dad reach you?
BRANDON
Dad?
No, why?
DENNY
He keeps calling.
He saw you on tv, wants to talk to you.
I
gave him your work number but he says they won't put him through.
BRANDON
Really?
BRANDON'S eye catches WALTER across the set, watching a playback
of the show.
TONI enters the studio, kisses WALTER hello and
--
WALTER and TONI trail BRANDON down the lamp-lit sidewalk.
WALTER
Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked
to him?
Honestly.
BRANDON
That's not the point!
WALTER
Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story
here?
What's the deal with your old man?
BRANDON
You tell it, you seem to know.
WALTER
--I only know pieces.
I was trying to spare you from something.
BRANDON
(stopping under a street light)
Spare me?
By blocking my calls?
There's nothing you can spare
me from.
He's a drunk.
Left when I was 9.
I couldn't t compete
with a bottle.
End of story.
WALTER
... That's it?
That's the best you can do?
Hell, Toni and I'll
match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours
any day of the week.
My father, 5-foot-
arms like this, cock the size of a hebrew national -- if I even
looked at him wrong he knocked me across the room like LaMotta.
He yelled so much, until I was five I thought my name was asshole.
Tell him about you, Toni.
Well go on --
TONI
I didn't have a great home-life either.
WALTER
"Great?"
Tell him about the uncle--
TONI
--He gets the idea.
WALTER
Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the
family pet, isn't that right, honey?
TONI
Walter, please.
WALTER
(to BRANDON)
Your father was a drunk, a jerk -- so what?
It happens.
I'm
glad I blew him off.
Know why?
Because what you need is a new
image of a man.
How 'bout me?
BRANDON
That's a really scary thought.
WALTER
If not me, then pick someone else.
It's all in your head!
The
shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it
is?
Just that, shit that happened.
WALTER CON'D
It's not who we are.
After
Walter con'd
all the therapy and the analysis and the meetings and the --
aaahhhh! -- the one thing I know--
(yelling to the sky)
--WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP!
We are all just so fucked up!
(to BRANDON)
Say it!
Shout it!
Come on, you two -- wallow with me here!
A MAN sticks his head out a window down the street, yells --
MAN
I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
WALTER
Dad!
Is that you?
MAN
I'll crush you like a beetle!
WALTER
How's Mom?!
MAN
Fucking freak!
WALTER
I love you too!
Don't wait up!
WALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh.
The three of them doubled
over on the dark, deserted street.
MAN screaming from above.
The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and --
AMIR (sharply attired) stands outside his business, leaning against
a brand new, red Ferrari as he talks on the phone.
AMIR
Don't get me wrong, John.
I'm thankful, very much, you're amazing,
it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep--
BRANDON
--The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the
Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring
and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio
that I put you in -- you know what -- I'm cutting you off...
You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation
tax!
Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight
and we'll kiss and make up.
(hanging up, to the TAILOR)
No cuff.
(the phone rings, picking up--)
John Fucking Anthony, talk to me.
WOMAN VOICEOVER
This is... May I please speak to a Brandon Lang?
BRANDON
... Mom?
An AIRLINER roars in for landing.
NOVIAN and BRANDON regard a group of GIRLS lounging topless by
a pool.
NOVIAN
... Ever pick oranges, Mr. Anthony?
BRANDON
Nope.
NOVIAN
I have, in fact it's how I started.
Builds character.
See those girls down there?
Pretend they're
oranges and pick some ripe ones.
Take 'em upstairs and build
some character.
Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms.
BRANDON goes to an ice-filled cooler by the door, pulls a bottle
of champagne, carries it dripping down to the pool and--
BRANDON'S Mercedes speeds into the city.
BRANDON loads his golf clubs in the Mercedes, spies TONI coming
down the front steps.
BRANDON
Where're you headed?
TONI
Some of us have to work.
BRANDON
Come on, get in.
I'll give you a lift.
ANGLE ON -- upper brownstone window.
WALTER looks down.
Watches
TONI'S legs swing into BRANDON'S sports car and --
Similar lights illuminate a driving range on the Hudson River.
BRANDON smacks one to the 250 sign, about to hit another and
--
WALTER
Helluva swing.
Great game.
Sport of kings, right?
Or is that
horse racing?
BRANDON
What are you doing here?
WALTER
Southie told me where you were.
BRANDON
I had to get out.
Clear my head.
(teeing one up)
Well talk to me.
How'd we do?
WALTER
You haven't seen the scores?
BRANDON
Nope.
That's how I wanted it.
Just make the picks and get the
results later.
WALTER
Highest sales volume ever.
Take a guess.
BRANDON
I think we kicked ass.
WALTER
It was amazing.
BRANDON
I told you.
Last week was nothing.
BRANDON smacks a drive, watches it soar --
WALTER
You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today!
BRANDON
... What'd I go?
WALTER
I have an idea.
I give you a few glimpses of what happened here
today and you take a stab.
BRANDON
Just give me the numbers, Walter.
WALTER
You don't like that game.
Too bad.
Woulda been fun.
Grown
men crying on the phone.
Wives screaming in the background.
Three salespeople quit 'cause they couldn't take the pressure!
BRANDON
Fuck!
WALTER
No.
When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it.
What would be more appropriate is something like "Holy Fucking
Shit!" Or "My Fucking God."
Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"
BRANDON
Enough.
I get the idea, Walter.
WALTER
You're right.
I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend
-- what the hell's left to say?
Except maybe keep the phone
number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!
BRANDON hefts the golf bag, walks away.
Yelling after him --
WALTER
Tomorrow morning, Brandon!
Bright and early!
We start in all
over again!
No getting off!
I'm gonna ride you until you're
more sick of me than losing!
Turn it around and we avoid a lot
of pain!
Omit
OMIT
Omit
Omit
Gloomy fog.
A few PEOPLE heading home from work.
BRANDON riding
his bike, pedaling fast when a MAN suddenly steps out, flash
of something in his hand, jamming it in the spokes and --BRANDON
wipes out, over the handlebars -- hard to the ground --
BRANDON
Son of a bitch... What the fuck--
BODYGUARD
Mr. Novian wants to see you.
Now.
BRANDON
(seeing a gun in his waistband)
... Tell him to call.
BODYGUARD
You tell him.
BRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby.
NOVIAN
I didn't recognize you without the suit, John.
BRANDON
This is my time off.
It's how I clear my head.
You want to
talk, pick a time.
NOVIAN
Or should I call you Brandon?
Someone costs you 18 mill, you
do some research.
I know more than your name, Brandon.
I know where you're from.
Where your family lives.
Hell, I just came from Vegas.
Your
Mom, sweet lady... dealt me three blackjacks in a row.
(stepping close)
Where's the cocky motherfucker who came to my house?
BRANDON
I'm leaving.
The BODYGUARD grabs his arm.
Iron grip.
NOVIAN
Feel that?
I hate the cold.
Winter's coming.
Water's getting
rough.
BRANDON
What the fuck is this about?
If you don't like my picks, use
someone else.
NOVIAN
Oh, I'm not using you again.
That's already decided.
And I
can't get my money back.
It's gone.
No, I came for an apology.
The BODYGUARD holds him tight.
Light fading.
No one around.
NOVIAN
Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make
me believe you mean it.
Cold gust.
NOVIAN closes the distance between them.
BRANDON
You flew to New York for--
NOVIAN
--That's right.
BRANDON
... I'm sorry.
NOVIAN
I don't accept it.
Not good enough.
Try again.
BRANDON
I don't know what you want me to say.
I'm sorry.
I am.
I'm
very sorry.
NOVIAN
Pathetic.
BRANDON
I am very, very sorry.
That's a lot of money.
NOVIAN
Not even close.
BRANDON
I'm sorry!
NOVIAN
This isn't going to work.
I'll have to get satisfaction somehow
else.
BRANDON
Look, I'm not it -- I...
NOVIAN inches from BRANDON.
Unbuttons his coat.
Sound of a
zipper.
BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly.
BRANDON jumps.
The BODYGUARD holds him.
NOVIAN comes close.
BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and--
He squirms -- enduring something -- trickling water heard --
NOVIAN staring right at BRANDON -- finishes pissing on BRANDON'S
leg.
NOVIAN motions his BODYGUARD to let go and the men walk
off.
BRANDON stands there.
Alone in the gloom and --
BRANDON, suit and tie, stands in the lobby of an apartment high-rise,
speaks on a house phone.
An unsmiling DOORMAN watches nearby.
BRANDON VOICEOVER
Alex, it's Brandon.
Hey, it's been awhile but I never got your
number that night.
I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd
take a chance and stop by.
Pale sunrise over the East River.
A cab pulls up.
BRANDON and TONI emerge.
BRANDON looks around
as they start up the steps.
Both reach for their keys, regard
one another.
BRANDON
It's still early.
Come in for a while.
TONI
I don't think so.
She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and -- BRANDON suddenly
shifts.
Their lips meet.
A casual goodbye suddenly grows in
intensity as neither tries to part.
Seconds ticking by.
Things
getting heated.
TONI tries to pull away.
TONI
Brandon--
BRANDON comes close, whispers something.
He unlocks the door.
She hesitates before BRANDON takes her hand, leads her into his
dark apartment and --
A cold wind blows off the river.
Whips through the cables of
the span.
A match flares.
WALTER'S face is lit briefly by the
flame.
He stands on the bridge walkway, looking down at the
brownstone and --
DISSOLVE TO
Gray, winter day.
View of a snow-covered window sill --
BRANDON loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and --
The studio doors open.
WALTER exits.
BRANDON right beside.
BRANDON
You can't guarantee they'll win!
It's insane!
WALTER
You think?
Well I say if you can flip a coin to pick, I can
guarantee the game!
BRANDON
What if you lose?
WALTER
Fuck it, I'm ruined anyway.
BRANDON
At least cap it out!
WALTER
(turning to him)
Can't you feel it, Brandon?
BRANDON
I don't know what you're talking about.
WALTER
I think you do.
The best part of the best drug in the world
isn't the high.
The best part is the time just before you take it!
The dice
are dancing on the
table.
Between now when they stop -- that's the greatest high
in the world!
BRANDON comes down the steps, carrying his bag, dressed the same
as the day he came.
BRANDON starts down the sidewalk.
Flags
a cab.
It stops.
He opens the door, about to get in when a
cheer from the SALES ROOM makes him look up and --
POV BRANDON -- TONI looks down from a window.
Frozen beat.
She turns away.
BRANDON climbs in the cab, drives off and --
