    CLOSE ON a badge sitting atop a nightstand that reads: FBI
    Counter Terrorism Division.  The owner of the badge, Agent
    ERICA EVANS (38), lies sleeping peacefully in her bed...

    But the quiet moment is suddenly interrupted as A SMALL
    TREMOR SHAKES THE HOUSE.  Erica's eyes pop open.  PRELAP: 

                                    ERICA (V.O.)
                  Tyler...


    Erica standing outside her son's room talking through the door. 

                                    ERICA
                  ...Ty did you feel that?

    No response.  She cracks open the door to find...  An empty
    bed.  An open window.  And no Tyler...  Off a pissed Erica...


    CLOSE ON a cell RINGING.  "Mom calling" flashes.  A hand
    bearing bruised knuckles and dried blood reaches for it.  

    We follow the hand up to the equally roughed up face of
    TYLER EVANS (16).  He hasn't had a good night to say the
    least.  And it's about to get worse... Answering:

                                    ERICA (ON PHONE)
                  You're in big trouble...

    PRELAP: The sound of birds FLAPPING their wings...


    A flock of pigeons head skyward as FATHER JACK LOWERY (30)
    opens the doors to the inner-city church for the day.  

    Nothing but junkies and prostitutes outside -- that, and
    one faithful parishioner in a wheelchair, who's always there.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            2.
    CONTINUED:

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Morning Roy.

                                    ROY
                  Morning Father Jack.

    Just as Jack and ROY (45) head into the otherwise deserted
    church...  There's ANOTHER SMALL TREMOR.  Off Jack pausing...


    FATHER TRAVIS, 60's (Father Jack's mentor), eyes the objects
    in his room, jiggling from the tiny quake.  

    The RUMBLING QUICKLY SETTLES, and he goes back to what he
    was doing.  Drowning his sorrows in a glass of red wine,
    despite the early hour.

    ADJUST to find the reason for his sadness.  A letter from
    the Archdiocese: "After 57 years, All Saints Church will be
    closed due to lack of attendance..."

    PRELAP: the SOUND of a SHOWER RUNNING...


    CAMERA MEANDERS along a trail of clothes.  Passes an empty
    wine bottle, a discarded condom wrapper, and eventually
    comes to a TV.  

    FRAME is composed such that we're shooting across the end
    of a bed.  A sultry pair of women's feet, toenails painted
    bright red, are in the f.g.

    A dashing, Anderson-Cooper-wannabe is on screen anchoring a
      REBROADCAST of his news show.  As we HOLD this shot, we
    HEAR the SHOWER in the adjacent bathroom SHUT OFF...


    VALERIE HOLT (42) asleep in her bed.   

    DOWNSTAIRS--  Val's daughter, CASSIE HOLT (17), is at the
    computer having pulled an all-nighter on an English paper. 
    She struggles to stay awake, but is losing the battle.  

    We jump into Cassie's POV... 



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            3.
    CONTINUED:

    As she slowly nods off, the ROOM FADES TO DARKNESS, the
    CATHEDRAL MUSIC CRESCENDOS and the montage introducing our
    cast of characters comes to an end.

                                                                                    CUT TO:


    Ryan examines the engagement ring he's selected as the kindly
    old jeweler rings up the sale...  

                                    JEWELER
                  She's gonna love it.  Just don't
                  forget the knee.  

                                    RYAN
                  The knee?

                                    JEWELER
                  I got down on one knee in the middle
                  of a crowded room.  There were cheers --
                  applause.  Thirty years later, she
                  still talks about it.

                                    RYAN
                  Yeah I'm not big on drawing crowds--

                                    JEWELER
                  So forget the crowd.  But don't forget
                  the knee.

    Ryan smiles as he grabs a pen and signs the credit card slip. 
    But halfway through, the pen SUDDENLY SKITTERS across the
    signature line -- the counter SHAKING from yet ANOTHER TREMOR. 
    Off Ryan and the Jeweler... What the hell is that?


    ALISON RAY (40's), the woman with the red toenails, is still
    lying in bed watching the Anderson-Cooper-wannabe on TV.  

                                    ALISON
                        (calls out)
                  Last night was amazing... 

    And into the bathroom doorway steps -- the Anderson-Cooper-
    wannabe -- CHAD DECKER (28).  Dripping wet, sexy as hell, towel
    around his waist.  Eyes himself on TV.

                                    CHAD
                  Were you watching that while we
                  were...?

                                    ALISON
                          (devilish smile)
                  You should be on a big network.

                                    CHAD
                  I'm working on it.

                        (smiles)
                  Speaking of, I get my interview now,
                  right? 

                                    ALISON
                  I'd say you earned it - twice.  Expect
                  a call from the Office of the Vice
                  President.

                                    CHAD
                  Pleasure doing business with you.

    As he steps past the TV we HOLD on the screen.  And we
    realize Alison was a guest on his show last night.  Her
    title comes up: Press Secretary to the Vice President.

    As we PUSH IN on this shot, the TV begins to SHAKE.  Like
    the others, this TREMOR only lasts a moment, but clearly
    whatever's happening in L.A. is happening in New York too.


    Erica, still on the phone with Tyler; upset.  Mid conversation: 

                                    ERICA
                  How exactly did you get beat up?!  


    A sheepish Tyler on the other end.  His friend BRYCE (16)
    sits nearby, equally bloodied and bruised.  Both are a little
    awkward; cute but in a dorky way.  INTERCUT:

                                    TYLER
                  We were trying to crash a party in
                  the hills.

                                    ERICA
                        (unbelievable)
                  You snuck out in the middle of the
                  night to crash a party.

                                    TYLER
                  It was Bryce's stupid idea.  We
                  thought we could blend in with the
                  cool kids.  
                        (loud; directed at Bryce)
                  WE DON'T BLEND IN...

    But Bryce ignores him.  He's distracted -- staring at a
    medical tray next to his gurney... 

                                    ERICA
                  But you're okay, right?

                                    TYLER
                  I said I'm fine.

                                    ERICA
                  Okay, where are you again?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            5.
    CONTINUED:

    WHAT BRYCE SEES: Some medical instruments are JIGGLING ever
    so slightly on the tray...

                                    TYLER
                  Some crappy hospital at Sunset and
                  Vermont.

                                    ERICA
                  I'm coming to get you.

                                    TYLER
                  It's not that bad I can take my bike
                  home.

                                    ERICA
                  I'm coming to get you.

    The HUBBUB in the busy emergency room masks the fact that
    the building is SHAKING -- and the SHAKING is GROWING. 

                                    TYLER
                  It was just a party, mom. 

                                    ERICA
                  Yeah, one I said you couldn't go to. 
                  Why would you even want to go?  That's
                  not your crowd - those kids do nothing
                  but pick on--

    Erica stops, suddenly aware - her house's SHAKING as well. 
    But unlike the earlier tremors, this one isn't stopping.    

    Tyler and everyone else in the ER feel it now.  Equipment
    starts to ROCK.  Windows begin to RATTLE.


    The shaking GROWS EXPONENTIALLY.  Picture frames fall. 
    Books TUMBLE from shelves.  Loudly, into the phone:

                                    ERICA
                  Get under something!


    Tyler and Bryce scramble for cover under a desk.  People
    start to freak...


    Same SHAKING!  Valerie, now out of bed, races downstairs.

                                    VALERIE
                  Cassie!  Cass...!

    As she reaches the ground floor a heavy armoire TOPPLES
    over.  Cassie is SCREAMING, terrified...                                                                                            6.



    CRASH!  The huge stained glass windows lining the church
    SHATTER one after another.  Father Jack grabs Roy, pulls
    him out of his wheelchair and under a wooden pew.  

    They eye the enormous crucifix hanging above them.  A bolt
    securing it to the wall has snapped.  IT ROCKS WILDLY back
    and forth until CRACK!  The other bolt snaps!  

    They duck as the huge plaster likeness of Christ PLUNGES
    downward, SMASHING to pieces right in front of them... 


    Erica scrambles toward the door, barely able to stay on her
    feet.  A DEAFENING ROAR suddenly comes from above.  And as
    she looks up toward the sound...   

    ...AN OMINOUS BLACK SHADOW CREEPS OVER THE HOME, BLOTTING
    OUT THE EARLY MORNING LIGHT.  

    The house shifts and part of the chimney COLLAPSES.  The
    falling bricks strike Erica, KNOCKING HER to the floor,
    trapping a leg under the rubble... 


    His co-workers racing out as he races in.  

                                    CHAD
                  Where're you going?!  

                                    COLLEGUE
                  Basement shelter.  

                                    CHAD
                  We gotta get on the air!
                        (they ignore him)
                  You think World News Tonight is
                  heading for a shelter?!  


    As the SHAKING finally FEATHERS OUT.  

                                    BRYCE
                  It's over... I think it's over...

                                    TYLER
                        (into his phone)
                  Mom...!  MOM...?!  


    Erica, leg still trapped under the fallen bricks, struggles
    to grab her phone which lies just out of reach.  With a
    Herculean effort she's able to snatch it up.  INTERCUT:

                                    ERICA
                  Tyler?!

                                    TYLER
                  Are you okay?!

                                    ERICA
                  Stay there, I'm coming for you!

    But as she pulls her battered leg from the rubble, she lets
    out a PAINFUL SCREAM.

                                    TYLER
                  MOM!!

    The line goes dead.  Off his panicked look...


    A frightened Cassie peers out the windows looking around.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            8.

                  Seriously, what the hell was that?!  

    Val's frantically searching the channels on the TV.

                                    VALERIE
                  Nothing's coming in.

    She spots her cell on the floor.  Moves to it...

                                    VALERIE (CONT'D)
                  Try the radio.

    As Val dials her phone...

                  Come on, Ryan, please pick up.

                  Oh God -- Mrs. Belker... 
                        (races for the door)

                                    VALERIE
                  Don't go out there!

                                    CASSIE
                  Mom, she's all alone.

                                    VALERIE
                  Cassie!


    Both priests race out of the church, followed closely by
    Roy, back in his chair.  They look to the sky.  Father Travis
    drops to his knees praying. Father Jack crosses himself... 


    The doors are barricaded with furniture.  PAN OFF to find
    Val, Cass and their neighbor MRS. BELKER (78), a feisty
    woman who's legally blind.  All are glued to the TV.  

    Val looks to Mrs. Belker.  Addresses the old lady by raising
    her voice and slowing her words...  

                                    VALERIE
                  Can I get you anything, Mrs. Belker?

                                    MRS. BELKER
                        (winces)
                  Sweetie, I'm blind not deaf.

    Right.  ON THE TV: A split screen with live shots of Times
    Square and L.A. -- a huge mothership hovering over each city.

                                    REPORTER #1 (ON TV)
                  The sheer mass of the ships moving
                  through the skies of New York and
                  Los Angeles was enough to rock both
                  cities for miles...

    Cassie changes channels, landing on Chad's network:

                                    CHAD (ON TV)
                  ...NORAD is confirming that the first

    She changes channels again.  Lands on a station airing
    reactions from people on the street.  

                                    COLLEGE KID #1 (ON TV)

    Val, Cass and Mrs. Belker suddenly JUMP as a NOISE comes
    from the backdoor.  

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  What was that?!

    Someone's trying to get in.  A terrified Val grabs a gun
    sitting next to her.  Aims... A tense moment, then... Ryan
    steps through the door.  

                                    RYAN
                  I see you found my gun.

                                    VALERIE
                  Oh my god... Thank god!

    A relieved Val and Cass rush to him.  Tears streaming down
    their eyes.  All three embrace.  Val kissing Ryan over and
    over.  Cassie holds them both tight. 


    Father Travis (the elder priest), and Father Jack move down
    a long hall leading from the rectory to the church.  An
    uneasy Father Jack is looking over a fax. 

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  You still seem troubled.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  I am, Father.

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  I thought sharing the directive from 
                  Rome would ease your mind.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  I thought so too, but...
                        (reading from it)
                  "We're all God's creatures?"  That's
                  how the Vatican explains the existence
                  of aliens?

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  Have faith in our leaders.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  I do, but... We don't even know what
                  these things are yet - I mean this is
                    unprecedented - and we're being asked
                  to embrace them as God's creatures?

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  Yes.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Rattlesnakes are God's creatures too,
                  doesn't mean they're good for us.  

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  What would you have me do, Jack? 
                  Call the Vatican and question their
                  position?

                                    FATHER JACK
                  No, I just... Don't know what to do.

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  All we can do is pray and minister
                  to our congregation.  

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Our congregation amounts to two bag
                  ladies, a heroin addict and Roy.

    As they step into the main church...

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  That may be, Father Lowery, but until
                  they close my church, we will minister
                  to any size congregation, no matter how-- 
                        (off their stunned looks)
                  ...Small.

    Both have come to a dead stop.  They stand SILENT as CAMERA
    ARCS around revealing... 

    ...The normally deserted church is completely FILLED to
    capacity with a SEA OF FEARFUL FACES.

                  Dude, I was standing right there!  I

                  I'm gonna text the whole school and
                  tell them I was there.  How cool is

                  Dude, half the school watched Derek
                  Strubbs kick our asses at that party. 
                  You are not cool and neither am I.

                                    TYLER
                  What about my bike?

    CAMERA follows Ty as he heads to the kitchen for a snack.

                  Dude, you bought the bike in an attempt
                  to be cool - and it is cool - by
                  itself.  But the second you and me
                  get on - it stops being cool.

                                    TYLER
                  That's harsh.  I'm still texting.  

    As he exits, he leads us to Erica who we find sitting cross-
    legged in an armchair, her computer in her lap.  

    She eyes the TV as she talks to her partner DALE MADDOX
    (44) on her cell.  

                                    ERICA
                  They're calling themselves "The
                  Visitors."


    Dale's at his desk in their shared office, also watching
    the news coverage.  INTERCUT: 

                                    DALE
                  You say that like it bothers you.

                                    ERICA
                  Visitors are old friends who drop by
                  for a drink.  

                                    DALE
                  Got a better name for 'em?

                                    ERICA
                  I got a couple of names for 'em. 
                  You should see my chimney.

                                    DALE
                  You said something's going on.  What's
                  up, partner?

    Erica shifts her attention back to her computer.  She's
    logged into an FBI Intelligence database.

                  Chatter among sleeper cells worldwide
                  dropped like a rock when the V's
                  showed up -- makes sense, they're
                  just as freaked as the rest of us -- 
                  But there's this one cell, their
                  chatter actually spiked.  It's like
                  they've been activated or something. 
                  And they're based in L.A.

                                    DALE
                  What kind of intel we got on them?  

                                    ERICA
                  Next to nothing - but we did get a
                  nice little gift this morning.  One
                  of them got a bit too excited and
                  sent out an uncoded message by
                  mistake.  

                                    DALE

                  They're looking to acquire large
                  amounts of C-4 as soon as possible.

                                    DALE
                  Not so awesome.

                  one's suddenly looking for high

    She eyes the massive mothership on TV.

                                    ERICA (CONT'D)
                  You only need lots of C-4 if you're
                  gonna hit something big.

                                    DALE
                  Extremists are calling for a Jihad
                  against the Visitors.  You think
                  this cell's looking to blow up a
                    mothership?  

                                    ERICA
                  Hope not.  We know what happens when
                  all they do is show up.  Imagine
                  what happens if we piss them off.

    Ty hangs up as he dives for the remote and turns up the

    Anna's shuttle door is opening.  A moment, then she appears. 
    A gorgeous figure to go with her flawless looks.

                        (softly)
                  Wow... She's pretty cool.

    Erica eyes him.  Anna's words have struck a chord.  

                                    TYLER (CONT'D)
                        (with a thread of sadness)
                  It's like they're more human than a
                  lot of human beings I know.

    Erica's gaze shifts to the bruises on Tyler's forehead and
    it registers what he's referring to.  His so-called peers
    could take a lesson in compassion from the Visitors.  

    She puts her arm around her son, pulls him close.                                                                                            20.



    Ryan, Valerie and Cassie gathered around the TV.  

                                    RYAN
                  I think we should consider moving
                  out of L.A.

                                    VALERIE
                        (laughs)
                  Right. 

                                    RYAN
                  Seriously.

                                    CASSIE
                  Why?  'Cause of the Visitors?

                                    RYAN
                  We should think about it.

                                    VALERIE
                  What about my practice, my clients?

                                    CASSIE
                  My friends, my school?

    Ryan's cell RINGS.  He jokes...

                                    RYAN
                  My phone.

                                    CASSIE
                  Know what I think'd be cool?  Going
                  downtown to see the ship in person.

                                    RYAN
                  Ah, no, that would most definitely
                  NOT be cool.
                        (answers phone)
                  Hello.

                                    GEORGIE (V.O.)
                  Been a long time.

    Ryan instantly recognizes the voice.  Alarmed, he moves 
    away from the others.  Quietly:

                                    RYAN
                  How did you get this number?

                                    GEORGIE (V.O.)
                  I need your help--

                                    RYAN
                  I'm not that guy anymore.  I haven't
                  been that guy for four years.  DON'T
                  call me again.

    Ryan hangs up sharply, heart pounding.  Off his look...                                                                                           21.



    Chad sitting at his anchor desk hosting his news program.  

    We realize we're now watching him do his show, recounting
    the impromptu press conference earlier in the day.  

                                    CHAD
                  It was truly a remarkable moment.  In
                  the midst of the chaos and, yes even
                  hostility from some, came something
                  unexpected from our new friends.  A
                  sense of humor... 
                        (another angle)
                  Coming up after the break, we ask:
                  Should the press be so tough on the
                  Visitors...? 


    Anna and Marcus sitting at a console watching Chad's
    broadcast.

                                    CHAD (ON SCREEN)
                  ...They did just get here, after all... 
                  We'll have a roundtable discussion
                  and find out what our experts think. 
                  More still to come.  Stay tuned.

    Anna turns to Marcus.

                                    ANNA
                  I want him.

    Off Anna's look... Clearly she's interested in Chad -- for
    what, we don't know yet...

                                                                      HARD CUT TO BLACK:

    FADE IN:


    Chad is on-the-air:

                                    CHAD
                  Good afternoon everyone, I'm Chad
                  Decker and this is a BBN news break...    

    We CUT TO a slick video package complete with SNAPPY MUSIC.

                                    CHAD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  Three full weeks have passed since
                  the Visitors arrival, yet thousands
                  continue to flock to the host cities
                  to see the motherships in person;
                  many describing the experience as
                  deeply moving.
                        (video of a healing)
                  The newly opened Visitor Healing
                  Centers are overflowing with the sick
                  and disabled.  Patients afflicted
                  with one of the 67 ailments the
                  Visitors can cure are waiting in lines
                  up to 12 hours for their miracle.
                        (video of the white house)
                  And government officials have begun
                  talks to establish Visitor embassies
                  in the 29 host cities.  But not
                  everyone thinks it's a good idea. 
                  Massive protests are set for tonight
                  at several ship sites.  Demonstrators
                  just want the Visitors to go home...


    CLOSE ON the TV in Erica and Chad's office... 

                                    CHAD (ON TV)
                  ...That's it for now.  We'll have
                  more coverage on our news at noon. 
                  See you then.

    PAN OFF to find Dale rushing in.  A hyped up Erica pouring
    over several reports.

                                    DALE
                  Got here as fast as I could.  What's
                  going on?

                                    ERICA
                  I think we finally got a real lead
                  on our cell.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          25.
    CONTINUED:

                                    DALE
                  I've heard that before.

                                    ERICA
                  No, this one feels good, Dale - look.
                        (hands him a report)
                  A truck suspected of hauling drugs
                  was impounded by CHP last night. 
                  They tested for residue - found no
                  drugs, but did find traces of
                  cyclonite.  

                                    DALE
                  C-4?  

                                    ERICA
                          (nodding)
                  C-4.  

                                    DALE
                  Okay, this is feeling better.

    She shows him several photos, each is a picture of a white
    truck going through an intersection.    

                                    ERICA
                  These are still frames from traffic
                  signal cams - shows the truck at
                  various intersections throughout the
                  city.  Starting from where he was
                  pulled over, we used these to back-
                  trace his route and figure out where
                  he was coming from.  Our best guess...

    Holds out a satellite shot of a farm.  

                                    ERICA (CONT'D)
                  This farm in Ventura.  

                                    DALE
                  You think our cell's hiding out on a
                  farm in Ventura?  

                                    ERICA
                  We'll find out soon enough. Let's go.


    Erica and Dale wince at the strong odor as they look around. 

                                    DALE
                  I can't take the smell anymore.

    Dale's about to leave but then Erica pries back a loose
    board on the wall - shines her flashlight.

                                    ERICA
                  There's something back here.


    They pull more boards.  Enough to step into the dark room. 
    They shine their lights.  The excavated area is huge.  

    They come to something covered by a sheet -- the source of
    the smell.  Erica pulls off the sheet, revealing...  

    The gruesome sight of a decomposing body - bloodied, gagged
    and bound to a chair at the hands and feet.  

                                    DALE
                  Jesus...

    Erica looks away for a moment to collect herself - but as
    she does something else catches her eye.  She shines her
    light.  Approaches.  Lifts a corner of a tarp, then pulls. 
    Her eyes go wide.  Underneath is a huge stash of...  

                                    ERICA
                  C-4.

    PRELAP: Father Jack.

                                    FATHER JACK (V.O.)
                  We're all so quick to jump on the
                  bandwagon...                                                                                           27.



    Father Jack's in mid sermon, preaching to a packed house.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  ...A ride on the bandwagon sounds
                  like fun.  But before we get on,
                  let's at least make sure it's sturdy
                  and sound.  Step back and examine
                  that wagon to really make sure it's
                  something we want to climb aboard.

    Father Travis looks on sternly from the back of the church.

                                    FATHER JACK (CONT'D)
                  No one's saying don't trust the
                  Visitors - but don't they need to
                  earn our trust...?


    Father Travis critiquing Father Jack's sermon.

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  I thought I was clear about this,
                  Jack.  People need to hear the V's
                  are part of God's plan. 

                                    FATHER JACK
                  They hear it from you.  

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  They need to hear it from you too.

    Father Travis tries a different approach.   

                                    FATHER TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                  I thank God for the Visitors everyday,
                  Jack.  This church sat empty for years -
                  now look at it.  The Visitors are not
                  driving people away from God.  They're
                  driving people back to God.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  People are scared, Father - that's
                  why they come.

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  But they come.  And that's the
                  blessing in disguise.  

                                    FATHER JACK
                  It bothers me that they showed up
                  right when we needed them the most. 
                  World's in bad shape, Father - who
                  wouldn't welcome a savior right now?

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  I agree, they're a godsend.  And we
                  need to be grateful.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          28.
    CONTINUED:

                                    FATHER JACK
                  But that's the danger.  Under the
                  right conditions and with enough
                  time, gratitude can morph into worship -
                  or worse -- devotion. 

    Father Travis' brow furrows.  He's had enough of this debate.  

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  Father Lowry, you will put your
                  personal opinions aside.  You will
                  follow the directive from the Vatican. 
                  And you will follow my guidance
                  without question.  Is that clear?
                        (beat)
                  I expect an inspirational sermon
                  from you by tomorrow morning.

    Just then a KNOCK.  Roy opens the door and pokes his head
    in, smiling.  Giddy:

                                    ROY
                  Thought you two priest types'd like
                  to see somethin'.

    Roy swings the door open wide to reveal... he's standing. 
    No wheelchair.  Emotion wells up in him:

                                    ROY (CONT'D)
                  They healed me.  I'm walkin' again
                  and got no pain... 

    Father Travis is stunned...  

                                    FATHER TRAVIS
                  My God, Roy... that's amazing.
                        (to Jack)
                    Inspirational even.


    Tyler and Bryce sitting at Bryce's computer.  Tyler clicks
    through a never ending stream of websites, photos and
    articles all pertaining to the V's.  He's surprised at the
    volume of material his friend's collected...

                                    TYLER
                  Damn...  I knew you were into the 
                  V's, but seriously.

    Bryce seems distracted.  He eyes himself in a mirror.  Picks
    at a cut on his chin; one he got the night of the beating. 

                                    BRYCE

                  Hello Principal Salizar...


    Cass and Mrs. Belker watching a live broadcast.  ON TV: A
    stage full of disabled children.  A VISITOR PHYSICIAN moves
    a device over the spine of a BOY in a wheelchair.  Then:

                                    PHYSICIAN
                  Go ahead.  Walk.

    With an incredulous look, the boy rises.  A bit rickety at
    first, but then he takes a step.  The auditorium ERUPTS.

                                    CASSIE
                  That's amazing.  

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  When's this program over?

                                    CASSIE
                  It doesn't end.  This channel's
                  running 24 hours of healing.  

    ON TV: The boy is now running around the stage, absolutely
    elated at being healed.  The crowd is on their feet CHEERING.

                                    CASSIE (CONT'D)
                  Oh my god, you should see this kid. 
                  He's gonna make me cry, he's so happy.

    ON TV: The boy rushes to the physician - throws his arms
    around him, then grabs the hand mic from him.

                                    BOY (ON TV)
                  Visitors rule!

    Cassie LAUGHS.  The crowd on TV goes ape shit.

                                    CASSIE
                  You should go get your sight back. 

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  I don't want anything from them. 

                                    CASSIE
                  Why not?

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  People are looking to these whatsits
                  to solve all their problems.  It's
                  not right.

    The boy on TV still running around yelling "Visitors rule." 
    The words echo in Mrs. Belker's head. 

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  I see plenty.


    Father Jack sits in a confessional as SOMEONE (all we see
    are his distinctive brown loafers) steps into the other side.  

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Have you come to confess your--

                                    MAN
                        (fearful tone)
                  I was at your sermon today.  You're
                  right to question the V's.

                                    FATHER JACK
                    Unfortunately, the church doesn't
                  agree.  I don't think I'll be giving
                  anymore sermons like that one.

                                    MAN
                  Don't let them do that to you!  You're
                  right!

                                    FATHER JACK
                  About what exactly -- you sound upset.

                                    MAN
                  I know the real reason they're here,
                  Father - and I'm not the only one.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Real reason?

                                    MAN
                  Everyone thinks the V's are here to
                  help us -- The V's are here to
                  obliterate us.
                        (off Jack's look)
                  Don't give up on that message, Father. 
                  People gotta hear it.  People gotta
                  open their eyes!

    The man bolts from the booth; Jack left unnerved.


    Ty stops short as he rounds the corner to his room, helmet

    The grainy cell phone footage shows a CLOSE UP of a license
    plate: DEREK1.  The image pulls out to a shot of Derek
    Strubbs' '06 Mustang. 

    Someone's hand comes into view shaking a can of red spray
    paint.  The can is held up to the car, the trigger depressed
    and a huge red V is graffitied across the hood.  

    FRAME pulls wide to reveal the culprit - a grinning Tyler. 
    Bryce sticks his head in the shot.  Both flash a peace sign.

                                    GELLER
                  Lots of common names.  It's gonna
                  take Background Investigations time
                  to sort the real from the fake.

                  Let's go see what Owen Forbes knew.                                                                                          36.



    Mrs. Belker sits stoically among an excited CROWD of seniors.  

    Her friend Roy, the parishioner from All Saints, is the
    center of attention.  He's answering questions, excitedly:

                                    ROY
                  ...It took all of two minutes -- No,
                  it didn't hurt -- And yes, anyone
                  can go get healed.   

    The crowd is abuzz, AD-LIBBING their enthusiasm.

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  What'd it cost?

                                    ROY
                  It's free.

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  Nothing's free, Roy...  I heard you
                  sit through a seminar before they
                  look at you -- what'd they say?

                                    ROY
                  They tell you about how they could
                  be doing more for us, but there's a
                  lot of red tape with the government.

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  I see, so they do this for you and
                  maybe you'll sign a petition or call
                  your congressman for them. 

                                    ROY
                  So?

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  So that's what it costs.

                  Small price to pay -- sign me up!

    The small spacecraft RUMBLES to life; Ty and Bryce jazzed.


    CLOSE ON the door to the shuttle as it opens, revealing
    Tyler and Bryce looking out.  Their eyes go wide.

    REVERSE ON what they see.  The shuttle deck seems to go on
    forever.  A beehive of activity filled with dozens of other
    shuttles and a small army of Visitor technicians.  A Visitor
    Guide, LISA (18) steps up to the group, smiling.

                  They knew we were coming - just like
                  the farm.

                                    DALE
                  You still think they knew we were

                  Somebody tipped them off.

    BLING.  BLING.  BLING.  BLING.  The sound of multiple incoming

                                    DALE

                                    ERICA
                  Guess we'll find out tonight.


    CLOSE ON a woman, her hair standing on end.  WIDER to reveal,
    she's floating weightless in a chamber!

    We slowly PUSH IN on Mrs. Belker sitting stoically; the TV
    rambling on about the Visitors; Cassie tidying up for her.  

    She's not paying attention to the TV.  Lost in thought. 
    Emotional.  On the verge of tears in fact.  

    As Cassie clears some dishes from the coffee table she
    notices the old woman.  Softly, with concern:

                  Mrs. Belker...?  Are you okay?

    No answer.  Cassie moves to her, takes her hand.

                  Why're you upset...?  You can tell me.

    Mrs. Belker steels herself, tries to be strong.  Softly:

                                    MRS. BELKER
                  I believe in God, Cassie... and I
                  believe in prayer.  I prayed for food
                  when I was starving in the camps.  I
                  prayed they'd spare my mother, father
                  and baby brother the night they were
                  killed.  I prayed for my sight when I
                  was going blind.  I prayed my whole
                  life, and you know what...?
                        (moist eyes, voice catches)
                  ...I never got an answer.  Have you?  

                                    CASSIE
                  Not like a voice or anything.

                        (tears spill over)

                  ...they're answering all our

                                    PRODUCER
                  Here she comes.  Good luck.

    The Producer exits as Anna and Marcus step in.  He rises. 

                                    CHAD
                  Pleasure to see you again, Commander.

                                    ANNA
                  Please, call me Anna.


    Erica and Dale parked outside a deserted sheet metal factory. 
    The address: 4400 Pier Ave.  Erica eyes her watch: 7:55 PM.

                                    DALE
                  We don't even know what this meeting
                  is and you're just gonna walk in
                  like you're invited?

                                    ERICA
                  They're expecting people they haven't
                  met before, so yeah.

                                    DALE
                  This is stupid.  Why aren't we calling
                  for back-up?

                                    ERICA
                  You know why.

                                    DALE
                        (dismissive)
                  'Cause you think there's a mole
                  tipping off our cell. 

                                    ERICA
                  Damn right, there's a mole tipping off
                  our cell, and I don't want them finding
                  out about this meeting.  Especially if
                  these people have information about
                  them -- they kill people who have
                    information about them.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          45.
    CONTINUED:

                                    DALE
                  It's against policy not to call for--

                                    ERICA
                  No back-up, Dale.  It's a closed
                  loop if it's just you and me.
                        (gets out of car)
                  If I'm not out in a half hour, then
                  you can call in the cavalry -- 'kay?

                                    DALE
                        (with concern; pointedly)
                  You watch your back.  

    She nods.  Heads off.  Dale's eyes then shift to the police
    radio.  Will he or won't he?  Off his look...


    An excited Tyler is planted in front of the TV.

                                    ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                  Stay tuned for Chad Decker's one-on-
                  one interview, next on BBN...

    BLING.  An email on his phone.  The Subject Line reads: 
    Check it!  Me and a V!  Attached is a picture of Bryce posing
    with a Visitor, both smiling like old friends.  Tyler's
    brow furrows as he quickly texts Bryce back. 

    Tyler: Where r u?  

    Bryce: Peace Ambass. Center.  Dude, it's awesome here.

    Tyler: U got your parents 2 sign the form?

    Bryce: Hell no - I forged their signature.

    Bryce: The dude in the pic with me is Matt.  Way cool V. 
    So are his friends.  

    Bryce: Tell you all about it tomorrow -- Later, hater.

    Tyler just sits there, suddenly feeling very alone.  His
    eyes shift to the blank Peace Ambassador Application on the
    coffee table... 


    She creeps through a labyrinth of metal fences.  Rounds a
    corner and runs into two MEN.  Playing it cool:

                                    ERICA
                  I'm here for the meeting.  

    Off their looks as they size her up...                                                                                          46.



    The men have led Erica into a room with 25 other people. As
    she's being frisked, she eyes the other faces.  People from
    all walks of life, including two we recognize... 

    ...Father Jack and Georgie.  


    Chad with Anna getting ready for the interview.  Marcus
    hovers close by.

                                    CHAD
                  Thanks again for choosing me to do
                  this.  I'm really excited.  

                                    ANNA
                  So are we.

                                    CHAD
                  Do you have any questions before we
                  go to air?

                                    ANNA
                  No.

                                    CHAD
                  Good.

                                    ANNA
                  Just be sure not to ask anything
                  that'd paint us in a negative light.

                                    CHAD
                  Excuse me?

                                    ANNA
                  Do not ask questions that will portray
                  us negatively.  Ask ones like you
                  did the first time we met.

                                    CHAD
                  I think there's a mistake.  I'm a
                    journalist.  It's my job to ask
                  questions even if they make the other
                  person uncomfortable.

                                    ANNA
                  That was not my understanding.

                                    FLOOR MANAGER
                  One minute to air...

                                    CHAD
                  I'm afraid I don't have a choice.

                                    ANNA
                        (rises)
                  The interview is now canceled.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          47.
    CONTINUED:

                                    CHAD
                  Whoa, hang on a sec...  This is just
                  how it's done.  I swear I'll be fair.  

                                    MARCUS
                  You'll need to be more than fair if
                  you want to proceed.  

                                    ANNA
                  We cannot be seen in a negative light. 

                                    FLOOR MANAGER
                  Thirty seconds...

                                    ANNA
                  This interview would elevate your
                  career, wouldn't it Mr. Decker? 
                  Don't you want to elevate your career?


    NEIL, the guy in charge, eyes his watch.  To another:

                                    NEIL
                  Still no word from Owen, but we can't
                  wait any longer.

    He moves to the door, and in the first of a number of ominous
    moments to come, locks himself and everyone else inside.  

    Immediately, three other men surround the group and raise
    their guns.  Incredibly, no one seems to be surprised.  But
    it's all Erica and Jack can do to contain themselves. 

                                    NEIL (CONT'D)
                  This is a word of mouth group.  You're
                  here because someone we trust
                  personally referred you.

    A DOCTOR then pulls several hypodermic needles from a bag.

                                    NEIL (CONT'D)
                  This man's a doctor.  He'll be
                  injecting a small dose of anesthetic
                  into each of you. 

                                    DOCTOR
                  I know most of you haven't been here
                  before, but you were told to prepare
                  for the test.  It's necessary to
                  ensure we're all who we say we are.

    The doctor steps to the first attendee and slides a needle
    under the scalp at the back of his head.

    Erica's heart pounds, as does Father Jack's.  Both taking
    each moment as it comes - trying to figure out what the
    fuck they've gotten themselves into...

                                                                            CUT TO BLACK:                                                                                          48.



    FADE UP on Chad, smiling for the camera.

                                    CHAD
                  Good evening and welcome.  Tonight,
                  BBN is proud to present the first
                  up-close and personal interview
                  with Anna, the Visitor High
                  Commander.  
                        (turns to Anna)
                  On behalf of all of us, I'd like to
                  thank you for the opportunity to get
                  to know you a little better.

                                    ANNA
                  No, thank YOU, Chad.  And please ask
                  anything and everything.  I'm here
                  to discuss all topics without reserve.  

    Off Chad's look, knowing she's full of shit...


    Erica rubs the back of her head, the anesthetic having kicked
    in.  She looks on as the doctor who did the injecting now
    pulls a scalpel from his bag.  He approaches a man...

                                    DOCTOR
                  Please turn away from me.

    The man does and incredibly, the doctor slices a V-shaped
    wedge into the man's scalp.  

    Erica and Jack can't believe it.  The doctor then uses
    forceps to lift the flap of skin.

                                    DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                  Please confirm you see skull bone.

    The others take a peek.  Lots of nods, confirming there is
    skull under the skin.  

    The doctor replaces the flap while an assistant uses a
    medical stapling device to seal the wound.  

                                    DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                  It's painless.  
                        (moves to Erica)
                  Please turn away from me.


    Father Travis watches the interview on TV:  

                                    CHAD (ON TV)
                  What's life like where you come from?  

                                    ANNA (ON TV)
                  Our planet is a place of great beauty. 
                  Vast cities, massive oceans.  

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          49.
    CONTINUED:

                                    ANNA (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                  Much like Earth.  Though unlike you,
                  we don't divide ourselves into 
                  countries.  We're one united people...  


    KACHUNK.  Father Jack is the last to receive a staple in
    the back of his head, sealing his flap.  

                                    NEIL
                  Thank you for your cooperation.  You
                  all passed the test.

                                    ERICA
                  Test for what?

                                    NEIL
                  To ensure you're not a Visitor. 
                        (off her confused look)
                  I thought everyone was up to speed.  
                        (explaining)
                  In order to walk among us, the
                  Visitors have disguised their
                  appearance by cloning human flesh
                  over their own reptilian bodies.

    Erica stares at Neil - this guy can't be fucking serious.  

                                    DOCTOR
                  The base of the skull is an area
                  where skin barely covers bone.  It's
                  hard for them to mask, thus the test.  

    Erica suddenly thinks she's stumbled into a den of paranoid,
    conspiracy nut jobs.  Neil turns to Georgie...

                                    NEIL
                  Why don't you get everyone caught
                  up, Georgie?

                                    GEORGIE
                        (rises)
                  The Visitors didn't just get here
                  three weeks ago...  They've been here
                  for years...                                                                                          50.



    Val and Cass watching Anna's interview:  

                                    CHAD
                  You've said we're the only other
                    intelligent life you've encountered
                  in your travels?

                                    ANNA
                  Yes.  Humanity is a rare gift, one
                  we hold in the highest regard...


                                    GEORGIE
                  For decades they've been implementing
                  a plan that will result in the
                    extermination of every man, woman
                  and child on the face of the earth...  


                                    ANNA
                  We are honored and privileged to be
                  able to assist mankind with our
                  knowledge and technology.  Truth be
                  told, it stirs great emotion in us...  


                                    GEORGIE
                  V's posing as humans have established
                  themselves in all facets of life. 
                  Business, government, religion, the
                    military... It took years... 

    Erica and Jack try to make sense out of what they're hearing.


                                    CHAD
                  Are you emotional beings?

                                    ANNA
                  We are, but we've evolved to quickly
                  process and expel all negative
                  feelings.  Happiness we've learned,
                  comes from tranquility and peace.


                                    GEORGIE
                  Once embedded in society, they set
                  out to create worldwide instability. 
                    Unnecessary wars.  Economic meltdown.   
                  Faith twisted into extremism...                                                                                           51.



                                    GEORGIE
                  All the while, Visitors became adept
                  at manipulating the media to get people
                  to believe what they needed them to
                  believe.

                                    CHAD (V.O.)
                        (to Anna)
                  If you could speak to the protesters,
                  what would you say to them? 


                                    GEORGIE
                  The final phase of the Visitor's
                  decades long plan began three weeks
                  ago with the V's revealing themselves
                  to us...


    Tyler watching intently.  

                                    ANNA
                  We know we represent great change...

    Anna's inspirational words speak directly to him...

                                    ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...But all we ask is for you to put
                  your hand in ours, and trust in us -
                  together we can make your world a
                  better place...

    Off Tyler, moved by the sentiment...                                                                                           52.



                                    NEIL
                  They build trust with the promise of
                  friendship and technology. 

    The room listening to him motionless...

                                    NEIL (CONT'D)
                  Of course all they're really doing
                  is positioning themselves as the
                  saviors of mankind... 

    PRELAP: the kick start of a bike - VROOOM...


    The TV now off.  The house still.  Neil continues... 

                                    NEIL (V.O.)
                  ...By the time people figure it out,
                  it'll be too late...  

    A moment later - through the window - we see Tyler pulling
    out of the driveway and ZOOMING OFF down the road.

                                    NEIL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  ...They'll take over -- unless we
                  can stop them.


    Neil eyes the room.

                                    NEIL
                  I see the looks.  It's the first
                  time here for a lot of you - I'm
                  sure you think we're crazy.
                        (to Erica)
                  Right?

                                    ERICA
                  Where did you get all this
                  information?

                                    NEIL
                  We have our sources.

                                    ERICA
                        (has had enough)
                  I need to go.  Please open the door.

                                    NEIL
                  You don't believe us. 

                                    ERICA
                  Do you have any proof?  You know,
                  other than scary stories being passed
                  around the internet.   



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          53.

                                    NEIL
                  Who are you?  Who referred you?

                                    ERICA
                  It doesn't matter, open the door.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Excuse me--

                                    NEIL
                  I want to know who you are.

                                    ERICA
                  I said open the door.

                                    FATHER JACK
                  I have proof - I think.

    They eye him holding the now open envelope in his hand.

                                    FATHER JACK (CONT'D)
                  It's a list of names - supposedly
                  Visitors living on Earth...

    Erica rolls her eyes, gets up to leave.

                                    FATHER JACK (CONT'D)
                  It says these Visitors received fake
                  documents to pass as human.  

    Erica stops on the words "fake documents."  

                                    FATHER JACK (CONT'D)
                  Passports, driver's licenses...

    She eyes the list of names.  Three pop out at her: Al Miller,
    Margie Johnson, Mike Smith...

                                                                                  FLASH TO:


    CLOSE ON the list of names that were recovered from the farm
    house: Al Miller, Margie Johnson, Mike Smith...

                                                                                  FLASH TO:


    And it hits her... is it possible the terrorist cell she's
    been investigating is not a human cell, but instead...

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Could this be a sleeper cell of
                  Visitors?  

    Off Erica reeling, the pieces all falling into place...

                                                                      HARD CUT TO BLACK:

                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                          54.


                                          ACT SIX

    FADE IN:


    Chad sits at his computer, decompressing after the night
    he's just had, a beer in his hand.  

    He scrolls through countless emails from friends and
    colleagues congratulating him on his interview with Anna. 

    Then he comes across one from the Press Secretary to the
    Vice President.  It's from Alison, the woman who he slept
    with in Act 1.  

    It reads: Congrats on tonight.  So whose morals did you have
    to corrupt to get that gig ;) LOL

    Before he can answer, there's a commotion outside his office. 
    A sudden giddiness from his co-workers, as if a celebrity
    just entered the building.  And one kinda has.  

    Chad looks up to see Marcus stepping into his office.  He
    smiles as he closes the door behind him.

                                    MARCUS
                  Anna LOVED you!  

                                    CHAD
                  I'm sure she did.

                                    MARCUS
                  She wants you to know we intend to
                  call on you again.  She trusts you. 

                                    CHAD
                  I'm not sure I trust her.

                                    MARCUS
                  Look, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding
                  tonight, but you did the right thing.
                        (beat)
                  Compromising one's principles for
                  the greater good is not a shameful
                  act - it's a noble one.

                                    CHAD
                  What greater good?

                                    MARCUS
                  Your people are easily threatened. 
                  What you did tonight went a long way
                  toward disarming that threat.  You
                  made a lot of people feel good. 
                  What's the harm?

    He considers for a moment, then...

                                    CHAD
                  What do you mean you're gonna "call
                  on me again?"



                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          58.
    CONTINUED:

                                    MARCUS
                  Whenever Anna has something
                    significant to say, we'd like her to
                  say it through you.  
                        (leans in)
                  Unless you have an aversion to a
                  worldwide audience hanging on your
                  every word.

    Marcus smiles warmly, turns and heads out.  Chad sits there
    still digesting.  Careful what you wish for.

    His eyes shift back to his email.  The last line of Alison's
    message pops out at him: ...So whose morals did you have to
    corrupt to get that gig...

    Off his look... he deletes the email.


    Ryan slips in the door quietly.  He's thrown a long sleeve
    hoodie on from his car to cover the wound on his arm.  As
    he rounds a corner he's surprised to find Valerie in the
    dark - tears in her eyes.  Moves to her:

                                    RYAN
                  Val?  What's wrong?

    She shows him what she has in her hand; the engagement ring. 
    Throws her arms around him, pulls him close.

                                    VALERIE
                  I didn't mean to find it.  You were
                  going to ask me to marry you.

    Looks into her eyes; the emotion overwhelms him.  

                                    RYAN
                  Was even gonna get down on one knee.

                                    VALERIE
                  I love you.

    She hugs him close again.  Off this tableau...


    Erica and Jack at a table, still in shock.  The mothership
    seen through the window, looming in the distance.  

                                    ERICA
                        (re: Dale; numb)
                  I can't get that... that image of
                  him lying there out of my head...

    Father Jack takes her hand to comfort her.  They lock eyes -
    two lost souls seeking strength from one another.    

                                    FATHER JACK
                  What do we do now?                                                                                            59.



    A large reception packed with humans and Visitors alike. 
    There's a celebratory atmosphere among the crowd.  OVER
    PICTURE we hear Erica and Jack continuing to talk...

                                    ERICA (V.O.)
                          (steeling herself)
                  ...The bigger the conspiracy the
                  more leaks there are.  We just have
                  to connect with them...

    CAMERA pushes through the large crowd.  People smiling,
    LAUGHING, enjoying themselves.

                                    ERICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  We'll help build a resistance.

    CAMERA continues through the crowd, headed for a stage at
    the front of the gathering.

                                    ERICA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  We'll recruit.  Bring more into the
                  fold -- we just have to be careful.


    As they talk, the sun begins to peek above the horizon.   

                                    FATHER JACK
                  We will.  But we HAVE to fight!

    She eyes the man who mere hours ago proclaimed himself a
    coward, and sees anything but.  Drawing strength from him...

                                    ERICA
                  We'll fight - But they got a big
                  head start.  


    CAMERA zeros in on a SPEAKER at a podium in front of a curtain.

                                    SPEAKER
                  Ladies, gentlemen and Visitor friends. 
                  It's time to introduce you to them. 
                  These selfless individuals are the
                  first of what we hope will be many...


                                    ERICA
                  And they're arming themselves with
                  the most powerful weapon out there--

                                    FATHER JACK
                  Yeah?  What's that?                                                                                          60.



                                    SPEAKER
                  I give you the Peace Ambassadors.  

    MASSIVE CHEERING as the curtain opens. CAMERA TRACKS down
    the line of HUMANS who've dedicated themselves to the V's... 

                                    FATHER JACK (V.O.)
                  Erica...?  What big weapon?

    ...and lands on the last in line -- Tyler.


                                    ERICA
                  ...Devotion.


    Tyler, soaking up the CHEERS and ADULATION, spots Lisa among
    the crowd.  He smiles at her.  She smiles back.

    Finally -- it's good to be Tyler Evans. 

                                    SPEAKER
                  Welcome to the dawn of a new day.

    The crowd ROARS even LOUDER as we CRANE UP, taking in the
    large group of brand new Peace Ambassadors.  As the MUSIC
    SWELLS, we cut in-time on the HARD PERCUSSIVE BEAT TO: 

    SAO PAULO, BRAZIL'S MOTHERSHIP

    TOKYO'S MOTHERSHIP 

    ROME'S MOTHERSHIP 

    NEW YORK'S MOTHERSHIP
