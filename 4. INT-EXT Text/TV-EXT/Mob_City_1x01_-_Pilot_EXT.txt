A PAIR OF TOO-BIG SHOES, old and falling apart, come up
the sidewalk, a BASEBALL BAT dragging alongside...

SUPER TITLE:             "1922"

CAMERA BOOMS UP along an assortment of tortured hand-me-
downs to the face of a 9 YEAR-OLD BOY striding the sidewalk
like he owns it, dragging the bat. 

TWO OTHER BOYS, GABE and HERSCHEL, trail behind him, trying
to look tough, following their leader.


The kid comes to a free-standing ticket booth fronting
the sidewalk and peers up at the TICKET GIRL inside. She's
engrossed in a paperback romance, glances up.

TICKET GIRL
Would you like a ticket?

KID
(smirks at his boys)
Ticket, she says. 
(to the girl)
Just what's in the cashbox,
sis, and no lip outta you.

She hesitates, taken aback, decides this has to be some
kind of unfunny joke:

TICKET GIRL
Now listen, little boy...

The kid hefts the bat and swings, SMASHES the glass in
front of her face (the glass spiderwebs but holds
together.) The girl SCREAMS, her book goes flying.

KID
GIMME IT, LADY! FORK IT OVER!

The kid goes berserk swinging, SMASHING THE GLASS on all
sides, the girl trapped and SCREAMING inside.

Gabe and Herschel are frozen, wide-eyed with shock. 

TWO BEAT COPS run out of a diner across the street, drawn
by the commotion. Herschel sees them, yells to Mickey:

HERSCHEL
MICKEY! COPS!2.

The kid with the bat doesn't hear, doesn't care, just
keeps swinging: SMASH! SMASH! SMASH! 

KID
NOW, BITCH, NOW!

The cops come running, dodging traffic. Gabe and Herschel
take to their heels, fleeing the scene...

Quaking and near tears, the ticket girl grabs the cashbox,
digs out the money and shoves it at the kid.

TICKET GIRL
Here! Just take it and go!

He grabs the loot, turns and runs --

-- right into the arms of the arriving cops. Cop #1 grabs
him, hoists him kicking and screaming into the air as:

IMAGE FREEZES: The punk kid is frozen before us in the
arms of the law, face twisted in rage and defiance...

JOE TEAGUE  (V.O.)
That 9 year-old who just robbed
a movie theater and got pinched
for his trouble? That's Meyer
Harris Cohen, but everybody
calls him Mickey. 
(beat)
By 1947, he'll be the boss of
all organized crime in L.A.

IMAGE UNFREEZES: Money flying in the air, kid kicking and
screaming. The bat lands a lucky shot to Cop #2's nuts,
sends him groaning to his knees...

MICKEY
SCREW YA MAMAS, YA BASTARDS!


BILL, a 17 year-old usher, is drawn outside as a MODEL-T
POLICE CAR goes by with a WAIL OF A HAND-CRANKED SIREN. 

Bill gazes up the street. There's some kind of commotion
a block away; a crowd has formed. 

FRANCETTE (fellow usher and Bill's future wife), hurries
up from that direction, late for work. 

FRANCETTE
Some pint-size lunatic just
tried to rob the Columbia, you
believe it?3.

BILL
You're kidding.

FRANCETTE
With a bat! Clara, the ticket
girl? He smashed up her booth! 

BILL
She okay?

FRANCETTE
Shook up pretty bad.

In the distance: Mickey gets loaded into the police car,
kicking and hollering at the cops who nabbed him.

Bill watches, shakes his head. Unbelievable.

BILL
Thank God for the cops, huh?

Francette pauses at the door, throws him a deadpan look.

FRANCETTE
Those lugs? They come in here
all the time, copping free candy,
free popcorn...copping a feel
while they're at it.
(off his shocked look)
There's a reason they're called
"cops." 

BILL
They do that? That's not right.

FRANCETTE
Tell you what. You're such a
boy scout, you go set 'em
straight. 
(smirks)
Bill the boy scout...

She goes inside. HOLD ON BILL watching the police car
depart, hauling little Mickey Cohen off to jail... 


SUPER TITLE:             "1924"

A FAT IRISH SERGEANT and a BLACK BEAT COP are poised over
the hood of a CAR. The sergeant raises a MEGAPHONE...

SERGEANT
YOU IN THERE! YOU'RE SURROUNDED!
COME OUT WITH YOUR HA--4.

BLAM! The WINDSHIELD IS BLOWN APART in a hail of buckshot.

The cops drop for cover behind the car, sprawling on their
asses as shards rain down. (No safety glass in 1924.)

They brush glass off themselves. A DOZEN OTHER COPS are
staring at them, everybody crouching behind VEHICLES.

We hear a DISTANT VOICE SHOUTING:  

VOICE (O.S.)
Keep talkin' fat man! I'm gonna
kill these damn fools in here,
just see if I don't!

The sergeant sighs, looks at his men. 

COP #1
What do we do, Sarge?

SERGEANT
We can't just sit here! He's
got hostages, fer Chrissake!
Somebody's gotta go in. 

He looks around for volunteers. Faces staring back.

COP #2
What about Parker?

The sergeant draws a blank. The cop cocks his thumb. 

BILL, no longer a theater usher, now a 19 year-old rookie,
is crouched several cars away, separate from the group. 

SERGEANT
Ain't that the numbnuts who
hauled in the captain's drinking
buddy for drunk driving? 

COP
And booked him.

Beat. The sergeant smiles.

SERGEANT
You! Parker! 

Bill sees the sergeant beckoning. He scurries over.

BILL
Sergeant.

SERGEANT
This one's yours. 5.

Bill absorbs that. Sees a few cops snickering.

Bill decides these guys aren't getting the better of him.
No way. He gives the sergeant a brisk nod. 

THE LINE OF CARS

Bill rises into view, gazes across the street at a small
GROCERY STORE, a typical Mexican mom-and-pop bodega.

Through the windows, we catch glimpses of a GUNMAN with a
shotgun pacing back and forth, scanning the street.

He sees Bill, pokes the shotgun out a window.

GUNMAN
YOU WANNA DIE RIGHT THERE? JUST
KEEP IT UP, BLUE BOY!

Showing he's not a threat, Bill gingerly draws his sidearm
with two fingers, lays it gently aside on the car's hood.

BILL
I'M COMING OVER TO TALK!

It makes the gunman pause. Bill raises his hands and steps
out, starts carefully across the street while all the
other cops trade looks: shit, he's really doing it!

GUNMAN
Slow and easy, boy! Less ya
want a load of buckshot in that
blue belly a yours!

Bill keeps coming, hands raised. The gunman has him in
his sights, tracking him...

BEHIND THE CARS

The cops frozen, watching. The sergeant is sweating
buckets, grimacing, regretting his hasty move:

SERGEANT
Aw, Sufferin' Christ...this
dummy's gonna die...


The gunman moves from the window to the front door (which
is locked, a set of keys dangling in the jamb). 

Bill arrives outside. The gunman faces him through the
glass, the shotgun leveled. 

Bill can see FOUR HOSTAGES huddled on the floor inside.6.

GUNMAN
What the hell you want? You
wanna be on a slab? That what
you wanna talk about?

Bill gestures to his ears, speaks loudly: 

BILL
Sorry! I'm having trouble hearing
you! Could you speak up? 

GUNMAN
I'LL BLOW YOU OUT OF YOUR DUMB
COP SHOES! YOU HEAR THAT OKAY?

Bill's "can't hear you" gestures increase...

BILL
SAY AGAIN? LITTLE LOUDER? 

GUNMAN
(glances to hostages)
They sent me a deaf cop, you
believe this shit? 
(top of his lungs)
YOU DEAF AND STUPID! YOU HEAR
ME NOW, BLUE BITCH?

Bill is shaking his head, motioning to his ears...

BILL
I JUST WANNA TALK! I'M UNARMED!
CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR JUST A
CRACK SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT? 

Exasperated, the gunman steps close to the door, grabs
the keys dangling in the lock... 

No sooner does he turn them...

BAM! Bill shoves the door in hard, whacks the gunman right
between the eyes with the door frame.

The man staggers back half a step, tries to bring the
shotgun to fire, but Bill thrusts his arm in, grabs him
to hold him in place, and: 

BAM-BAM-BAM! Bill keeps ramming the door frame rapid-fire
into the man's face, like a boxer with a punching bag.

The gunman's legs buckle. Bill squeezes in, pulls the
shotgun from the gunman's grasp as he keels over...

Bill raises the shotgun and starts racking the pump
repeatedly, ejecting the shells, as:7.

IMAGE FREEZES: Bill caught in mid-action, a shotgun shell
frozen in the air before us...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
This rookie will not be cited
for courage in the line of duty
for saving the lives of four
hostages. That's because nobody
likes him much. 
(beat)
Around the time Mickey Cohen
takes over running the L.A.
mob, Bill the Boy Scout here
will take over running the Los
Angeles Police Department. 

IMAGE UNFREEZES: Bill racking the pump, shells flying...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
Nobody calls him numbnuts after
that. They call him Chief of
Police William Parker. Or sir.


Parker drags the gunman out by the collar, hauls him across
the street. The hostages emerge, one of them a HISPANIC
WOMAN sobbing at the sky and blessing all the saints... 

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
White hats. Black hats. That's
what they always wore in those
old westerns we watched growing
up so we could tell the good
guys from the bad guys.

Bill hands the unloaded shotgun to the sergeant, hauls
the suspect onward toward the paddy wagon...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
That works in a kid's western.
In real life, it's different...


ANOTHER PAIR OF SHOES come up a sidewalk. These aren't
old or falling apart, they're new TWO-TONE FLORSHEIMS.  

CAMERA FOLLOWS the shoes...

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
In real life, the bad guys often
wear flashy shoes.

SUPER TITLE:               "1947"8.

CAMERA RISES along a sharp suit to a PAINTED SILK NECK
TIE (but we do not reveal the man's face). 

The tie's pattern is pure Vegas flash: cards and dice and
martinis. Vulgar? No, on this guy it looks great.

JOE TEAGUE (V.O.)
Their ties aren't bad either.
Expensive anyway. Silk. 

THE FLORSHEIMS

walk past azalea beds, past a lawn being watered...

A POODLE ON A LEASH goes by, followed by HIGH HEELS showing
off sensational legs (skirt below the knee)...

The Florsheims stop, turn back briefly as our unseen man
pauses to admire the woman who just passed him. 

We hear a low, quiet WOLF WHISTLE. 

The Florsheims then pivot forward again, keep walking...


Porkpie exits onto a sidewalk swarming with Central Avenue
night life: SWELLS and DAMES, PIMPS and HUSTLERS, WHITE
PEOPLE out slumming for kicks and jazz...

Porkpie steps off the curb...


Blazing blue skies. City Hall and its plaza dominate.

Joe comes up the sidewalk on his way to work...17.

On the lawn, a press event is taking place. PEOPLE in
folding chairs, REPORTERS scribbling notes, PHOTOGRAPHERS
snapping flash photos with GRAFLEX CAMERAS...

MAYOR FLETCHER BOWRON addresses the crowd from the dais:

MAYOR BOWRON
...latest rumors of corruption
are an attempt to undermine
confidence in this city's police
department and my administration.
I remind these critics that my
office has been at the forefront
of rooting out the bad apples
and eliminating the corruption
that existed in the past...

Joe moves past, heading for the building...

IN THE AUDIENCE

DETECTIVE HAL MORRISON is seated in a row near Captain
William Parker (now 42, imposing in his uniform) and DEPUTY
CAPTAIN MILES HEWITT, Parker's aide-de-camp.

Hal catches sight of Joe going into the building. He leans
out, looks down his row, where:

Porkpie Hat and Ruddy Face also lean out, returning Hal's
eye contact. Knowing looks passed.

During this exchange, up on the dais, Bowron has indicated
current Police Chief CLEMENCE HORRALL seated to his right:

MAYOR BOWRON
With the vigilance and dedication
of fine officers like Police
Chief Horrall, the efforts we
have spearheaded will continue
with all the vigor and resources
at our disposal so long as I am
mayor of this great city...

Hal rises, quietly edges from his row past Parker.

HAL
'Scuse me, Bill...


Headlights appear in a dark landscape...

TWO CARS, one leading the other, trail clouds of dust
through a desolate sprawl of derricks and dirt roads...


Joe gets out. It's eerily quiet, except for the ghostly
GROANS of the derricks rising and falling... 

Joe goes to his trunk. Hecky comes from the forward car. 

HECKY
What do you think?30.

JOE
I'd have picked a more public
place. 

Hecky glances nervously around as Joe opens his trunk.

JOE
Then again, up here there's
nobody around to get curious.
(off Hecky's look)
It's fine. 

F.G.: Hecky drifts toward us, fighting the jitters, gazing
out at the sea of city lights...

B.G.: Joe takes off his jacket, lays it on the lip of the
trunk, pulls BINOCULARS out, hangs them around his neck... 

Hecky glances back, as:

Joe pulls a long object wrapped in a blanket from the
trunk, unwraps it, throws the blanket back in...

It's a .30 caliber CARBINE RIFLE. Hecky's face goes slack
as Joe slots the ammo clip. 

HECKY
Think you'll need that?

JOE
Doubt it. Maybe.

Joe leans the rifle against the rear fender, grabs a
FLASHLIGHT, comes to where Hecky is.

Joe raises the binoculars, scans the terrain below. 

Hecky drifts nearer, checks his watch as he lights a
cigarette, trying to calm his nerves.

JOE
It's not too late, you know.

HECKY
For what?

JOE
Go a different way. 

HECKY
My way's fine.

JOE
Then why you shaking?31.

Hecky looks at his hand holding the cigarette -- it's
trembling. It flusters him.  

JOE
This evidence you've got. You
could take it to the police.
Get protection.

Hecky bursts out laughing. 

HECKY
Protection. That's a good one.
Remember Abe Reles? He got
protected right out a sixth-
floor window. Secure hotel room,
a dozen cops keeping tabs round-
the-clock. Some protection.

Joe, unruffled, keeps scanning the terrain.

JOE
Just a thought.

HECKY
You my rabbi? No? Then save it.
I'm paying you a grand to cover
my ass. That's a lot of money
for one ass. 

JOE
My math says two. That girl of
yours...Jasmine?

HECKY
Jesus, you got big ears. Don't
drag her into this.

JOE
You're the one who did that,
sounds like. She know the risk?

HECKY
Mostly.

JOE
Enough to not like it.

HECKY
She doesn't have to! She goes
my way. My way or the highway.

Hecky flings his cigarette to the ground, angrily crushes
it out with the toe of his shoe. 32.

HECKY
They don't know she's any part
of this. So just leave it alone.

Hecky fishes another cigarette from his pack, seething. 

HECKY
And don't confuse me for
upstanding. That's not what
this thing is. 

JOE
Tell me.

HECKY
(draws closer)
It's a winning hand. My whole
life I been dealt shit cards,
for once I'm holding a royal
flush. Instead of laying it
down and taking my chips, I
should do the cops a favor? 

Hecky turns away, lighting his cigarette...

HECKY
Don't make me laugh. Cops never
done nothing for Hecky Nash.
The Blue don't give a damn if I
live or die. 

JOE
The guy you're blackmailing
will. You'll be looking over
your shoulder the rest of your
life.  

HECKY
Been doing that since I was
born. Finally a win, that's
what this is. My ticket out.

He drifts to the edge of the road, gazes out at the vast
sprawl of lights.

HECKY
This city. So goddamn beautiful.
Like a sky full of stars. But
only from a distance. Up close,
it's all gutter. 
(glances to Joe)
You from here?

JOE
Detroit. Until the war.33.

HECKY
After the war? You didn't go
back. Why? 

JOE
I grew up in a slum. Didn't
want to die in one.  

HECKY
The war was your ticket out.
See? A smart guy plays the hand
he's dealt. 
(nods toward city)
Though you ask me, you traded
one slum for another. 

Hecky takes a drag, wanders back this way.

HECKY
Those islands you fought on.
Bet they were pretty too. Till
you went ashore.

JOE
No. Those were always ugly.
Rocks, most of 'em.

HECKY
Lot of men died for those ugly
rocks. Tell me the sense.

JOE
You could die for this scheme.
Is there sense in that? 
(off Hecky's look)
Just wonder if it's worth it.

HECKY
Might be, just for the looks on
their stupid faces.
(off Joe's look)
The wiseguys. They always get
the best. Clothes, booze, broads.
You see the cars they drive?
Money falls out of the sky for
these idiots. And the kicker?
Dumbest mugs you ever met. I
been around 'em all my life. 

JOE
Mickey Cohen?34.

HECKY
Yeah, Mickey. No secret. Since
the first grade I know him.
'Course he never got past the
second grade. 

He moves off again, shaking his head in wonder.

HECKY
The shit this guy's pulled. He
should be serving life, or dead
a dozen times over. Not Mickey.
All he does is rise. Makes like
he's the king. Got 300 suits in
his closet, you know that? The
finest shoes, a guy so dumb he
can barely tie the laces.

JOE
I thought you were friends.

HECKY
Friends. Okay, call it that.

Hecky lets out a bitter laugh. It's all coming out, the
seething resentment, a lifetime of pent-up bile...

HECKY
We were nine, he says "let's be
a gang, we'll pull a heist." Me
and another kid, Gabe Zamanski,
we say okay. We're kids, we
think it's a game. Mickey takes
us up to Hoyt Street where all
the movie theaters are, and
what's he do? Beats the shit
out of a ticket booth with a
baseball bat. The girl's inside
screaming her head off. Two
cops show up. I yell at Mickey,
try to warn him, does he listen?
Like hell. Mickey never listens.
(beat)
Me and Gabe run. Mickey gets
pinched. Think he blames himself?
Even a little? Think again. 

He flings his cigarette down, stomps it out.

HECKY
Me he blames. All these years
he rubs my nose in it. I never
live it down. He even gave me a
nickname: Jesse, he calls me. 
(MORE)35.

HECKY (CONT'D)
Like Jesse Owens. He says,
"That's you, Hecky. Jesse Owens.
A nigger who runs." And he laughs
his ass off, the sick bastard,
'cause that's funny to him. I'm
funny, I'm a goddamn joke.

Hecky pauses, roiling with shame. He meets Joe's gaze.

HECKY
(explodes)
I ran! I was nine years-old,
for Chrissake! 

JOE
The guy you're blackmailing. Is
it Mickey? 

Hecky hesitates, sees no reason not to say.

HECKY
No. Above him. Even Mickey
answers to somebody. Take my
word, this will not reflect
well on Mickey Cohen. And you
know what? That's jake by me.   

He turns away, stares off at the city.

HECKY
Why should they always get away
with it? Them and not me? My
whole life they feast, I get
crumbs. Well now it's my turn.
My score. For once the joke's
on them. I'll get to laugh.
(pause)
Is it worth it. What do you
think?

Joe's gaze shifts. 

JOE
I think they're here.

Hecky follows Joe's gaze. HEADLIGHTS below. A CAR is
wandering the oil field, searching... 

Hecky goes cold, walloped by fear and sudden doubt.

HECKY
Oh, Christ. 

Joe hands him the flashlight.36.

JOE
Get his attention. 

Hecky's scared, fumbles the flashlight, almost drops it. 

JOE
Second thoughts?
(Hecky nods)
Backing out was five minutes
ago. 

Joe turns and goes back to his car...

Hecky aims the flashlight down the hillside, clicks it on
and off to get the car's attention.

The headlights veer, coming this way. Hecky watches it
approach, his heart in his throat.

AT THE TRUNK

Joe throws a glance, sees Hecky's attention diverted. 

He leans in, uncovers the FLARE GUN. He breaks the breech,
loads a flare, getting it ready... 

Another fast glance. He tucks it in the back of his pants.

HECKY

glances back, sees Joe straighten up from the trunk. 

Joe grabs his rifle, comes back halfway, takes a flanking
position behind Hecky for a clear line of fire.

The car pulls in. Engine shuts off.

Doors open. Two DARK FIGURES get out. They come forward
into the light:

SID and TERRY, two mob bruisers. Sid shields his eyes
against the flashlight.

SID
Hecky? Is it you? 

HECKY
It's me.

SID
Lower the thing, willya? What
am I, a moth?

HECKY
Sorry.37.

Hecky lowers the beam. The men peer past him at Joe.

SID
Who's that? Who's back there? 

HECKY
A friend. 

SID
Show me him. He makes me nervous
in the dark back there. 

Hecky swings the flashlight beam...

Sid and Terry get a good look at Joe: badge on his belt,
carbine nestled in the crook of his arm.

Terry turns, mutters into Sid's shoulder:

TERRY
It's a cop. A goddamn cop. 

SID
(to Hecky)
You bring a cop to a thing like
this? What ails you?

HECKY
He's just a pal. Tagged along.

The wiseguys absorb this, getting the picture. 

SID
Give us a sec.

They draw aside into a private huddle, whispering:

SID
...he skunked us, the prick,
the skeevy little Hebe...

TERRY
...what do we do...

SID
...we got no choice here...we
gotta do it the other way...

TERRY
...boss won't be happy...

SID
...he can get in line...

They break their huddle, turn back to Hecky and Joe. 38.

SID
I don't like this should happen
with a cop. We're all just pals?  

JOE
Just pals. Like he said. 

SID
Okay. Fine. Long as it's pals.

He nods to Terry, who reaches into his coat... 

Joe swings his carbine up, finger tight on the trigger.

JOE
But go easy. Let's stay pals.

TERRY
I'm easy! 

Terry eases his hand from his coat, pulling out a five-
inch-thick envelope bound with a thick rubber band. 

Joe eases his aim, eyes going to Hecky. (His left hand
also starts easing around to the back of his belt where
the flare gun is hidden, getting ready to pull it...)

SID
Now you.

Hecky pulls a FLAT GRAY ENVELOPE. He steps forward, lets
Sid take it, backs away. 

JOE'S HAND (BEHIND HIS BACK)

His fingers touch the flare gun, tighten on the grip...

SID

opens the envelope flap to check the goods. He pulls out
a clear plastic sleeve of photo negatives.

SID
Little light here?

Hecky shines his light through the plastic sleeve, throwing
rows of grainy black-and-white images onto Sid's face. 

As the light plays, throwing all those tiny images...

WE PUSH IN ON JOE'S FACE

Like a man who's seen a ghost. Quietly rocked by some
realization. Those rows of negatives in their plastic
sleeve mean something to him.39.

JOE'S HAND (BEHIND HIS BACK)

The flare gun is frozen half out of his belt... 

Beat. He eases it back into his belt. His fingers uncurl,
letting go of the grip...

HECKY AND THE MOBSTERS

HECKY
He'll love 'em. Little grainy,
but they really show off his
profile. He's very handsome. 

Sid grunts, slides the sleeve back in the envelope.

SID
These all the negatives? Gotta
be all of 'em, you know that.  

HECKY
Every single one.

Sid gives Terry a nod. Terry tosses his envelope. Hecky
catches it, pulls off the rubber band, peers in. 

The sight of all the money takes Hecky's breath away. 

He tamps down his reaction, looks up at Sid.

SID
We done?

HECKY
We walk away whistling.

They go back to their car. Sid opens his door, pauses.

SID
Smart move tonight, Hecky. Well
played. See you around. 

HECKY
Doubt it. I won't be showing my
face much. 

SID
That might be best. You burned
bridges with this. Goes without
saying. I said it anyway.

They get in, the doors slam, the engine starts. The car
makes a tight U-turn, heads slowly back down the hill.

Joe eases his aim, lowers the carbine.40.

Hecky is electrified, watching the mobsters drive away.  

JOE
You made your score. How's it
feel?

Hecky lets out a dazed laugh. It's sinking in that he's
gotten away with it. He erupts in a scream of joy:

HECKY
Ha! That's how the hand is
played! Ace-high-straight,
suckers! Read 'em and weep!

He flips the car off, tracking its brake lights down the
hill with his middle finger raised.

HECKY
Take this back to the son of a
bitch that sent ya! This right
here! With my highest regards! 

Joe comes to Hecky, takes his flashlight back.

JOE
We should go now.

Hecky gets hold of himself, calming down.

HECKY
Just gimme a sec. I need a
second, okay? I just have to
take this in.

Joe smiles, indulges him, walks back to his car.

Hecky watches the mobsters' brake lights crawl slowly
back down the hill...

HECKY
The looks on their faces. That's
the look I was talkin' about.
That look when they see the
cards lay down on the table.

Hecky turns, soaring. Joe's at his open trunk unloading
the carbine, removing the clip.

Hecky approaches him, stops halfway.

HECKY
'Cause of you. 

Joe smiles, stows the clip in the trunk, pulls out the
blanket to re-wrap the rifle.41.

JOE
All I did was show up. What you
did took balls. You did good. 

Hecky turns to savor one last look down the hill. The
mobsters' tail-lights are vanishing in the distance...

HECKY
My whole life I waited for a
moment like this. Now I get to
rise. I'm king. Me, Hecky Nash.

Behind him, Joe stows the rifle in the trunk... 

HECKY
(yells)
Like friggin' Cagney! Top of
the world, Ma!

...rises back out with a SNUB-NOSE .38...

JOE
Top of the world, Hecky.

POP! POP! Two in the back. 

Hecky arches, pure shock. He takes a few lurching, drunken
steps forward, then swandives face-first into the dirt.

The shots echo away. They weren't even very loud. 

All we hear now is the eerie groaning of the oil derricks
rising and falling all around us...

Joe walks over to Hecky sprawled facedown. 

Hecky stirs, lets out a moan. Still alive. 

He shifts, rolls over onto his back, looks up at Joe with
absolute shock in his eyes. This can't be happening. 

HECKY
But--but--you're a cop!

Joe aims down. Hecky gasps, shields his face with his
hands...

POP! Right through both hands, a spray of blood.

Beat. Hecky's hands fall away, revealing a ragged hole in
his forehead, a faint wisp of smoke drifting out. 

Hecky's feet kick a few times. Final death twitch. 

Pause. Joe proceeds calmly, methodically:42.

He pulls a rag, wipes his prints off the gun, tosses it
on the ground near Hecky's corpse. 

He crouches, grabs the envelope of money, rises and goes
back toward his car... 

Along the way, he pulls the flare gun, aims it up:

WHOOOOSSH! The flare FIRES skyward, arcing high overhead...

He gets to the trunk, tosses the flare gun back in, grabs
his jacket off the trunk's lip, puts it back on...

SHOT BECOMES A STEADICAM FOLLOW:

Joe leaves the murder scene and cars behind, walks out
into the surrounding oil fields...

The groaning of the derricks is much louder now...

He moves among them, picking a random path...

POLICE SIRENS rise in the distance, faint at first... 

Joe pauses, looks around, makes an equally random choice:

He picks a derrick, checks it out, runs his hand up along
the steel structure. Finds a good hiding place.

The POLICE SIRENS swell ever louder, coming this way...

Joe slots the envelope of money into the hiding place
he's found, jams it tight into the cranny...

CAMERA FOLLOWS Joe back as he retraces his random path
through the derricks...

SIRENS GROWING LOUDER AND CLOSER by the moment...

He arrives back at the murder scene, stepping out onto
the road, just as:

The CARS appear. LIGHTS AND SIRENS split the night.

Joe holds up his badge as they pull in, the scene going
chaotic, COPS pouring out of their cars...

Hal Morrison runs up, trailed by Fat Jack toting a shotgun,
all the men stunned at the sight of Hecky's corpse:

HAL
What the hell happened?43.

JOE
I told him if I fell behind on
the drive over here, he should
pull up and wait for me down
the hill, we'd come up together.
(looks at the corpse)
I don't know why he didn't.

HENDRY
He came up alone? Moron! They
were waiting for him up here. 

JOE
Looks like they clipped him
when he got out of his car. 
(aims his flashlight)
They left that behind. 

Flashlight beams converge on the discarded .38.

JOE
I didn't see anybody, no other
cars. I just drove up here and
found him like that.
(off Hal's look)
I couldn't have been more than
three minutes behind him.

FAT JACK
See? What I say? Three minutes
can make all the difference.

HAL
What about his evidence?

JOE
(shrugs)
Soon as I saw him, I fired off
the flare and waited for you.   

HAL
(to the men)
Check the body! And tear his
damn car apart!

Hendry drops to a crouch, searching Hecky's body.

ANGLE CLOSES ON Joe just standing there, the calm at the
center of the storm, watching it all unfold... 

AS WE SETTLE INTO HIS CLOSEUP:

PER-LAP THE SOUND OF A SMOKY, WAILING JAZZ SAX...

DISSOLVE TO:44.
