Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
his cell and dials.

Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
EVAN
What's up?
SETH
I was doing research last night, for next
year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang
Bus.
EVAN
Which one's Bang Bus?
SETH
The one where they bang the chicks on the
bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging
them myself.
EVAN
That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking
it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
at the bill.
SETH
It shows up under a different name.

I hope. Bang Bus.

SETH
I could tell my parents I'm doing a
project on Rome and I have to research
orgies.

Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
EVAN
You're being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn't park there.
SETH
Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
least they can do for stealing three
years of my life.
They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
Seth.
EVAN
What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
SETH
Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in
capture the flag last week.
EVAN
Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate
that guy.
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

Look at those nipples.
SETH
They're like baby toes.
EVAN
It's not fair. I have to hide every
erection I get.
SETH
Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
hide them. And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding, and it all just,
like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
this...thing...that's attached to me. And
it won't go away.
EVAN
Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see `em, like this shit.
SETH
You know it's been, like, a year and a
half since I've seen an actual human
female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
last month, and it was sick.
EVAN
Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
SETH
Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
EVAN
How can that possibly suck? I'd be
fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!
SETH
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
gettin' career, and it happened way, way,
way too early.
EVAN
You're like Orson Welles.

SETH
Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
probably at least be having steady sex
with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point. I honestly now see why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death.
EVAN
You'll have sex in college. Everyone
does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
Bus.
SETH
But the key is to be good at sex by the
time you're in college. You don't want
girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
EVAN
I still think you've got a chance with
Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
she still flirts with you.
SETH
Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
and what's-his-face. All of those were
cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
you think. Why would she end her high
school career with me?
EVAN
Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
SETH
Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
loser. You're a step up from that. Which
is why you should stop being a pussy and
do her! You could nailthe shit out of
her for, like, two months before you
leave. That bitch looks like a good
fucker.
EVAN
Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
like that, man!
Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
SETH
What, you can talk about that bitch all
day every single day, but I can't say one
thing about her?

Some women pride themselves on their dick-
taking abilities.

Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.
She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.
The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as
they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a
pen.
HELEN
Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
EVAN
Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep
it. Then you'll just have it, and you
won't have to borrow another pen.
HELEN
Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did
you hear about Terry's grad party? It's

basement...
An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer

The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce

adults look at them like they are morons.
EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.)

EVAN
Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got

Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard
reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.
Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.
SETH
Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
thought I'd be cooking with a partner.
It's not fair. She's never here. I don't
get twice the marks for doing all the
work.
MRS. GREIR
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
SETH
Look at Evan.
Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They
both laugh hard.

MRS. GREIR
Well, save it for next week. Today Jules'
partner isn't here either. Pair up with
her. Station four.
SETH
Jules?
The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four,
nervous as hell.
ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking.
She
stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.
Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,
unsure of what to say.
JULES
Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?
SETH
That's kind of a personal question.
JULES
What?
SETH
(nervous)
Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
JULES
Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd
be forced to work with me. There's my
attempt at humour.
SETH
Well, I would call that a success.

Jules watches as Seth awkwardly removes the tiramisu from the
oven and places it on the table.
JULES
What are you doing tonight?
SETH
I don't know, probably nothing. Why?
JULES
My parents are out of town and I'm
thinking of having a party. I don't know
how big it'll be, but you should come
anyways.
SETH
Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love
parties.
JULES
Really? I don't usually see you at them.
SETH
Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate
thing. Right now I love them, though.
Uh...how do I do this?
JULES
I'll write down my address and number.

the pants.

We see Fogell, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly

It's nine thirty.
NICOLA

FOGELL
I told her what time it was. It was

FOGELL

arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same
place Mike Snider went to pick up my
brand new false identification card.
SETH
Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan,
didn't you just say that you heard about
a party?

Why didn't you tell me?

Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he

Sounds cool. Cool.

EVAN
Why?
SETH
I was never going to tell you this story,

would never want to get with Helen, but
over the last few weeks I've been having
a hard time thinking of a reason not to.
So, here it is. Helen and I went to
elementary school together, right?

Well, in the third grade, I

You're not coming, are you?

thinking I could buy you yours, if you
needed someone to.
HELEN
Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me

Evan leaves.

Seth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a
SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers.
SETH
(to himself)
Hope piggy can run.
He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the
long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD
WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers.
44
44
Seth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze
in the conveyor belt.
CASHIER
How old are you?
(CONTINUED)
33.

CONTINUED:

SETH
Twenty two.
CASHIER
You certainly are. That'll be eighty
dollars.
Seth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.
SETH
Thank you kindly.
CASHIER
You're welcome, Seth.
45
45
Seth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his
head. He eyeballs the old lady.
46
46
The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand
reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth.
SETH
Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse.
Would you like me to help you to your
car?
OLD LADY
That would be lovely, young man. Would
you like me to buy you alcohol?
SETH
That would be lovely!
48

Seth shakes his head. He looks down the aisle again, takes a
breath and starts walking.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks
down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads,
"GOLDSCHLAGER."
SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)
Don't do it kid.
We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth
doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.
SETH
I never had a choice.
He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it
with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at
Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY
in the head.
OLD LADY
(in agony)
AAAHHHHH!!!
Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce
bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken
end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out.
Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.

MORE MIND-BLOWINGLY BADASS FUNK MUSIC OVER Seth, Evan and
Fogell sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy,
unpleasant looking strangers. Nothing happens whatsoever.
52
52
At first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused,
dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and
takes a few deep breaths.
CLERK
Hi there.
Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps
walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell
passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly
recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the
opposite direction.
SON
Fogell?

FOGELL
(weird voice, covering his
face)
No.
SON
Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing
here?
FOGELL
(weird voice)
Uh...nothing. Not Fogell...
(whisper)
Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me.
MOSCOVITCH
(knowingly)
Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck.
He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at
the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly
opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack
and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the
other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop
the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is
impossible.
FOGELL
Fuck.
A CLERK approaches Fogell.
CLERK
Is there a problem, sir?
FOGELL
Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.
CLERK
(pointing to the beer on the
floor)
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?
FOGELL
(beat)
No.
(beat)
I think it happened before.
Fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all
over his legs, holding a can of beer.

CLERK
Are you sure?
FOGELL
I think I would know, thank you.
Fogell walks away.
53

Fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line
to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is
currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.
CASHIER
Um, yes, may I please see some ID?
OLD-LOOKING GUY
No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in
years.
CASHIER
Anyone who looks under thirty-five.
The guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches.
55
55
Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him
kind of funny.
FOGELL
Hello...
(reading name tag)
Mindy.
She rings up a six pack of Budweiser.
FOGELL (CONT'D)
Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it
for years. I heard they recently decided
to start adding more hops.
Fogell just nods kind of proud of himself. She stops ringing
stuff up and looks at him.
(CONTINUED)
41.

CASHIER
Umm, okay sir, I'm gonna need to see some
ID.
FOGELL
Identification?

The cashier is still examining the card. She hands it back to
Fogell.

CASHIER
That comes to a total of $123.59
A huge smile forms on Fogell's face as he pulls out a wad of
money and hands it to the cashier. She starts to gather his
change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Fogell
right in the side of the head!!! Fogell falls to the ground.
The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a
handful of money and runs!
The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Fogell is on
the ground, dazed and confused.
FOGELL
What the hell happened?!
Fogell sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the
police.
CASHIER
(breathing hard)
I don't believe it...I don't believe
it....
59
59
The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and
OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the
Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.
OFFICER SLATER
(to cashier)
So, did he punch anyone else?
CASHIER
(losing it completely)
I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I
have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand
that? A goddamn exam!
The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of
the store. The officers look at each other.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Apparently, she has an exam.
They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell.
OFFICER SLATER
(turn to Fogell)
So then, son, you're the one that got
punched?
Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then
back at the cops. He nods.
OFFICER MICHAELS
We'd like to ask you a couple questions.
The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil.
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)
Okay, first things first. What's your
name?
(CONTINUED)
44.
59
CONTINUED:
59
Fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his
chest.
FOGELL
My name, it's...it's..
(tripping over his own words)
Mc..mac..laddle...
OFFICER SLATER
MicMac what?
FOGELL
No, no I said, "McLovin".
OFFICER MICHAELS
McLovin?
FOGELL
McLovin.
The officers both write down some information.
OFFICER SLATER
Cool name. And your first name?
Fogell looks twice as scared.
FOGELL
Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an
interesting...uh...event...
Fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily,
making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store,
we see Seth and Evan peeking through.
61
61
The cops are still talking to Fogell. He looks completely
flustered. He's lost his composure.
OFFICER SLATER
Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's
no need to get irrational.
In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we
see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey
jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is
lying, apologizing frantically.
OFFICER MICHAELS
A lot of people have strange names these
days.
(CONTINUED)
46.

OFFICER SLATER
I once arrested a man-lady who was
legally named "Pearl Necklace."
FOGELL
It's just... I changed my name. I was
going to be a singer. R&B.;
OFFICER MICHAELS
Fine. That's not illegal.
OFFICER SLATER
And, how old are you McLovin?
Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again.
FOGELL
Old enough.
OFFICER SLATER
Old enough for what?
OFFICER MICHAELS
Can I see your ID?
FOGELL
Um...okay...
Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his
pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to
Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads
of sweat are running down Fogell's face.
In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's
car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.
OFFICER SLATER
You're an organ donor?
FOGELL
What?
OFFICER SLATER
I didn't want to be one but my wife
insisted.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Just like a woman. Even after you're
dead, they want to tear your heart out.
The officers start laughing. Fogell is shocked. They hand
back the ID.

47.

CONTINUED: (2)

FOGELL
Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't
really have any information. I didn't
really see him. His fist hit here.
Fogell points at his giant black eye.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Are you in a hurry or something?
FOGELL
Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a
bus.
OFFICER SLATER
Where were you going?
FOGELL
Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.
OFFICER SLATER
We'll take you there, get your
information on the way. Sit tight.
Fogell is completely dumbfounded.
64
64
Seth and Evan sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the
front.
DRIVER
One of you bros could have sat up here
with me.
There is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to
wriggle in discomfort.
SETH
Aaah!
Seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it.
SETH(CONT'D)
875-6611?
(thinking)
Holy shit...
Seth answers the phone.
SETH (CONT'D)
Jules! What's the haps?
DRIVER
Who is it?
INTERCUT WITH:
65

There are six girls passing two beers in a circle while
dancing blissfully to crappy 80s music.
JULES
Seth! Where are you?
SETH
Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going
to the liquor store as we speak.
JULES
Awesome. I can't wait for you to get
here.
A huge smile sweeps across Seth's face.
SETH
Really?
(CONTINUED)
51.
65
CONTINUED:
65
JULES
Yeah. It looks like it could actually be
a great party. I think, like, tons of
people might show up. I hope they don't
trash my house.
SETH
Well, if they want to do that they're
going to have to get through me.
JULES
So I guess I don't have to worry then.
I'll see you soon.
Seth hangs up the phone, completely elated.
SETH
She called, man! That's insane! She's
practically begging for it. She said, "I
can't wait for you to get here."
DRIVER
That sounds like she fully wants it.
Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my
man?
Seth and Evan are very weirded out.
67
67
The boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the
huge party. It's in full swing with all sorts of random-
looking people. Nobody is under the age of 25.
EVAN
This is weird.
(CONTINUED)
52.
67
CONTINUED:

SETH
Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All
we gotta do is find the booze and haul
ass out of here.
As they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them
looks.
68
68
They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been
looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer,
coolers, wine, vodka, everything.
SETH
Holy shit! Let's grab one of these
buckets and go.
MARK (O.S.)
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
DRIVER (O.S.)
What, man? It's nothing.
The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the
Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive
brute, MARK.
MARK
You calling more of your stupid friends
again? Ya prick.
DRIVER
Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.
MARK
Get the fuck out of my house.
DRIVER
Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a
dick.
Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and
drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the
door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan.
70
70
The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide
in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.
EVAN
Dude, let's slip out the back.
SETH
Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just
hurry up and do this.
EVAN
You want to end up like that guy? Not me,
I need my nuts.
SETH
We need this liquor!
EVAN
You need it! I don't need it. I'm going
to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe
she'll get with me; not after I get her
stinking drunk.
(CONTINUED)
54.
70
CONTINUED:
70
SETH
Then why haven't you ever made a move,
you pussy?
EVAN
Because I respect her! I'm not going to
put that kind of unfair pressure on her.
SETH
These aren't girls, they're women! They
need our dicks as much as we need their
poons - and we all love liquor, so
where's the fucking beef?!
EVAN
We're leaving, okay? These guys could
kill us. You want to get killed for
liquor?
SETH
You're really gonna bail on me?!
EVAN
(rolls eyes)
Jesus...
Evan walks out the door.
SETH
Okay, okay...if that's how you're going
to be, then I'll get the booze on my own.
And you're not getting any. And neither
is Helen!
Seth storms off.
71
71
Fogell sits in the backseat. The cops are in the front. There
is silence for a few beats.
FOGELL
Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer
those, uh, questions now if you want.
OFFICER SLATER
We get the gist of it. You were buying
some beer, some guys came in and robbed
the place. I don't think we're gonna find
`em this time.
The officers start to chuckle.
(CONTINUED)
55.
71
CONTINUED:
71
FOGELL
It was only one guy.
OFFICER SLATER
Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could
never catch one guy.
OFFICER MICHAELS
You see, McLovin, if it was two guys,
we'd have twice the chance of catching
one of them. But just one guy? I mean,
how are we supposed to find one guy in
this whole city?
OFFICER SLATER
Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people
there are in this city? I have trouble
finding people I know.
FOGELL
Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or
something? Don't you have a computer?
OFFICER SLATER
Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone
walks up to me on the street, and is
like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell
am I supposed to do that?
FOGELL
Who's Bob?
OFFICER SLATER
Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then
how am I supposed to know where he is?
OFFICER MICHAELS
When you're new to the force, like I am-
OFFICER SLATER
Only six months in.
(proudly)
I got two and a half years under my belt.
OFFICER MICHAELS
You learn a lot of crazy stuff. For

Nice. Ya see, Michaels, when ever there's
a call for a bar, you take it.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Good fucking call, sir.
They chuckle.
OFFICER SLATER
Hey, McLovin. We got a situation at
Bailey's. We have to see to that, but
we'll drop you off right after. Okay?
FOGELL
Um...okay...
Michael's hits the siren and they drive off.
72
72
Seth is looking in the fridge, which is full of beer. An
ENORMOUS GUY nudges Seth aside and sticks his arm in.
ENORMOUS GUY
Hey Mark, you want another beer?
Seth quickly walks away from the fridge and goes down the
hall.
INT HOUSE PARTY - DANCING ROOM
73
73
Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices
all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then
locates a cooler full of it across the dance area.
He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot,
sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him
and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn't know how to
react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the
girl.

HOMELESS GUY screaming at a bar tender.

Fogell quickly sits at the bar by the entrance to the
kitchen.

Alright, Michaels. I've got your back.
Show this rummy how we roll.
Officer Michaels walks up to the Homeless Guy.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Excuse me! Sir!
The Homeless Guy turns and sees the cops.
HOMELESS GUY
AAAHHHHH!!!
He runs for the front door!
OFFICER MICHAELS
Resisting!
Michaels blocks the door and the Homeless Guy rams into him,
knocking him to the ground.
OFFICER SLATER
(sarcastic)
Good one, Michaels!
Slater runs at the Homeless Guy and chases him into the
dining area. The Homeless Guy knocks over a table, which
Slater trips over.
OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
Fuck!
OFFICER MICHAELS
(nervous)
Should I shoot him?!?
OFFICER SLATER
NO!!!
The Homeless Guy makes a mad dash for the kitchen, and Fogell

The kitchen staff watch in awe as the Homeless Guy wrestles
Fogell on the ground.
FOGELL
Ow!!! Please! Stop, you fucking bum!!!
The Homeless Guy gets up, grabs Fogell and HURLS him into a
rack of trays! He then turns to run, but SLIPS on a wet spot
and SLAMS his head against the ground! The cops burst into
the room to find Fogell panting on his knees with the
Homeless Guy unconscious on the floor.
OFFICER MICHAELS
McLovin! Nice!
OFFICER SLATER
I am buying you a beer, McLovin!

An R&B; slow jam plays as an exuberant Seth, a Mike's Hard
Lemonade in one hand and the Woman's ass in the other as the
dancing becomes increasingly sexual. As the song ends, the
Woman moves on.
Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard. He
grabs it and puts it in his pocket. The bulge is apparent.
Extremely pleased with himself,

Seth walks into the adjacent room. There are a bunch of GUYS
chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he
enters.
SETH
Hey, wut up?
The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him
strangely.

idiot.
SETH

I didn't spill anything on myself.
Seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to.
SETH (CONT'D)
Oh shit.
On Seth's upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size
of a palm of a hand.
SETH (CONT'D)
What the hell is this?
GUY 1
Oh my lord. You were just dancing in
there, right?
SETH
Yeah, so?
The guys all burst out laughing.

GUY 2
We should find who did it.

Guy 1 brings six more guys, including the Enormous Guy, into

Seth starts making his way out of the room.
SETH
Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up,
assholes.
Seth works his way through another room full of people,
shielding the splotch as best as he can.
PARTY DUDE

FOGELL
You've been in shoot-outs!
OFFICER MICHAELS
Nope.
OFFICER SLATER
McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless
people on the head. You're practically a

Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then,
she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling
you McLovin, stay out of bars.
FOGELL
Hey, you don't need to tell me.
OFFICER MICHAELS
So, yeah, you gotta look in different
places. The gym, an art class, you know,
shit like that.
OFFICER SLATER
I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you
believe that? I shot her in the neck, and
we just hit it off. And my first wife --
who is a whore -- where do you think we
met? A bar.
FOGELL
I don't know. I find they're always good
for a little quick ass.
The cops laugh.
OFFICER SLATER
I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do
the whole mysterious guy thing, right?
OFFICER MICHAELS
Yeah McLovin, how's it going with the
ladies?
Fogell thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable.
FOGELL
Well, officers, it's not the going with
the ladies I care about, it's the coming.

FOGELL
Can I...can I hold one? Your gun?
Michaels and Slater look to each other.
OFFICER MICHAELS
I mean, if we took the bullets out?
OFFICER SLATER
Yeah. Why not?
Slater pulls out his gun and takes out the clip.
OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
Here.
Fogell takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in
his hands, a huge smile gleaming.
FOGELL
Wow. I've never held one. Are they hard

OFFICER SLATER
If you're Michaels they are. He can't

OFFICER MICHAELS
Fuck you, old man. I could out-shoot you

Only one way to settle this.
FOGELL

Seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it's not

He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he
opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf
is completely filled with beer.
SETH

Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are
you at the party?
HELEN
No, I'm in a cab. I'll be there soon. Are
you still coming?
EVAN
Yeah, definitely. Um, about your
Goldschlager...

Evan can hear all the girls goofing around and giggling.
HELEN
(whispering to the girls)
Shut up.
EVAN
What's going on there?
HELEN
Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure
you were still coming, you know, and that
you didn't get caught up at a cocktail
party or some club.
EVAN
Nope. I'm gonna be there.
HELEN
Well, I can't wait to see you.
EVAN
I think it's going to be a real
fun...event.
HELEN
Okay. Bye.

Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he
turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES
wander into the room.
DUDE 1
They're going to kill that guy, man. That
bitch's boyfriend is so pissed.
DUDE 2
Yeah. And he's a beast.
They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of
them notices Evan standing in the corner.
DUDE 3
Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid
with the splotch on his crotch?
Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and
horrified.
EVAN
No. What splotch-

DUDE 2
I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was
at that party with me.
DUDE 4
Who's he?
DUDE 2
He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the
crazy raps, the one I told you about!
They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the
door.
EVAN
Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy,
man. Sorry.
Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door.
DUDE 3
No. No, that's you, man. You are fully
Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed
up you can't remember.
EVAN
Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't
even listen to rap.
DUDE 3
It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've
been telling these guys about you. Just
give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.
They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid.
88

Seth is finishing pouring the beer bottles into the second
detergent jug. There are about thirty empty beer bottles
laying around Seth. He tightens the cap, picks up the two
detergent jugs, and heads upstairs.

Seth emerges from the basement and heads towards the front
door.
SETH
I did it man. Peace out-tro.
He's inches away from the front door, when suddenly-

GUY 1
There! That's the guy!
Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver,
walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his
leg, too.
SETH
Hey! You got one, too! We're blood
brothers.
MARK
Shut it, you little shitter! What the
hell were you doing dancing with
Jacinda?
Horrified, Seth scrambles for excuses.
SETH
I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even
dance! Never even tried it!
MARK
(point at Seth's splotch)
Then where did that come from, asshole?
SETH
I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up
against each other at some point. How am
I supposed to know?
90

The coked-up dudes are watching Evan intensely. They are
completely loving his rapping, completely into it. Evan is
struggling.
EVAN
...cause, yo! Bitches and gats, bitches
and gats, what do all of we's got?
DUDES
Bitches and gats!
EVAN
When we steal all the money?

THE DUDES

Oh!!!
SOME GUY bursts into the room.
SOME GUY
Dudes! Looks like a fight!
Dude 3 does a line of coke and they all get up together and
charge out of the room.
91
91
There is a crowd gathered around Seth and Mark. The Enormous
Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark.
SETH
I swear to God it wasn't me!
Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the
room. Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much
commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands.
MARK
And what the fuck is this?
SETH
It's nothing. It's detergent.
MARK
Yeah. And what are you doing with it?
SETH
I...uh, I got blood on my pants.
Mark sees the bottle of MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE in Seth's pocket
and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a
look of death.
SETH (CONT'D)
I brought them from home.
Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES Seth and throws the beer
bottle at his face!!! Seth holds up a detergent jug and
deflects the beer bottle.

It flies towards Evan, who ducks, and nails Dude 1 in the
head, glass exploding everywhere!!!
DUDE 1
AAAHHHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!
Dude 1 clutches his bloody head as the other Dudes charge at
Mark! A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting!
Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him
into Evan.
DUDE 3
Hold him!
EVAN
What?
DUDE 2
HOLD HIM!!!
Evan reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes
pound on him.
ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner
Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly
Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and
faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA.
JACINDA
You motherfucker!
She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth.
She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!
SETH
AHH!!!
JACINDA
You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated
me!!!
SETH
You're the one who used my leg as a
tampon!
She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around
the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles.
Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan
backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party.

As Seth and Evan run up the block together, Jacinda talks
into her cell phone.
JACINDA

Michaels kicks it into drive and they peel out. Fogell shoves
the unconscious Homeless Guy over.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Hah, hah! Eat it. So, dudes, what do we
do now?
Suddenly, the car radio goes off.
RADIO
We got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview, all
units in the area report to Fifth and
Paysview. Car 98. That's you. Do it.
Seriously.
The cops stop and listen.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Son-of-a-bitch.

Car 98, ten-four.

Ya dumb whore. Ha!
FOGELL
What does that mean? We gonna get to

OFFICER SLATER
I wish. Probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?
FOGELL
Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how
we roll.
96

Michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with
his fist.
OFFICER MICHAELS
How do they expect us to work these
things while we're driving? I can't even
work my iMac while I'm sitting at my
desk.
FOGELL
So, like, what does that computer do?
OFFICER SLATER
Pretty much anything, if you're smart
enough to figure it out. Like, who do you
really hate? Gimme a name.
FOGELL
Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham.
Susette Graham.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Can I do it?
Slater nods. Michaels bring her file up, then punches a few
buttons and smiles.
FOGELL
What did you do?
OFFICER MICHAELS
Tomorrow, Mrs. Graham will have a boot on
her car.
Fogell laughs his ass off.
FOGELL
I hate my dad, too!

OFFICER MICHAELS
Okay. The place should be around here
somewhere. McLovin, are the numbers on
that side odd or even?
FOGELL
It's too dark out.
OFFICER SLATER
We got flashlights.
Slater gets his flashlight and points it out the window.
OFFICER MICHAELS
I wasn't even sure light came out of
those things. I thought they were just
cool looking clubs.
Michaels and Slater start making light saber noises and
pretend to fight with their flashlights.

Slater turns and points his flashlight out Michaels window,
accidentally shining the light into his eyes.
OFFICER MICHAELS
My eyes!
He jerks the wheel.

Everyone in the car is looking forward, stunned. They can't

OFFICER SLATER
Okay, okay, we're gonna get out of the
car now. McLovin, you stay right there.
OFFICER MICHAELS
That guy better not be dead.

Fogell anxiously sits in the cop car. He can't see what's
going on through the shattered windshield.
104
104
Officer Michaels is sitting in the driver's seat.
FOGELL
Was the guy alright?
OFFICER MICHAELS
What? Oh, yeah, the guy was fine.
Michaels looks back at the Homeless Guy, who looks a little
bit more awake than before.
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)
Are you awake, sir?
The guy starts to open his eyes a little. Michaels grabs the
guy's face and slams it back, knocking him out again. Fogell
jumps a little.
OFFICER MICHEALS
I'm sorry, McLovin. But I really need
this to be a private thing.
Officer Michaels takes out two cigarettes, and gives one to
Fogell, who accepts, quivering in fear. Michaels lights his,
then passes the lighter to Fogell.

OFFICER MICHEALS (CONT'D)
Listen McLovin, you... like... Officer
Slater and myself, don't you?
Fogell tries to light his cigarette. It takes a few tries and
he starts hacking after the first pull.
FOGELL
(coughing)
Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Yeah, well, we're also on probation. You
see, we've actually trashed two other
cars. The first time wasn't our fault,
and the second time a bee flew in and I
freaked out. Point is, we trash another
car, without a good reason, we're fucked.
Know what I'm saying?
Fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette.
FOGELL
Sure.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Now, we're going to arrest these guys,
and if you don't mind, which you
shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake
witness report saying they jumped out in
front of our car. Cool, McLovin?
Fogell nods his head, getting some of his cigarette smoke in
his eyes. He winces and starts to blink in discomfort.
106
106
They can't see out of the shattered windshield.
OFFICER SLATER
Fuck!
114

Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll
box, then walk towards the back of the bus.
HOMELESS GUY (O.S.)
Hey! It's you!
Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards
them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle.
The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze.
HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D)
You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme
some?
SETH
No! Fuck off! You already drank our
detergent beer!
HOMELESS GUY
That was beer?!
(to Fogell)
Well, you little shit...ain't got no cop
people to help you keep your
booze...gimme it...
The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. Seth steps in
front of him.
SETH
Back off, or we'll kick the shit out of
you!
EVAN
We can't do that. He's homeless.

SETH
So? Who cares? Just because he doesn't
have a home doesn't mean he can be a
lunatic!
HOMELESS GUY
Give me the booze!
The guy shoves Seth aside and dives at Fogell.
WE GO INTO VERY SLOW MOTION:
- Helen's bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag.
It VERY SLOWLY falls towards the ground.
- Seth reaches for it, but doesn't quite grab it.
- WE LOUDLY HEAR the bottle as it slams against the bus
floor...but doesn't break! It slowly rises back up into the
air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus.
- Evan LEAPS through the air, sailing towards the precious
Goldschlager with his arms extended.
EVAN
(in slo-mo voice)
GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
- He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly
smashes into a pole, SHATTERING, sending little gold flakes
everywhere.
BACK TO NORMAL.
The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes.
HOMELESS GUY
Shit!!! Gold!!!
He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Evan stares at
the remains, shocked. Fogell walks over.
FOGELL
What the hell is going on? Where did you
come from?
BUS DRIVER
(calling from front)
Get the fuck off the bus or I'm calling
the cops!!!
The boys look at each other terrified, and get off the bus.

The party is in full swing. There is loud music blaring and
nearly a hundred people talking, dancing, and smoking.
JULES

Everyone turns around and sees the Seth holding all the
liquor.

table; it is an impressive array of inebriates.
SETH
The bar is open!
EVERYONE
(ecstatically cheering)
Yeah Seth!/Clutch!/Nice!/I can't believe
it!/Seth did that?!/ Who the fuck is
Seth?
In the background, we see Evan and Fogell wander into the
party as Jules approaches Seth.
JULES
This is awesome. Thank you so much.
SETH
Sorry it was late.
JULES
Yeah. To be honest, people were starting
to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I've
got to go tell everyone the drinks are
here. Don't go anywhere. Promise?
SETH
I'll be right here.
Jules walks off.
- MOMENTS LATER
119

Tons of kids pour themselves drinks. Seth and about six other
kids all have overflowing shots of Jaeger.
SETH
To Jules!
Everyone drinks and recoils from the taste. A random guy
refills everyone's shot glasses.

Seth)

Everyone laughs as Seth, very pleased with himself, starts
refilling shot glasses.

Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of
Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself
in the mirror, seeming as though he's on the verge of a full-
on panic attack.
EVAN
(panting)
Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants
to suck on your penis. That's a good
thing.
He opens the Ouzo and smells it, recoiling in disgust.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Down the hatch.
Evan takes a mighty swig, then gags and spits it out,
spraying it everywhere.
122

Fogell sits bored in front of the TV, drinking a beer. He
watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. Everyone is
talking and laughing while he sits alone.
He walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls
dancing. In the corner dancing is Nicola. He stares at her
for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the TV.

He changes the channel and "COPS" comes on the screen. It
shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee
dropping him. Fogell ponders as he watches "COPS." He throws
back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is
dancing in.
He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in
the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown
at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.
FOGELL
They call you Nicola, right?
NICOLA
And they call you Fogell.
FOGELL
Some do.
They continue dancing.
I/E. JULE'S KITCHEN/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
MONTAGE INTERCUTTING SETH AND EVAN DRINKING:
123
123
- Seth taking shot after shot in the kitchen with everyone
else, glancing over at Jules every now and then as she walks
around the party, sending more people to drink with him.
124
124
- Evan in the bathroom, forcing himself to brutally suck back
a disgusting amount of Ouzo. He sips from his beer, takes a
deep breath, and then starts again.
125
125
- Seth dances jokingly with a few people and tells the story
of that evening, showing them the detergent jug full of beer
and acting out the car hitting him.
126
126
- Evan, who has drank about half the bottle and is pretty
drunk, stands up, arms reached out, and tries to walk in a
straight line. He does it fairly well. Frustrated, he sits
back down and takes another disgusting swig of Ouzo.
91.
127
127
- Jules throws Seth a smile when she sees him making everyone
laugh as he re-fills their cups with very foamy, slightly
blue-tinted beer from the detergent jug.
129
129
- Evan can't keep his balance as he tries to touch his nose
while standing on one foot. He's drunk. He drinks from the
tap thirstily, eats some toothpaste, fixes his collar and
hair, and then gathers his courage, takes a deep breath, and
steps out of the bathroom.
130
130
Nicola and Fogell are standing in the corner of the room.
Nicola is looking at Fogell's ID.
NICOLA
McLovin! That's the funniest thing I've
ever seen!
FOGELL
Yeah, I just thought it sounded old.
They both laugh and their eyes meet.
131

The party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and
drunk. Jules walks up to Seth, who is clearly piss drunk.
JULES
Hey, I'm back. I had to thank the peeps
for comin' out.
SETH
(really, really, drunk)
Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The
woman of the hour!
Seth takes a swig of a beer.
SETH (CONT'D)
This party's blowin' my ass off! I want
you to have a drink with me.
Seth offers her a beer.
JULES
No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously,
thanks for getting all the drinks. It
really made the night.
SETH
It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems,
no problems.
Jules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working.

SETH (CONT'D)
Uh...you know...I love talking, and
conversing with you, you're so good at
it, but I can't hear you. Could we just
go on the...uh...balcony or something?
Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling
drunkenly.
JULES
Why not? I haven't conversed in ages.
Let's do it.
Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and
then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and
after Jules.
132
132
Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several
times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down
the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice
kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue.
After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the
remarkably drunk Helen.
EVAN
Are you okay?
HELEN
I so flirt with you in Math.
EVAN
Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I
mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long
time-
HELEN
I know. I've wanted to get with you so
hard.
Helen kisses him.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Like...so hard.
Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him
again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off
Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons.
Evan yanks it off.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Good...

Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks
like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and
sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model.
Evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her
shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual.
As Evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of
tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and
concentrates on untying her shoes.
HELEN (CONT'D)
What the fuck...stupid shoe...
Evan moves over to help her. He can't do it either.
EVAN
Shit. Can you, like, slip out?
Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. She grabs
a pair of scissors off a desk.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.
She snips off the knot and slips her shoe off.
HELEN
You...take off your pants...
(drunkenly waving the scissors)
Or I'll cut `em off.
Helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing
Evan. He starts taking off his pants.
133

Nicola leads Fogell up the stairs.
NICOLA
I can't believe I'm about to get with
"Fogell".
FOGELL
Why?
NICOLA
I don't know. You're like, the most

knows anything about you.
FOGELL
Well, you're about to learn a few things.

Evan sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just
getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie.
Evan's eyes widen. She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in
a very un-sexy way.
HELEN
I wore this for you. Here we go...
Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts
seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than
ever.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Evan, I'm so wet.
EVAN
(still nervous)
You're so beautiful.
Helen shoves her hand down Evan's boxers. Evan jolts,
terrified!
HELEN
You've got such a smooth cock.
EVAN
Um...thank you. I've thought you were a
really incredible person for a really
long time.
Evan looks really nervous as Helen's hand starts moving up
and down.
HELEN
You've got to get hard for me...real
hard.
EVAN
I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just
want to tell you exactly how I-
HELEN
I'm gonna suck your dick so good.
Evan is taken aback.

I need you to eat my hairy love crack.
EVAN

Evan sits up.
HELEN
What's wrong?
Beat.
EVAN
You don't want to do this.
HELEN
Yeah I do, I want to fuck you.
EVAN
Look, you know I really like you, Helen,
but this is...it's just too intense. And
I'm so drunk I don't even know how to,
like, process-
HELEN
You're just being a pussy.
EVAN
What? Did you just call me a...pussy?
HELEN
Yeah...a scared little pussy-
PUKE! Evan watches in horror as Helen vomits all over Jules'
bed.
EVAN
Oh god! Oh...

Fogell is laying on his back on the bed and Nicola is
straddling him. They are kissing. Nicola sits up and takes
Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers.
FOGELL
I've got a boner.
NICOLA
Good. Do you have a condom?
He pulls a condom out.
FOGELL
And lube.
He pulls out a little bottle of lube.

Evan, sitting on the couch next to Miroki (Evan's partner
from cooking class), drinking a bottle of tequila. He's
absolutely smashed.
EVAN

Suddenly, Seth bursts into the room and grabs Evan's shirt.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Fuckin' wax off, asshole!
SETH
No...I'm helping you, man! Just listen...
Seth grabs Evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet.
EVAN
Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my
shoulders!
Just then, Terry (the guy who spat on Seth in the beginning)
walks by.
TERRY
Hey! Look, it's Christina and Britney.
Have fun boning each other on grad night!
Terry and his buddies laugh their asses off when, suddenly-

Officer Slater and Officer Michaels! They talk to whoever
answered the door, oblivious of Evan and Seth.
OFFICER SLATER
We had a complaint about the noise. It
looks like you're having a nice little
party here.
OFFICER MICHAELS
A nice little underage drinking party.
Evan points at the cops.
EVAN
Dude! Seth! It's the cops! The cops.
SETH
That's what I've been...! Here...
Seth pulls Evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out
of the living room just as the cops step into it.
OFFICER SLATER
Okay, everyone out. Party's over. Get out
of here.
Michaels turns to Slater.
OFFICER SLATER(CONT'D)
I'll go upstairs. I told you this would

Fogell wears the greatest look of accomplishment one could
possibly imagine.
SUDDENLY, Officer Michaels bursts into the room and flicks on
the lights.
FOGELL (CONT'D)
What the hell?
Nicola screams, grabs her clothes, and runs into the
bathroom.
OFFICER SLATER
McLovin? What the fuck?
FOGELL
Officer Slater?
OFFICER SLATER
You ran away from us!
(turns to the door)
Michaels! Get up here!
FOGELL
No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was
all disoriented and I just wandered off,
confused. Seriously!
OFFICER MICHAELS
Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old
was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard,
that's statutory rape, McLovin.
Officer Slater appears in the doorway.
OFFICER SLATER
McLovin!
OFFICER MICHAELS
He was violating a sixteen year-old girl!
FOGELL
What? No! No!
Fogell covers himself with the blanket and starts to get up.

FOGELL (CONT'D)
I didn't break the law! I'm not really
even-
OFFICER MICHAELS
Sit your ass down and keep it down.
OFFICER SLATER
You're going to jail, fucko.
Nicola, now dressed, emerges from the bathroom. She screams
and runs out. They take Fogell's arms and handcuff him.
OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
(to Fogell)
They don't take kindly to your type in
jail, McLovin.

The cops both get in and slam their doors. They just stare
forward.
FOGELL
So...am I going to jail?
The two cops burst out laughing hysterically.
OFFICER SLATER
(laughing his ass off)
Yeah!! You're going to fuckin' Azkaban!!!
FOGELL
What?
OFFICER MICHAELS
You are the funniest fuckin' kid I have
ever met!
OFFICER SLATER
We've been fuckin' with you! Jesus! I
love this kid!
FOGELL
I don't understand!
OFFICER SLATER
We know you're not twenty five! What are
we, morons? My god! What are you?
Sixteen?
FOGELL
Seventeen.

Seth and Evan are lying in sleeping bags beside one another.
The now empty bottle of Tequila lies between them. They are
laughing very hard, still drunk off their asses.
SETH
I can't believe she said that shit.
EVAN
Oh my lord. You have no idea!
(CONTINUED)
108.

CONTINUED:

They laugh harder.
EVAN (CONT'D)
And then you saved me, man! I fucking
love you!
SETH
I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not
embarrassed, I just love you!
EVAN
Why don't we say that more? It feels
good! I love you more than my brother,
man. Like, when you went away for Easter
last year, I, like, missed you. You know?
SETH
I missed you, too. Come here, man.
Seth grabs Evan and they hug.
SETH (CONT'D)
We'll always be friends. `Cause we love
each other.
They stop hugging and sit back down. They're laughter slows
down and there is a moment of silence.
SETH (CONT'D)
Like, three weeks ago I was in you room
and, like, you were taking a dump and...I
saw your residence placement thingy. I
totally saw you're living with Fogell.
So, like-
EVAN
I'm sorry, man.
SETH
Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was
being a bitch.
EVAN
I need you to know that it's not like I
even want to live with Fogell; it's just
that I'm really afraid of living with
strangers.
There is a moment of silence.

SETH
You know...I was pissed off I didn't get
with Jules, but, like...we really got
through a lot of our shit, you know?
EVAN
Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we
kind of came together, again.
Beat.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Good night, Seth. I love you.
SETH
Night, Evan. Love you, man.

Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking.
They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though
they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.
EVAN
Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
SETH
Uh...morning.
They stare at each other, uncomfortable.
EVAN
You sleep good?
SETH
Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
EVAN
Um...
Seth looks at his watch.
SETH
Maybe I should get going.
EVAN
You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing
anything.
Beat.

SETH
Oh...do you want to hang out? I
was...gonna go to the mall, actually.
EVAN
Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a
comforter. For college.
SETH
Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like
that.

Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store.
Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are
way too small.
EVAN
Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your
pants look good.
SETH
Well, I need someone's opinion.
EVAN
Fine. They're way too small.
SETH
Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's
pants last night I realized that if I buy
pants that are too small it'll encourage
me to lose weight. And in tight pants
chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.
EVAN
Yeah, the male camel toe look is really
big this year.
Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the
pants. He walks out.
SETH
These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck
out of here.

They walk through the department store, when suddenly, Evan
sees Helen and Jules looking at comforters.
ANGLE ON: Helen and Jules

HELEN
Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I
actually did that.
JULES
I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a
new one.
HELEN
I have to. It's puke.
ANGLE ON: Seth and Evan
EVAN
Holy shit!
Helen looks like hell and Jules has a horrible black eye.
SETH
Is that them?
They stare at the two girls from afar.
EVAN
Should we hide?
Helen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out
to Jules. Seth and Evan wave back. The girls get up and start
to walk over.
SETH
(pretending to smile)
Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look
what I did to her!
EVAN
(pretending to smile)
Helen called me a pussy to my face! What
am I going to say to her?
The girls walk up to them.
HELEN
JULES
Hi Evan, Seth.
Hey guys.
EVAN
SETH
Hi Helen, Hi Jules.
Jules. Helen. Hi.
Everyone looks very embarrassed.
SETH
Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Jules.

JULES
It's okay.
EVAN
(to Helen)
How are you feeling?
HELEN
Not bad, but not great, how about you?
SETH
(to Jules)
That looks terrible. No! I mean, it
doesn't look terrible, it looks-
JULES
Don't worry about it, Seth. It was an
accident.
EVAN
(to Helen)
Did you have fun last night?
JULES
(to Seth)
Do you remember much?
HELEN
(to Evan)
I really don't remember much.
SETH
(to Jules)
Not really. I remember looking up, and
you screaming at me. That's about it.
Jules laughs.
HELEN
(to Evan)
I didn't puke on you, did I?
Evan laughs.
EVAN
No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.
SETH
(to Jules)
But seriously, I acted like a fuckin'
idiot last night. I'm really sorry, you
didn't deserve that.

HELEN
(to Evan)
Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that.
Thanks for being such a gentleman.
There is a moment of silence.
SETH
You look good with a black eye.
They all chuckle a little.
JULES
Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I
have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of
cover-up for the grad photo.
SETH
(mortified)
Oh man...
HELEN
Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to
buy Jules a new comforter.
EVAN
Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for
college.
JULES
(flirtatiously, joking)
So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and
buy me my cover-up, or what?
SETH
Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such
bad acne last year, I became an expert on
the stuff.
EVAN
You could get your college pants there.
SETH
Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan
drove me here, how do we-
JULES
I've got my dad's car. I'll take you
home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.
HELEN
That sounds good.

EVAN
Maybe we can go eat after?
HELEN
Sweet.
Seth and Evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their
faces. They didn't blow it.
SETH
So, uh, I'll call you later.
EVAN
Yeah man, have a good one.
JULES
Come on, Seth. Let's go.
Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the
opposite direction.
As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back
and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.
A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as
though they're never going to see each other again.

As Jules and Seth walk into Macy's and Helen and Evan descend
an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome
crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...
