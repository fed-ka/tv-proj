          Flashing patrol cars and unmarked units litter the parking
          lot.  Uniformed and plain clothed police officers sweep
          the area with flashlights.  Walt is running on pure
          adrenaline as he barks orders into his shoulder radio.

                                        WALT
                        We're looking for a silver 2004
                        Jeep Liberty.  Plate number Romeo-
                          4-Hotel-832.

          We HEAR the STATIC VOICE respond as Roscoe approaches...

                                        ROSCOE
                        We contacted the local gas stations
                        and triple-A office.  Nothing
                        yet.

          Walt seems lost for a second, then...

                                        WALT
                        Check the Interstate toll booths. 
                        And move those cars out of the
                        lot.  I want a forensic's team in
                        here ASAP.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Got it.

          Roscoe takes off, as Walt notices Johnny checking out the
          bleachers.


88THE BLEACHERS

          Johnny 'feels' around.  Walt steps up.

                                        WALT
                        Have you 'seen' anything?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

          Walt takes a breath, then,

                                        WALT
                        I can't stop thinkin' about what
                        you saw.  I mean, maybe she's
                        already...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, don't do this.  They're
                        going to be fine.

                                        WALT
                        You saw my wife handcuffed to a
                        bed.  Exactly what part of that
                        is going to turn out 'fine'?

          Johnny can see that Walt's years as a police officer are
          playing with his head.  The terrible things he's seen
          over the years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to stay focused.  What
                        would Sarah say if she was here?

                                        WALT
                                (beat)
                        She'd say have faith and do the
                        best you can.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like good advice to me.

          Johnny grabs ahold of the railing, Whoosh!



          Night becomes day.  The stands are now peppered with a
          few scattered parents and kids watching the game.  Observer
          Johnny looks out onto the field.

          JJ is up to bat.  And WHACK.  A line drive and takes off
          running.  Sarah stands, excited.

                                        SARAH
                        Run, JJ, run!

          She's so excited she doesn't notice someone's HAND reach
          up from beneath the bleachers, into her purse and steal
          her cell phone.  Observer Johnny steps quickly to the top
          step and watches as the THIEF, wearing a hooded raincoat,
          hurries across the parking lot.

          Johnny jumps down and CHASES the guy.  But when Johnny
          rushes around the side of the building, he SEES NOTHING! 
          The Thief has VANISHED.



          Johnny walks with Walt, as he tells him what he saw.

                        He stole Sarah's cell phone and
                        took off.

                                        WALT
                        Did you see his face?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was wearing a hood.

                                        WALT
                        Maybe if you try again.

          Johnny tries touching the bleachers again, but gets
          nothing.  He looks at Walt and shakes his head.

                                        WALT
                          Something isn't right about this. 
                        It feels like Sarah was the target
                        from the beginning.

          Johnny doesn't say anything, but he has the same gnawing
          feeling in his gut.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Any luck finding the Jeep?

                                        WALT
                        No.  It's like they vanished off
                        the face of the earth.  I'm gonna
                        back-track some of the side roads.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Want some company?

                        Yeah, I would.

          They both head off towards Walt's car.



          A dark, lonely stretch of road.  Walt drives, Johnny rides.   

                                        WALT
                        Let's go over it again.  You saw
                        a man sitting in a chair, and
                        then you saw Sarah in the bedroom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.

          REVEAL - SARAH'S SILVER JEEP LIBERTY

          Parked awkwardly off the shoulder of the road.



          Walt pulls the patrol car up behind it.  They quickly get
          out of the car and approach the Jeep, Walt draws his gun. 
            Passenger door is open.

          Johnny touches the fluid.  Rubs it between his fingers. 
          Smells it.

                        It's radiator fluid.

          Walt breaths a sigh of relief.  Johnny uses a handkerchief
          to open the hood.  He shines the light into the engine.

                        it was the same guy from the park?

          Johnny hesitates, as Walt SLAMS the hood closed.

                                        WALT
                                  (frustrated)
                        You're always there when people
                        need you, John.  It's an amazing
                        thing to watch.  But now it's
                        Sarah and JJ. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to find them as much as
                        you do.

                        But I can't control my visions. 
                        You know that.

          Walt considers the comment, then heads back to the patrol
          car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What now?

                                        WALT
                        Now we call in the big dogs.



          A gas station off the highway.

          Walt's patrol car SKIDS to a stop.  A STATE POLICE OFFICER
          is standing with JJ, who has a blanket wrapped around his
          shoulders.  Walt and Johnny both get out of the car. 
          Agent Gribbins behind them.



          Observer Johnny is already there as Linda guides The
          Collector, now badly injured and SCREAMING IN PAIN, out
          of the building and into the back of a black Ford Bronco.

          She slams the side door shut and hurries around and gets
          in the driver's seat.  Johnny takes notice of the license
          plate number as the van tears away, just as the building
          is rocked behind them by huge explosions.

          He gets a partial number "WR4 -" as everything ghosts
          away and the visions end...



          Johnny spins out of he vision.  He's now outside of the
          building with Walt.

                        They drove away in a black SUV. 
                        I saw part of the license plate
                        number - "W-R-4".

                                        WALT
                        Good.  Let's see if we can find
                        the bastard.



          Johnny and Walt exit double-doors.  Frustrated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't get it.  There's no way
                        anyone could have survived that
                        kind of trauma without medical
                        attention.

                                        WALT
                          According to them there hasn't
                        been a major burn victim admitted
                        here in over a year. 

          Walt violently kicks a metal trash container.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Feel better now?

                                        WALT
                        No.  Yes.  Maybe.

          They share the absurdity of the moment, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a thought)
                        If the guy was hurt and Linda
                        didn't take him to a hospital,
                        that means she must have taken
                        care of him herself.

                                        WALT
                        And?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She'd need medical supplies.

                        I've been spending too much time

          They get in the car and drive away.

                        It's against the law for me to
                        sell to the public.



          Johnny and Walt head for the car.

                        They use it to connect skin tissue

          Night has fallen.  A row of cabins.

          Walt and Johnny speak with the MANAGER, a woodsy type.

                                        MANAGER
                        Don't recall a couple checkin'

                        There was a blonde rented the
                          lakeside cabin.  But she was alone.

                        Cabin five on the far side of the

                        on account her dog likes to howl
                        at night.

                        Her dog, huh?



          A small log cabin surrounded by dark woods.  Johnny and
          Walt cautiously check the perimeter.  They move to a side
          window and peer in through the slightly parted curtains. 


          THEIR POV INTO CABIN'S MAIN ROOM

          Also dark.  What appears to be a MAN sits in a chair,
          watching TV, his back to them.  It's the same exact scene
          Johnny saw in the Teaser vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (whispers)

                                (intense)
                        That means Sarah's in there, too.

          Walt pulls his revolver and checks the cylinder.

                        Maybe we should get some help?

                        This is all the help we need.

          Walt removes a smaller gun from his ankle holster.

                        Take this.

                        Why?

                                        WALT
                        You know what this guy's capable
                        of. 
                                (pointed)
                        Sarah's in there for Chrissake.

          Johnny reluctantly takes the gun.

                        Let's go.

          Walt slowly puts his hand on the doorknob, gun at the
          ready.  Opens.  And they ease inside...



          Johnny's Range Rover pulls off the road at the spot where
          Sarah's Jeep was found.  He opens the door and gets out,
          leaving his headlights as the only source of light.  He
          walks forward and finally notices --

          A SMALL BOX sitting on the ground.  He looks around into
          the darkness, then picks it up and opens it.  He lifts
          out a small, micro-cassette TAPE RECORDER.  He doesn't
          get a vision, so he hits, PLAY.

                                        LINDA'S VOICE
                        If you're hearing my voice, that
                        means you've been smart enough to
                        follow my instructions.  Good for
                        you, better for Sarah.  She's
                          suffered no permanent injury. 
                        How long she remains unharmed is
                          entirely up to you.  You need to
                        know that I am watching you at
                        this very moment, and I'm not
                        alone in case you decide to play
                        hero.

          Johnny looks around into the darkness, it's impossible to
          know if she's lying or telling the truth.

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        I've had many months to reflect*
                        on our brief, but eventful
                          association and it occurred to me
                        what a truly special individual
                        you are.  It also occurred to me
                        that you are a fraud of monumental
                          proportions, operating in the
                          knowledge that you inhabit only
                        as an observer, a voyeur free
                        from consequence.

          We CAMERA SPINS SLOWLY around Johnny as he listens...

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        That's why I've decided to strip
                        away your safety net.  Not only
                        do I want you to know what happened
                        to Sarah, I want you to experience
                        it.

                                        LINDA (V.O.)
                        There is only one thing you can
                        be certain of, and that's if you
                        don't do exactly what I say, you'll
                        never see or hear from either one
                        of us again.  
                                (beat)
                        Take the box and the recorder and
                        get back into the car.  Sit in
                        the passenger seat.  You can push
                        pause until you're ready to
                          continue.

          Johnny hits PAUSE, as he notices his hand has a slight
          tremble.



          One bloodied hand appears, then Johnny's body rolls out
          on to the ground.  He stares up towards the sky, exhausted
          and breathless.

          JOHNNY'S POV - THROUGH TREE BRANCHES

          The first rays of morning sunlight filter through the
          tree tops.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          It's good to be alive, but then his mind races back to...

                                        LINDA'S VOICE
                        Now you and I share the pain of
                        losing our one true love.  A pain
                        that can only be healed by death. 
                        By the time you hear this message,
                        I'll be one step closer mine.

          He has a moment of clarity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.

          He checks his watch, scrambles to his feet and starts to
          run towards the road.



          Johnny half jogs up the isolated logging road.  In the
            distance, he sees a SEMI-TRUCK APPROACHING.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank God.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heart of Darkness" - ACT FOUR - 8/1/05 - BLUE   47.

          He steps into the center of the road, waves his arms as
          the truck approaches...



          Johnny, Walt and Agent Gribbins come running out of the
          front door into the street.  Johnny looks in both
          directions, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This way!

          They ALL take-off up the street.


  5858SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

          They run to the end of the side-street and stop, a battered
          pick-up truck with a battered camper shell sits parked by
          itself.

          PICK-UP TRUCK

          Johnny checks the cab, but it's empty.

                                        WALT
                        John, what is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.

          Johnny tries to open the back door of the camper, but
          it's locked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We have to get this open.

          Walt rips off his jacket, wraps it around his fist and
          SMASHES OPEN the small window in the door, then he reaches
          his arm inside and unlocks it.
