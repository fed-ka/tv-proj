                                      COLD OPEN

      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY11

      The City. Hometown to Maupin, Jerry Garcia and the Zodiac 
      Killer.  Fading light paints the usual landmarks: Golden 
      Gate, Coit Tower, the TransAmerica Building.  

        CONSTRUCTION CRANES dot the skyline. Even in tough times, 
      progress continues. People work. People love. People die.

        A HALF-COMPLETED SKYSCRAPER comes into view. We move onto its 
      top floor.

      EXT. TOP FLOOR - INCOMPLETE SKYSCRAPER - DAY22

      The city sprawls behind the open space filled with rebar.  
      WORKERS pack tools. One grabs a beer from his cooler.  
      Everyone heads to the CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR. 

                                  WORKER #1
                    Sorley s, man.  

                                  WORKER #2
                    No, chicks are awful there.  
                      Houlihan s.

                                  WORKER #1
                    Lookit you.  If the choice is 
                    between women and cheap beer.  Take 
                    the beer..

      Older workers chuckle. One of them, WALKER, hangs back.

                                  WORKER #1 (CONT D)
                    You coming?

                                  WALKER
                      Transformer 2 s sucking juice.  I m 
                    gonna shut it down and take a look.

      WORKER #2 tosses Walker a beer. The steel cage closes. The 
      elevator heads down. Cracking the brew, Walker looks out over 
      the city until the whirring of the elevator stops.

      Walker SHUTS DOWN the main POWER SWITCH. Popping iPod 
      headphones in his ears, Walker heads off, sipping his beer.  
      MUSIC sounds out, loud and strong.

      TWO TRANSFORMER boxes sit dormant in a rats  nest of cords 
      and wires. Setting his beer on the top, Walker gets to work 
      checking each connection.

      It s tedious going. Thank God for the iPod.

      At the other end of the job site, a PORTA POTTIE opens.  
      FITCH, a younger worker, heads out. The site s barren.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)         TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 2

        CONTINUED:22

      At the TRANSFORMER, Walker s found the problem. Quick, he s 
      into the guts of a transformer lead. The music cranks.

      Fitch gets to the elevator, pushes the call button. Nothing.  
      He tries again. Checking around, he sees the MAIN POWER 
      switch thrown to  OFF. 

                                  FITCH
                    Hey!!!  Anyone up here? 

      Oblivious, music cranking, Walker repairs the lead.  His 
      pliers twist exposed cables. The voltage meter reads  0. 

      Light fading, Fitch throws the POWER SWITCH to  ON. 

      CLOSE UP: VOLTAGE METER

      The needle JUMPS past 30,000, frying the meter.

      WALKER takes 30,000 volts through his body. His hair melts, 
      the hand gripping the pliers chars. His body goes rigid. The 
      beer topples from the transformer, boiling at his feet.  

      Across the job site, lights flicker. The elevator goes dead.  
      Fitch sees sparks, hears horrible sounds in the distance.  

                                  FITCH (CONT D)
                    Oh no...

      Leaving the switch  ON,  he runs off in the direction of the 
        Transformer.  Walker twitches in a pool of beer. His breath 
      catches in rasps, then STOPS.

                                  FITCH (CONT D)
                    Oh God, Walker. Oh God...

      CLOSE UP: FITCH S HAND

      Pulling his phone, he dials  911. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER - DAY33

      Banks of OPERATORS man phones and screens. The WORDS:  
       FITCH, THOMAS A. CELLULAR 415-555-6655  hit a touch screen.

                                  OPERATOR
                    911.  What is your emergency?

      INTERCUT:  INCOMPLETE SKYSCRAPER

      Freaking out, Fitch just avoids stepping in the beer.

                                  FITCH
                    It s Walker... He s been 
                      electrocuted.  He s not breathing.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)         TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 3

                                  FITCH
                    1012 Montgomery. It s a 
                      construction site. Top Floor...

      Back at Emergency Response, the operator s already routing 
      the call. Her touchscreen reads:  SFFD, PARA. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT./INT. SFFD PARAMEDIC VAN - MARKET STREET - DAY44

      At the wheel, TYLER (30s) - slight build, nutty eyes - hits 
      the lights and nails it.  Next to him, CAMERON BOONE (30s) - 
      drinks all the information from a SCREEN in front of him. He 
      touches a headset at his ear.

                                  BOONE
                    Patch me in...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TRAUMA CENTER - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - DAY55

      Pain, healing and chaos swirl around the curtained Trauma 
      rooms and offices.  Walking through it all, the maestro, DR. 
      JOSEPH SAVIANO (50s) sees everything, remembers everything 
      and appears to be affected by nothing.

      A team of TRAUMA DOCS and INTERNS trails Dr. Joe.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Cardiac arrest, burns, brain 
                    damage, organ failure. Full meal 
                    deal of electrocution.  Incoming 
                    within ten minutes...

      Dr. Joe opens the curtains of TRAUMA 3, surprising an Intern 
      and a heavily BANDAGED MAN. 

                                  DR. JOE (CONT D)
                    He stable?

      The Intern nods.

                                  DR. JOE (CONT D)
                    Move him.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      In the back, on a gurney NANCY MONAHAN (32) - intense, just 
      enough damage to make her interesting - straddles TERRY 
      BANNER (36) - handsome, witty and serious in equal measure.  
      To say the radio interrupts is a huge understatement.

                                  NANCY
                    Wait... Not now.

      Terry scrambles out from under her.  

                                  TERRY
                    It s a call...

      He grabs the radio.

                                  TERRY (CONT D)
                    Unit 114, we re here.  We got the 
                    call.  En route.  1012 Montgomery.

      Pulling up his pants, Terry slides into the driver s seat.  

                                  RADIO
                    Copy that Banner.  Oh hey... Tell 
                    Naughty Nancy to check her buttons.

      Terry doesn t like that too much. Nancy checks her uniform.  
      Yep, the top button on her blouse reveals a little too much.  
      She takes care of it.

                                  TERRY
                    I told you...  Not in the van.

      Climbing into the passenger seat, Nancy musses his hair.

                                  NANCY
                    Yes, in the van. I mean come on,  I 
                    get the residency, no more fun on

      A TV screen reads SONG FAILED on Guitar Hero as ASHER  ROTOR  
      REYNOLDS (30s) tosses down the controller. He grabs a FLIGHT 
      HELMET and HEADPHONES and heads upstairs.

      EXT. ROOF - ANGEL S FLIGHT EMT SERVICES - DAY99

      Rotor bolts out on the roof, sees a FIGURE standing on the 
      ledge.  REUBEN  RABBIT  PALCHUCK (36), somewhere between 
      genius and madness. Smiling serenely, toes 12 stories over 
      the street, Rabbit looks over the city, his city.

                    My favorite kind.

      WALKER s turning grey. FITCH listens to a DEEP REASSURING

      Insanity at Code 3 as Tyler weaves through traffic. Boone 
      barely notices, focused on the call.

                    Stay the hell away from it.  Find 
                    the power switch and shut it down.

      INTERCUT: INCOMPLETE SKYSCRAPER

      Casting glances back to Walker, Fitch pulls the power switch.

                                  FITCH
                    Did it. Power s off.

                    Good job.  Now Tom, I want you to 
                    start CPR.

      INT/EXT. EMT HELICOPTER - DAY1212

      Blades spin, the pristine copter powers up. In the cockpit, 
      Rotor checks the gauges  In the back, Rabbit battens down 
      equipment, oxygen, crash carts.

      A one-bed aerial ER, the back has a video and data link to 
      San Fran General.  There s enough equipment to save anyone 
      from just about anything.  All that s needed is talent.

                                  ROTOR
                    You eat yet?

                    Good.

      Crazy fast, the COPTER lifts off the helipad, then DIVES into 
      the canyon of skyscrapers.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Phone on speaker next to him, Fitch works on Walker.  

                                  FITCH
                    Nothing. He s not breathing.  
                    Nothing s happening.

                                  BOONE

                    It s okay.  We re here.  Just keep 
                    going.

      Fitch does. Four pumps of the chest. One breath. And again.  
      Boone and Tyler step out of the elevator.   

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Thanks. 

      Boone works and talks, checking Walker s eyes. Pupils fixed 
      and pinned. He shoots a grim look to Tyler:  Not good. 

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Epi, tubes and paddles.

      Tyler pulls gear. Boone opens a LARGE SYRINGE, shoots up 
      Walker.  Nothing. Not so gently, Boone tilts back Walker s 
      head, opens up his mouth for the tube.  Fitch hovers.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)         TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 7

                                  BOONE
                    We re working on that.

      Boone slides the long tube down Walker s throat into his 
      airway. Fitch heads away. As soon as he s on the elevator and 
      out of sight, Tyler pulls the DEFIBRILLATOR KIT.

      EXT/INT. EMT HELICOPTER - DAY1414

      Rotor takes the copter in an obscene turn around a 
        construction crane. Rabbit s nodding his head in time to the 
      MUSIC churning through the sound system.

      CLOSE UP: RABBIT S HANDS

      Like a razor sharp coin, he twirls a SCALPEL through his 
      fingers.

      EXT. TOP FLOOR - INCOMPLETE SKYSCRAPER - DAY1515

      BOONE hits WALKER with the paddles. His already charred body, 
      arcs and twitches again. Then, nothing.

                                  TYLER
                    I don t think more electricity s

                    Yeah.  I m gonna call it.  We don t 
                    need the copter.

      A voice cuts across the open space.

                                  NANCY
                    He s not dead until I say so.

      Terry backing her up, Nancy strides to Walker. Her eyes eat 
      up every detail.

                                  BOONE
                    Be my guest Nance. Starting  em and

      Nancy begins loosening Walker s clothes, checking pupils, 
      feeling his chest, fingertips, earlobes.

      Suddenly, WIND washes over everyone. Lots and lots of wind. 

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey Nancy!!

      The helicopter hovers above. Like a tweaker Angel falling to 
      Earth, Rabbit sails down a zipline.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)

      A flat out rock star, Rabbit heads on over.

                          (checking his watch)
                    You got about four minutes until 
                    brain death. His I mean. Hey Terry.  

      Rabbit points to Nancy and flashes a thumbs up. 

                                  NANCY
                    I m working here, Rabbit. 

      She pumps Walker with another syringe. Nothing.

                    see if he s got a cell phone?

      Tyler does.  He tosses it to Rabbit.  

      CLOSE UP: WALKER S PHONE

      Rabbit scrolls the numbers, comes to  Home  and hits it.

                    No. No. No. He s fine. He s going 
                    to be just fine.  

      That raises a few eyebrows. Nancy just looks disgusted as 
      they strap WALKER S lifeless body to a board. Boone, Tyler 
      and Terry carry. Nancy works. Rabbit follows.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I just wanted to ask you a few

                      inhibitors? Oh Okay...

      He looks at Nancy.  Nope, no medication. 

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Just one more thing. Was he in the 
                    military recently?
                          (Listening, a smile grows)

                    General in about ten minutes. You 
                    can meet him there.

      A light dusting of ELECTROMAGNETIC SNOW obscures Dr. Joe s 
      face.  Harsh static sounds through the speaker.

1919EXT/INT. EMT HELICOPTER - DAY 

      Through the windshield, Rotor sees a NEWS HELICOPTER appear 
      from around a nearby building, heading straight toward them.

      The News Copter s coming too fast. Rotor pulls up, just as 
      the News Copter dives.  It s a slow motion symphony of 
      disaster.  The COPTERS COLLIDE.  Metal rips metal.

      EXT. TOP FLOOR INCOMPLETE SKYSCRAPER - DAY2020

      Nancy and the others watch the copters crash into each other 
      a few hundred yards above them.

                                  NANCY
                    No...  Terry... No...

      The NEWS COPTER drops. Somehow, Rotor keeps some sort of 
      control. The EMT COPTER SPIRALS, spinning horribly right 
      toward the top floor.

      The EMT copter punches in right in front of Tyler, Boone and 
      Nancy. Rotors and skids shearing off, the hull of the copter 
      flames out, sliding across the roof.

      No one could survive that crash. Nancy watches. It sinks in.  
      She runs forward as flames engulf the copter.

      EXT. 1012 MONTGOMERY - DAY2121

      The NEWS COPTER burns on the ground. Firefighters put out the 
      blaze, tend to the injured, the terrified. Up on the roof, 
      RABBIT and ROTOR S EMT COPTER smolders.

      It s a scene from hell. Strangely, a VOICE sounds out.

                                  NEWSCASTER

                    lives in the air and on the

      PULLING BACK the disaster footage glimmers on a SMALL 
      TELEVISION SCREEN in a cozy North Beach apartment.

      TV humming on the dresser, MARISA BENEZ (28) - petite, a mass 
      of muscle and street smarts - fingers a ROSARY.

      By the TV, a PHOTO shows Marisa in uniform, posing by an ARMY 
      ATTACK HELICOPTER. She sets down the rosary beads, reapplies 
      lipstick, grabs her cell phone.

      As Marisa heads out the front door, the phone rings.

      Marisa jaywalks across the street, maneuvering between moving 
      cars. She scoots her ass away from an oncoming TAXI.

      BLOOD splatters.  Lots and lots of blood.  A siren screams. 
      Up front, a new face drives. SAM BAILEY (30s), a couple steps 
      past metrosexual. Screams come from the back, where...

      NANCY works on a man bleeding from a CHEST WOUND. Eyes blank, 
      her hands move of their own accord. She clamps an artery, 
      then slams a sedative into the IV.

                                  NANCY

                    Oak it is.

      Bailey checks the back. Nancy s soothing the patient. But the 
      bleeder is UNCONSCIOUS. Nancy s barely looking at him.

                                  NANCY 
                      Everything s going to be just fine.

                    You re in copter two. State of the 
                    art man. Get moving. Rush hour s 
                    starting.

      Near the TV, there s an odd MEMORIAL - ROTOR S CHARRED HELMET 
      propped on his plastic GUITAR HERO GUITAR. One of the EMTs 
      snickers as she passes.

                                  MARISA
                    What? You got a tick or something?  
                    Some kind of stutter. Lotta meds on 
                    the copter. Maybe one could fix you 
                    up.

                                    GLASSES EMT
                    You got no idea what you re in for, 
                    do you?

      She checks him out, noticing he s wearing GLASSES.

                                  MARISA
                    You weren't military were ya,

                    copter. Started flying a meat bird 
                    for some action, right?

      His face drops. She nailed it. His buddies chuckle.

                    Oigame guero, what you call a rush,

      On the TV, the GTA player goes down in a hail of bullets.

      EXT. ROOF - ANGEL S FLIGHT EMT SERVICES - DAY2929

      TWO COPTERS wait on the helipad. One s a little older, the 
      other s the gleaming replacement for the one that took Rotor.  
      All business, Marisa does a walk-around. Checking the landing 
      gear. Looking for any leaks on the ground.

      INT. COCKPIT - RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY3030

      Marisa slides in. Home. Instinctively, she runs her hands and 
      eyes over the gauges. She pulls a MEDALLION, hangs it around 
      the compass.  

      Suddenly, a GRUFF VOICE scares the shit out of her.

                                  VOICE
                    Take it down.

      Startled she turns. RABBIT moves out of the shadows of the 
      back. Intense, almost manic, Rabbit has a faint scar running 
      along his cheek.

      The back is IMMACULATE. Everything put perfectly in its 
      place, the result of Rabbit s obsessive attentions. Not 
      scared, simply wary, Marisa smiles and flicks the medallion.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 20

                    Cool. But St. Joey s not the patron 
                    here. I am. And I didn t say you

                                  MARISA
                    You re Rabbit.

      He smiles and waves,  Bye. Bye.  She slides out of the 
      copter. St. Joseph stays. Rabbit eyes the medallion.

      INT. ANGEL S FLIGHT EMT SERVICES - DAY3131

      The EMT in glasses has his eyes on his watch as Marisa blazes 
      in the room.

      Marisa thinks about this. The only way out is through.

      Evening traffic moves along at a pretty fast clip.

      INT: BMW

      One eye on the road, a SMUG DRIVER, works his phone, texting 
      someone named  FOXY.

      Up ahead an 18 WHEEL TANKER tries a lane change. The Texting 
      Driver doesn t see it.

      Looking up from his text, the driver doesn t have time. He 
      SLAMS into the 18 WHEELER. A horrible chain reaction happens.

      The Big Rig jackknifes, fishtailing into other cars, causing 
      damage, blocking the road.  A car swerves, plows head on into 
      oncoming traffic. Both sides of the bridge pile up.

      At the back of the series of rear-end accidents, a CARPOOL 
      MOM has a minivan full of 10 YEAR OLD BOYS.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Everybody okay?

      Fast, practiced, the older copter takes off. Sitting in the

                    Davey doesn t really feel it.  
                    There s a little blood. He figures 
                    he got nicked. I m a little busy, 
                    flying through a firestorm.  We get 
                    out. He s talking, starting to 
                    slur. Says he feels sweaty. I look 
                    over. He s got brain matter leaking 
                    out of his helmet. I wipe it away, 
                    tell him it s sweat mixed with a 
                    little blood.  Davey chats me up 
                    all the way back to Balad, like 
                    some drunk at a bar. I m landing,

                    messed up right?

      Marisa vaults into the cockpit, fires up the copter quickly.  
      Checking her surroundings, she gooses the throttles.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)
                    And Rabbit. That story about Davey.

                    list of worst things I ve ever 
                    seen.

      The copter lifts off, rotors biting air.  In the back, Rabbit 
      closes his eyes. In his hand the SCALPEL twirls, three times 
      as fast as before. It nicks his knuckle. He doesn t notice.

      Rabbit reaches into the COCKPIT, punches a button, LOUD MUSIC 
      fills the air.

      Instantly, Marisa silences it.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)

      comes into view...

      EXT. FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY3535

      Mayhem. A CAR burns. FIRE TRUCKS try to maneuver near the 
      snarl. The only way to get to the worst of it is on foot.

      Lugging his med kit, BOONE arrives at the impact site.  
      Behind him, Tyler brings a backboard. Boone checks cars.  
      People are dazed, scared. He gives one guy the once over.

                    Can you walk?  Good. Head that way 
                    away from the Tanker.  

      Boone checks a BMW. TEXT DRIVER S in bad shape. He s got a 
      nasty bump on his head. Gently and quick Boone moves him out.  
      He and Tyler get him on the carry board. Instantly, Text gets 
      aggressive.

                    got a brain injury?

      They get him strapped to the board. Boone notices a SMALL 
      CROWD of ANGRY DRIVERS.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER #1
                    It s this joker s fault. He slammed

      Boone checks the TANKER in the near distance. There s a 
      pretty big pool of GASOLINE.  He sees a WRECKED CAR. Its 
      BROKEN HEADLIGHT sparks.

                    Move!!!!

      Tyler and Boone pick up the carry board and run like hell 
      away from the tanker.  So does everyone else.

      The tail light sparks again... The gasoline ignites.  So does 
      the tanker.  A FIREBALL erupts.  SHRAPNEL flies...

      INT. MINIVAN - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY3636

      A chunk of metal SHATTERS THE WINDOW.  Everyone ducks.


                                    CARPOOL KID
                    Mrs. Wahl...

      She looks in the back.  The 10 YEAR OLD SKATE KID is choking.  
      His throat s a mass of blood.

      EXT./INT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY3737

      Marisa and Rabbit see the explosion.  They share a look.  She 
      veers the copter toward a clear spot on the bridge.

                                  RABBIT
                    God, I love my job.

      EXT. FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY3838

      FIRE AND SMOKE obscure everything. Boone and Tyler stumble, 
      get back to their feet. Visibility s impossible in all the 
      smoke. A VOICE rings in Boone s headset.

                                  NANCY
                          (over)
                    Cameron?  You alright?

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah.  
                          (looking around)
                    I think everyone got out before it 
                    blew.

                                  NANCY
                    Not much we can do for them if they 
                    didn t.

      Tyler checks out the TEXT DRIVER.

                                  BOONE
                    I got a head wound here. Possible 
                    brain trauma. You?

      INTERCUT: ANOTHER PART OF THE BRIDGE

      Away from the epicenter, NANCY and BAILEY walk through the 
      WOUNDED. Nancy kneels next to a woman with a severely twisted 
      ARM, filling out a TRIAGE TAG.

      First Nancy checks pulse, then she pinches the woman s thumb, 
      watching how quickly color comes back. 

                                  NANCY
                          (to the woman)
                    Hold up two fingers please.

      The woman does. Nancy clips a YELLOW TRIAGE TAG to the 
      woman s collar.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                          (on the headset)
                    I got a little bit of everything.

      A pale CORPSE gathers soot. Pulling a blanket over it, BAILEY 
      marks it with a BLACK TRIAGE TAG.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 27

      Text Driver thrashes around as Tyler bandages his head.

                                  BOONE
                    You need to calm down sir.  

      ANGRY DRIVERS start to come back.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER
                    Why are you helping this guy? Hell, 
                    he did this.

                                  BOONE
                    That s for the cops to figure out.  
                    We help anyone who needs it.

                                  ANGRY DRIVER
                    Then look around. There s worse off 
                    than him

      A San Francisco wind blows through, clearing the smoke. 
      Boone s eyes focus.  Away from the cars, Boone sees a LONE 
      MAN lying on the walkway. No motion. No blood. Nothing.

                                  BOONE
                    You got this?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah. Nothing I can do without an 
                    EEG.

      EXT. JOHN DOE - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY3939

      Boone trots over to the LONE MAN. He s barely breathing.  
      Boone checks for the pulse. Just the briefest flutter.

                                  BOONE
                    Nancy, I need you over here. Bring 
                    a crash kit.

                                  NANCY
                          (over)
                    Will do.

      PROPWASH clears the rest of the smoke. Up above, Marisa pulls 
      the copter in a wide arc over the scene. Door open, RABBIT 
      stands precariously, drinking in all the chaos

                                  BOONE
                    So Rabbit decided to grace us with 
                    his presence.  

                                  NANCY
                    You talk to him?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 28

                                  BOONE
                    I visited him once.  He threw a 
                    bottle of scotch at me and then 
                    cried for half an hour. That was 
                    one of his good days.

                                  NANCY
                    And how are you?

                                  BOONE
                    Fine. Hanging in.

                                  NANCY
                    Home okay?

                                  BOONE
                    Status quo.

      There s a moment. They ve said their lies.  Back to work.   
      Boone loosens the LONE MAN s clothes, checks his pockets.  
      Nothing. Carefully, Boone opens up his airway, starts CPR.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    This is a weird one.

                                  NANCY
                    Yeah. Flutter pulse. No trauma.

                                  BOONE
                    And no ID. No keys. I can t tell if 
                    any of the cars are his.  

                                  NANCY
                    Cardiac? Smoke Inhalation?

                                  BOONE
                          (shaking his head)
                    Dunno, Naughty. Just a John Doe on 
                    the ground. 

                                  NANCY
                          (a smile)
                    Don t call me that. There s no real 
                    reason he should be here.

      Nancy gently intubates JOHN DOE. She puts a heart monitor on.  
      The SCREEN reads the faintest pulse. Then, she injects 
        Epinephrine.  The heartbeat gets stronger, more regular.

      Behind Nancy and Boone, a FRANTIC MAN comes running up.

                                    FRANTIC MAN
                    Hey!!!  Sir!!!  There s a kid back 
                    here. He doesn t look too good.

                                  NANCY
                    I got this one. Take the kid.

      Boone heads off. Nancy stays with John Doe. She fills out a 
      YELLOW TRIAGE TAG, clips it to his shirt.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 29

      In the  Name  section, Nancy scrawls  JOHN DOE. 

      EXT. MINIVAN - FREEWAY BRIDGE4040

      Boone gently pulls out the SKATE KID. He s convulsing.  
      There s a horrible sound coming from his throat.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Please help him. Please help Sammy. 
                    He s my boy...

      Gently, Boone touches the hysterical woman s hand.

                                  BOONE
                    I m right here with him and I m 
                    going to stay right here with him 
                    until we can get somewhere better.  
                    We re going to do everything we 
                    can.
                          (he locks on to her eyes)
                    That s a promise.

      EXT. JOHN DOE - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY4141

      Nancy works on John Doe, checking everything, finding 
      nothing. Then she sees..

      A FIGURE moves through the smoke. Nancy can tell by the walk.  
      He s like a ghost risen from the dead. She tries to ignore 
      him. It almost works.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey!  Someone call for a brain box?
                          (a smile to Nancy)
                    Glad to see me?

      Nancy looks at him for a half a second, freezes him out.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Whatever.

                                  TYLER
                    I need the EEG.  Head wounds.  
                    Can t tell if there s brain trauma.  
                    He s been erratic and hostile.

      EXT. TEXT DRIVER - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY4242

      Tyler begins hooking up the electrodes.  Rabbit flashes a 
      light in the text driver s eyes.

                    There s no brain damage. He s just 
                    a jerk with a concussion. He

      Text driver pulls off the electrodes. Holding him down, Tyler 
      tries to put them back on.

                    Hey... Be cool.

                    Yes. Take me. Take me first.

      Rabbit whips out a syringe. Tyler s finally got the 
      electrodes on.

                                  TYLER
                    What are you...

      Rabbit slides the syringe in the guy s arm. The EEG comes to 
      life. For a moment it reads NORMAL, then goes FLAT as Text 
      Driver slips into unconsciousness.

      A ROUND of GOLF CLAPS rise up from the ANGRY DRIVERS.

                    Oh hell yeah. Mom s always ride.

      Rabbit and Boone pick up the backboard and move the boy 
      quickly toward the copter. They pass NANCY and JOHN DOE.  
      Nancy injects another syringe.  

                                  NANCY
                    I need paddles.

                    at the copter.  

      Nancy switches JOHN DOE S TRIAGE TAG from YELLOW TO RED.  

      EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY4444

      Boone and Rabbit load the SKATER KID onto the copter. Boone 
      helps the mother on.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Your seat s there. Strap in.

      Marisa catches the mother s eyes. Gently, she reaches a hand 
      over and helps the woman with the seatbelt.

                                  MARISA
                          (mouthing re: Rabbit)
                    Don t worry.  

      As the rotors pull air, Rabbit hooks the Skater Kid to the 
      comlink and video feed.  Dr. Joe s face fills the monitor.

                                  DR. JOE 
                    BR s high but blood gas is low.  
                    How s the airway?

                    Sorry. 

      EXT. JOHN DOE - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY4545

      JOHN DOE S body arcs under the paddles. The heart monitor 
      comes back to life. Nancy grabs his hand, squeezes it tight.

                                  NANCY
                    That s it. Keep coming back.

      John Doe s eyes open. Suddenly, he s completely lucid.

      Everyone registers what just happened, then Doe slips back 
      into unconsciousness. The heart monitor plummets.  Boone 
      watches as Nancy dives back in, readying another Epi syringe.

                                  NANCY
                    No.. Come on.  Fight. Just hold on

      Alarms sound. The Skater Kid crashes.  Marisa stays calm at 
      the stick, ripping along the water very very fast.

      EXT/INT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY4747

      Marisa takes the copter to the city. In the back, Rabbit has 
      the Skater Kid s head strapped down. The SCALPEL hovers over 
      his throat. Nearby, a LARYNX-TRACHEAL TUBE waits.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    What are you going to do?

                                  RABBIT
                    Help him breathe. Um... This looks 
                    worse than it is. Okay that s a 
                    lie. Here, just give me your 
                    hand...

      Gently, Rabbit takes the CARPOOL MOM S hand. He puts it on 
      the boy s shoulder.  

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Just look away and I ll move your 
                    hand when I need it.

      The Mom looks away, Rabbit raises the scalpel. Suddenly, 
      shudders rips through the hull.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Not helping.  

                                  MARISA
                    Bad air is bad air.

      Violent and deft, Rabbit slices a slit into the Skater Kid s 
      throat. He reaches for Mom s hand.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hold this open. Yeah. Yeah. Like 
                    that.

      Carpool Mom spreads open the larynx with her fingers. She 
      makes the mistake of taking a look.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Oh God.

      Rabbit quickly slides the TRACHEAL TUBE into the incision and 
      down into the airway. Like siphoning gas, Rabbit quickly 
      blows and sucks into the tube, inflating the lungs.

      FLUID spits out of the tube. Then, WHEEZING BREATHS sound 
      out. Mom looks ready to puke. Rabbit smiles broadly at her.

                                  RABBIT

      Nancy slams another syringe of Epi into John Doe. The HEART 
      MONITOR spikes, holds steady for a second, then nosedives.  

                                  BOONE
                    That s six. He s just running on

                                  BOONE
                    Nancy do you even know why he 
                    arrested?

                    No.

                                  BOONE
                    So why are you going overboard?

      Line crossed. Nancy shoots him a look. Suddenly, JOHN DOE 
      gasps, forms a single sound...

                                  JOHN DOE
                      Aaaaaaaa...

      And DIES. The heart monitor goes flat.

                    No...

      Nancy pulls the big needle, injects Atroprine straight into 
      the heart. Nothing. She reaches for the paddles.

                    I know what I m doing.

      She gels the paddles, gets ready to use them. Boone s gentle 
      hand stops her.  

                                  BOONE
                    He s gone.

                    I can get him back.

      Nancy s voice takes a horrible edge. She almost cries.  
      Almost.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    I can get him back.

      Boone locks eyes with her. Neither knows exactly who they re 
      talking about. But the answer s still the same.

      DR. JOE watches the Mom and the gurney pass, sees the

      Up front, Marisa s ready to turn and go.

                                  MARISA
                    Don t tell me what to do.

      Dr. Joe likes that one. He turns and goes back to the less 
      wounded. The copter heads back into the sky.

      EXT. FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY5050

      Things have calmed down. All the fires are out. ONE LANE on 
      each side of the bridge is open. Tyler puts a BLACK TRIAGE 
      TAG on the blanket over JOHN DOE s CORPSE.  

      Not far away, Nancy stands at the railing, looking out over 
      the water. Marisa s HELICOPTER circles overhead.

      Boone cracks a smile.  Then he sees a LEGGY WOMAN against a 
      car. She s got a gash on her head and a BANDAGED WRIST.  

      Moving in, Boone notices her TRIAGE TAG is GREEN.

                                  BOONE
                    Hey, how are you doing?

                    They said it was just a sprain.

                    Actually I think it s broken.

      Almost playfully, he pulls her thumb back. She jerks.

                    How s the kid?

                                  RABBIT
                    He s gonna to make it. His Mom 
                    might sue...
                          (watching Nancy)
                    What s up with her?

                                  BAILEY
                    Not sure. Probably best to give her 
                    distance.

                                  RABBIT
                    Oh...  Okay.

      Rabbit heads over to Nancy.

                                  TYLER
                    Jesus, you re crazier than I 
                    thought.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s a matter of degrees. A matter 
                    of degrees.

      Bailey watches Rabbit and Nancy.

                                  BAILEY
                    We re never going to be part of the 
                    club are we?

                                  TYLER
                          (zipping the bag shut)
                    Dude, you don t want to be.

      EXT. SIDEWALK - FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY5353

      Skipping through traffic, Rabbit moves up next to Nancy, 
      looks over the railing at the water, the city.

      She tolerates him for a few seconds, then...

                                  NANCY
                    Rather be alone.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah. With a Jameson s neat, a 
                    Norco and some dark sunglasses.   
                    I m familiar.

                                  NANCY
                    Long time ago. Different people. 
                    This isn t us anymore.

      CONTINUED:5353

                                  RABBIT
                    Whatever. So you re just having a 
                    moment. A little meditation thing. 
                          (a beat, direct, trying)
                    John Doe get to you? It s usually 
                    kids for you...

                                  NANCY
                    Yeah...  
                          (looking him in the eye)
                    Guy aces out on a bridge, alone and 
                    nameless. No trauma. Nobody there 
                    for him.  None of the cars are his.  
                    Wherever he was coming from or 
                    going to, no one was waiting.

                                  RABBIT
                    There s someone out there.

                                  NANCY
                    What if there s not?  Maybe some 
                    people never connect.  They re just 
                    on a bridge. Until they die... 
                    Alone.

      Rabbit eyes her.  

                                  RABBIT
                    You getting high again?

                                  NANCY
                    Terry used to walk this bridge.  
                    When we d fight...

      Rabbit stays quiet.  He knows better.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    He was pissed at me when he got in 
                    the copter.  He died in a split 
                    second.  I wonder what he was 
                    thinking.  That I was a bitch.  
                    That he loved me.  I ll never know.

                                  RABBIT
                    No one could.  Tell yourself it was 
                    something nice.  

                                  NANCY
                    I have.  It doesn t work.  
                          (a beat, shaking her head)
                    So this is what we say to each 
                    other after a year.  Typical.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Just trying to help.

                                  NANCY
                    Aren t we all?  You should go.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 41

      CONTINUED: (2)5353

      Rabbit trots off. In the middle of traffic, he stops and 
      turns around. Cars honk. Motorists yell.

                                  RABBIT 
                    Hey Naughty. I m sorry about Terry.  

                                  NANCY
                    You are such an asshole.

      Rabbit heads off toward the copter. Gathering herself, Nancy 
      heads over to Tyler who has JOHN DOE s body on a gurney.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    I ll take him in.

      EXT. FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY5454

      Rabbit arrives at the COPTER where BOONE is helping the LEGGY 
      WOMAN on. Rabbit checks the Triage Tag.

                                  RABBIT
                    What do we got?

                                  BOONE
                    Broken wrist. I think there s some 
                    marrow floating so I m worried 
                    about the head wound you know?  
                    Don t want a Transient Ischemic 
                    Attack.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah. TIA. We sure don t want that.  

      Leggy takes the window seat in the back. Rabbit s seat.

                                  LEGGY
                    Thanks.

                                  BOONE
                    Take care of yourself. Maybe I ll 
                    check on you later.

      Sliding the door shut, Boone takes off. Rabbit settles in 
      next to Marisa. Leggy looks out the window.

                                  MARISA
                          (soft, to Rabbit)
                    Never knew I was driving date bait.

      EXT. FREEWAY BRIDGE - DAY5555

      Bailey helps Nancy load John Doe in the back of the PARAMEDIC 
      VAN. She gets in after him. 

      Nearby, Boone piles a MAN with a broken leg into the back.  
      Climbing in, he checks his phone. MANY MISSED CALLS, all of 
      them from  HOME.  He ignores them.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 42

      CONTINUED:5555

      The Vans pulls away, weaving out into slow moving traffic.  
      There s no sirens, no lights.

      EXT/INT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY5656

      Marisa makes a wildly banking turn, smiles when she sees 
      Leggy flail for a handhold.  Rabbit moves to push the  Play  
      button the stereo. Marisa slaps his hand away.

      Then she pushes the  Play  button.

      INT. TRAUMA CENTER - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - DAY5757

      The aftermath of the bridge accident.  Interns and Doctors 
      work in the Trauma rooms.  Less serious patients wait on 
      gurneys, moaning, bitching.

                                    PATIENT
                    My leg hurts.

      Joe checks it out. It s obviously broken.

                                  DR. JOE
                    I m sure it does.

      He moves on, into a TRAUMA ROOM and a more life-threatening 
      case.

      EXT. TRAUMA CENTER - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - DAY5858

      A snarl of PARAMEDIC VANS. BOONE and TYLER send the MAN with 
      the broken leg inside. RABBIT s there waiting.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey Boone, you got a minute?

      Rabbit guides Boone off to a relatively quiet corner.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                       Transient Ischemic Attack?   You 
                    kidding me?  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  BOONE
                    Don t start with me. 

                                  RABBIT
                    Then don t use my copter to troll 
                    for strange. What you need is what 
                    you need. What you do is what you 
                    do. But don t get me involved.

                                  BOONE
                    Yes sir.

                                  RABBIT
                          (gently)
                      Cameron...  What s up?

                    I thought you were trying to work 
                    things out at home. I know Sarah, 
                    forgiving is a miracle. Don t push 
                    for two.

      Boone takes a second.  

                                  BOONE
                    You remember that day? The wreck?

                                  RABBIT
                    I was pretty busy being in a coma.

                                  BOONE
                    After we got everybody here. We 
                    weren t sure about you. We knew 
                    Terry was gone. There was nothing 
                    more to do. Shift was over. 13 
                    years, the end of every shift, I 
                    went home. Not that night.

      Rabbit stares at him, apparently engrossed.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    I just walked around. All over the 
                    place. Not even paying attention.   
                      I couldn t take it home, Rabbit.  
                    Not to Sarah. Not to the kids.  I 
                    still can t. You know what I mean?  
                    How it feels, how it weighs. I 
                    don t know where to go with this or 
                    who to take it to.  

      Boone notices RABBIT S NOT LISTENING. The faint sound of the 
      ERS comes through Rabbit s headset.  

                                  RABBIT
                    Hold on...  I can hit another call 
                    before the shift ends.  

      Rabbit trots off, looking for Marisa. Boone watches him go.

                                  BOONE
                    Good talking to you Rabbit.

      Tyler passes by, clapping Boone on the back.  

                                  TYLER
                    Widows and Orphans meeting in the

                    I don t know, man. I don t know.

                    Sure thing.  

      He heads off. Nancy watches the body go. Then, she notices 
      MARISA nearby.

                    Hey. Marisa Benez, I m flying with

                    I saw you guys talking on the

                                  MARISA
                    Cause I gotta say, I m a little 
                    worried. The guy s pure Post

                    I might. I just saw Rabbit save a

                                  NANCY
                    Don t compliment him. Don t hang 
                    out with him. Don t drink with him 
                    and do not sleep with him.

                                  MARISA
                    That bad?

                    Look, it s not like that.

                                  NANCY
                    Hey...  We do this job cause of how 
                    we re wired. I m a mess. You?

                                  MARISA
                    Up and down.

                                  NANCY
                    Rabbit makes us all look healthy.  
                    Try to remember that.

      On cue, Rabbit spots them. Not sure how to proceed, unable to 
      help himself, he bounds over.

                                  RABBIT
                    Awesome, you two have met.  
                    Naughty. Marisa. Marisa. Naughty.  
                    Ohhh, the mind reels.

      She blows him a kiss.

                                  MARISA
                      Complicated with you two huh?

                    She hates men.

                          (tapping his headset)
                    Look, we got a call. Water 
                      evacuation in the bay. Some 
                    sailor s stuck. Hurt. It s a good 
                    one.

      Marisa looks at him. Taps her own headset.

                                  MARISA
                    Not it s not. Coast Guard s got it.  
                    Shifts over. We re fuel cautioned 
                    and the wind s up. We re not taking 
                    it.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah we are.

                                  MARISA
                    Coast guard s got it. I m not

                                  RABBIT
                    Look, it s a solid call. We got 
                    time.  People are hurt. We need to 
                    take the call. 

                                  MARISA
                    You need to take a call right now.  
                    Nobody else does. I m off the 
                    clock.  

      With a flick of her ass, she leaves him. The RADIO in his 
      headset rings out.

                                  RADIO
                    This is Coast Guard 14, be advised

      It settles over Rabbit. Shift over.

      EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - NIGHT6060

      Lights from the city reflect on the water. Heading to the 
      park, HEADLIGHTS form a circle.  

      VANS form a loose camp. It s literally a TAILGATE PARTY of 
      Paramedics. Welcome to a Widows and Orphans meeting.

      Bailey and Tyler drink. Suddenly, TWO EMTs run past with 
      DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES. They re trying to shock each other.

                                  BAILEY
                    Now that s idiotic.

                    I had a Frequent Flyer go nuts on 
                    me once. Whipped those out on him.  
                    Zap! Now that put the put down on 
                    him.

      Bailey just stares at him. Notices that Tyler s rolling 
      TRIAGE TAGS in his hand, like a rosary.

      CLOSE UP: TYLER S HAND.

      The TAGS have different shapes and labels, from different 
      cities.  SFFD, NYFD, NOFD.

                                  BAILEY
                    You collect those?

                                  TYLER
                    I move around a lot. Well, uh I 
                    used to. New York. New Orleans.  
                    Chicago. Here. This is the longest.  
                    Almost two years.  
                          (a shrug)
                    Don t know why.

      Bailey looks across the park. RABBIT and MARISA sit on the 
      tailgate of a van. Rabbit pours cocktails from an IV bag.

                                  BAILEY
                          (nodding to Rabbit)
                    So was he actually normal once?

                                  TYLER
                    Not even close.  

      Again, Bailey shakes his head, takes a pull of his beer.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    You know, you don t know us well 
                    enough to judge.

      Something glitters in Bailey s eyes. Call it mental health.

                                  BAILEY
                    You re an overtime whore. You ve 
                    probably got 50 grand saved up but 
                    you don t know what to do with it 
                    cause you re just thinking about 
                    your next shift trade.

      Tyler registers the truth of that.

      Tyler grins, grabs another brew.

6161INT. TREATMENT ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - NIGHT 

      Her WRIST in a cast, the LEGGY WOMAN sits on the edge of the 
      bed. BOONE pokes his face around the curtain.

                                  BOONE
                    And how are we feeling?

      Boone pulls out his card, hands it over.

                    Let me know how it heals up.

                    I just might do that.

      She gives him a look, obviously charmed.

      EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - WIDOWS AND ORPHANS PARTY - NIGHT6262

      Lights strobing, a POLICE CRUISER moves through the Vans.  
      The COP S VOICE peals through the PA.

                                  COP S VOICE

      EXT/INT. RABBIT S CAR - NIGHT6363

      Rabbit s mildly battered CHEVELLE motors up one of the city s 
      steep hills. 

                                  MARISA
                    Hey take it easy.

                    Why start now? Look whatever you ve 
                    heard. I m cool.

      The speedometer peaks as Rabbit crests the hill. The car 
      catches air. Lands hard.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I m cool.

                    Rabbit, I d like to keep some

                                  RABBIT
                    You ever see Bullitt?

      Rabbit guides the car fast down a steep hill. There s an 
        intersection at the bottom.  The light reads GREEN.

                                  MARISA
                    Knock it off, okay? Not how I want 
                    to go.

                                  RABBIT
                    There s something you should know 
                    about me...

      The light at the intersection turns yellow. Instead of 
      watching the road, Rabbit fixes his eyes on her and blazes 
      straight through the RED LIGHT.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I can t die.

                    Oh, Jesu Christo...

      They re gathering speed, continuing downhill. Another 
      intersection, another green light turning YELLOW. Rabbit 
      keeps looking at her instead of the road.

                                  RABBIT
                      I survived hell and fire...

      The moment of IMPACT. Rotor screams as the helicopter shears 
      into the roof. The fireball builds. And miraculously, RABBIT 
      IS THROWN OUT OF THE BAY DOORS. Like a rag doll, he skitters 
      across the roof,crumples into a bloody heap. His eyes, 
      flutter. He SMILES.

                    time. And when it s not, it s not.  
                    And it is not my time.

      The intersection approaches. The light s RED.

                                  MARISA
                    Listen to me Rabbit, every corpse I 
                    know figured it wasn t his time.  
                    And you need to...  

      A HORN interrupts her. There s a CAR pulling into the 
      intersection. Rabbit swerves. He fishtails through the 
      intersection. Incredibly, Rabbit gets the car under control.

      Then... At the curb, an AUDI S DOOR OPENS right in front of 
      Rabbit.

      RABBIT S CAR slams into the Audi s door, shearing it off.  
      Rabbit s Chevelle spins out, finally comes to a stop.

      A terrible sound comes sounds out from the Audi. A scared

      Leaving Marisa behind, Rabbit bolts out to the Audi. Pale,

                    I m not a cop.  Let s see...

      Rabbit takes a good look at the man s hand.  The Audi 
      driver s MISSING A FINGER.

                      Marisa!!!!  See if you can find his 
                    finger. It s probably by the door.

                                  AUDI DRIVER
                    Oh my God. Oh my God.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s okay. Put pressure here.  

      Marisa searches the ground as Rabbit runs into a WINE BAR.

6565INT. WINE BAR - NIGHT 

      Rabbit cruises in, heads behind the bar and grabs a pitcher.

                    Hey!!

      Rabbit fills the pitcher with ICE.

                                  RABBIT
                    You overserved a yuppie. He s

      Audi Driver moaning quietly in the car, Marisa brings a 
      grisly prize to Rabbit - the FINGER.

                                  MARISA
                    I found it.

      Rabbit puts the finger deep in the pitcher of ice.

                                  RABBIT
                    It s a clean tear at the knuckle.  
                    They can probably save it. Guy s 
                    drunk, thinks it s his fault.

                    Hey Darlene... I got a fender 
                    bender. Well a little more. Guy s 
                    door got ripped off. And uh, so did

                    No worries. I ll be around let me 
                    know if anything comes in.

      Nancy goes, kicks back in the waiting room, checks out 
      reality TV for a bit. She takes a moment look at the wounded, 
      the waiting, their loved ones.

      Out of the lab coat and in a damn fine suit, DR. JOE heads 
      through. He spots Nancy.

                    No.  No.  No.  You re not allowed

                    And then you came back to work.

                    Dinner wasn t that great.

      They both smile a bit.

                    You should know by now. Not much 
                    escapes me here.  I saw the path 
                    report. He had Endocarditis.  His 
                    heart was like a 90 year old s.  
                    Probably didn t know. Smoke 
                      inhalation triggered total cardiac 
                    shutdown. For lack of a better 
                    word, the guy was doomed.  You 
                    okay?

      The veneer cracks a bit... For both of them.

                                  NANCY
                    I don t know.

      Dr. Joe sits down next to her, takes a gander at the waiting 
      room, the parade of damage.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Rabbit coming back was going to

                                  ALISON
                    Thank you.

      There s a moment. A complete and utter shared connection of 
      grief.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    This happened to you didn t it?
                          (Nancy nods)
                    Does it ever get better?

                                  NANCY
                    Not recently. You got a job?  
                    Something you love? Something you 
                    were born to?

                                  ALISON
                    I work in an insurance company. I 
                    hate it.

                                  NANCY
                    Okay... Scratch that.

      Alison manages a chuckle. We move around to the other side of 
      the glass. The attendant zips up the body bag. The tag 
      reading John Doe is replaced with a tag:  JEREMY BURTON. 

7171EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT 

      Lights twinkle. Cars move. Sidewalks thrive. For the lucky, 
      life goes on.       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 58



7272INT. BART TRAIN - NIGHT 

      BOONE rides the train. STOCKBROKERS fill some seats. He 
      catches the eye of a PRETTY BROKER. They look at each other.  
      Then Boone looks away.

7373INT. RABBIT S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

      Extreme focused minimalism. A very nice bed. A very nice 
      refrigerator. A stereo system easily worth $10,000. Neat 
      shelves of books, CDs and vinyl. No TV. Not a single picture 
      on the wall.  

      A ritual, Rabbit pulls down blackout curtains. Meticulously 
      he TAPES the edges of the window shades. Done with the task, 
      he just stands there. Nowhere to go. Night over.

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - NIGHT7474

      Packing up the UNIFORM, Nancy changes into street clothes, a 
      simple t-shirt and jeans.  They don t smell like smoke, 
      they re not stain with blood.  She moves out the door

7575EXT. SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL - NIGHT 

      More bodies move inside on more gurneys. Lights and noise 
      swirl. For Nancy, it s total silence as she moves out, away.

                                                                            FADE TO:

7676INT. BOONE S HOUSE - NIGHT 

      Boone creeps into the darkness. The first thing he sees is 
      THE COUCH made up for him to sleep on. Resigned, he moves 
      toward his DAUGHTERS  ROOM.

      Suddenly, his CELL PHONE VIBRATES, lighting up the room.

      INTERCUT: NOE VALLEY APARTMENT

      Wine in hand, the LEGGY WOMAN looks out the window. The phone 
      just rings.

      Boone pushes  IGNORE  on his phone. Then tiptoes to his 
      daughter and kisses them on the forehead.  

      INT. RABBIT S APARTMENT - DAWN7777

      Rabbit lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. There s a KNOCK 
      at his door. He looks confused. Could it be? No way.

      He opens the door. It s NANCY. The look that passes between 
      them speaks encyclopedias.

                                  NANCY
                    I can t sleep.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah, me neither.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 59

                                  NANCY
                    I know.

      Together they move to the bed. There s nothing sexual about 
      it. They slide in together. His shirt rides up, exposing a 
      HORRIBLE SCAR on his back. Lightly she touches it.

                                  RABBIT
                    Chicks think it s sexy.

                                  NANCY
                    Shut up, Rabbit.

      She SPOONS him. Rays of light seep through the sides of the 
      windows.  

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Hey... welcome back.

      Together, they let sleep take them.
