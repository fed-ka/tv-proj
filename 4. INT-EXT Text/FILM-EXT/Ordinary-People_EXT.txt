Calvin walks up the alley to the street. [Horn honks]
Lazenby's car stops, with music playing. Lazenby is driving,
Stillman is with him in the front and Dickie van Buren is at
the back.
LAZENBY

It's called flake.
Conrad just stands there, waiting.
DICKIE VAN BUREN

JEANNINE'S FRIEND
You guys don't want a clarinet, do
you?
STILLMAN
Yeah, Van Buren wants a clarinet.
DICKIE VAN BUREN
I don't need a clarinet. Who's
selling it?
JEANNINE'S FRIEND
My brother. He needs a motorcycle.
DICKIE VAN BUREN
Uh, uh... I need a new pair of
shoes.
STILLMAN
You need a new personality.
Dickie Van Buren and Stillman leave. Conrad and Lazenby stand
in front of Jeannine and her friend.
JEANNINE
(points at Jarrett)
You, you stand behind me in the
choir.
CONRAD
Oh? I do? You do? Is that you?
JEANNINE
You have a lot of energy.
CONRAD

All right now, smile.
And remember, not too many martinis.

From inside, Beth stares outside in the garden where Conrad
is lying on a chaise lounge. She comes out.
BETH
It's cold out here. You should put
that on, or do you want a sweater?
CONRAD
Do I need one?
Beth is taken off guard by Conrad's reaction, doesn't know
what to do.
BETH
What are you doing?
CONRAD
Nothing. Thinking.

BETH
Your hair is starting to grow out.
It's looking... looking better.
Pause
CONRAD
I was thinking about the pigeon...
You know the one that used to hang
around the garage. How it used to
get on top of your car, and he take
off when you pulled out of the
driveway.
BETH
Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember
how scared I used to get... That
whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap,
flap!... Every time I started the
car.
CONRAD
Yeah. That was the closest we ever
came to having a pet. You remember
Buck asked you, he tried to talk
you into... getting a dog. Do you
remember that?
He said. "How about it, if it's
the size of a little football?"
BETH
You know. Uh... That animal next
door, that Pepper or Pippin,
whatever its name is...
CONRAD
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin!
BETH
He's not a very friendly dog...
I...
I don't care what Mr. McGreary
says.
CONRAD
BETH
- What he really wanted was a

BETH
Put that on if you're gonna stay
out here, okay?
Conrad stays alone a while and stares. Then goes inside.
54
55
Beth is laughing at Buck story. She is lying leisurely on a
mattress on the lawn. Buck is standing, telling his story.
BUCK
Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started
to just scream, just cry, right?
It was crazy. We got so drunk
that we couldn't talk to each
other. It was the last day... the
last day of school.
A younger Conrad, sitting aside, is listening too, amused.
BUCK (cont'd)
We walked out of the building in
the middle of the class!
Conrad laughs. Beth laughs.
BETH
Oh, Bucky!
Beth laughs.

Calvin walks with his business partner Ray Hanley (seen at
the party).
RAY HANLEY
Well. At least she's an
improvement. She doesn't crack gum
in your face. That's what you get
when your partner does the hiring
and firing.
CALVIN
Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault.
I just can never seem to tell
anybody that they're not making
it.

That's not the problem.
Where are you?
CALVIN

RAY HANLEY
I've been losing you these days.
CALVIN
Oh, I'm sorry.
RAY HANLEY
That's okay. That's okay. You off
the track?
CALVIN
Huh?
They laugh.
RAY HANLEY
Come on. I've known you for twenty
years. You think I can't tell when
something's wrong? How's Connie?
CALVIN
Connie's all right. He is. He's
okay.
RAY HANLEY
Look, I am sorry, it's none of my
business, but I think you worry too
much. You've been on the rack about
him long enough. You're making it a
habit. You've gotta let him go
sometime.
CALVIN
I'm not on the rack about him.
RAY HANLEY
The thing about it is, in a year
he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or
Harvard or wherever in the hell he
gets it in his head he wants to go.
Maybe he'll decide to take a tour
of Europe for a year and not even
go to school at all. Who knows?
CALVIN
I can't argue with "Who knows."

RAY HANLEY
I'm just try giving you the benefit
of my experience.
CALVIN
Thanks.
RAY HANLEY
With Valerie, it's more than her
living away from home... She's
gone. Got her own friends, her own
life. She breezes in ...for a couple
of days on vacations, but... I don't
know, maybe girls are different.
Or maybe she was too aware of what
was happening between Nance and me.
But they leave... And all that
worrying doesn't amount to a hill
of crap. It's just wasted energy.
Calvin is troubled.

Conrad is taken away on a stretcher into an ambulance.
AMBULANCE MAN

JEANNINE
Spoon on a ...glass?
Conrad laughs.
JEANNINE (cont'd)
Oh, you mean like ...tablespoon?
Oh, dear! Why do I ask dumb
questions? I'm just showing off.
Why is it so hard... the first

Calvin and Friend are jogging in sportswear. Calvin's friend
explains a stock market deal he made.
FRIEND
Say. After going to a new high, it
falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies
on good volume. I shoot an order to
buy 4000 at the market. If I get
the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know
something's wrong.

But suppose the order to buy the
4000 shares I put in at the price
of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500
at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way
up, so the last 500 shares I pay
115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm
going to peel off here.
Friend leaves Calvin and runs toward his home.
CALVIN
OK.
FRIEND
I'll see you, Cal.
CALVIN
See you later.
Now Calvin is running through the park alone. Different
voices are echoing off screen.

Listen, I want to say something

JEANNINE
Conrad. I was stupid.
That was dumb of me to laugh and
it was my fault. I just didn't
know what to do. I was
embarrassed.
CONRAD
Really?
You were embarrassed?
JEANNINE
Yes. When those boys came in, it
was awful and awkward. That's what
I do when I get embarrassed. I
laugh.
CONRAD
But they were all right. They were
just up and they were having a good
time, and I let them get in the way

No! I can't! And neither can you,
and neither can anybody else!
Only maybe I'm just a little more
honest about it!
CALVIN
Well, stop being so godamn honest,
and start being a little generous!
And start thinking about him for
a while!
BETH
I don't know what he expects from
me. I never have known.
CALVIN
Well, I'll tell you what he
expects!
BETH
What? He wants me to throw my arms
around him everytime he passes an
exam? Well, I can't do it! I
cannot respond when someone says:
"Here, I just did this great thing.
Love me.". I can't!
CALVIN
All he wants... All he wants is to
know you don't hate him. That's it.
BETH
Hate him? My God! How could I hate
him? Mothers don't hate their
sons! Is that what he told you? Do
you see how you accept what he says
with no questions, and you can't do
the same thing to me, can you?
CALVIN
I just try to keep this family
together...

BETH
(she shouts)
I don't know what everyone wants
from me anymore!
AUDREY
Beth, nobody wants anything from
you.
WARD
Beth, listen. We all just want...
Cal, Con, everybody, we just want
you to be happy.
BETH
Happy?
WARD
Yes.
BETH
Ward, you tell me the definition of
happy, uh? But first, you better
make sure that your kids are good
and safe, that no one's fallen off
a horse, or been hit by a car, or
drowned in that swimming pool
you're so proud of! And then you
come to me and tell me how to be
happy!
She leaves. Calvin follows. Ward and his wife just stand
there.

From inside, Conrad finally sees his father in the garden,
reflecting. Patches of snow. Conrad puts on his coat over
his pyjamas, and joins him.
CONRAD
Dad?
CALVIN
The yard looks smaller without
leaves.
CONRAD
Dad? What happened?
CALVIN
Your mother's going away for a
while.
CONRAD
Where?
Why?

CALVIN
Back to Houston.
Then I... I don't know.
CONRAD
Why? What... I know why.
It's me.
Isn't it?
CALVIN
No.
CONRAD
Yeah, it is. It's my fault.
CALVIN
Don't do that! Don't do that to
yourself! It's nobody's fault!
Things happen in this world,
people don't always have answers
for them, you know.
Calvin sits down.
CALVIN (cont'd)
I don't know why I'm yelling at you
for...
CONRAD
No, that's right! You're right! You
ought to do that more often.
CALVIN
Oh, yeah?
CONRAD
Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little,
you know. Get after me. The way you
used to for him.
CALVIN
Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You
were always so hard on yourself, I
never had the heart.
CONRAD
Oh, Dad. Don't.
CALVIN
No, it's the truth. I... I never
worried about you. I just wasn't
listening.
CONRAD
Well, I wasn't putting out many
signals then. I don't think you
could have done anything.

CALVIN
No, no, no, I should ...I should've
got a handle on it somehow.
CONRAD
You know, I used to figure you had
a handle for everything. You knew
it all.
Calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself.
CONRAD (cont'd)
I know that wasn't fair but you
always made us feel like everything
was gonna be all right. I thought
about that a lot lately. I really
admire you for it.
Calvin is moved.
CALVIN
Well, don't admire people too much.
They'll disappoint you sometimes.
CONRAD
I'm not disappointed.
I love you.
Calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms.
CALVIN
I love you too.
They hug each other.
