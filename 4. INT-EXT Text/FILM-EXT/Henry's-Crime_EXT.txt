Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,
abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.
The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest
salt-box houses.
Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.
2.
Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL
UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
GUYS sit in the back of the car.
Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
friend is JOE.
EDDIE
Henry Torne.
HENRY
Eddie Vibes.
EDDIE
So how you doin', man?
HENRY
I'm okay. What's going on?
EDDIE
Listen, I got a man down here.
5.
Eddie glances up and down the street.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Mind if we come in for a second?
The car turns a corner on to Main Street.
EDDIE
Pull up right over here. We gotta grab
some beer money at that ATM.
The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST
BUFFALO BANK.
Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.
7.
After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
his sleeve.
BEHIND HIM
In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
guys slipping on SKI MASKS...
HENRY'S POV
A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
store and enters. He says good morning to all the
animals. It's a strange one man show.
LOUD ALARMS BLARE --
Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming
FROM :
THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS
Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
GUARD chases them.
ON HENRY, confused.
A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :
FRANK (O.S.)
You!
Henry turns forward again.
A GUN
Is pointing at him through the windshield.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Freeze!
Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
Holding on Henry's stunned expression...
Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.
MAX
But here's the good news. We got all this
time to do. And time is a medium of
exchange. You can buy things with it.
(MORE)
12.
MAX (CONT'D)
Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And
in your case, you can figure out what
your dream is.
Max takes his arm :
MAX (CONT'D)
Your dream is your truth is your destiny.
Henry looks at him.
HENRY
I told you. I'm here by mistake.
Max shoots a look back at him.
MAX
There are no mistakes.
Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.
HENRY
What?
Several convicts are making their way towards them...
He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :
MAX
But you're going to have to fight for
that dream, Henry.
HENRY
I am.
MAX
You're at a crossroads now. There are
going to be tests!
HENRY
What tests?
CRAACK!
Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab
him, throw him to the ground next to Max.
MAX
This is your moment. Whatever you do now
defines you. Go get em!
Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging,
taking several down. He gives it everything he's got.
They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps
fighting...but it's hopeless.
GUARDS rush in. Max watches.
13.
Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just
happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty.
Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a
hand around his shoulder.
MAX
I ever tell you I was married?
Henry turns to him.
15.
MAX (CONT'D)
I mean nearly. I had a lovely
correspondence going with Jocelyn
Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she
finally came on visitor's day she said I
was too short.
Henry thinks.
HENRY
Books and covers.
MAX
Right. Books and covers.
CUT TO:
TWO YEARS LATER
It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the
prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's
cold. We see his exhale.
He starts to walk.
20.
Henry turns onto his old street.
Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before
ringing the bell. A beat.
The door opens. It's --
JOE
The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a
suit and tie now.
JOE
Henry. How you doing?
HENRY
Hey.
JOE
(CALLING OUT)
Debbie! Henry's here.
(TO HENRY)
Come on in. Make yourself at home.
HENRY
Thanks.
Henry walks down the street with his box.
A NEIGHBOR approaches, recognizes him.
NEIGHBOR
Henry! How are you?
Henry looks over.
HENRY
I'm good. How are you?
NEIGHBOR
Great. How was Greece?
HENRY
Greece?
NEIGHBOR
Debbie told us all about your trip.
A beat.
HENRY
I was in prison.
NEIGHBOR
In Greece?
A grass field. It's raining.
Henry steps into frame with a SHOVEL. Behind him an OLDER
MAN in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow.
IN THE DITCH - LATER
From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs. He's a few feet
down. The wheelbarrowman still watches silently.
25.
It's snowing. The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as
Henry digs another small ditch.
A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch.
Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's
hand.
He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower
poking through the dirt.
HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :
THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK
Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he
contemplates the place...
Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.
There's something happening, he's not sure what it
is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each
passing moment becomes more like a knowing....
A moment of revelation.
He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,
heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the
SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --
SCREEEECH!
A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down.
A GIRL (30s)
Rushes out of the car.
JULIE
What are you doing? What the fuck are you
doing? Are you okay?
(into cell phone)
Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran
someone over. No, he looks okay.
27.
She hangs up.
JULIE (CONT'D)
You idiot, you weren't even looking where
you were going! Are you okay?
Henry's a little delirious.
HENRY
I think I'm okay.
He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.
JULIE
No. Stay on the ground.
The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.
FRANK
Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an
ambulance.
HENRY
No, don't.
(Starts to stand)
I think I'm okay.
FRANK
(RECOGNIZING HIM)
You!
HENRY
(RECOGNIZING HIM)
Yeah. Me.
JULIE
(to Frank, confused)
Is he alright?
FRANK
Are you alright?
HENRY
Yeah. Fine.
JULIE
He just walked right out into the street.
He came out of nowhere.
FRANK
I saw the whole thing. You were on the
phone. You weren't even paying attention.
JULIE
Yes. I was. I know how to drive.
Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the
sidewalk.
28.
JULIE (CONT'D)
What are you doing? Get back on the
ground!
FRANK
Park your car. I'm going to take him into
that cafe.
She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side.
Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.
FRANK (CONT'D)
They let you out, huh.
HENRY
Yeah.
FRANK
Let's get you a seat in here.
Henry comes out. Stares at the bank across the street.
Looks both ways and then crosses the road.
Henry stands in the back alley behind the bank, feeling
the place out...his head turns between the back door of
the bank and the back of the building opposite...then
looks down at his feet.
He looks up again, notices the :
`BACKSTAGE DOOR'
31.
He goes over to it. It's locked.
Henry stares at the bank again...then walks down Mecca
Road glimpses the marquee of `THE ORPHEUM' theatre.
DAREK MILLODRAGOVIC's `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' by Anton
CHEKHOV
OPENS NOVEMBER 23
Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and
the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming
PRODUCTION:
Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry-
shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it,
including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as
Madame Ranevsky.
A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk
of the cherry tree with bloody roots.
Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre
door.
This one's open.
Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the
traffic. Henry follows.
HENRY
Is it always like that?
JULIE
What?
HENRY
(gesturing back to the
THEATRE)
That.
JULIE
You mean rehearsal?
HENRY
Yeah.
JULIE
It's a process.
HENRY
Looks complicated.
JULIE
It's all pain.
(THEN)
Chekhov, right?
They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :
HENRY
I thought you were listening.
She looks at him, curiously.
HENRY (CONT'D)
I'm Henry by the way.
38.
JULIE
Julie.
The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny
figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small
black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s.
42.
Max looks a little less sure of himself.
HENRY
Appears. Smiling.
HENRY
I knew you could do it.
Max looks around nervously.
MAX
Where's the car?
HENRY
I don't have a car.
MAX
You don't have a car? What's wrong with
you? You came to pick me up without a
car. That's not picking a person up.
HENRY
Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.
MAX
I don't know about this. Maybe this is a
mistake.
Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to
POUND on them.
MAX (CONT'D)
Dave! Carl!
HENRY
Max, it's okay. You're free.
MAX
Open up! DAVE!
No response.
Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.
HENRY
Come on, Max.
MAX
I don't like this.
HENRY
Take it easy. There's nothing to be
frightened of. I promise. You're okay.
The bus station's just a short walk.
Max starts to hyperventilate :
43.
MAX
I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe...
Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...
HENRY
You're going to be alright.
MAX
(nearly on his knees)
I'm going to die right here. I told you!
HENRY
Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus.
Henry helps Max back up again.
A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside.
As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the
other side.
MAX
What is this obsession with coffee,
Henry? When did that happen?
HENRY
I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give
people a lot of purpose.
They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.
MAX AND HENRY stand in the alley. Henry touches the back
of the bank wall.
HENRY
The vault is here.
He walks across the alley...
HENRY (CONT'D)
The tunnel runs under here...
He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.
HENRY (CONT'D)
And ends up somewhere in there.
He turns to Max.
MAX
It's virtually robbing itself!
Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it
SWINGS open.
JULIE
Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov
shit!
48.
She storms out, punches the air, screams :
JULIE (CONT'D)
AHHHH!!
Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there.
HENRY
(rubbing his head)
Hi.
JULIE
Jesus. Henry?
She looks at Max.
HENRY
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.
MAX
Hiya.
JULIE
What are you doing here?
HENRY
Oh, we were, you know --
MAX
I was just showing Henry the place I used
to perform.
Henry shoots Max a look.
JULIE
Oh. What?
The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.
SIMON
That's lunch, Julie.
JULIE
Thank God.
MAX
Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel
stomach.
JULIE
You know Chekhov?
MAX
Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my
favorite Russian.
She laughs. Max approaches her.
49.
MAX (CONT'D)
Would you mind if we took a look around?
It's been over thirty years since I've
been inside.
She considers the request.
JULIE
Sure.
She gestures them inside.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Sure. Yeah. Come on in.
MAX
Thank you.
As Henry passes :
HENRY
How you doing?
JULIE
Great. I'm in hell.
A taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please
knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside.
SIMON
We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like
people in his dressing room.
Max and Henry exit the back stage doors.
MAX
You were right, Henry. You got a nose
like a bloodhound!
HENRY
You found it?
MAX
Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing
room.
HENRY
Who?
MAX
Lophakin. We find a way to get into his
dressing room and we're right as rain!
Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the
alley having a cigarette.
He glares at them as they pass...
Arnold opens the door with his key.
Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as
she approaches her car.
74.
JULIE
Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but
that's what's happening...
(SHE LISTENS)
I don't know, he's `thinking'...
She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the
ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window.
She looks up. It's MAX.
JULIE (CONT'D)
What?
He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Sorry, I can't give you a ride --
MAX
You said he was a natural.
JULIE
Stan. Let me call you back.
(she hangs up, to Max)
What?
MAX
Henry.
JULIE
Henry what?
MAX
Henry would be perfect for it.
JULIE
Perfect for what?
MAX
For Lophakin.
It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.
JULIE
You mean Henry should play Lophakin?
MAX
Yes.
She laughs.
JULIE
He's not even an actor!
MAX
Exactly. He'd be playing himself.
(off her shocked look)
Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.
(MORE)
75.
MAX (CONT'D)
A man who came from nothing. A man who's
not afraid to create a new life and put
his past behind him. A man who's in love
with you...Madame Ranevsky.
A beat. She does think about it.
JULIE
Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly
shifting under my feet?
MAX
Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin
needs a dressing room.
(BEAT)
Can you get him in to see Darek?
She hesitates...
JULIE
What's going on here, Max? What are you
doing?
MAX
Nothing.
She regards him. Suspiciously.
JULIE
You made this happen, didn't you?
MAX
Sometimes a good guy needs a less good
guy to help the good guy be good.
He smiles. A beat :
She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.
MAX (CONT'D)
Fair enough.
They just sit there for a moment...
JULIE
What am I supposed to do now?
MAX
He just needs a shot. One audition. Let
the chips fall where they may.
JULIE
What if it doesn't work?
MAX
They'll get someone else.
She thinks...
76.
MAX (CONT'D)
Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm
asking, Julie.
She thinks some more...
JULIE
Okay, confidence man.
It's cold out. Max and Henry walk inside.
Henry leaves Julie's apartment. There's snow on the
ground. It's freezing out here.
He starts to walk.
MAX (O.S.)
It's going to be incredible. I'm talking,
Florida...
Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car.
JOE
What do you think guys? If it's a boy do
I cut him or not?
MAX
Well, you know what they say, cleanliness
is next to Godliness.
JOE
What do you say, Henry?
Before he can answer :
92.
VOICE (O.S.)
I see you guys in the bank. I see you
guys in the alley next to the bank.
They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right
there. He's in his street clothes.
FRANK
Now I see you coming out of the theatre
behind the bank.
Frank sucks his teeth.
FRANK (CONT'D)
I know what you're up to Gentlemen.
Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves
closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.
FRANK (CONT'D)
And I want in.
MAX
In on what?
Frank snickers.
FRANK
We can't talk here. Let's drive.
Max looks at Henry.
MAX and HENRY walk up to the theatre. They've got
coffees. It's drizzling.
They both look up.
HENRY
Shit.
ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens
NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM"
HENRY (CONT'D)
Opening night.
MAX
And?
HENRY
That's soon.
MAX
We're going to have pull some nights.
Henry thinks...
HENRY
Maybe we should wait. Do it closing
night.
95.
Max turns.
MAX
We can't. He's retiring. This is a one
time deal.
(THEN)
I told you there were going to be tests,
Henry.
Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.
MAX (CONT'D)
You're going to have to leave her.
(BEAT)
No looking back.
CUT TO :
AN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled
inside.
A line at the box office. THEATERGOERS mill around,
waiting for friends or chatting, everyone anticipating a
great evening of theatre.
...pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank.
BERNIE and STAN jump out. Bernie knocks on the glass door.
BERNIE
How you doin', Frank?
He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back
of the truck.
Through the glass, Frank smiles.
FRANK
Doin' good, Bernie. Real good.
He sucks his teeth.
Max bursts out the back door of the theatre, his walk
turning into a run...
Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open
electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out,
reads it.
"YOU"
He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his
hands are trembling and he drops it...
Thirty feet to the ground.
CRACK!
MAX
Shit.
Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his
watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again.
Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire.
MAX
Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little
pischer?
He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :
103.
AS Max quickly attaches the CIRCUIT BYPASS WIRE...
Max CLIPS the bypass onto the other side of the wire and
the NUMBERS START TO COME UP.
Max looks at the screen. ALL THE NUMBERS MATCH. The red
light turns GREEN.
He sighs, relieved.
LOPHAKIN (O.S.)
I saw this excellent piece of theatre
yesterday. Really very funny.
104.
Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck.
STAN
Well this is it, Frank.
BERNIE
We got you something.
STAN
A little retirement gift.
Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift.
STAN (CONT'D)
Go ahead. Open it.
Frank does. It's a bag of coffee.
FRANK
Thanks guys.
BERNIE
We wanted to get you something from
France.
STAN
You like French Roast, right?
FRANK
Thanks.
(THEN)
You know this isn't from France.
BERNIE
What are you talking about? It's French
roast.
FRANK
Right. But over there they call it coffee.
STAN
(slightly baffled, at Bernie)
But this is French roast...
105.
Max pulls open the door, sweating, runs inside...
straight into Julie.
MAX
Julie -- Break a leg!
JULIE
Play's already started, Max.
She walks past him.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Good-bye confidence man.
MAX
Good-bye, Julie.
Max and Joe load the last of the duffels filled with cash
into the back of Joe's car...
They get inside. Joe starts the engine...
JOE
Where is he?
MAX
Any minute now.
Henry comes out the back door. Gets in the car.
MAX
How's the leg?
HENRY
It's fine. Go.
Joe guns it.
ON HENRY
Sitting in the back.
CUT TO :
...which become REAL BLOSSOMS on a CHERRY TREE, widening
to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever
seen.
A STONE FARM HOUSE
Frank sits at a table outside in the garden. He pours
himself a Pernod. He looks happy as a clam.
A CAT jumps in his lap, purring.
FRANK
Hello miou-miou.
He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.
CUT TO :
THE SOUND OF A CRYING BABY
We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters
a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR
GROOMING"
