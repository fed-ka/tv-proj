      EXT. PARK. DAY. (D1)11

      The guys play football with friends. NICK, SCHMIDT and WINSTON 
      are in a huddle. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Nick, go out ten yards, cut left. 
                    Winston, go long, post right.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL JESS is also in the huddle.

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    Jess, see if you can find a 
                    shamrock in the grass.

                                  JESS
                    Oh, ha, ha, very funny. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I know. Break!

      They LINE UP. Schmidt, as QB, calls out:

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    Hike!

      Schmidt drops back, throws to Nick, but the ball sails high 
      over his head. Exasperated, Nick throws his hands up.

                                  NICK
                    Schmidt!

                                  JESS (O.S.)
                    I got it!

      Just then, Jess flies INTO FRAME and collides with Nick, 
      hard. Nick lies writhing in pain. The gang surrounds him.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    Nick? Are you okay? 

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, I m--
                          (a beat, then:)
                    Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

                                  JESS
                    I ve never seen a man go down that 
                    fast.

      Nick is making his way to his car, in horrible pain. Jess, 
      Schmidt, and Winston follow him.

                                  JESS
                    Nick, stop. You re walking like 
                    Ghandi. Let me drive you to your 
                    doctor. 

                                  NICK
                    Jess, I don t have a doctor. I 
                    don t have insurance. 

                                    SCHMIDT 
                    Nick, I keep telling you: you re 
                    playing with fire. For a few bucks 
                    a day, you can make sure last

                                  JESS
                    I have a friend from high school 
                    who s a doctor- She can just look 
                    at you- she won t charge you.   

                                  NICK
                    No. I don t go to doctors. 

      EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND. FLASHBACK.33

      YOUNG NICK lies on the ground near second base, in pain. 

                                  NICK S FATHER (V.O.)
                    C mon, Nicky, rub some dirt on it!

      WE SEE the feet of NICK S FATHER as he rubs dirt on Nick. 

      INT. NICK S PARENTS  BATHROOM. FLASHBACK.44

      Through the frosted glass of his parents  shower, ADULT NICK 
      soaps himself and sings  Runaway Train.  

                                  NICK
                    Runaway train never going back/
                    Wrong way on a one way track...

      Suddenly, he slips and smashes against the glass before 
      tumbling into the tub. A beat as he yells in pain.    NEW GIRL  #109     "Injured"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      3.


                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Mom! Dad!

                                  NICK S FATHER (O.S.)
                          (then, from downstairs:)
                    Rub some dirt on it!

      BACK TO PRESENT:55

      Nick is getting into his car, growling with pain. 

                                  JESS
                    Should you be driving... 

                                  NICK
                    I m good! Totally good--

      The group watches, worried. He tries to adjust his seat. 
      Suddenly, the car lurches and speeds OUT OF FRAME. CRASH! 
      They rush to Nick s car, as he climbs out with much effort.

                        NICKWINSTON
      I m okay, I m okay -What did you do?  *

      REVEAL Nick has hit Winston s car: What used to be a nice, 
      low-level luxury car is now a beat-up car that was clearly a 
      disaster even before Nick hit it. Nick points to a tiny dent. 

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Winston, this is what I did.
                    The rest was already there. 
                    Actually, I think I undid a dent 
                    over here. Ow, ow, ow. 

                                  JESS 
                    Get in my car, Nick. You re going 
                    to see my friend.  

                                  NICK
                    Jess-- 

                                  JESS
                    Now! 

      INT. DOCTOR S OFFICE. WAITING ROOM. DAY. (D1)66

      Jess sits next to Nick in the waiting room. 

                                  JESS
                    She s squeezing us in between

                                  JESS (CONT'D)
                    Things you should know about Sadie: 
                    She s the smartest person I know, 
                    she s a lesbian, and she s quite an 
                      accomplished archer.

                                  NICK
                      Fantastic.

      Jess picks up a magazine as Nick looks around. Sees that the 
      other patients in the waiting room are FOUR HUGELY PREGNANT 
      WOMEN. Suspicious. He looks up to see the wall is covered in 
      framed Georgia O Keefe prints. Something dawns on him. 

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Jess. Is your friend a 
                      gynecologist?

                                  JESS
                    No.
                          (then)
                    She s an OB/GYN. But she s also an 
                      accomplished archer--

                                  NICK
                    I m out of here.  
                          (He stands, then)
                    Ow ow ow ow ow. 

      Nick tries to get up and leave, but he s forced back down 
      because of extreme pain. People turn and stare.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    I don t have a vagina, Jess--

      A SWEET OLDER WOMAN leans over, fed up with her vagina. 

                                  SWEET OLDER WOMAN
                          (rolling her eyes)
                    You can take mine! 

                                  JESS
                    I heard that, sister. 
                          (to Nick)
                      Everything is connected. The body 
                    is a miracle. And I m sorry that my 
                    only doctor-friend is a 
                      gynecologist, but you re broke and 
                    you re going to stop whining, shut 
                    up, and tag the things you want to 
                    buy in this  Lucky  Magazine.

      INT./EXT. AUTO MECHANIC GARAGE. LATER THAT DAY. (D1)77

      Winston watches SHERMAN, a mechanic, work on his car. Sherman 
      inspects something. Makes a face. Sherman inspects something 
      else. Makes a more concerned face. He walks towards Winston.

                                    SHERMAN
                    We re going to have to let it go. 

                                    WINSTON
                    No, no. That car s been through 
                      everything with me.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    You didn t even buy it. It was an 
                    illegal recruitment gift from a 
                    college you didn t even go to. 

                                    WINSTON
                    You don t get it. Things happened 
                    in that car.  

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Yeah? Did you drive through a two 
                    day long tornado? Because that s 
                    what it looks like.  

                                    WINSTON
                    Things happened.

88EXT. STREET. FLASHBACK. 

      Winston is sitting in a newer version of the car, eating a 
      burger. A HOT GIRL comes up to the car. 

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Is this your car?

                                    WINSTON
                    Yeah.

      She flashes Winston her boobs. Winston barely blinks. 

                                    WINSTON (CONT D)
                    Cool. Thanks.

      BACK TO GARAGE:99

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Come on, man. Get a new car.  

                                    WINSTON
                    You get a new car! 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No, I have a new car. Remember, you 
                    borrow it in the morning when yours 
                    makes this noise. 
                          (making a loud very 
                            annoying noise)
                      Aaaaaaaaa, reee, reee. 

                                    SHERMAN
                    Yeah, that s not a good sound.

                                    WINSTON
                    Give me the keys.

      Sherman reluctantly hands Winston his  keys : An unbent 
      paperclip with a duct tape handle. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Really?  Keys ? Because you 
                    should ve just said:  Sherman, give 
                    me the paperclip that I use to 
                    start my car--    

      Winston grabs the  key  and storms out. Schmidt follows him.  

      EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE GARAGE. SHORT TIME LATER.A9A9

      The car pulls out. Making the noises Schmidt was making.

      INT. GYNECOLOGIST OFFICE. EXAM ROOM. LATER. (D1)1010

      Jess sits on a chair in the exam room.

                                  JESS
                    Nick, you don t have to sit up 
                    there if you don t want to--

      REVEAL Nick is lying, belly down, on an exam table with his 
      legs up on the stirrups.

                                  JESS
                    Sadie, thanks for squeezing us in. 
                    This is my friend Nick.

      Nick tries to put out his hand to Sadie.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    We were playing football, and I

                    Look at those legs. Jess tackled a 
                    girl I was dating once--

                    Well, at least you have a little

                    a little back ache.

      Nick grimaces. But the pills are already in his mouth, so he 
      can t say anything. Sadie hands him the water and he drinks.

      reaches out and touches his neck.

                    fine.

                    going to freak him out- You re 
                    going to- Oh, dammit.

                    know if you re fine?

      Jess slides her phone over to him. Nick looks at the phone. 
      ON Nick s face. The first flash of worry: What if it s not 
      fine? 

      Cece walks up with her drink. She looks at all of them.

      Post-closing. The bar is empty except for our group, who 
      appear inebriated. Schmidt and Cece are cleaning up behind 
      the bar. Winston sits at the piano bench. Jess stands on a 
      chair, swaying slightly, performing as if on stage. 

      Nick sits in the same booth, totally zoned out. Depressed.

                    No. Take  em off. 

      Jess starts trying to take Nick s pants off. He pulls away. 

                                  NICK
                    Hey. I got it. I got it, Jess.

                    Aaaaaah!

      Suddenly, Nick begins running toward the beach. As he runs, 
      he begins stripping off his clothes. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    What the hell is happening?

                    I m a little drunk, and I can t be 
                    sure, but I think you re finally 
                    gonna get to see your best friend s 
                    penis. 

      Schmidt starts running after him.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Hey wait! Wait! Wait up, man! 

      But Schmidt can t catch up. 

2121We re ON NICK, as he throws his pants over his shoulder and 
      runs toward the water, naked.

                          (very happy, as he runs)

                    Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! 
                    That was so so dumb! It s so cold!

                    will never come up with the words 
                    to describe how much this hurts! 

      He clambers out and scrambles for his clothes. The gang all 
      run down the beach to join Nick. 

                                  JESS
                    Nick! Are you okay?

                    I m- I m-- 

      Finally, the reality of the everything hits him and he can no 
      longer hold back. 

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                          (losing it)
                    No, I m not okay! I got out of bed 
                    this morning to go play a friendly 
                    game of touch football and then I 
                    went to see a gynecologist and now 
                    I might have cancer and I m not 
                    okay! 

      Nick crosses away and sits down facing the ocean. Finally:

                    I know this is the wrong time to 
                    say this. But do you think he s 
                    gonna do that again so I can get a 
                    better look?

      They all glare at him, then Winston crosses over to Nick, 
      takes off his jacket and drapes it over Nick s shoulders. He 
      crosses back to the group. 

                                    WINSTON
                    Leave him alone for a sec.

      Cece, Schmidt and Jess are asleep on the beach. Nick is not. 
      He sits as before, clearly having spent the night awake. 

      ON WINSTON, asleep in the driver s seat of his car. He stirs, 
      then wakes up to the bright sun. He looks at the clock on his 
      dash, then yells out the window to the group:

      ON THE GROUP as they stir awake, then realize it is morning.  
      Schmidt and Cece get up and gather their things. As Cece 
      rushes to the car, Schmidt looks down and sees her perfect 
      butt print. He starts to comment, thinks better of it and 
      follows her to the car.

                    Just come on!

      They move to the car, where Schmidt faces off with Winston.

                    before it leaks through. Get in the 
                    damn car. 

      They all pile into the car. Winston starts it up and it jerks 
      and sputters away. The back bumper falls off as they chug up 
      the road.

      Winston s car barely makes it up the drive and practically 
      collapses into a parking spot. Everyone gets out and runs 
      into the hospital. As Winston follows, his car continues to 
      jerk, sputter and cough even though the keys are out of the 
      ignition. Finally, it just dies. Winston looks back 
      concerned, but there s no time to deal with this now. He 
      follows the gang into the hospital.

      Cece rolls her eyes. Jess looks nervous. Winston squeezes her 
      arm. Finally, Nick EMERGES. They all look at him expectantly.

      He can t handle it and grabs Nick once again to kiss him 
        Fredo-style. Nick throws him off.

      Nick crosses back to the window and pulls out his sandwich 
      bag/wallet. He fishes for his license and debit card.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    I have a three hundred dollar limit 
                    on this card, but--

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    It s already taken care of.

                                  NICK
                    What?

      He stops and turns to the group. 

                                  JESS
                    We split it.

                                  NICK
                    I ll- I ll pay you--

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Just get some health insurance. 
                    It s not cute anymore.  

                                    WINSTON
                    And get a wallet.

      EXT. HOSPITAL. MOMENTS LATER. (D2)2828

      Over music: A much relieved group pours out of the hospital 
      and piles into Winston s car.    NEW GIRL  #109     "Injured"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      30.


      INT. WINSTON S CAR. CONTINUOUS2929

      Nick slides in next to Jess in the backseat. Silence, then:

                                  NICK
                    What happened last night?

      Jess gets Nick s phone out of his pocket. 

                                  JESS
                    Call her. 

      Winston turns the key, but the car won t turn over. He tries 
      again. Nothing. Everyone looks at each other, then one by 
      one, they get out of the car.

      EXT. MEDICAL PLAZA. CONTINUOUS. (D2)3030

      Everyone but Winston gets out of the car and begins walking 
      away as Winston tries desperately to get it started. He gets 
      out of the car as if he s about to push-start it again. Lays 
      his hands on the trunk. Stops for a beat, then lets go. It s 
      over. Schmidt pats him on the back. Winston nods.

      He goes to the front of the car, yanks off the front license 
      plate with all of his might, takes one final look at his 
      past, then runs to catch up with his friends.  

      As they all walk off together, we see Nick talking into his 
      phone. 

                                  NICK
                          (into phone)
                    Hi Julia? It s Nick. Which Nick? Uh-
                    oh. Nick Miller. Oh, no, I knew you 
                    were kidding.... 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      END OF SHOW.
