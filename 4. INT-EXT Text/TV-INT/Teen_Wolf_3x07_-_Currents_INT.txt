      TWO HANDS press down on blood-stained gauze. Gently, Melissa 
      McCall places her own hands over those of a frightened 
      PATIENT.

                    Keep pressure on it. The Doctor s 
                    on her way.

      The Patient nods and an Orderly wheels him out of the crowded 
      reception and down the corridor.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    Does anyone know where the hell Dr. 
                    Hilyard is?

      The sound of the double doors opening turns her head, but 
      it s just Scott walking in with a plastic-wrapped container.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    Oh, thank God, I m starving.

      Melissa grabs the bag out of his hands and hurries around the 
      reception counter to unwrap it.

                    Sorry, sorry.

      Rushing back around, she kisses him on the cheek.

      An ACCIDENT VICTIM clutching her stomach reaches out to 
      Melissa.

                    Miss? Excuse me? I could really use 
                    something for the pain.

                    I know and I m sorry, but giving 
                    you something could actually 
                      complicate things. We really need

                    Ten minutes.

      Doors pushing open, TWO PARAMEDICS pull in another victim, 
      head in a neck brace. Stepping out of the way, Scott takes a 
      seat next to the miserable Accident Victim.

                                  SCOTT
                    You know, I think I read online 
                    sometimes just a little human 
                    contact can help with pain.

      The Victim can barely respond with a nod. Glancing about to 
      see no one is watching, Scott places his hand on her forearm. 
      BLACK VEINS ripple underneath the skin of Scott s hand. 

      The Accident Victim draws a quick breath. But then relaxes, 
      all of the tension fading. She looks at him, astonished as--

      THE DOORS CLANG OPEN. Arm around Danny, struggling to keep 
      him on his feet, Ethan looks up.

                    Let Melissa know it may be more 
                    than ten minutes. I think there s 
                    an accident up ahead.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                    Yeah, a ten car pile-up which is 
                    why we need you here.

      Hilyard tries to cut into another lane and gets a LOUD HORN 
      BEEP for her efforts. 

                                  DR. HILYARD
                    Oh come on, I m a doctor!

      She brakes HARD, spinning the wheel back as--


      Melissa guides Danny to a seat with Ethan and Scott s help.

                                  SCOTT
                    What did you do to him?

                                  ETHAN
                    Nothing. He said he was having 
                    chest pains and trouble breathing. 
                    But it just kept getting worse--

      Danny can barely hold his head up as Melissa looks him over.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    What is it? Is he dying?

                    The two of you, back off.

      Her voice sends them both retreating a step. Turning her 
      attention back to Danny, she feels at the side of his neck.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)

                    I think it s a tension

                          (calling out)
                    Can we get a gurney over here--

      Lurching forward, Danny crumbles to his knees on the floor. 
      They move to help, but his head reels back and he opens his 
      mouth wide to vomit.

      A VISCOUS WHITE FLUID pours from Danny s mouth. 

      Scott, Ethan and Melissa retreat in horror while Danny 
      wretches violently, tendons pushing out from his neck.

      Scott spots SMALL ROUND OBJECTS within the discharge. He 
      recognizes the tell-tale white berries immediately. 
      Surprisingly, so does Ethan--

      Strangling the steering wheel in frustration, Dr. Hilyard 
      veers her way through traffic. Out of the haze of headlights, 
      SOMETHING flutters against the windshield, landing on it.

      A MOTH.

      Strangely large and right in Hilyard s field of view, the 
      creature doesn t seem to want to move. Hilyard flicks on the 
      wipers and the moth flutters back into the darkness.

      She eases back, not noticing ANOTHER MOTH crawling its way 
      through one of the vents.


      Following the gurney carrying Danny into the trauma room, 
      Melissa notices Scott and Ethan at her heels.

      She waves a hand at the moth, not realizing she s also 
      pulling the steering wheel with her other hand.

      A HORN BLARES, HEADLIGHTS blazing across the windshield. 
      Hilyard swerves the car back into her own lane.

      A THIRD MOTH crawls out of one of the vents. Another flitters 
      up from behind the backseat. Hilyard waves at them, trying to 
      keep her eyes on the road.

      In mere moments, DOZENS OF MOTHS fill the car, blocking 
      Hilyard s view. They surround her, flying about her head. 
      Blinking furiously, she looks into the REAR VIEW MIRROR and 
      sees--

        A horrifying ashen FACE, scarred and slashed, features 
      literally ripped apart. The Darach.

      Hilyard SCREAMS and the wheel slips from her hands.


      Fingers trembling, Melissa presses lightly over Danny s upper 
      chest, trying to find the right injection spot.

                    I know, I know.

      Taking a breath of her own, she turns the large needle up and 
      inserts the point into Danny s chest. 

      Scott s eyes widen as the needle goes in and keeps going. Air 
      bubbles up in the fluid inside the syringe as Melissa 
      aspirates Danny s lung. Body finally relaxing, he begins to 
      breathe normally. Then blinks up at Melissa in relief.

      A BEEPING goes off. Derek jumps to his feet in the darkness. 
      Cora rushes to his side, both looking at the ALARM. 

      Derek hits the button, silencing it, and looks about. Nothing

                    for a more qualified substitute to 
                    take over. So, let s get started...

      As she begins flipping pages in the book, Stiles leans over 
      his desk to whisper to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    My Dad said the ER Attending wasn t 
                      strangled. But they re saying he 
                    did die of asphyxiation. They just 
                    don t know how.

                                  SCOTT
                    You think the On-Call doctor could 
                    still be alive?

                                  STILES
                    I don t know. But there s twenty 
                    other doctors at the hospital. Any 
                    one of them could be next.

      Scott s phone BUZZES. The ID on the display: DEATON. Sliding 
      down in his seat to be inconspicuous, Scott answers the 
      phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey, I m in the middle of class. 
                    Can I call you back?

                                  DEATON (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, no...


      Phone to his ear, Deaton speaks calmly but with a noticeable 
        undercurrent of tension.

                                  DEATON
                      I honestly thought I might never 
                    have to burden you like this. But, 
                    at the moment, I m afraid you re my 
                    only hope.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1313.

      He opens his hand. A single dead MOTH lies in his palm.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    I m going to be taken.


      Breath caught, Scott sits up in his seat.

                                  DEATON (V.O.)
                    I need you to find me--

                                  SCOTT
                    What s happening? Doc?

      But the line goes dead, a DIAL TONE blaring back at him.


      Lowering his phone, Deaton turns around to face the high 
      windows of the clinic where moths flutter against the glass, 
      blocking out the sun.

      Hundreds of moths. Possibly thousands.

      FADE IN:


      The Physics classroom door bursts open into a crowded 
      corridor. Scott hurtles out with Stiles trying to catch up. 
      Allison turns from her locker, noticing them.

                                    ALLISON
                    Stiles, what s going on?

                                  STILES
                    It s Scott s boss--Deaton.

      She watches them race off as a bewildered Jennifer steps out.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I have to admit the number of 
                    students recently bolting out of my 
                    class is starting to make me 
                    question my teaching ability.

      Allison gives a polite smile and shuts her locker with a 
      METALLIC CLANG.


      STEEL DOOR sliding open, Isaac and Boyd step into the eerily 
      quiet loft. Derek s voice rises from the shadows.

                                  DEREK (O.S.)
                    Go back to school.

                    I have a migraine. Boyd has 
                    explosive diarrhea.

      Sitting on the steps of the spiral staircase, Derek tries 
      hard not to smile. But loses the battle. He steps down to 
      meet them.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1315.

                          (off Boyd s look)
                    He came up with a plan.

      Setting his bag down, Boyd kneels to unzip it.

                                  BOYD
                    I thought about the time Gerard had 
                    me and Erica tied up, hooked to 
                    wires that were pushing electrical 
                    currents through us. So I wondered 
                    how we could do something like 
                    that, but on a bigger scale.

      Derek reaches into the bag and pulls out a COIL OF WIRE.

                                  DEREK
                    What kind of plan is this?

                                  BOYD
                    Actually, I d call it more of a 
                    trap.


      Door swinging open, Scott rushes inside the Clinic. He stops 
      when Stilinski and Deputy Graeme turn around.

                                  SCOTT
                    How did you know?

                                  STILINSKI
                    Stiles called me right after you 
                    left school. And I m sorry, but 
                    your boss s car is still here and 
                    the back door was wide open.

      Scott takes a step back and without even seeming to realize 
      it, he sits down in one of the waiting room chairs. Almost 
      like he s pushed down.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1316.

                      everything.


      Moving quickly, Boyd unravels a hose and drops the open end 
      onto the floor of the loft. Water begins pouring out at Derek 
      and Isaac s feet.

                                  BOYD
                    In a pool of electrified water, it 
                    can take only fifty milliamps to 
                    kill a normal human. Less power 
                    than it takes to turn on a light 
                    bulb.

                                  DEREK
                    That s comforting.

                    keep coming. And anyone who steps 
                    foot in here gets a pretty shocking

      Derek peers up at them with the beginnings of a smile.


      While his Deputies scour the clinic for clues, Stilinski 
      tries to comfort Scott with Stiles now by his side.

                                  STILINSKI
                    All right, we re going to do

      He puts a hand on Scott s shoulder, giving it a comforting 
      squeeze and then steps out to the waiting area. Scott throws 
      Stiles a look, gesturing for him to follow into the cage room 
      where they ll be out of earshot.

      moves to kiss her. But she takes his chin, turning his cheek, 
      her lips brushing lightly against his neck as--

      Rolling his eyes, Aiden pulls his shirt back on and 
      cautiously slips out the door to join the other students 
      filing out of the school. Lydia waits a moment. Then, just as

                    No. How did you know that?

                    I need you to look at the other 
                    body with me. I think I know how 
                    they both died. And I think maybe 
                    it could help find Scott s boss.


      Under the still BLEATING ALARM, Lydia tries to step around 
      Cora, but the girl blocks her from the door.

                                  LYDIA
                    Problem?

                                  CORA
                    Yeah. Derek would like to kindly 
                    ask you to not see Aiden anymore. 
                    Which means the next time I catch 
                    you with him, I m not going to pull 
                    a fire alarm. I m going to pull 
                    your tongue out of your head.

                                  LYDIA
                    Listen, sweetheart, my last 
                    boyfriend was a homicidal lizard. I 
                    think I can handle a werewolf.

      The ALARM stops. But Cora doesn t move. Lydia raises her hand 
      to physically move her. But Cora s own hand snaps out 
      lightning quick to grab her by the wrist.

                    Let go.

      Stiles steps through on the locker room side of the office. 
      Noting his dead serious look, Cora finally releases Lydia.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1322.



      Weaving through the crowded corridor, Scott s phone buzzes 
      with a text from Stiles: Found her.

      Scott begins thumbing a reply when a SOUND drifts toward him. 
      A familiar TAPPING. Fingers paused over his phone, he slowly 
      looks up as the rhythmic tapping becomes louder and louder.

      Slipping the phone back into his pocket, Scott starts 
      forward, following the TAPPING along the corridor.


      In the empty classroom, Stiles opens a BOX on one of the 
      tables in front of Cora and Lydia. Peering inside, Lydia 
      removes a PLANCHETTE from the box as Stiles unfolds a tell-
      tale board with letters and numbers on it.

                    it s worth a shot.

                    Will you just try? This is for 
                    Scott s boss. The guy who s saved 
                    our collective asses more than 
                    once.

      He sets the planchette in the middle of the board.

                                  CORA
                    All of us?

      Stiles nods. They each gently place their fingers on the edge 
      of the planchette.

                                  STILES
                    Ready? Okay... Where is Dr. Deaton?

      They wait. Each of them peering down at the planchette, 
      focusing on it. Lydia purses her lips, bored. Then notices 
      both Cora and Stiles watching her.

                                  LYDIA

                    we were asking some sort of spirit?

                    yes, I could subconsciously answer

      Tilting his head, Scott focuses in on the TAPPING, trying to 
      determine its source. He turns down the adjacent corridor, 
      moving more and more quickly, heading for the music room.


      The doors push open and Scott steps in. Sitting on the piano 
      bench, Deucalion taps his cane against the floor.

                    you ve set the tempo. Whether it s

      Stepping away from the piano, Deucalion turns his ear to

                    something to do with Deaton s 
                      disappearance? Maybe I can make the 
                    blind man talk.

      Scott tries not to let the anger show, but it s there in his 
      clenched jaw, fingers drawing into fists.

      Scott CHARGES right at him. Deucalion responds with 
      extraordinary speed. Whipping the cane about, he SWATS 
      Scott s CLAWED HAND down.

      As Deucalion whirls around, Scott flips forward, lashing out. 
      Deucalion wields the cane like a rapier, blocking and 
      parrying each blow, even swiping out at Scott s legs.

      With more skill than he s ever shown, Scott keeps landing on 
      his feet, keeps returning to fight. Until Deucalion yanks the 
      tip off the cane, revealing its BLADE.

      Scott rushes forward, but Deucalion plunges the cane through 
      his shoulder and then whips it back out just as quickly.                   TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1326.

                    So Deaton is somewhere right now 
                    hanging by his wrists?


      A soft light falls on Deaton s face as he slowly gazes up.

                                  STILINSKI (V.O.)
                    When he no longer has the strength 
                    to pull himself up to catch a 
                    breath, how long before he dies?

      Eyes wide with fear, Deaton pulls in a desperate gasp of air.

      FADE IN:


      The BELL RINGS and students pour out of classrooms for the 
      end of the day. Normal teenagers rushing out, a contrast to 
      Scott, Stiles, Cora and Lydia who hurry down the corridor 
      with far weightier concerns.

                                  CORA
                    But isn t Danny still at the 
                    hospital?

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, and that s where we re going.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ll meet you there.

                                  STILES
                    What? Why?

      Scott holds up his phone. On the display is a text from 
      Allison: I think I found something.


      With Derek and Isaac perched above the now water-drenched 
      floor, Boyd finishes tying off a wire. Kneeling from his own 
      position on the elevated steps, he slowly reaches out--

                                  DEREK
                    Woah, what are you doing?

                                  BOYD
                    You can test to see if water is 
                      electrified with the back of your 
                    hand. If there s a current, it ll 
                    kick your hand up. Do it with the 
                    front, the muscles clench and your 
                    hand goes under.

      He turns his hand and touches it to the surface of the water. 
      SPARKS and BLUE LIGHT fly up as Boyd s hand snaps back.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                          (through his teeth)

      Boyd gazes down at the water for a long moment.

                                  BOYD
                    I hope so.


      The door to Allison s bedroom swings open and Scott quickly 
      follows her inside.

                                    ALLISON
                    So I was looking through one of the 
                    drawers in his desk when I found 
                    this...

      She holds up an object that looks like a small light stick. 
      But then pauses, hearing a DOOR CLICK OPEN.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    He wasn t supposed to be back yet.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do I do? Where do I go?

      Grabbing him, she pulls him back and into her closet.

                                  ARGENT (O.S.)
                    Allison? You home?

      In the darkness, she clicks on the object she found in her 
      father s desk. A BLACKLIGHT. Under its purple glow, she puts 
      a finger to her lips, then clicks the light back off.


      Standing by his desk, Argent listens to the quiet. His 
      fingers delicately brush the map on his desk. Looking as if 
      he might sit down. But then, he steps out.


      Pressed tightly together in her closet, Scott and Allison try 
      to keep quiet while listening for Argent.

                                    ALLISON
                            (whispering)
                    What are you doing?

                                  SCOTT
                    Nothing.

                                    ALLISON

                    Oh. Sorry.

                                    ALLISON
                    Stop.

                                  SCOTT
                    I kind of don t have control of 
                    that.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay... um... I ll turn around.

      As quietly as she can, Allison turns around, her back now 
      pressed against Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison?

                                    ALLISON
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    That s worse.

      Allison tries not to smile. Then tries not to laugh. Scott 
      starts to smile as well as she turns to him. But then, in the 
      darkness, she peers into his eyes and the smile fades. Scott 
      stares back at her, their faces so close a kiss almost seems 
      inevitable.

      Allison s elbow brushes against wood hangers causing them to 
      CLATTER.

                                  ARGENT (O.S.)
                    Allison? Is that you?

      They both keep still, listening to Argent step into the room. 
      After a few tense seconds, they hear his FOOTSTEPS receding, 
      moving back down the hallway. The sound of a door SHUTTING.


      Allison leads Scott into the office, voice kept to a low 
      whisper as she shows him the map of Beacon Hills on the desk.

                                    ALLISON
                    See this map? Last time we were 
                    talking in here, my dad put a book 
                    down over it. There was something 
                    about the way he did it. Like he 
                    was trying to cover it.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1332.

                    I don t see anything.

                                    ALLISON
                    You can t. Until you use this.

      She clicks on the black light and waves it across the map to 
      show dozens of secret MARKINGS all over it.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    He s been tracking and marking 
                      everything. Boyd and Cora at the 
                    bank. The Alphas above us in the 
                      penthouse. All of the bodies...

      Allison guides the light toward each location.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    He s got a symbol for all the 
                    places where someone was taken. 
                    Then a different mark for where 
                    their body was found. See?

      She traces a line from Kyle s kidnapping at the Animal Clinic 
      to the woods where they stumbled upon his body.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Now here s the scary part. There s 
                    been six sacrifices so far, right? 
                    This map has markings for twelve.

      She points the black light at several other markings.

                                  SCOTT
                    What does that mean? Did your dad 
                    find other bodies and not tell 
                    anyone?

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think so. I think he knows 
                    where the bodies are going to be 
                    found. And one of these other six 
                      locations--one of these is where 
                    Deaton s body could end up. It 
                    doesn t tell us where he s being 
                    kept right now--

                                  SCOTT
                    But it s close to figuring it out.

      Scott pulls out his phone to take a picture of the map. But 
      the SHUTTER SOUND makes them both freeze. FOOTSTEPS pound 
      toward them.                   TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1333.

      Argent looks into the office. It s empty. He turns and--


      Peering into Allison s room, Argent finds her on the bed  
      innocently looking over homework while eating from a pack of 
      candy.

                                  ARGENT
                    Hey. I didn t hear you come in.

                                    ALLISON
                    Just doing some homework.

      She glances past him where, in the hallway, Scott stealthily 
      sneaks past.


      The door to a darkened hospital room CREAKS open. Slipping 
      inside, Stiles quietly shuts it and sneaks over to the bed 
      where Danny lies.

                                  STILES
                    Danny? Danny, you awake?

      Stiles taps him on the shoulder. Then gently slaps him on the 
      cheek. Then slaps a little harder. Then even harder--

                                  DANNY
                    Ow.

      Stiles jumps back, nearly toppling a chair. He holds still. 
      But Danny doesn t move, clearly sedated.

      Stiles notices a SCHOOL BAG on the chair. Eyes on Danny, he 
      carefully unzips the bag and rifles through the contents. 
      School books, homework, pages and pages of notes.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)

                    What are you doing?

      Stiles freezes, pages gripped in his hands. He stares back at 
      Danny s glazed look, eyes half open.

                                  STILES
                    Go back to sleep, Danny. This is

                    Why would I dream you going through

                    Danny, shut up and go back to 
                    sleep.

      Danny closes his eyes again. Stiles returns his attention to 
      the pages, beginning to read. He slowly brings one page 
      closer, eyes scanning the words. Reading faster and faster.

                                  STILES (CONT D)

      A POUNDING comes from the sliding door. Isaac and Boyd 
      retreat to Derek s sides. They hear STEEL bending and tearing 
      as someone tries to break through. 

      Wrenching free of its lock, the door slides back. RED EYES 
      GLOW from the pitch black. The slender and shapely silhouette 
      of Kali steps forward.

                                  KALI
                    I m going to be honest, Derek. When 
                    Ennis died, I thought to myself I 
                    would just go for it. Find you and 
                    kill you wherever you stood. Then I 
                      remembered how you surround 
                    yourself with these teenagers. 
                    Hiding behind them. And I thought 
                    what s a girl got to do to get you 
                    alone? That s when I found out that

      Ethan and Aiden step out from behind her, dragging Jennifer 
      Blake by the arms. She looks about in rising terror, gaze 
      falling in shock on the transformed features of Derek.

                    apart. What do you say? Think you 
                    can beat me one-on-one?

      Derek steps forward, eyes surging with a defiant GLOW.

                                  DEREK
                    I m going to rip your throat out.

      Kali bares her own fangs and in the darkness, they charge 
      each other, claws slashing.

      telling how long he s been there. But then, as if making a

      down the corridor.


      Under the examining room s overhead light, Cora and Lydia 
      watch Stiles gather Danny s work on the steel table.

                    Got it.

      Rushing in, Scott places PRINT OUTS on the steel table, 
      rebuilding the blacklight photo of the Beacon Hills map.

                                  CORA
                    Okay, how does this kid s homework 
                    have anything to do with finding 
                    Deaton? 

                                  STILES
                    Because it s not just homework. 
                    It s a project on geo-magnetic 
                    fields. They flow through the earth 
                    and can even be affected by lunar 
                    phases. Look at this. It s a note 
                    from Harris on Danny s proposal.

      Stiles shows them Danny s proposal page where teacher s notes 
      have been written in RED. Lydia reads it aloud.

                    Danny, I strongly advise you to 
                    choose another subject. The ideas 
                    here, while innovative and 
                      thoughtful, border on 
                      pseudoscience. Not suitable for

                    Harris wasn t just a sacrifice. He 
                    knew something.

                    Danny marked the telluric currents. 
                    And the weird thing about Beacon 
                    Hills is that it literally is a 
                    beacon. There s tons of energy 
                    surging through the earth around 
                    this town.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, look. They match.

      All eyes focus on the two maps. Scott grabs a BLACK MARKER. 
      Using the symbols on Argent s map, he puts down marks on 
      Danny s map.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    There s three places, right? The 
                    place where they re first 
                      kidnapped.

      Scott marks Kyle s disappearance at the Animal Clinic.

                    The place where their bodies are 
                    found.

      He marks the appearance of Kyle s body in the woods near the 
      school.

                                  LYDIA
                    It s right on the telluric current.

                                  SCOTT
                    So maybe the place where he was 
                      sacrificed is somewhere in between.

                                  STILES
                    Let me see that.

      Stiles takes the marker from Scott.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    You said there s six more bodies to 
                    be found. Deaton s one of them.

      Stiles quickly marks them on the map. The last one falls on a 
      telluric current that leads back to the Animal Clinic.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    He has to be somewhere in-between,

                    Stop.

      Stiles pauses. Cora puts her hand over his and guides it back 
      to a landmark titled BEACON HILLS FIRST NATIONAL.

                                  CORA (CONT D)
                    He s in the vault. The same vault.


      Bound and hanging by his wrists, Deaton struggles to raise 
      his body up. His fingers wrap around the rope, trying to grip 
      it. Muscles straining, he finally manages to get a hold on 
      the rope and-- 

      His hands slip, body weight yanking him back down. Gasping in 
      PAIN and struggling to breathe, Deaton s eyes flutter closed.


      Grabbing his helmet, Scott hurries for the door with the 
      others behind him. All except for Cora.

                                  LYDIA
                    Guys, hold on.

                    Lydia, we don t have time--

      But he stops short when he sees Cora looking at her phone 
      with a troubled expression.

                                  CORA
                    It s from Boyd. His plan didn t 
                    work. They cut the power.

      Scott lowers the helmet. 

                                  SCOTT
                          (a whisper to himself)
                    It s just like he said.

                    Go. I can get Deaton myself.

                    without you. We can save them both. 
                    Go!

      Before any of them can protest, Scott pushes through the door 
      of the clinic, yanking his helmet on.


      TWO SILHOUETTES whirl about, two pairs of GLOWING RED EYES in 
      the darkness, kicking up droplets of water as they clash. 
      Derek desperately fights back against Kali as the others 
      watch.


      Pushing the pedal to the floor, Stiles glances past Lydia to 
      Cora at the passenger side window. He shares a look with 
      Lydia, both of them seeing the fear in Cora s eyes.


      A shadow falls over the floor just in front of the vault 
      door. Breathless, Scott charges through, pausing to gaze up 
      at Deaton s frighteningly still body hanging from the 
      ceiling.

      A strangled breath whispers from between the man s lips. He s 
      still alive. Scott races forward and--HURTLES BACK, LIFTED 
      RIGHT OFF HIS FEET.

      Tumbling to the floor, he peers up in confusion. The light 
      seeping in now reveals a devastating twist of fate...

      MOUNTAIN ASH lies on the floor. Poured in a perfect circle 
      around Deaton.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Kali s clawed foot lands on Derek s chest, launching him into 
      the air. He drops brutally down, water splashing up around 
      him.

      Jennifer turns her eyes, unable to watch. Both Isaac and Boyd 
      start forward to help, but Ethan and Aiden pull at her until 
      she CRIES OUT.

                                  DEREK
                    No!

      Pulling himself back up, Derek throws Isaac and Boyd a look. 
      Then faces Kali once again. Ready for another round.


      Scott tries again to breach the mountain ash barrier, but the 
      force of it keeps pushing him back. Digging his heels in, he 
      reaches out, trying to cross through.

      Deaton s eyes flutter, breathless and with no more strength 
      to pull himself up while--


      Bloodied and beaten, Derek falls again, water surging in 
      around his body.


      Teeth clenched, Scott eyes begin to glow YELLOW as he pushes 
      forward. The skin on his face pulls back as if under high 
      velocity wind.

      While flesh literally starts to tear from his cheeks, a RED 
      GLOW surges from his eyes. Deaton stares back in 
      astonishment. Looking into the eyes of an Alpha.

      But the ash barrier proves too powerful. Head snapping away, 
      Scott hurtles back, tumbling across the floor.

      With the wounds already healing on his face, Scott reaches 
      out, crawling forward, trying to lift himself up when--

                    Let me have a shot.

      HE FIRES, the sound THUNDERING throughout the vault. The rope 
      just above Deaton s hands SPLITS and he falls to the floor.

      Slipping the gun back in its holster, Stilinski hurries in. 
      Scott follows as he pulls Deaton away, crossing the barrier. 
      They help a gasping Deaton to a sitting position.

                                  SCOTT
                    How did you find us?

                    Celtic symbols on them. I knew one 
                    of them looked familiar.

      He nods to the quarternary knot symbol on the floor of the 
      vault, the bank s logo. Both Scott and Deaton look on him 
      with a mixture of amazement and relief.

                                  DEATON
                      Sheriff... thank you for being a 
                    hell of a detective.


      The door to the ELECTRICAL ROOM breaks open. Cora rushes in 
      with Stiles and Lydia right behind her, all of them glancing 
      about a confusing array of circuit breakers.

      Together, they begin yanking the breakers.


      Boyd s phone VIBRATES in his hand. He looks down to see a 
      message: NOW.

      As Kali reaches to pull a beaten Derek back to his feet, Boyd 
      bares his fangs and charges forward while--

      Kicking up water, Isaac races for the twins. They 
      instinctively let Jennifer fall back to defend themselves.                   TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1343.

      But instead of attacking, Isaac goes for Jennifer, pulling 
      her to the safety of the elevated platform and through the 
      vault door as--

      THE POWER SURGES BACK ON.

      SPARKS FLY from the lights, BOLTS of ELECTRICITY arc up 
      around the bodies of Boyd, Kali and Derek.

      Screaming out in pain, Kali is still too powerful. She drags 
      Derek down into the electrical field with her. The power 
      blinks, dying out again.

                                  KALI
                    Take him!

      Charging back, Aiden and Ethan plunge into the now harmless 
      water and grab the weakened Derek by the arms, each taking a 
      CLAWED HAND, twisting them up.

      From the platform in front of the sliding door, Isaac helps 
      Jennifer up, both of them turning to witness a horrifying 
      sight--

      Kali raises Boyd off his feet and DROPS HIM DOWN right onto 
      Derek's claws held by Aiden and Ethan. Eyes surging with a 
      SUDDEN BRIGHTNESS, Derek opens his mouth and gasps in shock 
      as he subsumes Boyd s power.

      The Alphas release them. Boyd falls into the shallow water as 
      Derek drops to his knees.

      Ethan steps away, a look of regret on his face. Noticing the 
      reaction, Aiden glares at him, pulling him back with Kali 
      behind them.

                                  KALI (CONT D)
                    I m giving you until the next full

                    Join the pack. Or next time I kill 
                    all of you.

      They walk past Isaac and Jennifer, disappearing into the 
      darkness. Derek presses his hands to Boyd s chest, trying to 
      keep pressure on the wound. But Boyd s hand reaches up to 
      Derek s.

      Boyd simply shakes his head, a weak smile on his lips. He 
      speaks, but slowly and with difficulty.

      Footsteps behind them announce the arrival of Stiles, Cora 
      and Lydia. But too late. Cora rushes to Boyd s body, 
      devastated.

      And Derek finally let s go. Stiles approaches, clearly not 
      knowing what to do. So like his father tried to comfort 
      Scott, he simply puts a gentle hand on Derek s shoulder.


      In a room lit by the amber glow of a single lamp, Argent sits 
      with Gerard, speaking to him with the utmost urgency but

      Lowering his phone, Stilinski turns back to Deaton and Scott.

                      Paramedics are on the way. I ll be 
                    back in half a minute.

      He hurries out, leaving the two momentarily alone.

                    It s rare. Something that doesn t 
                    happen within a hundred years. But 
                    now and then a Beta can become an 
                    Alpha without stealing or taking 
                    that power from another. They call 
                    it a True Alpha. One that rises 
                    purely by strength of character. By 
                    virtue. By force of will.

                    You knew this would happen to me.

                                  DEATON
                      I believed. From the moment I knew 
                    you d been bitten. I believed.

      Scott falls silent. But then looks up in realization.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1346.
