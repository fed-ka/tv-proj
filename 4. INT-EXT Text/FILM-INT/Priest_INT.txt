A pioneer's wood cabin.
Aaron sits surrounded, a lattice work of vines covering the
walls and floors in beautiful patterns. Not a trace of soil
anywhere in the room, everything hydroponically grown.
SHANNON (O.S.)
Supper's on!
He smiles, studying a. stunning RUBY RED FLOWER, separate from
the others. His crown jewel. He closes the door and enters --
THE KITCHEN
SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green
broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny
FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with
religious knickknacks.
SHANNON (CONT'D)
You been spending an awful lot of time
behind that door. Makes a woman
suspicious.
AARON
Special project. It's taking a little
more time than I thought.
SHANNON
Nothing special about milkweed. Unless
you like a thorn in the finger.
4.
I AARON
It's not Milkweed. Not this year.
SHANNON
What is it?
AARON
You'll see.
His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's
INTERRUPTED BY
LUCY (0.S.)
Yuck. Pershing-stew again.
Their DAUGHTER (13). Already a heartbreaker. This girl is
too young, too pretty to be out here in the badlands.
LUCY (CONT'D)
I can't do it anymore. This outpost.
Being all cooped up like this. I'm going
CRAZYL
AARON
Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for
you -- In two years someone else'll study
the soil and this'll be their outpost.
But for right now -- this is my job.
LUCY
I don't know what it's like to have a
best friend. To have any friends. I
want to have a crush. I want secrets.
(SIMPLY)
I want a life.
Shannon looks at her husband. She knew this day would come.
SHANNON
Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be
with children her own age.
Aaron lets out a breath.
AARON
Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way
to get you to a school close by. In
town.
LUCY
BUT
5.
AARON
N year -- that's still plenty of time
for you to have a "crush".
Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get
for awhile. Aaron takes her hand.
AARON (CONT'D)
Tomorrow I'm heading in town to file.
You come with, help your old man out, get
a change of scenery. OK?
(BEAT)
Now c'mon, stew's getting cold. Bow your
heads and say grace.
The family clasps hands. Whatever their differences, there's
a bond here.
LUCY
Dear Lord we thank you for what we are
about to receive. Blessing us with your
gifts...
She.speaks with her eyes clenched shut, words spoken
sincerely, nothing perfunctory about it. She's a believer.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We thank you for the earth and the sky and
for your bounty through Christ our Lord --
She.stops, opening her eyes -- staring at the plates and
glasses on the table.
They're RATTLING.
LU C Y (CONT'D)
Daddy?
AA RON
Shh.
He cocks his ear, heading a low rumble.
Although he's never heard the sound before...he knows it can'
only mean one thing.
Trying to remain calm, Aaron goes to the window.
OUT THE WINDOW
Framed by a BLOOD MOON hanging over the horizon, a DOZEN BLACK
MOTORCYCLES race across the plain, ENGINES thundering.
6.
The Jesus figurine falls off the table, SHATTERING to the
floor.
Aaron looks at Shannon, an expression on his face she hasn't
seen before -
AARON (CONT'D)
Get the boards)
LUCY
(ALARMED)
What's going on?
Aaron doesn't answer, Shannon helping him position pre-cut
planks across every window and door. Each with an iron-cross
strut for support
The ROAR of the engines fills the house as Aaron pulls a
POWERFUL LOOKING GUN from the drawer. He drops it, obviously
not familiar with firearms.
AARON
Get by me.
Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet.
PUSH past row after row of empty pews.
We stop on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH -- a foot sticking out from
the door --
INSIDE THE BOOTH
FATHER KOEPPEN, body skinny and ravaged. The old man pours
himself a drink and downs it. Coughing.
The confessional door opens, someone steps inside the other
booth. We can't see who it is.
FIGURE'
Bless me Father for I have
sinned...again.
The voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well.
Quietly commanding. Koeppen knows it well.
11.
KOEPPEN
I caught the ambulance picking up what
was left of the factory boys...figured it
was your handywork.
The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest.
PRIEST
This time there was a little girl.
KOEPPEN
if this keeps occurring it'll be
.impossible to keep it from the Clergy.
You'll get us both excommunicated.
Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper.
PRIEST
I want to see the other Priests.
KOEPPEN
You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.
PRIEST
Why?
KOEPPEN
They have their reasons.
Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see
through the vestibule, but his expression doesn't change.
PRIEST
And their reasons for building more and
more factories? The sky is turning black.
KOEPPEN
Since when is. industriousness a sin? Did
Jesus not teach us to be productive?
(BEAT)
As your appointed counselor take my
advice, . .Relax -- Take up a hobby, pick a
vice. Make friends.
PRIEST
You're my friend.
KOEPPEN
I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his
parish for a pint of whiskey.
Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking.
12.
PRIEST
I don't know what's happening to me. (7,
Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it
is.
Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face.
KOEPPEN
The devil comes in many shapes.
Do yourself a favor, keep your head
down. Be smart. And most of all
remember your oath...
He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
"To go against the Church is to go
against God".
This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priest's
existence -- but tonight, it Just sounds like empty dogma. He
squeezes his eyes shut, clutching the,rosary as we CUT TO:
Garbage litters the floor. The sound of water dripping.
Priest stands, waiting for the lift to arrive.
A BOY AND HIS MOTHER wait too. The boy stares at Priest,
fascinated, his mother doing her best to pretend not to
notice him.
The elevator arrives and they step inside.
As it rises, a single bulb flickers above. Buzzing.
The boy continues to stare at Priest, bewitched by the tattoo.
BOY
(TO PRIEST)
Did it hurt?
The lift grinds to a stop. The mother quickly pulls her son
out as the door rolls open, glaring at Priest, disappearing
down a dark corridor.
And only now does Priest answer.
13.
PRIEST
(SOFTLY)
Yes.
The lift door clatters shut.
CUT TO:
Sparse, containing only what's needed.
Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old
battle scars -- Punctures. Scratches. Bite marks. His skin
showing the early signs of aging.
He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment --
A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY
He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image
bringing him peace.
From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT.
He looks at the rosary beads, still in his hand.
He turns out the light.
CUT TO:
Unable to sleep, Priest sits on the edge of his bed. Praying.
There's a knock at the door.
PRIEST
Who is it?
MESSENGER (0. S.)
Messenger.
Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD.
MESSENGER (CONY ' D)
I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the
wasteland.
Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt.
14.
Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX, feeding the punch card into it.
A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks to-
life, like a sail, a SCREEN rises and Aaron appears, his image
a smudge. He looks awful. A man at the end of himself.
AARON
(FILTERED)
L-Lucy's gone. They t-took her. I tried
to stop 'em.
I knowouu're..."retired". But can you
find her? Find her before --.
(SOBS)
They killed Shannon.
The screen goes blank.
Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross.
His hand curls into a fist.
Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor.
Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A
TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70's). They
sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their
religion. Men of scripture, creed and doctrine.
Priest kneels, bowing his head.
PRIEST
Thank you for meeting with me on such
short notice, Monsignors.
Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader,
ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Father Koeppen notified us of the
situation. Our prayers are with your
family.
15.
PRIEST
I come before you because I would like my
authority to be reinstated.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
On what grounds?
Priest is taken aback.
PRIEST
She's my blood, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
The proper authorities are handling the
situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.
PRIEST
The proper authorities?
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
All occurrences of vampire. disobedience
and felonies are strictly a Federal
matter now.
(BEAT)
You Priests did too good a job. The
vampire population is classified as
endangered. They're protected.
PRIEST
But Monsignor...they are the enemy.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Were.the enemy. The war ended a long
time ago.
PRIEST
Not so long that we should forget what
they are capable of.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You would do well to remember the words
of our Savior: Turn the other cheek.
Embrace your enemies.
(BEAT)
It is not our place to interfere --- or
yours.
Priest looks up, obviously in great turmoil.
PRIEST-
I can be of.great service to the
investigation. I -can
16.
0 The tribunal shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by Priest.
Orelas stands.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You forget yourself, Priest...
It has been brought to our attention that
you have engaged in a number of
transgressions. Tell me...do you feel
yourself to be above God?
PRIEST
No, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
Engaging in any kind of practice is
sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our
house.
Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him.
PRIEST
"Let your light shine before men, that
they may see your good works and glorify
your Father which is in Heaven" --
MATTHEW 5:16

The Monsignor POUNDS the table.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You dare quote scripture to met
Questioning the . authority. of the Clergy
is forbidden1 If you engage in another
transgression.you will be stripped from
the Order and excommunicated immediately.
Do I make myself clear?
PRIEST
Yes, sir.'
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
I said do I make myself clear,. Father.
PRIEST
Yes, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS
You're a soldier. God's soldier-- Act
like one.
(BEAT)
Remember your vow: "To go against the
Church is to go against God".

The officers start to lead Priest and Koeppen out the chamber,
17.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS (CONT'D)
-- Eather..Kam, please stay behind
for a moment, a .we have something we need
to discuss.
Off Koeppen's expression we CUT TO:
Priest sits alone, rosary beads clutched in his hands. He
looks up to find Koeppen, the old man staggering as he downs
an EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, three sheets to the wind.
KOEPPEN
I knew I'd find you here.
He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor
souls at the surrounding tables.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
How many nights in this very spot? You
with your endless questions on the nature
of suffering-Me with none of the
answers.
Priest doesn't even acknowledge him, lost in his thoughts.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
Well, now I'm the one with a question.
This one's a riddle.
(BEAT)
What is greater than God-but more evil
than the Devil? The poor have it, the
rich need it -- and if you eat
it...you'll die.
Priest looks, up, his eyes cold.
PRIEST
Why won't they listen to me?
A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.
KOEPPEN
Okay. I'm going to.give you one more
riddle and if you listen close - you might
just hear an answer to your question.
(clears his throat)
(MORE)
18.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
How can a man who spent his whole life
searching for devils miss the ones
staring him in the face?
From behind, a CLICKING sound.
Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED
SHOTGUN pointed at him. The soup kitchen suddenly deathly
quiet.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
The Church feels it's better to keep you
under its care...at least until this
trouble with your niece blows over..
PRIEST
You know I can't do that.
KOEPPEN
That's what I figured.
TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN
Jackboots CLACKING, they form a circle around Priest and
Koeppen. Guns SNAP into place, laser points dotting his body.
Priest looks at Koeppen -- betrayed.
PRIEST
Why?
KOEPPEN
(TOASTING RUEFULLY)
"To go against the Church is to go
against God'.
Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle
at the surrounding tables, terrified.
There's only one thing left for him to do.
PRIEST
Then ...I go against God.
In an eyeblink --
Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it
against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise --
a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES.
When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing.
Everything goes quiet.
19.
ANGLE ON: A LITTLE BOY
He breaks, from his father.'' knee, slowly moving towards the
window, drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW.
His mouth drops open as --
WHAM! -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS
PUNCH through the windows in unison, showering everybody with
glass! BULLETS whistle through the air, everyone SCREAMING
as they scramble for cover. The father diving for his son.
PRIEST
Folds his hands into the prayer position.
VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and ---
'
SILENCE
The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have
disappeared.
A...,
ON A NEARBY TABLE
A neat pile of shotguns sit, every FIRED BULLET collected
harmlessly in a clean circle around them ...as if picked out
of thin air.
THE LITTLE BOY
is somehow back with his father, the two safely holding
hands, staring stupidly at each other.
Priest is gone.
KOEPPE4
Looks at his fancy whiskey bottle, inside now floats Priest's
ROSARY BEADS. He fishes them from the bottle, hand shaking.
KOEPPEN
Heaven help us.
He takes a swig.
CUT TO:
The STRIKE of a match -- a prayer candle is lit, glowing in
the darkness.
20.
AT THE ALTAR
Priest kneels, eyes clenched shut in prayer. A large
figurine of Jesus on the cross looms over him. The Christ is
expressive -- He suffers.
PRIEST
oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended
you. it was never my intention to do so...
His words continue OVER
The DOOR slides open just a crack. A sliver of light landing
on a piece of BLACK SCULPTED METAL.
PRIEST W.S. CONT'D)
But I can't.
It looks like a war zone. Splintered furniture everywhere,
sprays of dried, black blood over the floorboards.
He brushes away rubble and finds a DRESS, Shannon's. Putting
his face to it, he inhales, his expression softening.
BEHIND HIM
Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole
in the floor.
COWBOY HAT
Alright, now -- Not another step.
Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF
HICKS (22). You could say the name fits. But you'd only be
half right.
HICKS
Thought you'd come back for a souvenir,
hub? You gotta be the dumbest
bloodsucker I ever come across.
Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.
PRIEST
If I was a vampire you'd be dead already.
The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing
his hat back on his forehead.
HICKS
I'll be dammed.
He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards
with a SIZZLE.
CUT TO:
23.
A hole in the wall. A few wanted posters and postal warrants
tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell.
Hicks leads Priest inside.
HICKS
I've already had one of the boys send for
your brother. We got him put up at
Paddy's place.
Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are
milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade.
HICKS (CONT' D)
You're gonna have to excuse the
attention.. We don't get strangers `round
here too much -- "Specially no Priest.
'Course we ain't never had no vampire
attack in.these parts before.
(eyeing Priest.)
But then you're just here to perform the
service, right?
Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.
26.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Never much of a believer myself. I
figure I got one bullet to shoot. I'm
gonna shoot it my way... not how some BOOK
tells me to.
(SPITS)
But I do hear things...it true what they
may about you folks?
(BEAT)
You can fold time?
At that, Priest turns, looking at Hicks. Before he can
answer the door opens and --
AARON
comes through, looking older than the last time we saw him.
Seeing Priest, his face cracks, smiling for the first time in
days.
AARON
You came.
Overcome, he wraps his arms around his brother, embracing.
him. Priest hugs him back.
A DOG rests lazily in front of a rotating fan.
PADDY'S a bear of a man, the town bachelor. He plops down two
bowls of brown stew before a waiting and hungry Aaron and
Priest, The gruel smells foul, tastes fouler.
PADDY
Jackrabbit Stew. Never served no man of
the cloth before. Hope you like it
spicy, Father!
He stands over both of them, eager for a response. Priest
takes a sip, grimaces, tries his best to smile but fails
hideously.
PRIEST
.Delicious
PADDY
(slaps him on the back)
`Course it isl it was me Ma's recipe.
As Paddy jubilantly walks away, Priest puts the bowl on the
floor and the dog pads over, eagerly lapping it up. Aaron
smiles.
AARON
How come you never came round more? You
know you were always welcome.
PRIEST
I know.
AARON
After the war was over we figured you'd
stay with us. Shannon was real fond of
you. Lucy too. She was always asking
about you.
Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map,
unrolling it onto the wooden table. He moves his finger
across the paper.
PRIEST
The pack headed in this direction.
There's a reservation up that way so
that's where I'll start.
AARON
if anyone finds out you're doing this --
28.
o r PRIEST
You're my brother.
Aaron nods. This is enough,
PRIEST (CONT' D)
I'll find her.
AARON
And you' 11 bring her back to me.
Something in Priest's face darkens. He doesn't answer, not
able to look his brother in the eye.
CUT TO:
A SHOPCLERK mops the floor, guns of all types lining his
walls. Everything from old Smith and Wesson's to the latest
and most powerful hand cannons.
With a jingle, the door opens revealing Priest. The clerk
smiles. All he needs is one look and he knows -- This guy's
good for business.
CLERK
Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of
service?
PRIEST
I need bullets.
CLERK
How many?
PRIEST
How many do you have?
The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious.
CLERK
No offense, Father. You got a permit,
right?
PRIEST
I have this.
He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a
solid THUD.
The clerk smiles wider..
29.
,S,
Hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top.
Priest site with his back to us, hunched over a candle.
We're unable to see what he's doing. Aaron picks up a
bullet, twirling it in the light.
AARON
Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd
still be alive.
PRIEST
Sometimes things just happen. Fault's
got nothing to do with it.
AARON
Funny. I'm the one who used to say that.
You were the one who always said
everything was God's will.
Priest takes the bullet from him.
PRIEST
I'm not so sure anymore.
There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's
Sheriff Hicks.
HICKS
Aaron.
AARON
Sheriff.
HICKS
You mind if I have a word-with your
brother?
An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing
what the other's thinking.
PRIEST (0.S.
It's alright. Let him in.
Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door
behind him as he leaves. The vibe in the room is
uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks.
HICKS
I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire
Protection Act.
(MORE)
30.
HICKS (CONT'D)
it strictly states it is forbidden for
anyone to hunt vampires anymore.
C
Priest doesn't say anything, he just keeps working.
HICKS (CONT'D)
These days, things go through proper
channels. Paperwork drawn up.
investigators called in. Procedures
followed.
(spits, a wad of tobacco)
'Course we both know after a week, girls
taken by vampires either and up dead or
worse -- turned.
(THINKS)
I'm sure you also wouldn't be surprised
to know my office's'been contacted. I'm
supposed to arrest you on sight.
He pulls a SHINY OBJECT from his pocket, puts it on the table
beside Priest.
HICKS (CONT'D)
On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy
there'll be a warrant on mybead
too...and that'll put us in the same
briar patch.
O
Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae.
Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight.
HICKS (CONT'D)
We leave at sun up.
Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.
PRIEST
Why?
HICKS
We're the only chance she's got.
Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched
CROSS now in its tip (this is what he's been doing). He
SNAPS it in the air.
PHHHHTTI
Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the
wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing,
spilling to the floor. The kid's fast.
PRIEST
How you with a gun?
31.
HICKS
Better than I am with a knife.
Priest considers this.
PRIEST
I'll be there.
Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out,
stops at the door.
HICKS
What's with all the bullets anyway? I
thought Priests don't use firearms.
PRIEST
We don't.
(BEAT)
They're for you.
Hicks nods, realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole time.
Moonlight streams through an open window.
Priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches beside
the:.bed, closing his eyes. Hands clasped.
PRIEST
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be
thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven...
As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and
into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE.
PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those that trespass against us and lead
us not into temptation but deliver us
from evil.
We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the
shutters, tucking their children in safely for the night.
PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
For thine is the kingdom and the power and
the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a
nearby roofline.
32.
The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by
the SOFT GLOW OF A LIT CHEROOT...the Figure watches Priest as
he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle.
Silently, the Figure takes off. Flying into the night.
CUT TO:
The light of the sun's never been in here. Probably should
have stayed this way. Tiny bones-cover the entire floor.,
excrement smearing the walls.
The Crypt Familiar cowers-in the corner, shielding his eyes
from-the light. His body'fishbelly white and sickly.
36.
CRYPT FAMILIAR
(hissing).
Got Got You must got Master will be
angry!
Nicks is grimacing from the stench. He looks at Priest, not
happy as he approaches a STONE SARCOPHAGUS. Running his hand
over it.
PRIEST
Where's the girl?
CRYPT FAMILIAR
PLEEASE please got
PRIEST
No? Maybe your Master will know.
CRYPT FAMILIAR
NOt NOI THE MASTER CANNOT BE DISTURBEDI
Priest rests his hand against the. atone slab covering.the
tomb. It must weigh 200 pounds. He moves the slab. Just a
centimeter -- but the Familiar screeches.
PRIEST
Wh re is she?
CRYPT FAMILIAR
(SOBBING)
Please. Please don't hurtmy Master.
PRIEST
Your.Master'll be dead.
He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside
the edge.
And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling
sound. Something in his mood has shifted.
CRYPT FAMILIAR
No, i don't think so.
Hearing a noise, Hicks turns, witnessing a horrible sight
moving towards him
THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILIARS
About ten of them. Real Night Of The Living Dead stuff.
Makeshift weapons in their hands:. Scythes, Slingblades,
Buzzsaws.
3.7.
Before Hicks can react --
A FAMILIAR
Attacks, BUTCHER BLADE raised. CHOP! the blade buries itself
in Hicks' arm!
HICKS
Lets loose with a mean roundhouse. Plugging him in the
chest. in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from
his arm, flinging it at the nearest
FAMILIAR
The blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack.
These guys move surprisingly fast -- Hicks is already
surrounded. He hears a whistling noise as
A BUZZSAW BLADE
knifes through the air heading straight for him. He DUCKS,
the blade whistling past, sawtoothing into the torso of
another Familiar.
HICKS
Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a
CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim.
With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through
the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking
his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean
obedient pup.
A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet
SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt.
Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best
of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack
but before he can --
PRIEST
Leaps in front. Blocking his way.
PRIEST
Not yet.
With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at
Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air.
38.
Priest CHARGES into the frenzy. A juggernaut. His movements
clean and calculated, bones breaking around him with a wet
snap, bodies THUDDING at his feet.
When the dust clears, Priest stands alone... and he is holding
their weapons.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
Now we can do this easy --
He tosses the BUTCHER KNIFE, it sticks in the ground a
hairline from a Familiar's head.
PRIEST (CONTID)
Or we can do this HARD --
Priest flings another BLADE. This one PLANTS in the leg of
the Familiar. He HOWLS.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
Where is she?
THE FAMILIAR
(CACKLING)
You're too late, Priest --
He points to the horizon, the last rays of daylight
disappearing.
CRYPT FAMILIAR
It's our time now.
We hear a LOW RUMBLE from inside the crypts. Priest looks at
Hicks, a feeling of dark electricity in the air, anticipation.
PRIEST
They get your gun arm?
HICKS
Why?
PRIEST
You're gonna need it.
CUT TO:
MULTIPLE SHOTS OF
SLABS on each sarcophagus sliding open. SHAPES roiling in
the blackness inside. The sound of dark, mewling things.
Things already sensing trouble in their midsts.
39.
As the cars BLAST PAST THE CAMERA we see each is filled with
rows of BLACK COFFINS. A TALL FIGURE walks between them,
wearing a BLACK TOP HAT AND CAPE.
We only see 12im from behind.
PALE ARMS reach from within the coffins, fingers touching the
hem of the Figure's cape as he walks past.
 A FAMILIAR approaches.
FAMILIAR
A man came on board at the last stop.
Says he has something for you.
The Figure nods. We-FOLLOW as he continues to the back of
--- the car, sliding open the door
Fine china on oak tables. The SNAKE OIL SALESMAN we saw back
in Halbridge sits, nervously, in a plush chair. Candles
light the car, casting the room in a surreal flicker.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
You told me tQ come to you if I had any
information.
(SMILES)
I have some.
Silently, the Figure sits down across from him.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
But before I tell you...and I hate to bring
this, up -- there is the small matter
regarding compensation.
(LEANING FORWARD)
(MORE)
47.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
Now your group's been REAL good for
business so, of course, I'm willing to cut
you a deal
The Figure suddenly. LUNGES, grabbing the salesman by the
throat, teeth clicking inches from the man's neck. WE STILL
DO NOT SEE HIS FACE.
BLACK HAT
I can SMELL the blood racing through your
veins... Smells like dinner.
The salesman starts to shake.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
(VOICE QUAVERING)
A-After you snatched that girl outside
Haibridge...two nights later -- a Priest
s-showed up.
BLACK HAT
A Priest?
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
He was meetin' with the local sheriff. A
real shitkicker -- Booted me out of town
before I could make a single sell.
A pause..,.and then the Figure laughs. The salesman not sure
how to react.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
W-What's so funny?
The Figure BURIES his teeth in the man's neck, taking a deep,
deep drink, having his fill, dropping the body to the floor
with a thud.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW as the Figure walks to the
back of the car, sliding open the door --
A sliver of light lands on
LUCY
Lying on the floor, her face streaked with tears. Vestiges
of the girl we met earlier already lost.
LUCY
I won't tell anyone if you let me out...I
promise.
(MORE)
48.
LUCY (CONT'D)
(NODS)
10 I won't even go to the police.
BLACK HAT
You're in here for your own
protection...If I let you out of this car
you'll be torn apart a piece at a time.
He walks to her, face still hidden in shadow. She starts to
cry, pulling back to the wall. Angry.
LUCY
My uncle's a Priestl one of the best.
Hooll corns after youl
The Figure laughs. Bending down to her level --
BLACK HAT
I'm absolutely counting on it.
And now we get our first look at her captor. A cross tattoo
h s adows his face.
The mark of the Priest.
CUT TO:
A dusty PHONOGRAPH playing a recording of an old-time
spiritual, the record warped from the heat, distorting the
voice as THE CAMERA PANS PAST hundreds of homemade CRUCIFIXES
haphazardly nailed across the wall.
OLD MAN
Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years
since I had any kind of company 'sides
jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' --
Dreams don't lie.'
Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can,
handing it to Priest.
OLD MAN (CON'S I D)
Most people don't remember what you folk
done -- Don' t WANT to remember. But I
do. I know what you can do.
(making the sign of the cross)
You are God's mighty sword fused into
flesh. One of the chosen.. Touched by
His very ha nd so peace could finally come
to this cur sed land.
Hicks snorts.
HICKS
Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo
jumbo to me.
The old man stares fixedly at Priest.
OLD MAN
Now you tell the Clergy this here is an
authentic miracle, I want it registered.
It's mine.
PRIEST
Miracle?
52.
OLD MAN
The Angels. Never seen so many loot
souls, breaks my heart just to think of
it. This ain't no place for nothin'
divine.
The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to
respond.
PRIEST
You saw angels?
OLD MAN
Sure as chit.
PRIEST
How many?
OLD MAN
Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds.
Thousands. Some nights the sky was so
thick you couldn't see the stars.
His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something.
i OLD MAN (CONT'D)
Here! Look at this --
He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE --
rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed
photographs, collected junk.
He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN
floating in murky water, the old man proudly showing it to
Priest and Hicks.
HICKS
What is it?
OLD MAN
It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above
and this stuff would drop from the sky
like manna.
HICKS
That's angel shit?
OLD MAN
Scooped it up myself.
(offering it to Hicks)
You wanna hold it?
Hicks backs away, shaking his head.
53.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
Suit yourself.
Priest still doesn't know what to make of the man but he
senses something to be gained. He tries changing the subject.
PRIEST
These angels...di.d you ever see them
during the day?
OLD MAN
No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back
home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the
world ready for the rapture takes a lot
of work. Praise God.
PRIEST
Home?
OLD MAN
The castle -
.:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits
the -remains of a CASTLE --
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
Beautiful place. Wonder of the world. I
used to watch `em every night, takin' to
the sky in all of God's glory,
(LEANS FORWARD)
I never would disturb `em though. God's
children like their privacy.
He winks, smiling that crazy smile. Priest considers the
possibility of a lead here -- but Hicks just gazes at the old
man like he's nuts as we CUT TO:
Lucy is on her knees, scratching her nails against the wood
floor. Testing it. Splintery shards come up in tiny clusters.
From outside,.:the sound of a padlock opening, a chain
dropping to the floor. Lucy quickly sits, making innocent.
A SERVANT FAMILIAR enters, carrying a tray of food, his eyes
grotesquely roam Lucy's body.
Lucy smiles sweetly, taking the tray.
LUCY
Thank you.
The Familiar turns to leave.
WHAPI Lucy SLAMS the tray over his head and he collapses to
the floor.
She makes a run for it. But the Familiar manages to grab her
ankle.knocking her down, she kicks at him as he holds fast,
hissing.
Two more FAMILIARS run in and grab her arms, wrestling her to
the floor. She struggles furiously but it's no use, she
screams as we CUT TO:
Musty. Cool. Dark. Walls rising high into a cone as
sunlight streams in from an opening in the top. Hicks and
Priest enter, stepping carefully over PILES OF (GARBAGE
littering the floor.
HICKS
This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five
days'-- every stupid minute we waste here
is a minute more she gets farther-away.
Priest turns and sees a STONE STAIRCASE, uneven steps leading.
downwards...too dark to tell where though.
56.
PRIEST
Stay here. If anything comes up the
steps that isn't me -- Shoot it.
Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness
swallowing him with every step.
HICKS
Great.
DOWN THE STAIRS
The air seems thicker here, the darkness claustrophobic.
Enveloping. It takes a moment for Priests' eyes to adjust.
A CATACOMB
Actually more a cave. Miles and miles. Twisting, jagged and
moist. Endless corners, weaving into a dark and hideous maze.
Priest heads into it
Frustrated, Hicks kicks at the garbage.
There's something underneath.
He brushes aside the refuse, uncovering a . bunch' of SMALL
WHITE SHAPES, breath catching as he realizes what it is:
Bones.
It's quiet.
Priest moves through the darkness, footsteps not even a
whisper, heading deeper and deeper into the labyrinth as
Hicks is now at the chamber wall,'running his hand along it,
feels grooves lining its surface.
Stepping back, he sees they form an image-of some kind. Hard
to make it out in the darkness.
He leafs through the garbage, pulling out a piece of BROKEN
GLASS AS
57.
Priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest, most
narrow tunnel yet. A light shines at the end. A TORCH.
Flickering gently.
A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely
registers. Could just be a trick of the eye. Or not.
Priest moves towards it.
IT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME
Hicks angles the broken glass under the light, reflecting a
faint beam onto the wall, revealing a HUGE CARVING cut into
THE STONE:
1L0Z.J.PIf .! i
Primitive but very creepy. We linger on the image, the
terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature. Truly
horrific.
Quiet. Just the low how], of a breeze moving through the
tunnel.
Priest walks into an ANIMAL PEN of sorts, a hay-like
substance covering the floor, the smell of something bestial.
He,covers his nose, looking around, something in the corner
catching his eye ---
TWO BODIES
splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to
take a closer look...
WHAM!
SOMETHING. barrels into him with superhuman force!
Acting on instinct, Priest FOLDS AND ROLLS. Kicking the
thing off him and PUSHING off the wall for a blistering
recovery.
Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move
he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to
make out what it is.
Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it
against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light.
IT'S A FEMALE PRIEST
58.
o A BEAT as they stand staring at each other, unsure what to
say. The cross tattoo covers her face, shadowing fierce
eyes. Every inch a warrior.
Time seems to stop for these two. Their whole dark history
their bend -- passing between them in one glance.
PRIESTESS
How did you find me?
Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious.
PRIESTESS (CONT'D)
Did the Clergy send you?
PRIEST
No.
(BEAT)
Why would they?
She nods towards the bodies, we now see tb=1re.-VAMPIRZ-
CORPSES.
PRIESTESS
I've been busy.
Off Priest's reaction we CUT TO:
Hicks looking up to see the light; from the hole in the
geilingwinkinc_out. The sun is setting.
Slipping, he drops the piece og glass, cutting his finger.
Drawing blood.
HICKS
Shit.
He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE
SHAPE looms in the archway behind him...
The two warriors eye each other, the. air heavy between them.
PRIESTESS
If you didn't come for me...why are you
here?
PRIEST
I should be asking you the same question.
59.
The bestial smell stings their nostrils, smells good.
PRIESTESS
There's another one around here
somewhere.
PRIEST
Where?
PRIESTESS
I don't know...but it's not like the
others.
They're interrupted by the sound of GUNFIRE echoing off the
tunnel walls. Priest turns.
PRIEST
Hicks.
He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following.
Hicks is sprawled at the base of the stairs, bloodied and
bruised. Both guns pointed at
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
SOMETHING is lurking. A hulking shadow, sounds like a rabid
bull. We catch the TIP OF A CLAW scraping at the stone floor.
Priest approaches from down the tunnel, senses on full alert.
PRIEST
It's too big to fit down here. That's
why you're still alive.
HICKS
What the hell is that thing?I
HICKS
I'm not stupid. Vampires don't look like
that.
PRIESTESS (0.8.)
They used to.
The Priestess steps out from behind Priest. Startling Hicks.
60.
HICKS
Who the hell are you?! (7,
She doesn't even bother to respond,.just shooting a look as
the two warriors bound
UP THE STEPS
Charging into battle. Priest BURSTS from the stairway
LEAPING up and over as the Priestess rolls off to the side.
He-lands beside her, the two turning to face down --
THE VAMPIRE
A fearsome creature -- much more terrifying than the
Nightshade variety. Bigger, more ferocious. The ancient
cousin to the more modern vampire.
The beast opens its mouth and lets loose with a SCREAM, its
breath vile.
THE PRIESTS
Split up. The Priestess LEAPING to the stone wall and
climbing up the rock. Priest goes the opposite way, ROLLING
across the floor, keeping low.
I
THE VAMPIRE
With a screech, goes for the Priestess. Crawling up the wall,
hunched like a rat, talons ferociously . digging, into: rock.
Coordinating an attack wordlessly, the Priests make their move:
THE PRIESTESS
Lets go of the wall, PLUMMETING straight towards the vampire,
the creature FLASHING its fangs in anticipation.
PRIEST
Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of
the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping
his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock.
With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force
sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop,
CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet.
PRIESTESS
Should we lead it into open air? More
room to. maneuver.
61.
PRIEST
Better to keep it contained.
The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and
scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns.
Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through
the hole, FLYING out into the night.
PRIESTESS
Or not.
They race outside.
Carrying a torch, the Priestess. leads Priest and Hicks
through the maze, the deeper they go the more subterranean it
feels. Bowels of the earth.
PRIESTESS
I found this just before I was attacked -
AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER
Huge. Cavernous. Our group appearing as tiny shapes set
against the awesome scale of the place. Hundreds of LARGE
HOLES gouged into the walls, stretching as far as torchlight
allows. An incredible sight.
PRIEST
It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.
HICKS
Guess they're not as endangered as
everyone thought.
(MORE)
66.
A HICKS (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
0 But where'd they go?.
We hear a LOUD SHRIEK - and a MASSIVE SWARM OF BATS sweep
through the depths of the chamber, black wings fluttering.
PRIEST
Only one way to find out...
Our group moving deeper into the dark cavern, a moan of wind
echoing off the gorge wail behind them, massive black
stalactites hanging overhead. Very creepy.
They move quickly, Priest ahead of the other two. Hicks
gazes at the Priestess, admiring her body. Any man would.
He works up his courage and approaches her. Quietly.
HICKS
Are Priests allowed to, you know...have
relations?
PRIESTESS
We take a vow of celibacy at inception.
Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she
said that?
HICKS
Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he
do that little stunt back there?
PRIESTESS
All Priests can do it.
HICKS
Including you?
She nods.
HICKS (CONT'D)
So what's the trick?
PRIESTESS
No trick. You just have to remember.
HICKS
Remember... what?
PRIESTESS
Time is relative.
67.
Priest snaps up his hand, cutting off their conversation,
something strange up ahead -- He slowly moves forward, the
tunnel sharply dropping, feeding into a --
HUGE CHAMBER
Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a
wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering
his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench.
A GIANT SHADOW
Looms before him, we_don't see what it is.
As the Priestess and Hicks enter the chamber, Hicks coughs,
reeling from the smell, the Priestess wrapping a cloth around
her mouth -- the CAMERA focusing only on theirexpressions as
they take in the horrible spectacle before them.
PRIEST
You said the next nearest town was
Jericho.
HICKS
Yeah.
PRIEST
Then we better go see.
HICKS
. See what?
PRIESTESS
-- What they left of it.
PUSH IN ON HICKS -- knots of rope tightening in his
stomach... only now realizing how truly black the path before
him will be.
CUT TO:
THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for
Lucy, no tray this time.
68.
But she's not there.
He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in
the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's
not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through.
The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,-
RAILROAD TRACKS
CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The
noise is deafening..
LUCY (0.S.)
Hey...
The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS
lining the underside of the train.
KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his
head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's
quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track.
Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass.
She's come this far, time to go the rest.
She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving
along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters
from the passing track.
OHB SLIPS
Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically
brushing the wood.
Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through
the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE.
She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The
train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed.
Only one thing to do.
She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS
EXT WASTELAND (EDGE OF THE PLAINS) - DAY
A dustorm.
The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a
vista of dunes, wind shipping across them.
69.
As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to
reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and
respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a
cycle identical to Priest's.
In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as
they arrive at Jericho.
The place is a mess.
DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken
furniture scattered everywhere, glass littering the floor.
Whatever went down here -- someone put up a hell of a fight.
HICKS
'Damn.
He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --
70.
The Priestess walks in, flurries of yellow dust swirling in
her wake, filling the room.
if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine.
Everything set up for a great time...just no people.
A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs
her finger across the dust covered keys.
It comes up wet and red. Blood.
MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO
The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by
pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll, filling the lonely
room with tin-pan music.
The sound of a record skipping.
Priest steps through a doorway, the door already ripped off
its hinges. Broken furniture and glass.
It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and
wooden toys messily strewn across the floor.
He walks to an OLD PHONOGRAPH sitting on the windowsill,
still playing, placing the needle back in its cradle.
That's when so=thing out the window ratchgo hiseve...
Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of
dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger.
HICKS
The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way
in the backcountry, bought the ore from
the deep mines. There were about five
stops along the route. I think.
He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a
stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.
74.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Looks like Jericho was, the last town it
glances before'. heading around the Linwood
Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.
PRIEST
Where?
He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.
HICKS
The Cities.
So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.
PRIESTESS
They must have been picking up different
factions along the way. Moving during
the day, feeding at night.
HICKS
But headin' to the Cities is suicide.
The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere
to hide.
Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.
PRIEST
They won't have to.
And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:
V-)
A BLACK COWBOY HAT coolly tilted down, exposing .a cheroot
clutched between thin lips. A trail of smoke lazily floats
upwards.
DARK FIGEMH
A fine catch yes?
(the voice is oily, a dark
WHISPER)
She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed
by the wasteland.
We see Lucy on the floor at the Figure's feet, his pale hand
runs calmly through her hair.
From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at
Lucy. She struggles but the hand tightens its grip.
BLACK HAT
What do you want for her?
And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin
skin, eyes like black coal. This is RUNE, a bounty hunter.
RUNE
You know what r want.
Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight.
BLACK HAT
Don't. go too far, Rune.
RUNE
He comes for her still.
BLACK HAT
Of course he does.
RUNE
Let me have him.
BLACK HAT
No.
Rune smiles,'revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs.
RUNE'
I'm sure she'll fetch a nice price out
In the zone -- they don't care what
condition their meat's in...as long as
it's easy to chew.
76.
Black Hat eyes him.
BLACK HAT
Don't get involved in this.
RUNE
I was involved long before you showed
up.
(SEETHING)
I've been waiting years for a chance at
him...and now that he's here I find x
have to ask a Prime permission...
Like a snake, a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of
his jacket, wrapping itself around Lucy's neck.
RUNE (CONT'D)
My how things have changed.
Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat,
choking her.
RUNE (CONT'D)
I never cared about your war. Never got
Involved. Us halfbreeds. We were
exiles -- rejected by both humans and
vampires. All we wanted was a quiet
place. But he wiped out my whole tribe.
(BEAT)
Maybe it's time to return the favor.
The metal finger wraps TIGHTEtR, Lucy gasps, the "tension
becoming unbearable until finally
BLACK HAT
Fine. He's Yours.
As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket,
Lucy COLLAPSING to the floor coughing and choking.
RUNE
And -- she's yours.
He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to
the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long
dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night.
BLACK HAT
Annoyed, picks up the still burning cigar, squeezing it in
his hand. He turns to Lucy.
77.
BLACK HAT
And as for you uy dear...You're more
trouble than I anticipated. Must be your
uncle's blood in you.
(BEAT)
A shame he'll never see what you'll
become. I would've loved to see his face.
And then he is upon her, saliva mixing with blood as he drinks.
CUT TO:
It's dark.
80.
A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently
through a DEEP TRENCH, moist earthen walls rising around
them, the air putrid with stink, mud clinging to their feet.
Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike
the others, he's smiling, enjoying the action.
As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench,
scaling through the muck. They find themselves at the base
of the hive, looking around at a chilling sight --
THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS
OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES.
OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving
precise instructions, their movements well coordinated.
He stops. Hearing a sound...a faint but incr.
A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others.
PRIESTESS
They know we're here.
From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a
Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES
emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight
valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly
cut down.
PRIEST
Retreat!
FEARSOME PRIEST
Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws
at his throat, fangs inches from his face. A couple of quick
moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead.
He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through the
hive, a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES.
FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be
the last remanent of a dandy gentleman. He picks it up,
admiring the souvenir. Puts it on his head.
The Priestess races by, shooting him a we don't have time
for this' look. He STOPS her, grabbing her shoulder
81.
FEARSOME PRIEST
(WINKS)
What do you think -- Am I a "Dapper Dan"?
She glares, running ahead to join the group. Fearsome just
smiles, taking off the hat.
FEARSOME PRIEST (CONT'D)
Guess not.
From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now
Fearsome starts to run, trying to catch the others as they
scramble for daylight. The exit just in sight.
At the last second --
He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The
hat still gripped tightly in his hand as he's dragged away.
our two Priests reach for him but it's too late ...He
disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO:
Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to
the sun, making the train a world of eternal midnight.
Carefully, Hicks opens the next compartment's door.,.
It's pitch black.
92.
The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE, what's inside
impossible to see in the darkness, just a GIANT HULKING C
SHADOW. Its steady, hefty breathing letting us know whatever
it is, it's asleep.
Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell, the cage taking
up so much room he is forced to press himself against the
bars, his body just inches from the thing inside.
THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS
Makes Hicks stop in his tracks, silently praying to whoever's
listening.
A long moment...and then the steady breathing begins again.
Whew. Hicks continues through the cabin, finally making it
to the door as --
Hicks still hunting for Lucy, making his way to the next car.
He slides open the door, stepping carefully inside,
candlelight softly illuminating the space.
He's greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze:
DOZENS OF OPEN COFFINS FILL THE CAR
Long black boxes lined in orderly rows, flickering light
bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings -- The sound of
DEEP TORTURED BREATHING lets us know the OCCUPANTS are asleep.
94.
HICKS
0
(under his breath)
Shit.
Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as
possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see
what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound.
As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so
very tight.
WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes,
KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it.
He stops. Holding his breath...but
Nothing happens.
A quick Hail Mary (the man becoming more of a convert with
every step) and he continues on.
He doesn't notice as behind hi a PX rises from one of
the, coffins
CROSSCUT TO:
Hicks is almost at the door, hand reaching for the handle.
He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him...
But there's nothing, just the open coffins.
Turning back, Hicks catches his breath:
98.
A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the
door. Its red eyes snap in anticipation, a shiny BLACK
PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth!
Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature. It
RIEKSI dropping to the floor, writhing. The sick smell of
cooked flesh filling the car.
HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM
DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE. Sitting up in their
coffins, the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the
dinner he most surely is.
HICKS
Shit.
With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins,
sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks.
Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into --
and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the
hungry beings CRASH against itl
A
He wedges a knife in the door-handle, bashing it with his
revolver, jamming the door trapped shut.
He turns to head to the next car but there's a THICK CHAIN
AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door, aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR
peering out from inside the door window. Hicks SHOOTS the
padlock but no luck, it doesn't break.
He's trapped.
THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES
It'll hold. . .but not for long.
Hicks stares at the door as it starts to BREAK from its
hinges. He trains his gun on it, a feeble gesture --- but it's
all he's got left.
Then there's a horrible SCREECH.
HICKS TURNS
The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges, attacking from behind, having
unlocked the chain and opened the door. He SCREAMS, sinking
a KNIFE in Hicks' side!
Hicks spins, slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm
heel strike, knocking the Familiar out instantly.
Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt
as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him.
He trips over the chain and staggers into --
Collapsing to the floor, he presses his body against the door
to close it.
HIS EYES SEARCH THE CAR
It's bare. Absolutely nothing in here. A single candle
burns: ,on the floor, dimly illuminating the room.
Weakly, he crosses the space and goes to the next door. This
one's got a THICK PADLOCK too,.
HICKS
'Dam.
He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far
as he goes.
Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens,
nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear.
It's someone else's BREATHING.
IN THE CORNER
A HUNCHED FIGURE sits...its back to him. Hidden'in shadow.
Hicks levels his gun, slowly moving towards the shape, the
candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face.
He can hardly believe it
100.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Lucy?
it is.
That's when he sees something. Glinting in the darkness,
just below her lip.
Something sharp.
CUT TO:
Hicks crouches beside Lucy, his gun trained on her.
She site listlessly, her skin pale, eyes lost on the wall in
front of her.
HICKS
Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here
to take you home.
No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into
his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her.
101.
HICKS (CONT'D)
I'm here with your uncle.
That gets her attention, she looks at Hicks -- And she looks
scared.
WHAP!1
The car door outside finally starts to give freely, metal
breaking open. The sound of SQUEALING vampires.
Hicks runs to.the car door, in one quick motion, SCOOPING up
the chain and WRAPPING it around the handle, TYING IT TIGHT
just as --
A TALON
Reaches through the opening, long bony fingers swiping at
Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards, pain shooting
up his body.
ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window, clawing at the
air, the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain.
Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door, not noticing
as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Stay behind me. I'll hold `em off as
long as I can
BLAMI BL.AM! Hicks FIRES, bullets peppering the creatures as
they HOWL -- but they keep at it, the thick chain stretched
tight, ready to snap.
ONE VAMPIRE
Manages to scramble through, it charges at Hicks, fangs
glistening. BAMI With a twitch, it collapses in a heap, a
well placed bullet between the eyes.
Hicks continues to FIRE, the vampires seconds from entering
the car.
He turns to look back at Lucy. But she's gone.
HICKS
Lucy?
WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the
gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy
standing over him, holding the plank above her head.
He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again,
splintering apart across the floor.
HICKS (CONT'D)
Lucy, wait
She doesn't, jabbing at him with the broken plank, he dodges
it, barely, but she keeps coming.
HICKS (CONT'D)
:71
Lucy, don't do this!
The girl's just too fast. She keeps pushing him backwards
until he's dangerously close to the vampire's clawing hands..
Hick's closes his eyes, knowing this is it...
A FIST
PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one
through which Lucy escaped before), wood splintering into
tiny shards.
Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy,
knocking her unconscious.
He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the
hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through...
IT'S PRIEST
He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by
the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it.
PRIEST
(reaching for Lucy)
Give her to me! Hurry!
103.
Hicks thinks about it, unsure.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
-- They'11.get through the door any
second! Give her to mei
Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening,
Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot.
He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest.
Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just
as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with
screeching vampires!
Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep
coming. He drops into the hole --
Evening mass. The place is packed, every pew filled with
WORSHIPERS.
CROSSCUT TO.,
Shadows and light.
A cabal of MONSIGNORS stand shrouded in white robes, awaiting
to be anointed by ORELAS. A private ceremony.
CROSSCUT TO:
A LINE OF CHILDREN kneel before the altar, the MONSIGNOR
raising the Host, offering communion.
He suddenly stops, his expression dropping as
PRIEST
Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied,
his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman
GASPS, somebody faints.
CROSSCUT TO:
Orelas dips his hand in water, touching a Monsignor's forehead.
ORELAS
Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata
mundi.
THERE'S A LOUD CRASH
Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING
inwards! THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble
floor.
PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER
A true force of nature now, coming like the Fourth Horseman.
Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher, a blaze igniting
behind his eyes.
BLACK HAT
109.
Steps from the shadows. Deep wounds line his face, the cross
tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles.
BLACK HAT
I'm afraid you're too late, Priest.
THE MONSIGNORS
Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks.
Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight.
ORELAS
And why shouldn't we live forever?
(HISSES)
We're God's very voice. His vessel!
PRIEST
Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering.
BLACK HAT ATTACKS
SLAMMING.into him, the two warriors going at it in a brutal
battle, the vampire raking his claws across Priest's face,
drawing blood.
PRIEST
Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a
collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching
fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The
chamber erupting in an orange blaze!
THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK
Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME.
Black Hat stands triumphant, flames rising behind him.
BLACK HAT
With them I can start anew! You can't
stop it --
(SMILES)
Must be God's will.
He flies across the room, BARRELING into Priest with
everything he's got, DIGGING a hand into Priest's wound.
BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
"I looked and beheld a pale horse and His
name that sat on him was Death" --
110.
Priest coughs up blood. Black Hat smiles, wrapping a hand
around Priest's. throat, LIFTING him off the floor, SQUEEZING
the life from him,
BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
"And all hell followed with him."
He raises his head back, ready to sink his teeth. Priest too
exhausted to fight back. This is it.
Prom a b= --
THE GIANT GOLD CROSS
Breaks from the wall with a GROAN, PLUMMETING towards them.
Black Hat stops, his eyes snapping upward.
At the last second --
PRIEST
WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the
floor.
WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi !

Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest, the
chamber starting to COLLAPSE. Diving, he barely makes it
out, the rotunda .CRASHING down behind him.,
The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors
shut, locking them in. They BASH against the door, SHRIEKING
horribly, the chamber now an oven.
Priest presses against the door, it SPLINTERS all around him,
the terrible sound RISING until finally
it stops.
PRIEST
(WHISPERS)
Forgive me.
He collapses, making the sign of the cross.
CUT TO:
Time has passed. The moon shines through an open doorway.
Lucy lies in bed, Aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth. He
smiles, Lucy reluctant to smile back, still uncomfortable
with her teeth.
But eventually -- for her father...she manages it.
HICKS
Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his
way... then shyly looks away.
AARON
I can't thank you enough for what you've
done, sheriff.
T I
HICKS
Just make sure she keeps on the tea.
It's a special brew -- lessens the
bloodthirst...something my granddad
taught me.
Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand.
CUT TO:
Hicks BURSTS through the doorway, finding
LUCY AND AARON
114.
Sitting peacefully on the bed together, just as he left them.
Aaron holds up the cup, turning it over.
AARON
All done.
(BEAT)
We heard you fire your gun. is
everything OK?
A beat -- then Hicks nods.
HICKS
Nothing to worry about, just a coyote.
Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy.
AARON
Well ...we're all God's creatures.
Hicks turns, ready to leave, but something on the table
catches his eye
THE DESERT RAT' S HOMEMADE CROSS
He picks it up, turning it in his hand, the colored stones
0 catching the moonlight...How the hell did it get there?
AARON (CONT'D)
Don't forget your cross -- It's
beautiful.
A flicker of a smile crosses Hick's face, realizing.
HICKS
ACTUALLY --
(BEAT)
I think it's for you...and Lucy.
CUT TO:
