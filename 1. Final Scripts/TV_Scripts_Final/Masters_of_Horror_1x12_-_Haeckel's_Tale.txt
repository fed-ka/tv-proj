      FADE IN:


      EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT - 188511

      It is a ramshackle, broken-down little HOUSE, almost 
      completely overrun by VINES and BRUSH, practically to the 
      point where it s completely hidden.  The GRASS is unruly, the 
      blistered WOOD not whitewashed in decades.

      In the FRONT YARD just outside the house lie THREE 
      splintered, weathered WOODEN GRAVE MARKERS.  The GRAVES 
      beneath them seem RAW and FRESH, despite the age of the 
      MARKERS.

      It is the Late Nineteenth Century in Connecticut, and a warm 
      FIRE flickers behind the WINDOW.

      Under the heavy-clouded SKY, a WELL-DRESSED MAN in his late 
      thirties, EDWARD RALSTON, arrives on horseback. He looks 
      completely out of place in this neighborhood.

      He checks the address on the SLIP of PAPER in his HAND, then, 
      taking a last look at these strange old GRAVES, dismounts and 
      heads up the path to the DOOR.  He RAPS gently.

      No answer, so, almost timidly, he raps again.

      An OLD WOMAN S VOICE calls out from within.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Enter if you must!  Just cease that 
                    damnable tapping!

      Ralston hesitates at the sound of her voice, then takes the 
      KNOB in hand and opens the door.


      INT. OLD WOMAN S HOUSE - NIGHT22

      Ralston ENTERS, we find an OLD WOMAN, MIZ CARNATION, sitting 
      in front of a meager FIRE, sipping something HOT and 
      ALCOHOLIC, her face withered into a perpetual, wrinkled APPLE-
      DOLL FROWN.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    You knock like a woodpecker, and it 
                    just hammers right through my 
                    brain.  You knock like a man, with 
                    a big  boom, boom, boom  and I m 
                    fine.

                    But with that little birdy  tippy 
                    tappy tippy tappy , it s like to 
                    make my eyes pop out of my head.  
                    Come in and sit down by the fire, 
                    where I can see you.  My eyes are 
                    not so sharp anymore.

      Ralston comes around to stand in front of her.  He is TALL 
      and HANDSOME, obviously well-to-do... and DISTRAUGHT.  His 
      EYES are RIMMED with TEARS.

                                    RALSTON
                    Mrs. Carnation?  

      She SPITS into a SPITTOON at her side.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Depends on who asks.

      She SQUINTS and EYES him appraisingly as Ralston shuffles 
      uncomfortably.

                                    RALSTON
                    My name is Edward Ralston.  

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                      A handsome man.

                                    RALSTON
                    You are Mrs. Carnation, the 
                      necromancer?

      Miz Carnation stares up at him through cloudy eyes. She 
      FINGERS a fine, very distinctive, filigreed LOCKET in her 
      gnarled old HANDS.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Been many long years since anybody 
                    called me that.

                                    RALSTON
                    But you are she?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Well, let us say I once was she.

                                    RALSTON
                    Madam, I desperately need your 
                    help.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    I cannot help the likes of  so 
                      prosperous a gentleman as you.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   3.

                                    RALSTON
                    But I was told that you could raise 
                    the dead.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Well, you was told wrongly.

                                    RALSTON
                    You cannot raise the dead?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    I will not raise the dead.  Not 
                    even for so comely a gentleman as 
                    yourself.

      Ralston is quaking with desperation, unable to hold back his 
      tears.

                                    RALSTON
                    Madam, I have just come from the 
                    funeral of my beloved wife, 
                    Samantha.  A lovelier, more vibrant 
                    woman you could never hope to meet.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    I am sure your missus was all you 
                    say she was and more.  But let her 
                    go with God and lie in peace.

                                    RALSTON
                    There is no peace in her death!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Believe me, young gentleman, you 
                    surely would not like the 
                      alternative.

                                    RALSTON
                    But you hold the power to bring her 
                    back to me!  I am a man of means; I 
                    shall pay you whatever you require!  
                    A hundred dollars!  Five hundred 
                    dollars!

      The old woman seems to consider it for a moment... or is she 
      just studying him?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    What good is five hundred dollars 
                    to an old woman like myself?

                    Take your five hundred dollars to 
                    some far-off place and make a new 
                    life for yourself.  Grieve and make 
                    amends and start all over again.  
                    Find love again.  It will happen, I 
                    promise.

                                    RALSTON
                    I shall never, ever love again.  I 
                    shall always love my Samantha.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Then celebrate her memory.  I 
                    cannot help you.

                                    RALSTON
                    You are able to help me, and yet 
                    you refuse?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    It is for your own good.  And my 
                    own.  I m all used up.  

                                    RALSTON
                    And why not?  Why will you not help 
                    assuage my grief?  Why will you not 
                    bring back the woman I love to me?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Have you heard the story of young 
                    Ernst Haeckel?

                                    RALSTON
                    What has he to do with this?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Oh, young sir, he has everything to 
                    do with this.  Mayhaps you could 
                    call it a cautionary tale.  If I 
                    tell you my story and you still 
                    wish your beloved Samantha brought 
                    back from the dead, then I shall 
                    gladly grant you your wish... 

                                    RALSTON
                          (excited)
                    Do you mean that?

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    If your love is so great, then yes, 
                    I will bring your wife back to you.

                    No love is greater, I swear to you!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    We shall see, we shall see.  Now.  
                    Sit with your back to the fire, and 
                    I shall tell you my tale.  You are 
                    a tall man, and it hurts my poor 
                    old neck to look up at you.

      Ralston hesitantly takes a seat opposite her.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Rum?
                          (Ralston shakes his head)
                    Ernst Haeckel was a medical student 
                    in Massachusetts.  A cocky young 
                    boy.  He thought he knew it all.  
                     Course, that s what education is 
                    all about, is it not?

      She looks at him through CLOUDED EYES.

                                    RALSTON
                    Do go on.

      She takes a deep breath, as the CAMERA drifts past them 
      toward the reaching FLAMES of the FIREPLACE.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Oh, this was long ago...fifty years 
                    or more. A naive age. Not so filled 
                    with answers as today...

      And as the CAMERA is devoured by FIRE, we:

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      INT. MEDICAL LABORATORY - DAY - 183233

      It is not vast: a simple hall in an 1832 New England medical 
      university.  This is the elite class, sparsely attended by 
      the sharpest minds and highest level of medical student.

      We LOOK DOWN through a HIGH SKYLIGHT on the class below.

      The small LAB is far simpler and more primitive than any of 
      the Frankenstein movies.  However, it hearkens back to them.

      DOCTOR HAUSER, a 60-ish, bitter lemon of a professor, his 
      eyes magnified by owlish GLASSES, stands behind a CADAVER, 
      splayed out in all its bloodless glory before the class, who 
      have moved in for a close look.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Here he is: man, laid out in his 
                    final inglorious chapter.  Devoid 
                    of a soul, all we have left is 
                    flesh, a machine without power, a 
                    mere husk, an empty vessel.  Only 
                    God, in his wisdom, may grant life, 
                    and take it away.  So you, my young 
                    charges, are the instruments of 
                    God s will. The sanctity of life is 
                    in your hands. It is up to you to 
                    serve Him well.

      A 21-year-old student, darkly handsome with a fierce spark of 
        intelligence flaring in his eyes, stands apart.  He is ERNST 
      HAECKEL.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What has God to do with Man?

      All eyes turn toward Haeckel; there is more than one GASP.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Ah, our young heathen.  Why don t 
                    you tell me and the rest of the 
                    class, Mr. Haeckel?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Man and woman procreate to create 
                    life. Accident or disease or old 
                    age take it away.  Your God has 
                    nothing to do with it.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    He is our God, Mr. Haeckel, not my 
                    own.  And He has everything to do 
                    with it.  The creation of life is 
                    divine.  There is no man without 
                    God.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am a man without God, Dr. Hauser.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    You may think so, but you are 
                    wrong.  There is no life without 
                    God.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I take it you are unfamiliar with 
                    the recent experiments in Germany 
                    which have proven otherwise.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    I am well aware of the tales of 
                    Victor Frankenstein, Mr. Haeckel.  
                    They are balderdash at best.  Fairy 
                    tales and wishful thinking.  
                    Scripture tells us:  the Lord 
                    giveth, the Lord taketh away .  God 
                    gives us life, and once He has 
                    taken it away, it is gone for good.  
                    The light of life is extinguished 
                    in the body, leaving the sheath to 
                      decompose.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And you believe that there is no 
                    life after death.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    I believe in an afterlife, but not 
                    in the re-animation of a human 
                    corpse.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Then what on earth do you celebrate 
                    every Easter Sunday?

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    That is an entirely different 
                    matter, young man.  God may 
                      resurrect; man may not.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And I believe that you are wrong, 
                    sir.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    What you believe is of no 
                      consequence to me, my young free-
                    thinker.  Tell it to our good 
                    friend, Mr. Willoughby, here.

      He motions to the gutted CORPSE on the table before him, and 
      the class LAUGHS.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Well, I can prove it, Professor.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   8.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Oh, I ve no doubt that you can 
                      inseminate, Mr. Haeckel.  But it is 
                    God that grants the spark of life.

                                    HAECKEL
                    No, Professor, I mean I can give 
                    life to the dead!

      The class looks at one another, then at the professor, 
      waiting for his reaction.  Hauser merely SMILES, amused.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    I should like to see that.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I imagine you should.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:


      SAME PLACE - THE LAB FLOOR - NIGHT44

      A thunderous, classical LIGHTNING STORM booms outside, the 
      occasional FLASH of LIGHT illuminating the room from the 
      WINDOWS ABOVE.

      The class and Dr. Hauser have gathered around, and Haeckel 
      WHEELS IN a GURNEY with a sheet-covered BODY on it.  Hauser 
      chooses to stand at the back and watch Haeckel make a fool of 
      himself.

      Haeckel proudly YANKS the SHEET off of the CORPSE: an 
      attractive young FEMALE, pale and naked in the moonlight.  He 
      fastens ELECTRODES to her TEMPLES, checks dials and switches 
      and all kinds of very scientific-looking (for 1832) details.

                                    HAECKEL
                    This unfortunate young lady died of 
                      consumption over a week ago.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    How did you acquire her body?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Does it really matter?

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    It matters a great deal, young man.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   9.

        CONTINUED:44


                                    HAECKEL
                    And where does the University 
                    acquire its cadavers?

                                  DR. HAUSER
                          (staring him down)
                    From accredited legal sources.

      Haeckel just SNORTS, turning from him.  Hauser narrows his 
      eyes.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Your father is a wise and pious 
                    man, Mr. Haeckel. Surely he does 
                    not approve of this blasphemy.

      Haeckel turns to Hauser, and his eyes spark with an anger 
      that overrides an obvious pain.

                                    HAECKEL
                    You know nothing of my father! My 
                    father approves of the truth!

      He turns from the professor and regains his focus and 
      dignity. Mention of his father has thrown him.

      Outside the windows, the storm rages, as in a Frankenstein 
      movie.  Thick, woven ELECTRICAL CABLES run from the windows 
      to the LAB EQUIPMENT, and then to the DEAD WOMAN S TEMPLES.  
      LIGHTNING strikes, and the ELECTRICITY surges the length of 
      the CABLES in dangerous pulses.

      Haeckel moves to the corpse, focussing on the building 
      excitement here.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I have been following the notes of 
                    the German scientist quite 
                      specifically, and have been able to 
                    harness the electrical power of the 
                      lightning.  My challenge has been 
                    to channel that power through these 
                    copper ropes and into the body, and 
                    thereby ignite the spark of life.  
                    This girl shall live again.

      He fusses with his dials and controls as ELECTRICITY CRACKLES 
      through the room... and the young woman s BODY.  Her HAIR, 
      charged with STATIC ELECTRICITY, RISES from her HEAD.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   9A.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (filled with excitement)
                    Now... watch!

      Haeckel THROWS a MASTER SWITCH, and giant electrical currents 
      rush through her body.

      The CORPSE starts to JERK and TWITCH like a frog on a 
      skillet, and the excitement in the room is building, the awe-
      filled faces caught in the constant FLASHES of LIGHTNING.

      Suddenly the young woman s eyes pop wide open and for a brief 
      moment it appears as if Haeckel s experiment is a success.

      Then, in a sudden surge, the young woman s BODY is caught in 
      a giant electrical BURST, and IGNITES into flames!  

      The ELECTRICAL POWER dies, throwing the room into SHADOWS, 
      lit only by candlelight, the LIGHTNING through the windows, 
      and the FLAMES enveloping the corpse.

      Haeckel frantically puts out the fire with a blanket, but 
      when it is out, all that is left on the gurney is the 
      hideously charred remains.

      The room is thick with the DARK SMOKE of her burned body.

      It is Dr. Hauser who breaks the silence:

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Well, it appears divinity is still 
                    a ways off for you, is it not, Mr. 
                    Haeckel?

      The crowd of students break into laughter, and Haeckel 
      smolders...

                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE 
                                                                                  TO:


      SAME PLACE - NIGHT - LATER55



      HAECKEL is alone in the lab. He gently places the charred 
      remains of the young woman into the open FURNACE built into 
      the wall of the lab.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (to the corpse)
                    I am so sorry...

      There is a light TAP on the door, and Haeckel looks up from 
      the BODY in the furnace.  

      The door opens to reveal CHESTER FLANNIGAN, a seedy gent who 
      is covered in rain that has soaked through his OVERCOAT. 
      Chester is middle-aged, with the CHERRY NOSE of a brandy 
      drinker, lathered with a week s beard.  He pulls a WOODEN 
      CART into the lab behind him.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Oh, hello, Chester.

                                    CHESTER
                    Good evening sir. And how fares 
                    your father?...the elder Dr. 
                    Haeckel? I m hoping his condition 
                    is improved.

      Haeckel s face DARKENS. His voice cracks with emotion.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   11.

                                    HAECKEL
                    He s not well, Chester.  Not well 
                    at all.



                                    CHESTER
                    Well.  You give him my best wishes 
                    and salutations for me, will you?

      Chester sees the still-smoldering remains in the furnace.

                                    CHESTER
                    Oh, my.  Is that--?

      Haeckel nods.

                                    CHESTER
                    Still dead, hey Mr. Ernst?

      Haeckel just glares at him.

                                    CHESTER
                    You re lucky I m here.  Got some 
                    good beef with me tonight.

      He pulls the TARPAULIN off of his CART to reveal the recently 
      exhumed CORPSE within: a middle-aged MAN, streaked with the 
      dirt of his GRAVE.

                                    CHESTER
                      Pneumonia.  Just last night.  And a 
                    real bargain at ten dollars.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Not tonight, Chester.

                                    CHESTER
                    Money s tight, is it, Mr. Ernst?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Always.  Ten dollars or a hundred-- 
                    even a thousand.  I ve failed.  The 
                    key to life after death is still 
                    beyond my reach.

      The new corpse lies in Chester s cart, staring at Haeckel, 
      almost accusingly.

                                    CHESTER
                    Well, chin up, sir.  You re a young

                    mysteries of life and death before 
                    you have shuffled off this mortal 
                    coil, right?

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am in no mood for sarcasm, 
                    Chester.

                          (sarcastic)

                                    HAECKEL
                    Yes, Chester.  You.

                                    CHESTER
                    Well, if it s life after death you 
                    seek, should you not speak with the 
                      necromancer?

                                    HAECKEL
                    I place no faith in magic and the 
                      supernatural.  I believe in science 
                    not fairy stories.

                                    CHESTER
                    Well, Mr. Haeckel, I am a simple, 
                      uneducated man.  Science and magic 
                    seem one of a kind to me.  I saw 
                      Montesquino the necromancer down to 
                    the park of a weekend, and his 
                    magic seemed pretty scientifical to 
                    me, young sir.  He made the dead 
                    rise.  But as I said, I m not so 
                      sophisticated as you... but I think 
                    that we should be careful when we 
                    talk about necromancers.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Why should we be careful of a 
                    little English prick who preys on 
                    our women?  Good lord, he s 
                      practically stealing from their 
                    purses!  Claiming he can raise the 
                    dead!

                                    CHESTER

                    you and not he?

                    I believe the evidence of my eyes, 
                    young master, and I saw what I take 
                    to be proof that such crafts as 
                    this Montesquino professes are 
                    real.  I should not dismiss it out 
                    of hand.  Mayhaps you should see 
                    for yourself.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY66

      A small CROWD has gathered under hand-painted BANNERS 
      surrounding an enclosed WOODEN WAGON.  They proclaim  The 
      Great Montesquino, Necromancer .  

      FERDINAND MONTESQUINO is a middle-aged, corpulent gent in a 
      frayed TOP HAT and long MOUSTACHE.  His SUIT was once fine, 
      but now is too tight, and stretched at the seams.

      Young Ernst Haeckel wends his way through the small crowd as 
      Montesquino waxes theatrical, his British accent mellifluous 
      and flowery.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    What is the line between life and 
                    death, between darkness and light, 
                    between existence and infinity?  I 
                    am here to tell you that the dead 
                    can live again!  I possess that 
                    mystical secret, held until now 
                    only by the sacred shaman of 
                    Zanzibar.  It came to me at great 
                    cost, and it is not a power I use 
                    lightly.  With power comes great 
                      responsibility.  Each life I grant 
                    takes a year off of my own.  But 
                    because of the sacred trust I hold, 
                    it is well worth it.

      He looks around the tiny audience, his eyes rimmed with last 
      night s debauchery.  His gaze falls upon the doubting face of 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I sense disbelief among you.

      He grins, his eyes not leaving Haeckel, revealing a horribly 
      aligned, snaggled set of teeth.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   14.

        CONTINUED:66

      He leans right down in Haeckel s face, the stench of his 
      breath practically knocking him unconscious.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    You, sir.  I expect an educated 
                    young man like you would require 
                    proof of such a proclamation.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I would, indeed, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    And what would convince you of my 
                    powers?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Not this sideshow, Professor 
                      Montesquino.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I ask again.  What proof would you 
                    require that I tell the truth?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Nothing less than to see the dead 
                    revived before my own eyes.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    And so you shall have it, young 
                    man!

      He moves to the back of the little PLATFORM and drags a 
      WICKER BOX to the front of the little makeshift stage.

      The people in the crowd crane their necks to see what s 
      inside.  With a grand flourish, Montesquino reaches down to 
      the lid of the box.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Behold... DEATH!

      He PULLS the top off the box and leans it forward to reveal a 
      DEAD DOG within, obviously road kill, horribly mangled by the 
      wheels of a CART or WAGON.  The thing s a mess.

      The crowd GASPS and takes a step back.  All except for 
      Haeckel, who has seen more than his share of death up close.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (to Haeckel)
                    The miserable cur is dead, is it 
                    not?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   15.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (with a smile)
                    Quite dead, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Just so.

      His hands gesture theatrically in florid and arcane 
      movements.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (chanting)
                    Vobiscum botanicum; terra firma 
                      romanticum.  Magicus validus; 
                    animus activus, funero exsanguinis.  
                    Miraculum spectaculum!

      A HUSH falls over the paltry crowd, and the silence that 
      ensues is long and expectant.  

      Nothing happens.

      The crowd moves in a little closer, and Haeckel SMILES, 
      enjoying the old fraud s act.

      And then, the wicker basket suddenly JERKS!

      The crowd pulls back, except for Haeckel.  Then it JERKS 
      AGAIN!

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Behold: LIFE AFTER DEATH!

      The wicker box SHIVERS and SHAKES, and then, from within it 
      comes a low, MOURNFUL HOWL.  It grows in intensity: hideous, 
      agonizing.

      CRIES from the crowd:  Kill it!    Put it out of its misery!   
       Poor beast!   Etc.

      The unbelieving Haeckel gets right up close to the basket. 

      As he starts to REACH for the LID, it suddenly JOLTS OPEN, 
      and the RE-ANIMATED DEAD DOG within LURCHES OUT, and SNAPS at 
      him with BLOODY, FROTHING TEETH, just missing getting hold of 
      his HAND!

      Haeckel LEAPS BACK as Montesquino KICKS the undead beast and 
      FIRES A BULLET into its brain.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   16.

      CONTINUED: (3)66


      The DEAD DOG flops back into the wicker basket, and 
      Montesquino drops the lid into place.  The basket, this time, 
      remains STILL.

      As Haeckel quakes from his close call, Montesquino leans down 
      and grabs him by his shoulders, bringing him face to fearsome 
      face.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Do you believe your own eyes, young 
                    man?

      This close, the necromancer s EYES are BLEARY and BLOODSHOT, 
      his stubble mottled with grey, and his BREATH muscular.  
      Haeckel cannot answer him.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (to the crowd)
                    To resurrect a simple beast is not 
                    so taxing as to bring back a human 
                    being, a man with a soul.  Compared 
                    to that, this is merely a parlor 
                    trick.  Man is far more complex.

                                    HAECKEL
                    So you re saying a dog doesn t have 
                    a soul?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I am, young sir.

      FARON and RACHEL MAYBERRY, a young couple of obviously meager 
      means, approach the front of Montesquino s platform, timid 
      and vulnerable.

                                  FARON
                    Professor Montesquino...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    My good man...

                                  FARON
                    My wife and I... we... we lost our 
                    little girl to diptheria in the 
                    summer.  She was but three years 
                    old.  And we... and we wondered if 
                    you could... if you might...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    You want me to bring her back.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Do you have a hundred dollars?

                                  FARON
                    Oh, no, sir, nowhere near...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    How much do you think a year of my 
                    life is worth?

                                  FARON
                    We wouldn t know, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I should say it s worth more than a 
                    hundred dollars.  Could you get a 
                    hundred dollars?

                                  RACHEL
                    Not in a million years, sir.  But 
                    we were hoping that as a good 
                    Christian you might find it in the 
                    goodness of your heart...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I m sorry.  Find one hundred 
                    dollars, and I can bring your 
                    little girl back to you.  I am not 
                      a charity.
                          (turning to the crowd)
                    Now, then; who else would like to 
                    have their late, bereaved loved 
                    ones back in their arms again?

      The crowd looks at one another.  Montesquino looks at 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    What about you, young man?

      Haeckel, for once, is speechless.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE SAME PLACE - THAT NIGHT77

      A CAMPFIRE is burning as Montesquino cooks a GAME FOWL for 
      his supper when Haeckel approaches.

                          (looking up)
                    Ah, the young Doubting Thomas.  A 
                    good evening to you.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And to you.  

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    As delighted as I am to see you, I 
                    am having my supper.  Perhaps you 
                    could return in the morning.

                                    HAECKEL
                    My name is Ernst Haeckel.  I am a 
                    medical student at the University, 
                    and I wish to inquire of your ways.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Ah, a man of science.  Well, 
                    perhaps a boy of science.  

      He LAUGHS.  That doesn t sit well with the already defensive 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I am absolutely thrilled to meet 
                    you, Mr. Haeckel.  However, I am 
                    not here to instruct you.  My 
                    knowledge came over many years of 
                    intense instruction, at great risk 
                    to my own life and limb.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am willing to take risks.

      He pulls a BOTTLE of WHISKEY out of a SACK and hands it to 
        Montesquino.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Are you, indeed?
                          (taking the bottle)
                    The costs are greater than a bottle 
                    of whiskey.  I know you do not 
                    believe in my ways.  You think 
                      necromancy is twaddle, a sideshow 
                    for the gullible.

                    The dog: an excellent trick.

      Montesquino just raises his eyebrows.

                                    HAECKEL
                    You threw your voice, did you not?  
                    And the movements of the dead

                                    HAECKEL
                    Well, surely necromancy cannot be 
                    real.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I see.  If you say it cannot, then 
                    surely it cannot.  Who could argue 
                    with the likes of such a brilliant, 
                    educated young man as yourself?

                                    HAECKEL
                    So you do not even argue with me?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I do not.  I am tired, and wish to 
                    sleep.  Sweet dreams, young man, 
                    and thanks for the bottle.

      He kicks dirt over the fire, and retires into the WAGON, and 
      Haeckel leaves in frustration.


      INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY88

      As Professor Hauser drones on and works from the dissected 
      CADAVER in front of him, Haeckel remains at the back of the 
      room.  He s not paying any attention to the lecture; he pores 
      over the NOTES and ILLUSTRATIONS in his NOTEBOOK.

      There are complicated DIAGRAMS and crude DRAWINGS both 
      anatomical and electrical.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   20.

      He is startled from his studies when a HAND gently falls on 
      his SHOULDER.  He jumps a mile, but it s just a YOUNG WOMAN 
      from the office; she hands him a LETTER sealed in wax.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                            (whispering)
                    Mr. Haeckel...

                                    HAECKEL
                            (recovering)
                    What is it?

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    I...I am told it concerns your 
                    father.

      He takes the ENVELOPE from her, and stares at it nervously, 
      as the young woman stands by for a reply.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Thank you.

      The young woman EXITS, and Haeckel stares at the LETTER, as 
      his hands start to shake.  It is news he s been dreading.  
      Finally, he UNSEALS it and READS.

      THE LETTER (accompanied by the VOICE of DR. HARTWELL):  My 
      dearest Master Haeckel: your father s illness has taken a 
      turn for the worse.  His malaise has turned much more 
      serious, and the prognosis is not optimistic.  He may only 
      have a matter of days remaining.  He wishes to see you before 
      he passes.  Signed, Dr. Alfred Hartwell. 

      Haeckel s EYES start to fill with TEARS.  He CRUMPLES the 
      letter and EXITS the lecture hall, as all eyes turn to watch 
      him go.

                                  DR. HAUSER
                    Mr. Haeckel?

      But he is already gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY99

      Ernst Haeckel makes his way through the verdant countryside, 
      carrying a CARPET DUFFEL of his belongings over his shoulder.  
      CLOUDS roil ominously overhead.

      The farmer s DOG BARKS ferociously at Haeckel, and the farmer 
      makes no move to shut him up.

      Haeckel walks to and past us; he has a long way to go.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. ANOTHER COUNTRY ROAD - DAY1010

      The sun is setting, and the DRIZZLE of RAIN is soaking 
      through Haeckel s COAT.  It s a miserable journey.

      There is a DRY SPOT up ahead, under the vast TREE that 
      overhangs the road.  Haeckel makes his way to the shelter of 
      the tree, and sits on the soft MOSS beneath it.

      Dark shadows of worry and sleeplessness are under his eyes as 
      he stares out at the long road before him.

      He opens his DUFFEL and takes out a large LOAF of BREAD.  He 
      TEARS OFF a HUNK, and takes a big bite.  Delicious.

      But there is a strange SMELL: Haeckel looks around to see 
      where it is coming from.  Seeing nothing, he digs back in, 
      famished.

      Just as he is about to take another bite, something DARK and 
      WET drips onto it, right before it enters his mouth.

      DRIP.  And another.  DRIP.

      A BREEZE has kicked up, and Haeckel looks up above him.


      ANGLE - HAECKEL S P.O.V.

      A BODY is HANGING by the NECK from a stout branch above him, 
      dripping castoff FLUIDS.  A hand-scrawled BOARD hangs from 
      his neck:  PEDERAST .


      ANGLE - OVER THE BODY, LOOKING DOWN ON HAECKEL

      Haeckel stares up in horror at the HANGED CRIMINAL leaking on 
      him from overhead.

      The ROPE and BRANCH GROAN in the breeze.

      RESUME HAECKEL S POV (THIS SHOT IS OPTIONAL)

      As a LARGE DRIP falls in SLOW MOTION and hits him in the eye.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   22.

      CONTINUED:1010





      He leaps to his feet and casts the chunk of bread to the 
      ground.  Not the best place to set up camp, after all.  

      Pulling his coat up over his head, Haeckel sets back out on 
      the road.


      MONTAGE (2ND UNIT):1111

      Three angles of Haeckel s journey on foot: A COUNTRY ROAD, A 
      GREEN HILLSIDE, A RICKETY FOOTBRIDGE.  He is all alone, Man 
      vs. Nature.


      EXT. ANOTHER COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT1212

      It is RAINING, and Haeckel is miserable.  

      He comes to a ROCK WALL against the GRAVEL ROAD, and sits to 
      rest on the soft grass against it.  He looks even worse than 
      before.  He is SNIFFLING and in a foul temper.  

      There is a protective natural OVERHANG that provides a dry 
      area for him to rest.

      It is dead silent as he unrolls a BLANKET from his DUFFEL.  
      He collects STICKS and BRANCHES, and proceeds to BUILD a 
      FIRE.

      He sits on the blanket and takes out a HUNK of the hard 
      BREAD.  He starts to eat it, starving.

      A DADDY LONG-LEGS SPIDER starts to crawl on his arm, and he 
      stares at it.  He lets it crawl the length of his arm and 
      onto his hand, watching it, bemused, as it crawls into his 
      palm.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Life...
                          (crushing it in his hand)
                    ... and death.

      He opens his hand and stares at the crumpled remains of the 
      creature.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   23.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And one day, I shall be able to 
                    bring you back...

      He takes a long PULL from the BLADDER filled with WATER, then 
      corks it and gathers MOSS for a pillow.

      The STORM is getting worse, and LIGHTNING is FLASHING.

      As he puts his MOSS into place, some of the ROCKS from the 
      WALL give way and TUMBLE to the ground, revealing:

      A small BAT S SKELETON, falling onto his new pillow!

      Haeckel backs away, into:

      An OLD MAN, standing right behind him!

                                    HAECKEL
                    Jesus!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    My deepest apologies, young sir.  I 
                    did not mean to cause you fright.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (calming down)
                    You startled me...

      The old man, WALTER WOLFRAM, is stubbled and shabby.  One EYE 
      is clouded with CATARACT, but his TEETH are clean and even.  
      WOODEN FALSIES, we might guess.  An enormous UMBRELLA keeps 
      the rain from dumping on him.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It would not be wise for you to 
                    sleep here tonight.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am tired, and I am not going to 
                    move an inch.  This is an open 
                    road.  I have every right to sleep 
                    here if I wish to.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Of course you do.  I did not say 
                    the right was not yours.  I simply 
                    said it was not wise.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I m sorry.  I m cold and I m tired 
                    and I m hungry.  I meant no insult.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   24.

                      A pleasure to make your 
                      acquaintance.

      He reaches out his hand, and Haeckel clasps it.

                                    HAECKEL
                    My name is Ernst Haeckel.  I m on 
                    my way to Windsor.  My father is... 
                          (choking on it)
                    ... quite ill.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Please, come with me; I live 
                    nearby. I can offer you a warm, dry 
                    bed, a proper fire, some hot potato 
                    soup.

      Haeckel can t believe his good fortune.

                                    HAECKEL
                    An offer I shan t decline.  Many 
                    thanks to you, sir.

      Haeckel rolls up the blanket and stuffs it into his rucksack 
      with his other belongings as Wolfram watches him with an 
      inscrutable face.

      Haeckel looks up to see the man staring at him, and Wolfram 
      looks away.  As he finishes packing up:

                                    HAECKEL
                    Why do you think it unwise for me 
                    to sleep in this place?

      Wolfram gives him a deep, sorrowful, heart-breaking look.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    You are a young man, and no doubt 
                    you do not fear the workings of the 
                    world.  But please believe me when 
                    I tell you there are nights when it 
                    is good not to sleep next to a 
                    place where the dead are laid.

                                    HAECKEL
                    The dead?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Aye.  Their home.  The necropolis.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   25.

      He motions to a view over the stone wall to reveal, in a 
      FLASH of blinding LIGHTNING:

      Laid out before them is a CEMETERY, filled with cockeyed 
      stone GRAVE MARKERS, twined with VINES.  It s the essence of 
      every creepy GRAVEYARD from the classic HORROR MOVIES.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am a medical student.  I do not 
                    fear the dead.

      His expression says otherwise.

      The RAIN slows to a halt and the SKY begins to CLEAR, 
      revealing a MOON that illuminates the shining, wet GRAVEYARD 
      in all its glory.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Then I suppose you are a lucky man.  
                    Come.


      WIDE ANGLE - CEMETERY1313

      The old codger leads Haeckel out across the Necropolis in the 
      silvery MOONLIGHT, their BODIES and the GRAVESTONES casting 
      LONG SHADOWS.  The MOON frowns down on them from behind the 
      parting CLOUDS.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOLFRAM S COTTAGE - NIGHT1414

      The little FARMHOUSE is nestled in GREENERY, sparkling from 
      the RAIN that has just passed.  The moon s BLUE LIGHT makes 
      it particularly magical.

      The WINDOWS are WARM with FIRELIGHT as Wolfram leads Haeckel 
      to the door, leaving the GRAVEYARD far behind them.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It is not much, but it is warm and 
                    dry.

      And he opens the door to their sanctuary.


      INT. WOLFRAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT1515

      A warm FIRE is burning in the hearth, with a large KETTLE of 
      SOUP over it as they ENTER.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   26.

      But most inviting of all is the BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN who 
      greets them: she is ELISE WOLFRAM, 22 years old, and 
      astonishingly, voluptuously beautiful.  Chestnut hair, full 
      of figure, lush and desirable.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise, this is Ernst Haeckel.  
                    He ll be staying with us tonight.  
                    Mr. Haeckel, this is my wife, 
                    Elise.

      Haeckel is stunned, first by her beauty, second by her 
      matrimonial status.  He can t help but to STARE at her.  He 
      GLANCES over to Walter, but the old man doesn t seem to 
      notice the immediate attraction... infatuation.

      Haeckel extends his HAND, and when their hands meet, the 
      sensation is ELECTRICAL.

                                    HAECKEL
                    A great pleasure to meet you.

      Elise merely nods silently and sweetly.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise, get young Mr. Haeckel some 
                    soup and wine.  He has been out in 
                    the cruelty of the elements for 
                    several days.

      Haeckel can t take his eyes off of her as she bends over the 
      KETTLE to serve up his soup and reaches into the cabinet to 
      fetch him wine.

      Walter seems not to pay attention.  He keeps glancing at the 
      CLOCK on the MANTEL-- and the simple PAINTING of a HANDSOME 
      YOUNG MAN next to it-- then out the window into the dark, 
      blue NIGHT.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:


      SAME PLACE - LATER1616

      They all sit at the heavy wooden TABLE behind BOWLS of SOUP 
      and GLASSES of WINE.  Haeckel has already finished his first

                    Young Mr. Haeckel is on his way to 
                    Windsor.  His father is ill, maybe 
                    dying.

      Haeckel CHOKES on his SOUP.

                                  ELISE
                    I m sorry.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I hope not dying.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    My apologies.  Of course.  I 
                      misunderstood.  The young man is a 
                    student at the university.

                                  ELISE
                    What do you study?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Medicine.  I m studying to be a 
                      physician.

                                  ELISE
                    To save your father s life?

      She seems simple... something a little off-kilter about her.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Yes, yes, I hope so.  Among others.

      Wolfram sees Haeckel s attraction to his wife, but it doesn t 
      seem to matter much to him.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Mr. Haeckel needs more wine, Elise.

      Elise doesn t look at her husband.

                                  ELISE
                    Of course.

      Wolfram watches Haeckel watch his wife.  Haeckel turns to see 
      that he is being observed.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    She s lovely, isn t she?

                                    HAECKEL
                    She s a charming woman.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Oh, she s much more than that, and 
                    it will not inflame me for you to 
                    say so.

                    I know what you are thinking.  How 
                    do I, an old man with a small farm 
                    on the edge of a graveyard in the 
                    middle of nowhere, deserve this 
                    lovely young lady as a wife?

                                    HAECKEL
                    I thought nothing of the sort.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Liar.

      Wolfram glances up again at the CLOCK on the MANTEL.  It is 
      close to 11 p.m.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Sir, I--

                                    WOLFRAM
                    A white lie.  I do not take 
                    offense.  Let me just say this: the 
                    ways of love are mysterious.

      His speech is heavy with irony.  But we don t know what his 
      point is.

      He looks up to see Elise standing at the WINDOW, staring out 
      longingly into the night... for what? There seem to be TEARS 
      in her eyes.

      She looks again to the MANTEL: at the CLOCK or at the 
      PAINTING?

      Wolfram takes another sip of his WINE, and Haeckel follows 
      suit.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Are you a married man, Mr. Haeckel?

                                    HAECKEL
                    No, sir.  I am quite unattached.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Are you in love?

                                    HAECKEL
                          (getting uncomfortable)
                    Not at present, no.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Have you ever been in love?

      Wolfram smiles without humor, and takes another long drink of 
      his wine.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise!  The young man has no time 
                    for love.

      Elise turns from the window; something beyond is gnawing at 
      her.

                                  ELISE
                    Yes?

      She is even more lovely in the glowing LIGHT of the FIRE.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Bring us more wine.  And join us.

      Elsie, clearly distracted, obeys her husband.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I believe I ve had enough wine.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Nonsense.  It is no substitute for 
                    love, but it will warm you on a 
                    cold, wet night, right, Elise?

      She returns to the TABLE and refills their WINEGLASSES.

                                  ELISE
                    You have never known love?

      Haeckel is embarrassed.  He s in the throes of love right 
      now.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Only fleetingly, I m afraid.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Better fleetingly than not at all, 
                    eh?

      Strangely, he s staring at Elise as he speaks.  She casts her 
      secretive, melancholy EYES away. Haeckel, unable to take his 
      eyes off of her, takes another long drink from his wine.

      He s getting heavy-lidded with fatigue.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Mr. Haeckel is a fine-looking young 
                    man, is he not, Elise?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   30.

      Elise looks at Ernst, as if for the first time.  Then looks 
      at Wolfram, trying to figure out what he s getting at.

                                  ELISE
                    Yes, a very handsome man.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    And well-read.  The most eligible 
                    of bachelors.  A shame.  Surely 
                    you ve experienced physical love, 
                    have you not, Mr. Haeckel?

      Elise glares at her husband as Haeckel twists in awkward 
      discomfort.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am sorry, sir, but your question 
                    breaches propriety.

                                    WOLFRAM
                      I apologize if my simple 
                      conversation has made you 
                      uncomfortable.  Let us just blame 
                    it on the wine, shall we?

        Embarrassed, Elise rises from the table and collects the 
      bowls and glasses.  She takes them to the sink, then stops 
      and stands at the window, her hands against the glass, 
      staring again out into the night.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I feel very tired.  I should like 
                    to go to bed, if you don t mind.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Of course not.  Elise, make up the 
                    bed for Mr. Haeckel.

      She pulls herself from the window, and leads Haeckel to an 
      adjoining room.


      INT. SPARE ROOM AT THE WOLFRAM HOUSE - NIGHT1717

      THUNDER rumbles distantly, as RAIN patters on the roof.  
      Distant LIGHTNING flickers soft light through the window.  
      You can see into the LIVING ROOM from here.

      Elise leads Haeckel into the room, and makes up the 
      bedclothes.  Haeckel stands right behind her, and when she 
      finishes and stands up, they are almost touching.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   31.

      They face one another, their faces heated by the glow of the 
      FIREPLACE in the corner.  Their proximity is charged with 
      silent sexuality.

                                  ELISE
                    I hope you will be comfortable 
                    here.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am sure I will be, thank you.

      There is a long, uncomfortable BEAT.  She is about to leave.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Certainly better than out under an 
                    old oak tree in the rain.

      He attempts a smile.  She doesn t.  But she doesn t leave, 
      either, at least for a moment.

      Then, she turns to look outside, and Haeckel takes her hand.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What are you looking for?

      She just shakes her head and looks away.

      Her hand still in his, Haeckel s VOICE drops to a whisper.

                                    HAECKEL
                    You are a lovely woman, Elise.

                                  ELISE
                    I-- I must go now.

      He releases her HAND, and she turns and goes back out into 
      the living room, as Haeckel watches her from behind the 
      partly-closed door.

      She has set his heart to fluttering.

      He turns away, and begins to UNDRESS, taking off his muddy 
      BOOTS and WET SOCKS.  

      He pulls his SHIRT over his head, and when he turns back, he 
      sees Elise on the far side of the room, in front of the 
      window... staring out at God knows what.

      He can see the FLUSH of COLOR in her face.  There is a light 
      SHEEN of perspiration on her face and chest, as she lightly 
      runs her hand down over her stomach and feels the cleft 
      between her legs.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   32.

      CONTINUED: (2)1717


      Fascinated and excited and confused by the sight, Haeckel 
      cannot tear his eyes away.  And then... Elise TURNS, and 
      their EYES LOCK.  She seems in a TRANCE.  Then:

      Suddenly aware of what she is doing, she turns to peer once 
      again out the window.

      Entranced by her, Haeckel watches her, hoping she ll turn 
      back to him, but it s a futile hope.

      Soon, he gives in to exhaustion, and settles back on the bed 
      to SLEEP.

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK

      INT. BEDROOM - LATER1818

      The FIRE in the FIREPLACE is down to EMBERS, and the room is 
      DARK.  There is a low, THUMPING SOUND, awakening Haeckel.  
      His HEAD is thick with wine and sleep, his eyes bleary, 
      barely conscious.

      He looks up through the door, which is ajar, into the living 
      room.


      ANGLE - HAECKEL S P.O.V.

      The view is bleary, blurry, unstable.  On the far side of the 
      room, Walter opens the door to a SILHOUETTED STRANGER in a 
      DARK CLOAK.  There is WHISPERED CONVERSATION that cannot be 
      heard, and what seems to be an exchange of money.  

      There s something really creepy about him.  And FAMILIAR...

      Walter closes the door, and the house is quiet again.


      RESUME HAECKEL

      Haeckel, barely conscious, goes back to sleep, and we:

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT1919


      RESUME HAECKEL

      He s sound asleep again.  But there is another sound: a low, 
      mewling ANIMAL sound.  A CRY.

      It wakes Haeckel, and sends a chill up his spine.


2020INTERCUT: HAECKEL S ROOM AND HAECKEL S P.O.V. OF LIVING   
      ROOM - NIGHT

      He looks up through the cracked-open DOOR to see Elise 
      standing in front of the MANTEL, staring out the WINDOW. Her 
      HANDS rest on the FRAMED PORTRAIT of the HANDSOME MAN.

      Soon it becomes apparent that the SOUND is a CRYING BABY... 
      but not the normal sound of a baby s cries; they are oddly 
      twisted, inhuman.  There is something profoundly haunting 
      about the sound.

      Walter calls out to Elise in a harsh whisper.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise!  Pull yourself away from the 
                    window and see to the baby!
                          (she doesn t answer)
                    Elise!  The baby!

      She gives some sort of guttural REPLY.  Something about her 
      has changed: her HAIR is WILD, her SKIN flushed and mottled, 
      her TEETH pulled back in a grimace, her VOICE barely human.

      Her HAND is RUBBING at the place between her legs, and she is 
      in a FEVER... as if an inmate in a madhouse.

                                  ELISE
                          (rough, hoarse)
                    It has been a full year!  I cannot 
                    wait any longer!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Patience.  He has the money; 
                      everything is being taken care of.  
                    Now go and look after the child.

      She leaves the frame, and the sounds of the child s cries 
      subside.

      Haeckel doesn t dare make a sound; he avoids all attention.

      He catches another glimpse of Elise and the back of the head 
      of the CHILD in her arms.  The sight of the child NURSING at 
      her bountiful BREAST raises Haeckel s temperature, and turns 
      her appearance from fearsome to erotic.

      Haeckel s BREATH is heated.

      Then she is out of sight again, and we HEAR the contented 
      mewling of the nursing baby.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Make sure he s had enough before 
                    you put him down.  I don t want him 
                    waking and crying for you when you 
                    are gone.

      It is QUIET again within the little house, but all Haeckel 
      (and we) can see is Wolfram watching his wife and baby off-
      camera.

      In the distance, the mournful CRY of a DOG: much like the 
      agonized howling of the revived animal at Montesquino s 
      sideshow.  It filters through the night sky like a knife 
      through the heart.

      As Haeckel watches, Elise comes from the baby s room, empty-
      handed, and goes to the door.  Walter steps into her way.  
      She shoves him aside, and they WHISPER to one another, 
      seeming to ARGUE.

      They cast LOOKS back to the room where Haeckel is  sleeping , 
      and he CLOSES his EYES to feign sleep.

      Soon enough, Elise LEAVES the house, shutting the door 
      quietly in her wake.

      Walter watches her go through the WINDOW, with a long and 
      mournful stare.  We can see his deep, impossible, mournful 
      love for her in his rheumy eyes.

      Then he goes and sits in his chair before the fire, with a 
      bottle.  He takes a long drink, staring into the fire, then 
      pours another, downing it noisily.

      He begins to MUTTER to himself, the mutterings soon becoming 
      TEARFUL.  It s not long before he is SOBBING to himself.                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   35.




      INCLUDE LIVING ROOM2121

      Haeckel cannot bear this any longer.  He gently rises from 
      his bed, and approaches the old man.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Mr. Wolfram.  What is going on 
                    here?

                                    WOLFRAM
                          (though his tears)
                    Oh, my friend!  I could not begin 
                    to explain.  This is a night of 
                      unutterable sadness.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Would you prefer that I left you to 
                    your tears?

      He starts to walk toward the FRONT DOOR-- and Elise-- and 
      Walter suddenly GRABS his WRIST.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    No!  I do not want you to go out 
                    after her now.

      An awkward moment as the old man holds Haeckel there by the 
      wrist, staring into his eyes.  Finally, with a sigh, he drops 
      Haeckel s hand and turns his gaze into the fire again.

                                    HAECKEL
                    The man who came to the door...

      Wolfram looks up at him, his eyes wide... with fear?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Who is he?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    His name is Montesquino.  Doctor 
                      Montesquino.  He is an Englishman 
                    of my acquaintance.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (gently prodding)
                    And a friend of your wife s.

      Wolfram s expression turns steely.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   36.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    No.  It is not what you surmise.
                          (taking another drink)
                    You are supposing they are lovers.  
                    But they are not.  Elise has not 
                    the slightest interest in the 
                    company of Doctor Montesquino, 
                    believe me.  Nor indeed in any 
                    visitor to this house.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Sir, if you mean--

      Walter waves away his protestations.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Do not concern yourself.  I took no 
                    offense at the looks you gave my 
                    wife.  How could you not?  She is a 
                    beautiful woman, and I should be 
                    surprised if a young man such as 
                    yourself did not try to seduce her.  
                    At least in the heart.  But let me 
                    tell you, my friend...
                          (eyes filling with tears 
                            again)
                    You could never satisfy her.
                          (mostly to himself)
                    Neither, of course, could I.  When 
                    I married her, I was already too 
                    old to be a husband to her in the 
                    truest sense.

                                    HAECKEL
                    But you have a baby.

      The HOWLING of the DOG drifts through the night again, and 
      Walter takes another long look out the window.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    The boy isn t mine.

                                    HAECKEL
                    So... you are raising this infant, 
                    even though he is not your own?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Yes.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And where is the child s father?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I am afraid he is dead.  She was 
                    pregnant when we met, and I offered 
                    to raise the baby as if it were my 
                    very own.

      Beat.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Then you are a very noble man.

      Wolfram tosses him a contradictory look.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I am guilty of many things, but 
                    never have I been accused of 
                    nobility.

      He sinks under the weight of self-loathing, moving closer to 
      the fire as if to burn out the sins we don t know of.

                                    WOLFRAM
                          (miserable)
                    She so loved her husband.
                          (looking up at Haeckel)
                    Still does, to this day...No other 
                    man could ever fulfill her.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (shifting gears)
                    I have met this Doctor Montesquino.  
                    He claims to be a necromancer.  He 
                    claims to be able to raise the 
                    dead.  The man is a charlatan.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    The esteemed Doctor Montesquino 
                    deals in a science which I do not 
                    profess to understand.  But the man 
                    is not a charlatan.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (getting animated)
                    Have you paid this necromancer so 
                    that Elise could speak to the dead 
                    man who fathered her baby?

      Wolfram just shakes his head; there is no way Haeckel could 
      understand.  He stares miserably out the window.

                    It is not a trick.  Would that it 
                    were.  What the man does is real,

                    you need ever--

      Their conversation is interrupted by a CRY.  Elise s SOB 
      carries through the still night.  Then another, and another.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Listen to her!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Better not.

                    She is in pain!  What is the old 
                    fraud doing to that poor woman?  I 
                    am going after her.

      He heads to the DOOR, and Wolfram tries to stop him.  Haeckel 
      pulls the door open and heads outside.

                                    WOLFRAM
                          (to himself)
                    She still loves him...


      EXT. WOLFRAM HOUSE - NIGHT2222

      Haeckel comes charging out of the house into the night, the 
      landscape covered with the twinkling remains of the rain 
      shower that passed over in the moonlight.  A CURTAIN of CLOUD 
      has parted to grant the MOON a look.

      Walter comes out after him, and grabs his arm.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Come back into the house!  For 
                    pity s sake, leave this alone and 
                    come back into the house!

      We can hear Elise s SHRIEKS now, reaching across the 
      landscape from the CEMETERY in the distance.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   39.

                    Listen to her cries!

      He yanks out of Wolfram s GRIP and heads down the path, 
      leaving Wolfram in his wake.

      Walter goes back into the house, and emerges with a MUSKET in 
      his hands.  Haeckel STARTS, afraid he s going to use it on 
      him, but Wolfram hands him the musket.

                                    WOLFRAM

                    I do not intend to kill anybody!  I 
                    just want to get Elise out of this 
                    damn Englishman s hands.

                    fellow, I don t want any harm to 
                    come to you.

      Haeckel turns from him, ignoring him, and marches up the path 
      toward the GRAVEYARD.


2323EXT. PATH - NIGHT  

      Walter comes behind him, wheezing, trying to keep up with the 
      young medical student.

      Haeckel imagines himself the knight in shining armor, out to 
      rescue the fair damsel in distress.  So why is Walter trying 
      to talk him out of it?

      Walter can barely speak as he tries to keep up, talking 
      between deep breaths.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Listen to me, Haeckel.  Elise... 
                    she has a sickness...  She had it 
                    when I met her...  What did I know?  
                    I loved her... I sold... everything 
                    I had to grant her this... I wanted 
                    her to be.... happy... 

      Another CRY rends the night.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    We couldn t begin to please her.  
                    Neither of us...

                                    HAECKEL
                          (whirling on him)
                    So you hire Montesquino to service 
                    her?  Jesus, man!

      He shoves Wolfram hard in the chest, and the old man tumbles 
      to the wet path, grabbing at Haeckel s LEGS, and PULLING 
      himself up, rising with MUDDY HANDS and SKINNED KNEES.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Stop, I beg of you!  Stay away from 
                    the Necropolis!

      There is a break in the cries, and the night goes silent as 
      Haeckel strikes back out on the PATH, with Wolfram straggling 
      behind him.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Bastard!  What kind of husband are 
                    you to her?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   41.

      A new SOUNDS joins the symphony: the damned, mournful HOWL of 
      the DOG again.  It sounds in complete agony.

      Haeckel follows the path over the gentle rise of the slope.  
      The NECROPOLIS is still out of sight, blocked by TREES and a 
      STONE WALL, and the CURVE of the PATH up the HILL.

      The agonized HOWL of the DOG is closer now, close enough to 
      stop Haeckel in his tracks.  Wolfram is right behind him.

      Something is emerging from the dripping SHADOWS of the TREES 
      that line the path.  It is making its way, slowly emerging 
      into the moonlight, WHIMPERING.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I beg you cease, Mr. Haeckel.  You 
                    are stepping into a netherworld you 
                    should never enter.

      Haeckel ignores him, and slowly steps toward the silhouette 
      slowly emerging from the shadows.

      The damned thing whines and yowls in deep agony, dragging 
      itself into the MOONLIGHT.

      Haeckel, and Wolfram behind him, step closer.

      It is a DOG, and a familiar one at that.  It is lying on the 
      ground, pulling itself forward with its FRONT LEGS.

      There is a HOLE in its CROWN, and brownish black BLOOD covers 
      half its face.  Howling weakly in pain, it continues to pull 
      itself toward Haeckel, its glassy EYES on the young man.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Good lord... I know this pitiful 
                    cur!

      He bends down before it, as it drags itself along the path, 
      its hindquarters still hidden by the shadows.  Its FUR is 
      MATTED with DIRT and MUD and DRIED BLACK BLOOD.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Poor beast!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I m begging you to stay away!

      As he crouches before the WOUNDED DOG, the pitiful CREATURE 
      pulls itself all the way out into the moonlight, revealing:

      HALF of its BODY is MISSING!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   42.

      CONTINUED: (3)2323


      The poor dog s BODY ends halfway down its BACK; its SPINAL 
      COLUMN is trailing behind in the MUD.  The BEAST is ROTTING, 
      seemingly long DEAD.

      It LASHES OUT at Haeckel, SNAPPING at him with frothing, 
      gnashing JAWS.  The thing is pitifully ineffectual, but 
      trying as hard as it can to attack.  

      Hard to do without the back half of its body, though.

      The ZOMBIE HALF-DOG snaps and flails at Haeckel, who is 
      horrified and disgusted by the thing.  It is easy to avoid 
      its attack, however.

      Haeckel picks up a large, mossy ROCK, and SMASHES the UNDEAD 
      DOG S SKULL in.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Put the damned beast out of its 
                    misery.

      After moments of stillness, it SQUIRMS to  life  again, 
      trying to PULL itself out from under the rock that has 
      crushed its skull and pinned it to the ground.

      Haeckel picks up the rock, and bashes the flattened SKULL 
      again and again and again, as the beast bellows one mournful, 
      painful CRY after another.

      The thing WEAKENS with every blow, even seems to DIE each 
      time, but keeps coming back.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (fevered, perspiring)
                    Die, damn you!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It is already dead, Haeckel.  You 
                    cannot kill it again.

                                    HAECKEL
                    That s impossible!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    No.  The filthy beast is dead.

                                    HAECKEL
                    But the poor thing suffers so!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I tell you, there is nothing you 
                    can do!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   43.

      CONTINUED: (4)2323




      The dog s broken, misshapen HEAD tries to BARK and HOWL, but 
      without its VOCAL CORDS, it just comes out in a WHISPERING 
      HUFF. 

      The wrecked beast keeps trying to pull itself along with its 
      withered FRONT LEGS.  The bony PAWS just dig little TRENCHES 
      in the muddy path.



      Walter GRABS him by his SHIRT FRONT, his face manic, his eyes 
      crazed.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Do you see now?  You have no idea 
                    the horrors that await you here!

                                    HAECKEL
                    All the more reason to go to your 
                    wife!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    All the more reason to stay away!

      And then... ELISE S CRIES begin again, closer than ever.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What kind of man are you?  You 
                    actually paid this Montesquino to 
                    bring back your wife s first 
                    husband from the dead, you damned 
                    fool!

      He leaves the crushed RE-ANIMATED DOG to WHEEZE and SCRATCH 
      in the dirt as he makes his way up the HILL to the GRAVEYARD.                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   44.




      EXT. CEMETERY GATES - NIGHT2424

      The IRON GATES are OLD and RUSTED, and the STONE WALLS are 
      ANCIENT and falling apart.  VINES wind around the GATES and 
      the WALLS, sprouting lush, rotting BLOSSOMS that play in 
        counterpoint to the otherwise HORRIFIC TABLEAU.

      The MOON is fully revealed by the CURTAIN of DARK CLOUDS.  
      The GROUNDS are WET and SHINING.  Lush OAKS surround the 
      necropolis, guarding it from view.

      Mounted on the IRON GATES is a SKELETON, chained there to 
      keep away unwanted visitors as a SCARECROW would keep away 
      the birds.  The rotting remains of its clothing hang from the 
      bones in rags.

      The skeleton stares down at Haeckel with black, empty EYE 
      SOCKETS and a frozen GRIN.

      Haeckel reaches for the GATE, only to find that it is LOCKED 
      and CHAINED.  He turns to Wolfram.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Give me the musket.

      He grabs the GUN from Walter, and smashes it open with the 
      gun butt.

      The WINDS start to kick up as Haeckel struggles to pull the 
      GATE OPEN.  It fights him with a long, ragged SQUEAL as it 
      OPENS.

      The WIND BUILDS as Haeckel dramatically ENTERS the GRAVEYARD.  
      Walter stays behind, right outside the GATE.  

      Haeckel looks back.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Are you not coming?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I dare not tread upon consecrated 
                    ground.  I dare not enter the place 
                    where Montesquino performs his dark 
                    magic.

                                    HAECKEL
                    So be it.

      Haeckel takes a tight grip on Walter s musket and makes his 
      way into the dark, shadowy CEMETERY.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   45.

      Wolfram watches helplessly from the gate for a few beats, his 
      EYES welling with TEARS.  He buries his head in his hands, 
      his shoulders quaking with SOBS.

      Then, we see something that neither one witnesses:

      The SKELETON slowly TURNS its SKULL and WATCHES Haeckel go...


      EXT. CEMETERY - WITH HAECKEL - NIGHT2525

      It s a meager GRAVEYARD: no massive tombs or towering stones, 
      merely coarsely carved HEADSTONES and WOODEN CROSSES.

      Haeckel makes his way through them toward the SOUNDS of some 
      sort of RITUAL... and the VOICE of ELISE...

      In the distance we hear a HOOTING OWL and CROAKING FROGS.  

      Haeckel rushes through, then TRIPS and FALLS into an OPEN 
      GRAVE.


      ANGLE - IN OPEN GRAVE

      Haeckel breaks his fall.  Beneath him in the OPEN WOUND of 
      the ground is an old, BROKEN WOOD COFFIN, broken open from 
      the inside, with no corpse within.


      RESUME GRAVEYARD

      Haeckel CLIMBS out of the OPEN GRAVE and continues his quest.  
      He doesn t even wonder why there is no body in the grave.

      In the distance, he sees:

      FIRELIGHT, and SHADOWY HUMAN FORMS.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Elise!

      And he charges through the graveyard toward the activity.

      Before the view is clear, he sees right up before him:

      Montesquino is SEATED on a TOMBSTONE, PUFFING on a long 
      TURKISH PIPE.

      Haeckel rushes up and PULLS the necromancer off the STONE and 
      KNOCKS him to the GROUND.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   46.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Bastard!

      Montesquino recovers, and recognizes Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Ah, the Doubting Thomas... come to 
                    save the maiden fair, no doubt.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What have you done to her, damn 
                    you!

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Not to her, young man... for her.  
                    See for yourself.

      Haeckel follows his gaze.

      Just across the GROUNDS, we can see ELISE, spectacularly, 
        voluptuously NAKED in the SILVER LIGHT of the MOON and the 
      GOLD FIRELIGHT of TORCHES that surround her in a ten-foot 
      CIRCLE, burnishing her fair skin.

      Haeckel is overwhelmed and embarrassed by her loveliness 
      revealed so completely... until he sees, as they say, what 
      lies beneath.


2626EXT. GRAVES - NIGHT 

      At first it seems she is sitting on the wet grass, her face 
      and chest FLUSHED, her BREATH coming in GASPS.  Her CRIES are 
      not of anguish, but of PASSION.

      And her bouncing, rolling MOVEMENT betrays the source of her 
      passion:

      She is STRADDLING a MAN... but this man is DEAD.  He is 
      covered in desiccated FLESH; his rotting HANDS are pawing at 
      her BREASTS as she takes him within her.

      This is Elise s FIRST HUSBAND.  Despite the corruption of his 
      features in death, we can tell that he was a HANDSOME MAN.  
      Though they are CLOUDED, his EYES are a deep, pale, 
      penetrating BLUE.

      This is the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in the MANTEL PORTRAIT!

      She WRITHES up and down on the corpse, passionately coupling 
      with the man she loves most.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   46A.

      The TORCHES are held aloft by another FOUR or FIVE of the 
      UNDEAD, surrounding this love act as if lighting a showgirl.

      In a mad corruption of Busby Berkeley s favorite overhead 
      angle, Elise is surrounded by TORCH-BEARING living CORPSES 
      and FRESHLY-OPENED GRAVES.

      As Haeckel watches in abject horror, Walter, flushed and out 
      of breath, comes up behind him.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I warned you.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (horrified)
                    You knew this was happening?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Of course I knew.  I fear it is the 
                    only way she is satisfied.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Good God, what is she?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    A woman.
                          (anguished tears leak from 
                          his eyes)
                    A woman in love with a dead man...

                                    HAECKEL
                    No natural woman would endure that.  
                    Jesus!  Jesus!

      He looks over at Elise, who, with her dead lover, is in the 
      throes of ecstasy.

      The HEAT is spreading to the CORPSES who stand guard.  They 
      are not completely dead.

      One of the DEAD GUARDS heads to the center of the CIRCLE and 
      stands over the coupling couple.  He cannot keep his rotting, 
      decaying hands off of the stunning and voluptuous Elise, and, 
      in the heat of this twisted passion, she doesn t fight him 
      off.

      The other UNDEAD approach the party, one at a time, and try 
      to shove the CORPSE GUARD away so that they can partake.  
      They push and shove at one another, dying to participate.

      Elise and her late husband barely notice.  Her CRIES reach 
      off into the night.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   47A.

      Outraged, Haeckel SHOUTS OUT:

                    Stop!!!

      Furiously, he GRABS the MUSKET from Walter and charges off 
      into the graveyard.

                    Don t hurt her!  She is not to 
                    blame!

      He heads not for Elise, but for Montesquino.  He CLIMBS over 
      GRAVES and BRANCHES and the occasional FALLEN TREE.

                                    HAECKEL

2929EXT. CEMETERY / MONTESQUINO S SEAT - NIGHT 

      Montesquino is watching from his seat on the back of a 
      GRAVESTONE when Haeckel charges up to him and SLAMS him 
      across the FACE with the BARREL of the MUSKET.

      The necromancer falls to the ground, his FACE BLEEDING.

      Haeckel AIMS the GUN at him, and PULLS BACK the HAMMER.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Do not blame me, young sir!  I am 
                    merely doing as I was paid to do!

                                    HAECKEL
                    Get to your feet!

      Montesquino rises, his hands raised in surrender, terrified 
      that he s going to be shot.  His entire demeanor has changed; 
      he s no longer the arrogant, confident magician.  He is now 
      in the thrall of something out of his control.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Whatever you did to start this, 
                    undo it!
























                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   49.

      CONTINUED:2929


                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I cannot, sir!  I cannot!

      Haeckel jams the MUZZLE of the MUSKET into Montesquino s 
      ample BELLY.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Stop it now, I command you!  I 
                    swear to God, I will shoot you 
                    dead!

      Montesquino can only shake his head, his eyes wild, his 
      composure gone.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Do it!

      Montesquino is shaking, and cannot speak.  Then:

                                    WOLFRAM (O.S.)
                    Elise!

      They turn to look.


      ANGLE - WITH WALTER WOLFRAM

      The pitiful Wolfram is CLAMBERING over GRAVESTONES and FALLEN 
      TREES toward his WIFE.

                                    WOLFRAM (cont d)
                    Elise... please, Elise... you 
                    should come home now...


      ANGLE ON ELISE

      She doesn t even hear him; she is overwhelmed with sexual 
      desire.


      ANGLE ON ONE OF THE (OBVIOUSLY) AROUSED DEAD

      It turns toward Walter.


      ANGLE - INCLUDE WALTER, ELISE, AND THE DEAD

      Walter stumbles through the necropolis to his naked wife, but 
      there are re-animated BODIES between them.  ONE of the DEAD 
      GUARDS stands and shambles toward Walter, WAVING him away.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   50.

      CONTINUED: (2)2929


      Walter continues toward her, TEARS running down his face.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise, please... come home with 
                    me...


      ANGLE - INCLUDE HAECKEL

                                    HAECKEL
                    Walter, stay away!

      The CORPSE continues toward Walter, still shooing the man 
      away from his bride.  When Walter won t be shooed, the CORPSE 
      KNOCKS him to the GROUND.

      Walter FLAILS and gets back up, but the CORPSE-- and another-- 
      are on him.

      They knock him back to the ground, then fall upon him.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (to Montesquino)
                    Come with me!

      He heads across the grounds, leading with the gun, and 
      Montesquino follows.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I m coming, Walter!


      ANGLE - WITH HAECKEL AND MONTESQUINO

      Haeckel and Montesquino scramble over the obstacle course of 
      the graveyard toward Walter and Elise, Haeckel leading with 
      the MUSKET. 

      When they reach Walter, he is SCREAMING as TWO of the UNDEAD 
      are TEARING red, steaming VISCERA out of his OPEN CHEST and 
      ABDOMEN.

      Haeckel SWINGS the MUSKET and BATS one of the disintegrating 
      undead to the ground, but it just climbs back up and onto the 
      SCREAMING, DYING Walter.

      The other CORPSE bends down and FEEDS off of Walter s EYE 
      SOCKET.

      As Elise is being ravished on the other side of the GRAVE, 
      the LIVING DEAD GUARDS are dining on Walter as he DIES.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   51.

      CONTINUED: (3)2929


      Horrified by what he s wrought, Montesquino RUNS away.

                                    HAECKEL
                      Montesquino, stop!

      He keeps running.  Haeckel raises the gun and FIRES, and 
      Montesquino goes down, HOWLING in the wet GRASS.

      Haeckel goes to Montesquino, his musket now spent.  He GRABS 
      him by the COLLAR.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What does it take to make this 
                    stop?  What are the words?

      Montesquino is weak, wounded.  His TEETH are CHATTERING.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    No... no words...

                                    HAECKEL
                    How do we make it stop?

      The FIRE is FADING from Montesquino s EYES.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    When... the... sun... comes... 
                    up...

                                    HAECKEL
                    You cannot stop it any other way?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    No... no... other... way...

                                    HAECKEL
                          (shaking him)
                    Tell me, you bastard!

      Montesquino SHOVES BACK, and Haeckel SLIPS on the WET GRASS, 
      losing his footing, and FALLING hard onto a GRAVESTONE.  He 
      HITS it with a resounding SMACK, and falls unconscious.

      A FLASH of WHITE, then:

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      EXT. CEMETERY - JUST BEFORE DAWN3030

      HIGH and WIDE.

      The first LIGHT of the SUN is just coming up over the 
      HORIZON, just leaking into the darkness.

      The DEAD are SLINKING and CRAWLING back into their GRAVES, 
      pulling the EARTH and SOD over them like BLANKETS.

      There is no sign of Elise, but WALTER S BODY lies GUTTED and 
      EMPTY on the grass.

      Montesquino s BODY lies DEAD at Haeckel s feet.

      Haeckel WAKES as a VULTURE (or CROW) tugs at his PANT LEG, 
      just in time to see the last of the DEAD retire.

      It is calm and quiet as Haeckel STANDS UP, reeling.  The DEAD 
      are a memory, and life slowly begins to spring up around us: 
      the distant calls of the MORNING BIRDS and the DRONE of the 
        DRAGONFLIES.


      WITH HAECKEL

      He looks all around him: at the evacuated corpse of Wolfram; 
      at the wide-eyed CORPSE of Montesquino at his feet.

      Life and death are not as he supposed.

      His head throbbing, Haeckel makes his way through the quiet 
      NECROPOLIS.


      EXT. CEMETERY GATES - DAWN3131

      Haeckel walks through the heavy iron gate, under the 
      unblinking gaze of the SKELETON that is chained to it.  He 
      pushes the gate closed behind him.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. WOLFRAM HOUSE - DAY3232

      Haeckel emerges before the house, and there is the sweet 
      SOUND of a WOMAN SINGING.  Haeckel stops to listen for a 
      moment, then goes to the door and OPENS it.                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   53.




      INT. WOLFRAM HOUSE - DAY3333

      Haeckel EASES the DOOR open and ENTERS.

      The LIVING ROOM is empty, save for the FIRE in the HEARTH.  
      Haeckel EYES the PILE of his BELONGINGS next to the hearth.

      The SINGING is coming from the BEDROOM.


      INT. BEDROOM - DAY3434

      Haeckel steps into the DOORWAY to find:

      Elise is sitting in a ROCKER, a simple, gentle smile on her 
      face, lovely with a glowing complexion, despite the SCRATCHES 
      on her skin.  

      The BABY is NURSING at her breast, and the song on her lips 
      is sweet.  There is nothing but HAPPINESS in her EYES.

      He stands there a couple BEATS before she looks up at him.

                                  ELISE
                    Good morning.

      Haeckel NODS at her, wondering what she remembers of the 
      night before.

                                  ELISE
                    The storm has passed, hasn t it?

                                    HAECKEL
                    It has.

      The baby sucks hungrily at her teat.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Elise...

      She looks up at him.

                                  ELISE
                    Yes?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Last night...

      Her face goes even more radiant at the memory.  Yes, she 
      remembers.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   54.

                                  ELISE
                    Last night...

                                    HAECKEL
                    Out in the necropolis...

                                  ELISE
                    Yes, out in the necropolis...

                                    HAECKEL
                    Walter...

      The smile slides away for the moment.

                                  ELISE
                    Yes, I know.  He s dead.
                          (beat)
                    He was old.  But he was always kind 
                    to me.  Old men are the best 
                    husbands.  As long as you don't 
                    want children.

      She sees Haeckel look down at the baby at her bosom.

                                  ELISE
                    Oh, this isn t Walter s boy.

      She gently TEASES the BABY from her nipple to proudly show 
      off the child to him.

                                  ELISE
                    See?  He doesn t look anything like 
                    Walter.  But he looks just like his 
                    beautiful daddy...

      And she turns to reveal the BABY to Haeckel... and to us:

      There it is: life-in-death, perfected.  

      The SKIN of its FACE is taut and GREY, and its limbs fat from 
      its mother's milk, but its EYE SOCKETS are deep as the grave. 
      Its mouth is wide, its full, ragged teeth-- not an infant's 
      teeth-- bared in a perpetual GRIMACE.

      The dead, it seems, had given her more than pleasure.

      The DEATH S HEAD of the nursing baby does indeed look just 
      like its FATHER: a LIVING CORPSE.  The son of death: ZOMBIE 
      BABY.

                                  ELISE
                    Would you like to hold him?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   55.

      CONTINUED: (2)3434


      Haeckel BACKS AWAY, unable to speak.

      Elise RISES to bring the baby to him.  Haeckel keeps backing 
      away until his back hits the wall.

                                  ELISE
                    Please.  Hold him.

      She SMILES so sweetly.  

      In a sort of TRANCE, Haeckel reaches out, and she places the 
      baby in his arms.  He brings the baby to his chest.

      The Zombie Baby looks up into his eyes, a Keane painting gone 
      to hell and come back undead, then suddenly SNARLS and 
      LURCHES for Haeckel s THROAT.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOLFRAM HOUSE - DAY3535

      Haeckel s SCREAMS fill the otherwise calm and lonely air...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      EXT. CEMETERY GATES - NIGHT3636

      The MOON is FULL and bright above, the OAKS casting long, 
      leering SHADOWS.

      The CAMERA CRANES up and over the GATES, just clearing the 
      watchful grin of the SKELETON.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT3737

      We make our way through the HEADSTONES and WOODEN CROSSES and 
      SHRUBBERY.  The NIGHT BIRDS are singing, the FROGS bellowing.  
      The NIGHT is coming to life.

      We move past OPEN GRAVES, MOUNDS of DIRT.

      As we move CLOSER, we can hear the distant, familiar, 
      passionate CRIES of Elise, building in intensity.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   56.

      CONTINUED:3737


      Finally, we drift over the low, crumbling ROCK WALL to find 
      the RING of TORCHES planted in the ground, and reveal the 
      night s RITUAL.

      We make our way up a line of the eager, aroused WAITING DEAD:

      We recognize them as we move past them: Elise s once-handsome 
      FIRST HUSBAND, the CORPSE who was mounting her on the other 
      night; MONTESQUINO, a MUSKET-HOLE in his CHEST; the GUTTED 
      CORPSE of WALTER WOLFRAM, reaching impatiently for his 
      beloved wife.

      But they ll have to wait: the lovely and voluptuous Elise is 
      coupling fervidly with the late, lamented ERNST HAECKEL... a 
      dream at long last realized.

      Haeckel s EYES are wide with sated desire, a dream fulfilled.

      Then: we move in TIGHT on Elise s eager, florid FACE, and 
      follow the simple GOLDEN CHAIN around her NECK to the 
        DISTINCTIVE, FILIGREED LOCKET, dangling at the end.



      Just like Miz Carnation s.

      The LOCKET has fallen open, and facing CAMEO PORTRAITS fill 
      both sides: one of Elise, and the other of her handsome 
      HUSBAND, together forever.

      So romantic.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT - 18853838


      TIGHT ANGLE - MIZ CARNATION S LOCKET

      Her gnarled old HANDS caress the LOCKET and the PICTURES 
      within. We PULL OUT and she BLINKS, bringing us out of her 
      story.


      INCLUDE RALSTON

      The fire still burns in the fireplace as Edward Ralston is 
      held rapt and horrified by Miz Carnation s tale of Ernst 
      Haeckel.

                    And that, my handsome friend, is 
                    how young Ernst Haeckel finally 
                    found the love that he sought.

                                    RALSTON
                    Good God, woman!  That is the most 
                    horrible tale ever told!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Is it?

                                    RALSTON
                    That the woman would have carnal 
                    knowledge with the dead!  It is 
                      disgusting, inhuman!  It is an 
                    affront to God!  Your story is 
                      impossible!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    So say you, Mr. Ralston.  So... may 
                    I assume you could not be happy to 
                    have your wife return under such 
                      circumstances? You do not love the *
                    sweet Samantha so much?*

                                    RALSTON
                    My wife is the spirit, not the body 
                    that holds it!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Just so, kind sir.  Just so.  I can 
                    return the body, but I hold no 
                    guarantee for the spirit.

                                    RALSTON
                    Good God, woman!

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    No God in this simple home, sir. No 
                    God at all...

      Ralston turns away from her, gazing into the fire, 
      considering the horror of his wife minus her spirit.

      And then, from another ROOM: a soft, mewling CRY.  Miz 
      Carnation either doesn t hear it or chooses to ignore it.

                                    RALSTON
                    What is that sound?  That horrible 
                    sound?

      Miz Carnation just looks at him.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    I hear no horrible sound.

      And it ENDS.  Ralston looks around, decides to let it pass.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   57A.

                    How did you come to know this 
                    terrible tale?

      But they are interrupted by a SOUND from behind, and a LONG 
      SHADOW reaches out from the other room as the DOOR BANGS 
      OPEN.

      A SILHOUETTED FIGURE comes shambling out of the room and 
      approaches her CHAIR.







































                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   58.

      Miz Carnation turns and her FACE lights up.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                      Sweetheart!  We were just talking 
                    about you!

      The BODY steps up to her and into the FIRELIGHT to reveal:

      The long-dead CORPSE of ERNST HAECKEL!

      Haeckel s re-animated CADAVER comes up behind her as she 
      STANDS to GREET him, giving her a big, deep KISS as he SLIDES 
      his ROTTING HAND over her withered BREAST.

      She looks up at Ralston with a warm, salacious SMILE.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                      Montesquino taught me so much.  I 
                    shall always be deep in his debt...

        A passionate PURR rumbles up from Miz Elise Carnation s bosom 
      as she is caressed by her dead lover.  And then, the MEWLING 
      SOUND rises again.

      Out of the bedroom comes the CORPSE of WALTER WOLFRAM, 
      carrying the crying BABY ZOMBIE in the CROOK of his ARM, and *
      a BABY BOTTLE full of MILK in his other hand.  *

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                    Oh, give me the little darling.  
                    Come on, honey.  Time for supper.  
                    Daddy has to wait for his.

      He brings it to Miz Carnation, who takes the BOTTLE to suckle *
      the child, giving a lewd little chuckle.*

      Still in the bedroom doorway, waiting his turn, is Elise s 
      DEAD FIRST HUSBAND.

                                  MIZ CARNATION
                          (to her lovers)
                      Gentlemen, we have a very handsome 
                    guest.  He claims to love his wife *
                    as much as we love one another. Mr. *
                    Ralston?*

      Horrified, Ralston stumbles and runs for the door and makes a 
      hasty retreat, fighting down his gorge.  Miz Carnation *
      watches him go, bemused.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   58A.

      Her DEAD HUSBAND leans down over her, and they kiss *
      passionately, rotting corpse and decaying old woman, not too *
      far from the end of her life. But the life that is left in *
      her is hot with passion.*

      Haeckel and Walter converge on her, eager to share some of *
      that quality time with her.*

                    baby s fed... then we can all 
                      play...together...*

      She lewdly licks her lips as the baby SUCKS happily away on *
      the BOTTLE.*


      EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT3939

      It sits calmly nestled in vines.  We now see for the first 
      time that this is the same little house as the WOLFRAM 
      FARMHOUSE, several DECADES later.  

      We CRANE UP and OUT to see the old, overgrown NECROPOLIS in 
      the distance, as MUSIC swells to carry us away into the 
      night.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
