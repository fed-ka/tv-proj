We're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All
sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the
kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY
and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit.
Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from
different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the
class about the photos.
We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT
ON Fleury.
KEVIN FLEURY
This is my Fredricksburg house and
my grandma Ruth playing with my
skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk
jump ramp.
A little girl, MICK raises her hand.
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
Mick?
Silence from Mick
MICK
I forgot what I was going to say.
Kevin points to another picture.
KEVIN FLEURY
This is me at my second birthday
party with my mom and my dad.
That's my cake.
Fleury looks down sweet at his son.
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
This is me with my mom at the zoo
and this is my dad and me and my
grandpa Willie.
Kevin points to another photo.
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
And this is me and my dad and my

The kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get
closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five
year old teacher watches from the side.
MICK
Where's your gun?
LITTLE BOY
Yeah, where is your gun?
Pretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants
to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's
giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye.
FLEURY
I'm assuming that there are no bad
guys in this room. Isn't that
right? I mean, are you guys good
guys or bad guys?
THE WHOLE CLASS
GOOD GUYS!
FLEURY
Right. So why would I have brought
my gun to a room full of good guys?
This silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving,
pointing to a photo.
MISS ROSS
What's that picture?
KEVIN FLEURY
This is me and my dad playing
Battleship at my dad's apartment.
Mick's hand goes back up.
KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
Mick?
MICK
What is a battleship?
KEVIN FLEURY
(abruptly)
My parents are divorced.
A beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled...

KEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D)
But that's OK `cause the most
important thing is to know that
everybody loves each other.
This hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in.
MISS ROSS
So, who's that in that picture up
on top?
KEVIN FLEURY
That's my fish, his name is Jaws

KEVIN FLEURY
This is the day that my daddy says

MISS ROSS
Really. His happiest day! Can you
tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?
Fleury smiles, looks out at the class.

RONALD FLEURY
I sure can. That was December 4th
and that was the day that we spent
the whole day in the hospital
waiting for this guy right here to
come out of Kevin's mom's tummy.
And we waited and waited but he
wouldn't come and we kept waiting
and finally the doctor said
`OK...he's not gonna come out on
his own so we got to go get him.'
And well,
Fleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Can I tell this story?
MISS ROSS
Go for it.
RONALD Fleury
So they take her and put her on a
special bed and they give her some
medicine so she doesn't feel any
pain then they take out this tiny
little knife and make a tiny little
cut right here in her tummy.
The kids are mesmerized...
MISS ROSS
Then what happened?
RONALD Fleury
Then the doctor put her hands way
up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY
IN! And then you know what they
did?
A little girl, LU LU: WIDE EYED
LU LU
What did they do?
RONALD FLEURY
They started to pull and pull and
pull... they had something in there
and it started coming and they were
pulling and the doctor all of the
sudden said "STOP!"
The class is frozen. Fleury has them.
KINGDOM 8/18/06

RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
They stopped pulling and the doctor
looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr.
Fleury - you ready to have your
world rocked?' And I just stared at
her and she pulled this little head
up out of that belly. And it was
him. His head. And I looked down at
him and screamed "Kevin!!" And he
looked down at me and screamed
"Daddy!!"
The kids are howling!

Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the
complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco
homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks,
concrete and rock where grass should be.
The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top
sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser
parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security.
Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.

The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off

turns to his Partner, in Arabic:
DRIVER
You have a copy of the duty rost-
-POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot
rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit
multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats
before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an
attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like
professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump
in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center
console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound.

Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of
life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out
-- before he can begin firing again-

Everyone eats snacks that the Fleurys brought. Kevin's the
center of attention. Fleury's passing out juice boxes.
Fleury's cell phone vibrates. TIGHT ON THE ID: 911. Fleury's
mid-juice-pass, answering his phone at the same time.
Kevin looks to his Dad, already grimacing. Fleury walks away
from the kids.
RONALD FLEURY

We hear Fran's voice as though we're on the line with him:
raspy-ragged, like he's been crying.

RONALD FLEURY
Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's

FRAN (O.S.)

Fleury's demeanor shifts to HARD immediately.

Fleury looks at the kids eating and laughing.

Fleury smiles best he can at his Son. Into the phone:

Looks at Lyla who's been through this drill too many times,
knows this face. Ronald can only give a little shrug, which
Lyla gives right back.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
(to Lyla)
Can you get a ride?
She nods yes. Miss Ross nearby, surprised by this:
MISS ROSS
Where's your husband going?
LYLA FLEURY
Ex-husband, and God knows.
Then a wave of fear ripples across her face. She hesitates,
then calls after him:

BE SAFE.
Ronald turns, gives a little Cheshire grin, puts the phone

Fleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot

Startling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch
Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera,
CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops
from CNN. Volume low:
CNN REPORTER
...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi
Arabia, in or around the `Al-
Rahmah' western housing complex
near Riyadh. More than 100 feared
dead, including children. The Saudi
Foreign Minister has released a
statement calling this a `heinous
act possibly committed by
foreigners...'
BBC REPORTER
...homes to thousands of Westerners
and other non-Saudis who work in
the Kingdom, there have been
several attacks on these compounds
in the last five years. As such,
they have become very tight in
terms of security, with both the
Saudi National Guard and police
taking command.
Fleury walks under the televisions. A folder in-hand, heading
down a long hallway, subordinating his fury to tasks-at-hand.

MOMENT
Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents
seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of
coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime
cribbed from Al-Jazeera.
Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of
his ERTs.
RONALD FLEURY
Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+
injured. The target was a softball
game. Rumor is the Killers wore
Saudi police uniforms.

Special Agent Fran Manner was
killed.

JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row.
Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on
Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but
Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her
composure. She nods.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
So was Rex Burr from State.
Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium.
No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real
trouble maintaining control...
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Fran was the best among us...we'll
feel this loss the rest of our
days...
(beat, moment to regroup)
Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.
GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before
joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart
Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...
GRANT SYKES
From the craters, looks like they
used a High Explosive... possibly
military grade: can't fit that much
TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of
PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4:
they could get it. The third there,
God knows...that crater looks like
a plane dropped a 500-pounder...
RONALD FLEURY
Obviously a secondary blast after
the initial devices used to lure
first responders to the scene.
Don't know anything about where or
what it was yet.
GRANT SYKES
This is how they do it.
ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator.
There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and
mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then
eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude
diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels
more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his
drawing:

ADAM
LEAVITT
I already know
the answer, but any
chance in Hell
we get to go over
there, use our

RONALD FLEURY
If you already know the answer
Adam, why ask the question?
Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never
stops drawing.
SYKES
We're not seeing this kind of
planning and execution anywhere
else...these ain't hot-wired
artillery shells waiting for
Humvees to roll by.
(pointing at the screens)
These hits are coordinated:
planning, timing, and big, broad-
daylight balls-
JANET MAYES
(almost trance-studying
the images)
Yeah, So... did they all happen
during daylight?
Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his
immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front
of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly
through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses
his name off of his roster. Then:
AGENT #1
Yes. At least the first parts of
the attacks.
Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks
are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.
JANET MAYES
We had two others...North of Riyadh
and the oil thing. What was that?
ADAM LEAVITT
The Refinery... Ras Tenura
Refinery.
JANET MAYES
Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing:
daylight, suicide bombers. Right?

ADAM LEAVITT
Yup.
RONALD FLEURY
This is not new in concept. It is
new in scope. It's bigger. Very
sophisticated. Command and control
was flawless. They found the
largest kill zone they could and
they did it... they did it by being
patient.
ADAM LEAVITT
Any rumors or confirmations of
uniforms being used in the other
two attacks?
Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster.
AGENT #1
(from memory)
No. I know this is the first for
that.
GRANT SYKES
That's `worst case scenario' if
you're still asking for my stab,
Sir. A crew who can build bombs
this big, with this level of eyes-
on control and detonation
coordination... has access to Saudi
uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus.
LEAVITT
Anyone take credit?
Fleury checks from his notes.
FLEURY
Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin-
Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in
Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq.
Now he seems to have come home.
He's clearly becoming increasingly
active...

If it is Hamza, he's definitely

Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as
substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his
roster.
JANET MAYES
They can't afford to appear as if
they are losing any kind of
control. They lose control over
their country, their people...then
they risk losing control over the
oil. They won't let us in. No way.
Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo
printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo,
reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.
RONALD FLEURY
From the State Department, one hour
ago: `We are in agreement with the
Saudi security assessment that any
additional American presence on
Kingdom soil represents reckless
risk. Therefore it is the Secretary
of State's position that only after
the situation has been evaluated
and contained, should the Federal
Bureau of Investigation activate

(folding the memo)
The National Security Advisor and
the Attorney General agreed.

Leavitt stares at Fleury as he moves fast out of the room.

COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as
thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch.
He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the
interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what
he's observing.
His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed
the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab-
cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick-
fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear
split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the
firecracker sound again.
Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this
over.
In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He
doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth
from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those
distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The
following exchange in Arabic:
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham.
What was your involvement?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
Killing those I saw responsible.
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
So none could be questioned?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
(puzzled, angry)
I don't understand.
A nod from General Malik: another vicious crack.
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK

-it should be.

Al-Ghazi interrupts.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
He has answered the question.
Malik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard
eye. Then back on Haytham.
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
We found six more uniforms than you
were assigned in your possession --
that is a crime: especially when
you consider the Attackers wore our
Uniform...
Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more
alert.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
Uniforms?
General Malik in Haytham's face:
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK

SERGEANT HAYTHAM
I sweat. I'll say it again because
it is true. I need more uniforms
because I must change during
shifts...look at my shirts.

Colonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room.

We follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room.
Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls
out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths:
yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each.

Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them
down on the table in front of the General -- all business.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
He's telling the truth.
The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant
Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then
Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away.
GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK
You were injured when you used your
vehicle to protect your country. Do
you understand?
Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw
wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly
don't like each other.

Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at

GIDEON YOUNG

Fleury continues:
RONALD FLEURY
A Shooter crew served as
distraction. After the initial
attack there was a lull to allow
Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own
attaches...to collect. Then a
secondary blast was triggered,
aimed at those first responders. So
they targeted families and rescuers
with one attack.

First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner.
Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly.
DIRECTOR GRACE
As we are about Rex Burr.
ELLIS LEACH
I met with Prince Thamer at the
Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after
I heard this morning's news. After
speaking with Thamer, I advised we
withhold additional US personnel
because a big part of the religious
justification for these bombs is
the presence of current US
personnel. More boots on Saudi soil
make an already combustible
situation more so. I know that's
not the answer you want, but...
Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.
MARICELLA CANAVESIO
My two cents: The Saudis haven't
asked for FBI help. Sounds like
they've done just the opposite. If
we force the issue, that could
further anger an utterly important

border with Iraq.

Pardon me?

Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed

GIDEON YOUNG
It's some variation on vengeance...
When one of your own is killed,
Agents lose their analytical powers
- kind of a greatest strength,
greatest weakness thing...

If I wanted vengeance, I'd have
whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's

MARICELLA CANAVESIO

RONALD FLEURY
To call this massacre an act of
terrorism... that implies a
specific political agenda. To me,
these killings are so futile and
unbalanced that they feel utterly
sociopathic- more like Charles
Manson than Osama Bin Laden...
Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the
following with utter precision.
JANET MAYES
(beat, fuck it: Go)
Al Qaeda lost the first phase of
this war, so a new, zero-sum phase
has begun: if you won't join us,
we'll let loose the truly talented
Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will
kill so many of you that the
resulting humiliation of the Saudi
Royal Family will cause an exodus,
a rebellion, both. Because the
Royal Family simply cannot protect
you or yours any longer.
Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a
subtle nod: "Nice work."
RONALD FLEURY
When she says talented, she's not
talking about the walking-bombs who
can sneak past any and all
security, nor the hi-jackers tough
enough to take an airliner. We're
talking about the Man who teaches
them how...
JANET MAYES
--the operational commander who
organizes, trains, plans,

Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't
your team in that country represent

RONALD FLEURY
To not engage these criminals out
of fear for our personal safety is
just another way of saying `uncle.'
Fleury takes another deep breath.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
I'll say it another way: Evidence
starts to go cold after twenty four
hours. If we can't get in now, we
will not find the man or men
responsible for this crime. We
couldn't do it at Khobar; we
couldn't do it in Yemen; we have
barely scratched the surface in
Iraq. And we are on verge of not
doing it here. They are getting
stronger, we are getting weaker. I
just lost a very good friend and I

PRINCE THAMER
I had an interesting conversation
with a reporter from the Post.
RONALD FLEURY
She can be a bit of an

somewhat over-stated. I see myself
as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just

PRINCE THAMER
What kind of cooperation??
RONALD FLEURY
Full cooperation: my Team cleared
to land at Prince Sultan Air Base.
Tomorrow. We want to help in a very
muscular way, quickly.
PRINCE THAMER
Next month would be as soon as...
Fleury takes a beat.
RONALD FLEURY
This goes one of two ways. First:
The FBI with the White House go on
the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi
Royal Family Decaying Monarchy"
bender that just can't help but
hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care
how many Chinese are lined up to
buy the oil. You know it's gonna
hurt.
PRINCE THAMER
My family is not decaying-

RONALD FLEURY
And then we bring the hammer down
hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we
got direct links from Riyadh - two
wives donating ten million to three
Arab-American cultural centers in
Boston. Then what gets kind of not-
funny is how some of that cash
found its way to Jakarta and some
Mosques that have these training
camps built right next to them.
It's kinda funny... you got little
kids playing over here, and some
not so little kids playing with
guns over here. That's kinda odd.
PRINCE THAMER
You have no proof of this.
RONALD FLEURY
We're getting there, Sir. And I
haven't even brought up the two
girls still missing out of Houston.
This is big. It is real. And I know
you only care so much about public
American opinion, Sir. But the
story will be covered... Big...
Thamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this

RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
And this ain't the Metro section.
It's above the fold, just below the

syndicated to papers like the Omaha
World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune --
You ever been to Terrell, Texas?
PRINCE THAMER
What is your point?
Fleury looks back to him.
RONALD FLEURY
Last I heard, 112 people lost their
lives in your country. One of them
was a good friend of mine. I want

That's a rock solid answer.

Sergeant Haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile

OLD VOICE (O.C.)
Just in time.
Haytham's P.O.V.: His FATHER, glass-frail, lying in a bed, a
small TV nearby, on but soundless. Haytham goes into a
routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his Father,
reaches down to pick him up. His Father readies himself --
stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the
black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his
Son's cheek. Looks into his boy's eyes.
HAYTHAM'S FATHER
What happened?
Haytham not returning the gaze, hoists his Father into his
arms -- pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
You haven't heard about the attack?
HAYTHAM'S FATHER
I choose not to listen anymore.
What happened to your face?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
(beat)
An attack today.
HAYTHAM'S FATHER
Look at me.
Haytham looks into his father's eyes now. No words. Haytham's
eyes well with tears. After a long silence:
HAYTHAM'S FATHER (CONT'D)
Is this how they now treat the men
who protect them? Can you look at

Haytham stares at his father.

Ghazi's children are playing a game with peas, trying to
guess which one of his hands Al-Ghazi is hiding the pea. When
a girl guesses correctly, he eats a pea.
From outside, we hear the call to prayer. Al-Ghazi and his

chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic:

Al-Ghazi: more than mild shock.

fearful of the pioneering thought
this Committee and I have tried to

of how you want to go out: on your
feet or on your knees. After that,
we went out and pulled triggers
until barrels melted. And Vietnam
lasted another seven years.

The lesson extends to this career:

Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes
out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest-
passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks
in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots.
LEAVITT
How do you do that?
Janet gently bounce-passes it back:
JANET MAYES
Check.
LEAVITT
Don't say `good' again.
Janet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she
drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word:
JANET
Bueno.
Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up:
Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until
something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a
wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face
relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands
it to Al-Ghazi.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I am sorry for the time.
(beat)
You won't need you gear.
Fleury can't help a small smile.
FLEURY
(to Sykes, himself)
Of course we won't.

Fleury sits with the RIPONS: EARL (40s) JANINE, his wife
(30s), and MADDY, Earl's mother (late 60s). Earl sits on an
ugly couch, a plywood sheet right above their heads. Everyone
uneasy save the CAT in Maddy's lap. Fleury waves off a bottle
of water from Janine. Al-Ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front
door.
AWKWARD INTERVIEW:
EARL
There's still a couple of hundred
of us living on the compound.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
67.
RONALD FLEURY
Why Saudi Arabia?
A moment as Earl and Janine get a bit defensive:
EARL
Neither of us did anymore schooling
than Electra High, Electra Texas.
RONALD FLEURY
OK.
Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.
EARL
And the jobs here pay twice what
you'd make in Midland or the Gulf
a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.
Earl's mother Maddy looks at Fleury, pets the cat.
JANINE RIPON
I call it combat pay. This place
has gone Guns - Guns - Guns.
RONALD FLEURY
So has Everyone else now.
JANINE
My girlfriends in Texas spend their
combat pay on diamonds... I spent
mine on a safe room.
RONALD FLEURY
(chuckles)
Two nights back. Can you start one
second before you knew anything was
wrong?
JANINE
We didn't really see anything. Just
hit the ground and hustled to the
safe room. Closed our eyes and
prayed. It was so fast. So loud.
RONALD FLEURY
So you really didn't see anything.
MADDY
I hit the deck. Horrible.
JANINE
Not `til after. Just the screams--
KINGDOM 8/18/06
68.
EARL
-- the kids... they were screaming.
That got me out of the house. Those
kids.
FLEURY
Which kids were those?
JANINE
The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson
next door was murdered looking out
her window...front of her children.
No safe room over there...
(right at Al-Ghazi)
Not even the Men that did this
should die in front a' their
babies.
Fleury lets moments pass. Earl rubs his wife's leg, trying to
comfort her. Al-Ghazi hides emotion.
RONALD FLEURY
She live with her husband?
EARL
Aaron.
RONALD FLEURY
(beat)
If I'm facing your house, is the
Jackson home to the right or left?
JANINE
Left.
Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.

We're in the big gym as our team sits and waits. Leavitt taps
on a laptop.
Janet shoots free throws by herself.
JANET MAYES
This is the kind of radical
circumstance that could have
seriously upped Shaq's free throw
percentages. Take a man. Ship him
off to Riyadh. No phones, constant
threat of death, no girls, no hip
hop. Nothing... just free throws.
Shaq, he'd be shooting at least
seventy percent. Lakers would still
be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers
forever.
Leavitt calls to Fleury.
LEAVITT
Hey, Boss... check this out.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
78.
Fleury moves over to Leavitt. Checks out the screen.
LEAVITT (CONT'D)
Just posted half hour ago.
IMAGES ON THE COMPUTER: ARABIC EXTREMIST WEBSITE. Video
footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some
of the machine gun killings.
LEAVITT (CONT'D)
So self congratulatory. Makes me
sick.
Fleury studies the footage. Backs it up plays it again and
again.

78A
A set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a
mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks,
marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent
densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the
floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the
pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty.
79
84
Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp-
5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly
scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack.
Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance.
The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in
color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the
length of the wall's horizontal center-line.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
We're here.
The helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the
rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go:
ADAM LEAVITT
Big wall.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
It's a big palace.
85
85
Majlis - a Saudi political ceremony in which Saudi citizens
and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are
permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre
receiving line of sorts.
Our team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the
ceremony.
ADAM LEAVITT
How many Princes are there?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Over 5000.
RONALD FLEURY
They all get palaces this big?
KINGDOM 8/18/06
84.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Some get bigger.
ADAM LEAVITT
Who pays for all this?
GRANT SYKES
General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet...
ADAM LEAVITT
Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(a beat...)
The Prince will ask you about your
flight, the accommodations...lite
subjects. If he offers you the
chance to hold his Raptors, don't
flinch: it's a compliment.
ADAM LEAVITT
(to Grant: genuine worry)
What's a Raptor?
Damon Schmidt appears.
85A
85A
The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small
flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera.
Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing
next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold
serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a
frenzy of servants.
Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re-
fill.
Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on
his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from
the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing
the arm. Servants hold three others close-by.
PRINCE BIN KHALED
His talons slice bone.
ADAM LEAVITT
Super.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
85.
PRINCE BIN KHALED
That's my most prolific Hunter. I'm
trying to teach his friends there
by example, but I fear it's
something you're born with or not.
Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or
not at all?
RONALD FLEURY
I do.
PRINCE BIN KHALED
(nodding: I could tell)
What have you seen so far of our
Kingdom? -- and know I can arrange
tours anywhere within our borders.
When I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm-
amidst-the-bullets tone:
RONALD FLEURY
I've seen that the man who planned
the worst crime in your Kingdom's
history is without a doubt Saudi...
Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's
"lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk
by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again
after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand
slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As
Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down,
look up at him with wide-eyes.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
..and that if you walk 300
kilometers from the compound, you
will find a rooftop where the
attacks were planned. I've seen
that the person in this room "born
with it" is right there...
(points at a gawking Al-
Ghazi)
Everything I just said came from
Colonel Al-Ghazi: his observations
of the scene while he was
protecting us. And I think you're
absolutely right Sir: that kind of
instinct can't be taught: not to
Falcons. Definitely not to SANG
Generals. Innate or not at all.
(beat)
You want the murder to stop as much
as I do. Let us help.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
86.
The Prince stares at Fleury, cataloguing everything Fleury
just said. Stands. In Arabic:
PRINCE BIN KHALED
Colonel Al-Ghazi, a word.
As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another
corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee.
Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as
he was starting to smile at it.
Fleury sips his coffee. Schmidt and Sykes approach.
GRANT SYKES
That was impressive.
RONALD FLEURY
Think it will work?
GRANT SYKES
Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only
play the "I'm going to the press
card" like three more times. So,
maybe.
RONALD FLEURY
They're paranoid and overly self-
protective.
DAMON SCHMIDT
They aren't protecting anyone.
There's no conspiracy. They're just
terrified. Finally. The Saudis have
finally seen the Monsters they
helped create, because those
Monsters have come home. And if
Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters,
that's the end.
Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.
DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
(right through Fleury's
attempt to speak)
And that end could come double-
quick if they let the US "Shaytan"
catch those Monsters for them.
(Fleury silent, gets it)
Because that's what the Saudi on
the street suspects: the only thing
keeping the Royal Family upright is
American evil.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
87.
GRANT SYKES
That's dead on accurate. Very
impressive. That's why they're
making it hard on us, and that's
why he wants to help `em turn the
screws.
RONALD FLEURY
They can have every shred of credit-
DAMON SCHMIDT
-you see the slums on the way in?
RONALD FLEURY
Yeah.
DAMON SCHMIDT
See that even though their homes
are falling down, they had
satellite dishes bolted on?
RONALD FLEURY
Yeah...
DAMON SCHMIDT
Everyone already knows you're here.
Credit? If the Saudis cracked this
Cell while these servants were
pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still
leads the story with your Team.
RONALD FLEURY
Have you been to the crime-scene?
DAMON SCHMIDT
No-
RONALD FLEURY
-if you had, you'd see the evil
work of real Talent. The kind that
doesn't stop until it's forced.
DAMON SCHMIDT
And the path to Hell is paved with
good intentions.
RONALD FLEURY
You having fun?
DAMON SCHMIDT
(genuine smile)
Beats hell outta visa-stamping.
(smile vanishing)

KINGDOM 8/18/06

DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
You're on an island. I hope you
know how to get off.
RONALD FLEURY
By catching Abu Hamza.
Raising his coffee, toasting Fleury's cup:
DAMON SCHMIDT
Then here's to you. Let's bet: when
this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out,
he's in-charge of the investigation
-if so, you set me up on a date
with Janet Mayes.
86
86
100 m.p.h. Semi-grins from the Team: how the fuck did he do
that? Al-Ghazi on a cell, rattling orders in excited Arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
... every investigator on-scene by
midnight, 50 more portable lights,
three more pumps-
RONALD FLEURY
(to
Leavitt)
Do me a
favor and tell Janet that
she and
Damon Schmidt got a date
when he
gets back to the States.
Al-Ghazi points into darkness...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The rules still stand.
(beat)
But tomorrow will be a new day.

TIGHT ON blasting caps, military detonators, nails, wing-
nuts, bolts, jacks, marbles... young hands feed lengths of
detonating wire through pre-drilled holes on a wooden cover.
The cover is attached to the box with nails and a rubber
mallet: no sparks. The wires are braided into one, clipped to
a lead on a servo-motor attached to the box-top.
A vehicle is being fitted with tire guards and heavy-duty
crash bumpers - all as a man quietly talks.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
89.
WIDEN to reveal the MAN, being VIDEOTAPED: foretelling of new
threats, face obscured by his head wrap. Several other MEN
watch and listen.
TIGHT ON the man's eyes. REVEAL PHOTOS on a nearby table: the
Al-Rahmah compound, Fleury with Al-Ghazi, Leavitt and Mayes,
Sykes and Haytham.

Fleury stands with Al-Ghazi back in the Ripon home.
RONALD FLEURY
Would you mind doing one more thing
for me?
KINGDOM 8/18/06
91.
EARL
No, Sir.
Fleury pulls out the photographs.
RONALD FLEURY
Could you tell me if you recognize
any of these men?
Fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room
table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos.
JANINE
...Horrible.
A few moments, then:
EARL
I don't know any of them.
Fleury thinks a minute. Looks outside.
FLEURY
I'm just wondering. That chair out
side. Looks like it gets a lot of
wear. Looks comfortable.
EARL
That my mom's chair.
FLEURY
See, that's exactly what I was
thinking. I'm guessing she spends a
lot of time sitting outside?
EARL
All day.
FLEURY
She must pretty much see it all.
Right?
EARL
She does.
FLEURY
Where is she?
EARL
She's sleeping.
Pause: Fleury slow nods, then...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
92.
FLEURY
Let's wake her up.
TIME CUT:
Maddy up at the dinning room table, looking down at the
photos.
MADDY
I've seen him.
RONALD FLEURY
Where?
Maddy thinking...
MADDY
Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen
him. Watering...With the garden
crews. I remember he was wearing a
Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought
that was funny.
RONALD FLEURY
What about the others?
MADDY
(closer examination)
No. Just him. I remember the T-
shirt. I remember thinking it was
odd...?
RONALD FLEURY
What, the Liza Minelli shirt?
MADDY
No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone
odd, but that wasn't it.
RONALD FLEURY
What was odd?
MADDY
He was a Saudi. The gardener.
RONALD FLEURY
Yeah.
MADDY
Saudis, like Americans, don't do
manual labor. Blowing leaves is
beneath them.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
93.
Fleury looks to Al-Ghazi for confirmation. Al-Ghazi nods.
RONALD FLEURY
(to Maddy)
Thank you.
Fleury and Al-Ghazi start to leave.
EARL
Who is he?
Fleury looks back to Earl.
RONALD FLEURY
That's one of the many things we're
trying to find out...
92
94
The Muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the
Sunna. Western bodies lie separated from Arabs. A Saudi
TECHNICIAN blankly hands Janet and Haytham lab coats to cut
the cold. Three Police OFFICERS in the tent with them:
Watching Janet.
Haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to
be seen with the American woman.
95
97
The dead, oblong faces of the dog-walkers. Janet uses forceps
to pull a wing-nut from one of the dog-walkers. Places it on
a sanitary table littered with shrapnel: tiny bits of colored
glass, ball-bearings, parts of razor blades, spent slugs, and
scraps of unidentified metal.
98
99
Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take
a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab
hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full
guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's
obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an
un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more
than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems
to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening
display. Then, Haytham turns:
HAYTHAM
You cannot touch any Muslims.
Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her.
JANET
No problem. Can I still touch
Americans?
HAYTHAM
Of course.
Janet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech
continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of
COLORED GLASS from a wound.

SERIES OF SHOTS:
A two car convoy drives deep into the city.
The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas
station as a construction crane backs into a drive way.
Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas
truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.
FLEURY
What's gas running a gallon out
here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?
Al-Ghazi smiles.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
It was an American. An engineer
named Karl Twitchell. Hired by
Saudi Arabia to find water. He
didn't find so much as a dried
oasis, but he found this. Enough
oil to turn the earth.
Fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the
station tank.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
They say my country sits on over 1
trillion more barrels of
recoverable oil.
RONALD FLEURY
A trillion reasons for our Leaders
to hold hands another one hundred
years.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
A trillion reasons to keep
fighting. For both sides of this
War.
(beat)
I think our oil has begun
destroying more than it creates.
RONALD FLEURY
Agreed.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
99.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I'm 46 years-old.
(beat, tired)
I have three daughters. And I find
myself in a place where I no longer
care about `why' we are attacked. I
only care that 100 people woke up a
few mornings ago had no idea it was
their last. When we catch the Man
who murdered these people, I don't
care to ask even one question...I
just want to kill him...stop him.
(beat, a bit embarrassed)
Do you understand?
RONALD FLEURY
Yes, I do.
A long moment. Just road noise. We see two men, as different
from each other as they could be, yet made from the same
things.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Is your first name `Colonel?'
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(a small smile)
Faris.
100A
100A
A glazed Haytham works with a Pathologist on the Muslim
bodies. Their own collection of foreign objects. Janet pulls
free 1/2 of a marble from a burrowed hole: explains the
shards of colored glass. Cleans it in saline, holds it up to
the light. We stare at it with her.
Janet begins piecing together glass shards - reconstructing a
MARBLE.

Sykes, covered in mud, digging, searching for any signs of
identification amongst the charred, mangled metal.
103
103
The small convoy pulls up next to a run down, late seventies
chunk of architecture which looks like a combination bombed
dentist office/ accounting firm. Weird. Two TEENAGERS in Tu-
pac T-shirts smoke in front.
Fleury, Al-Ghazi and a couple of Police head for the blacked
out front door.
104
104
Moving up two flights of stairs. Dark, rundown shredded
carpet. Old hip hop - cheap bass, thin speakers. Smoke.
Everything grows in intensity as they move up the stairs. Two
more TEENAGERS skulk past.
FLEURY
(half joking to Al-Ghazi)
Feel like I'm back home in Detroit.
Al-Ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on
Fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever
been.
FLEURY'S POV:
Two rooms: First is some kind of snack/smoke/TV lounge.
FILIPINOS serve drinks. Packs of young Saudi MEN drink Cokes,
tea, coffee, and smoke.
Odd Saudi talk shows mix with hip hop.
Behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis-
matched computers. Dozens of them. Dozens of Saudi TEENAGERS
plugged in. Head-phoned and mic'd. All chain smoking, all
fully plugged in to CALL OF DUTY (an American war game) on
line. These kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and
screaming and killing.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
101.
Al-Ghazi moves through the crowd. A small middle aged SAUDI
spots Al-Ghazi. They exchange words. Al-Ghazi waves Fleury to
follow.
Fleury does and follows Al-Ghazi through the computer room,
into a back office.
105
105
A middle aged Saudi: TALAL. He sits behind a cluttered desk.
Art books and computers everywhere. He gets up and embraces
Al-Ghazi.
Al-Ghazi then turns to face Fleury.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
At one time, Talal was Arafat's
senior bomb-maker and planner in
the occupied territories. He joined
Bin-Laden when Al Qaeda brought the
fight to the Royal Family.
RONALD FLEURY
(beat)
OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or
shoot him or something?
Small smile from Al-Ghazi.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
He turned himself in last year
during an amnesty. He's now part of
a new government effort to balance
the experience of Saudi Youth.
RONALD FLEURY
This place is community service?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
If America figures out a way of
keeping their kids off the
computers please let us know.
RONALD FLEURY
Why did he turn himself in?
Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in
Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
`You only come after I see there
were bombs.
(MORE)
KINGDOM 8/18/06
102.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
Did you know Bin Laden put 5
million-dollars on my head? Why
shouldn't it be 10?'
Subdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi
continues the translation:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah
is someone my age -- this kind of
skill is learned over decades.
Talal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through
Al-Ghazi:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D)
A Man who can plan the mass-murder
of women and children, then go home
at night to his own and sleep
soundly...? That kind of Man is
supremely difficult to catch.
RONALD FLEURY
(through Al-Ghazi)
How does he know he slept soundly?
Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question.
Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed.
Someone who believes he's going to Hell.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
(translating)
Because he hasn't stopped. You stop
when their faces don't let you
close your eyes...
RONALD FLEURY
(through Al-Ghazi)
Is that why you quit?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
(translating)
17 days without sleep will make you
quit anything.
Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad
about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to
it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles
as he speaks to Al-Ghazi.
Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
103.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
He says he makes my job easier.
Here, at least they only fight and
kill on computers.
Al-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it.
Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator.
Al-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
He says that there are several ways
to get American military equipment
like this detonator but not many
men in Saudi Arabia that know how
to get them.
FLEURY
How do they get them?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Usually smuggled from Iraq by
corrupt soldiers working with the
Americans.
FLEURY
Could Hamza get this equipment?
Al-Ghazi asks Talal.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Without question. Yes, he could.
RONALD FLEURY
(through Al-Ghazi)
How do we find him?
He thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al-
Ghazi continues translating:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Prayer. Luck. Handshakes.
Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it...
RONALD FLEURY
(to Al-Ghazi)
Well, I think I get the `prayer'
and `luck' parts...
Talal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to
Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly:
KINGDOM 8/18/06
104.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
(translating)
His hands will feel like this.
Fleury shakes Talal's hand, turns it over: index finger gone.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D)
(translating)
Every Amir at some point gets
bitten by his work.
106
107
Now a mini command post. Al-Ghazi works phones with Fleury
and Mayes by his side. Sykes and Leavitt muddy, sitting on
their cots. Leavitt tags evidence from the shootout.
Al-Ghazi hangs up, looks to Fleury.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The ambulance was reported stolen
from King Fahd Hospital last
Wednesday, three days before the
bombing.
RONALD FLEURY
OK.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
There's more: I told you it
wouldn't be hard to find the
soldiers.
RONALD FLEURY
(focused; to Al-Ghazi)
What you got?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The stolen ambulance had a twenty
man crew that rotated shifts on it.
We checked all twenty men. One of
them, Muaath Hazmi is now of
interest to us.
RONALD FLEURY
Why?
Al-Ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter/attacker.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Because this gentleman is Fathi
Hazmi, Muaath's brother.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
106.
RONALD FLEURY
Where's Muaath?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I'm going to show you.
108
109
The team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all
dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug-
shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on
respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer
takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House:
engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All
of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure.
Al-Ghazi appears from the back of the house. Bends over each
of the four dead men: lifting each of their hands, examining
the backs of the hands quickly.
GRANT SYKES
Prints are on the other side...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
108.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I'm not looking for prints. I'm
looking for fingers.
Stands after the last: a look of controlled frustration that
Fleury files. Then Al-Ghazi motions to Sykes and Fleury.
110
110
Back to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives,
buckets of shrapnel, two Paramedics working feverishly on a
SWAT Officer hit multiple times. Fleury goes about his
business like a man isn't dying six feet away.
Sykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through
explosives, blasting caps, shrapnel.
RONALD FLEURY
JANET...
Janet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded
SWAT Officer.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
He's gone... This shrapnel look
like the stuff you pulled at the
morgue?
JANET MAYES
(distracted)
Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard
to remember it all.
RONALD FLEURY
Bolts?
JANET MAYES
Yes.
RONALD FLEURY
Wing nuts?
JANET MAYES
Yeah.
RONALD FLEURY
Razor blades?
JANET MAYES
Sure.

Al-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help.
Fleury moves to him.
RONALD FLEURY
(calling back)
ADAM...
GRANT SYKES
C-4...
Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking
buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying
each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
-the front gates of every other
western housing compound in Riyadh.
Everybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
And Embassies: Italy, Japan, Korea,
Norway, England...
ADAM LEAVITT
(beat)
The Coalition...
Leavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in
particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment.
ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D)
These are all countries with Troops
in Iraq -- Japanese and Italian
embassies are under construction?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The entire Diplomatic Quarter is
being retro-fitted to sustain
bigger bomb blasts.
Janet pops her head in:
JANET MAYES
-the Prince's Convoy just showed.
Al-Ghazi's face: fear.
RONALD FLEURY
This is bullshit. You know it.
Meaningless. There's no leader
here. These are kids. That's it.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
110.
Al-Ghazi says nothing.
JANET MAYES
We're out of here.
RONALD FLEURY
Yes, that's it. Smile for the
cameras, body-bag some children.
Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get
it.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I'm sorry.
111
112
The Team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away
from the holes and doors. Al-Ghazi standing, looking out the
window at the spectacle. Damon Schmidt steps in: sees dead
bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. Leavitt pops up,
helps him sit.
RONALD FLEURY
You need water?
A quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
111.
ADAM LEAVITT
You really ought not look at this.
DAMON SCHMIDT
(pointing at the dead)
That fella got shot right through
his God damn nipple...
JANET MAYES
Don't stare too long. It'll start
living in your dreams.
Janet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure.
DAMON SCHMIDT
No -- I know.
RONALD FLEURY
You do?
(beat)
How did you know we were here?
DAMON SCHMIDT
The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
What Men?
DAMON SCHMIDT
Ask him.
(beat)
3 vehicles will stay behind when
the Prince and Press leave. You'll
convoy straight to BA flights into
Dulles -- last minute fares come
out of your budget, by-the-by.
Tried to swing upgrades, but check
at the counter.
Pissed, reproachful head-shakes.
DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
(beat; color returning)
Turn those frowns upside down,
people. This will be pitched as a
stunning Saudi-only counter-punch
that killed those responsible for
Al-Rahmah. Al-Jazeera will play up
an FBI presence, we'll play up
their ties to Terror as checkmate.
And everyone that was so
righteously pissed back home is
gonna eat crow.

DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
Already a rumor that the guy who
wrote our State Department memo-
RONALD FLEURY
-Ellis Leach?
DAMON SCHMIDT
You know him? He's gonna be put out
to pasture: made an example of by
the President to ensure all levels
of government get tough on Terror.
(right at Fleury)
You won the hand on the River card.
RONALD FLEURY
We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These
are teenagers... children with
pictures that someone far senior
has provided them.
DAMON SCHMIDT
-kidding me? You mean those are
Terrorist targets? Holy Wow.
Momma, don't let your children grow
up to be cowboys.
(beat)
Just get ready to go home and revel
in the fact that for the next few
weeks your shit won't stink.
The phone rings that instant. Leavitt hands it up to Fleury.
Schmidt holds his hand up to Janet: high-five -- she gives it
up slowly, warily, semi-charmed:
DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
(to Janet)
Double or nothing that's a
congratulatory call.
RONALD FLEURY
Hello?
(beat)
Yes, Sir. We're all here and
healthy. I'm sitting next to their
corpses but this may not be over.
These don't feel like anything
resembling senior leadership-
(beat)
-thank you Sir. I do.

RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Please do me one favor before we

Willing' or whatever the hell we're
calling our Iraq allies now, that
pictures of their Riyadh embassies
were found in this Cell's safe-
house.
113
113
Flying down a highway. Haytham driving. Sykes up front. The
rest of the team crammed in back: Fleury next to Al-Ghazi;
Mayes and Leavitt on the back bench. Everyone spent. Grant
stares up at a distant jet climbing-out. The police radio
belching calm codes and calls every few seconds.
RONALD FLEURY
(to Al-Gahzi)
What do you think?
Al-Ghazi looks up at Fleury, slowly shakes his head.
AL-GHAZI
Amateurs. It's a small win.
RONALD FLEURY
Yeah.
A beat.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
I'm thinking about New York -
February 26, 1993. The first time
they tried to hit the Trade Towers.
GRANT SYKES
I'm thinking about going straight
to Dan's, gonna order six PBRs-
JANET MAYES
-Pabst?
ADAM LEAVITT
Keep it real. You ever drink PBR,
Haytham?
HAYTHAM
No.
GRANT SYKES
Any beer?
KINGDOM 8/18/06
114.
HAYTHAM
(small smile)
No.
GRANT SYKES
Now...that's just unreasonable.
Good Police work and problem
drinking are like a chicken and egg
thing: which enables the other?
In the back, Al-Ghazi can't help a small smile either.
Fleury's not into it. All business, pissed, clearly does not
want Pabst.
RONALD FLEURY
(to Al-Ghazi)
Remember how we caught that cell?
AL-GHAZI
Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick
up his deposit on the rental car.
RONALD FLEURY
Four hundred dollars. For four
hundred dollars, he was caught.
Stupidity. Catching the cell was
easy. Just like this. The cell came
back.
Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi. He knows the win is small. Also
knows that's all she wrote, for now.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
I'll be back.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Yes, you will.
The POLICE BAND suddenly squelches loud with excited Arabic.
Everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(translating radio
chatter)
Religious demonstration in
progress. Back near the City
Center.
A small collective smirk, sigh of relief. Fleury turns in his
seat.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
115.
GRANT SYKES
I'm serious. Beer will open up your
subconscious. Canned beer
especially. Give you instincts they
can't teach-
Fleury notices the Suburban bringing up the rear has dropped
back.
RONALD FLEURY
(looking back)
Is he responding to the call?
Dropped back...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
(turning)
What?
Al-Ghazi and Fleury both looking back to the following
Suburban now. Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces
staring back at them.
Fleury looks to the overpass above - he sees a YOUNG MAN on a
cell phone. As they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the
other side.
Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
Tighten up-
-the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further
back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the
window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing
lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy.
Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the
steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach...
114
114 THRU 116 OMITTED
114
117
118
Off-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber.
119
120
- and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo
door with it.
The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest
now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding
inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar
of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air.
Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung
the worst, trying to function, get his bearings.
Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the
gathering smoke that smells like oil.
RONALD FLEURY
You whole?
ADAM LEAVITT
Think so-
Leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into
the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in
Arabic: commands?
The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing
Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these
Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip
Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can
grab.
Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
This is not right!
KINGDOM 8/18/06
117.
Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the
officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham
moves to unbuckle.
Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down
punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now.
RONALD FLEURY
WHAT THE-
JANET MAYES
(panicked)
ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
Alarm rising, everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the
ceiling as horizons go flip-flop confusion.
121
122
Driving as fast-hard as possible. No regard for anyone/thing.
Passport Officer up front pulls a cell-phone. A THIRD AND
FOURTH in the back still beating and zip-cuffing Leavitt.
123
123
Janet's sitting with Sykes in the rear, readying weapons and
ammo. She hands him twin Berettas - Sykes' double-fisting
despite his wound, looking forward to a fight.
SYKES
Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.
Driver's Seat P.O.V.: on the median, 95 MPH, dodging
abandoned and escaping cars. High-beams flashed on-off-on-
off, constant horn, gaining on the Mercedes' rooster-tail
ahead of them.
124
124
Powering deep into the Suweidi neighborhood. Skid-stopping
and backing into an alley between broken down three story
buildings.
125
125
Haytham scanning as he drives: straining to see the plume
from the second attacking vehicle way ahead, blending with
other fleeing, scared motorists. We watch as the distant
plume cuts hard left, at a high rate of speed... then
DISAPPEARS.
126
126
Quiet. The 32 year-old son we met on the rooftop is on his
cell phone again, speed-assembling an ancient VHS camera atop
a tri-pod.
THE SON
(in Arabic, frantic)
DO NOT COME HERE!
Intercut with the Mercedes Driver yelling frantic into his
cell phone:
KINGDOM 8/18/06
121.
MERCEDES DRIVER
(Arabic)
He's been shot! BE READY.
Back in the room, A HUGE MAN dressed in paramilitary black,
face wrapped in his shumagh, so only the eyes are visible,
stands in front of a sheet hung from the ceiling, quietly
practicing/reading a speech for an imaginary audience. Lots
of gesticulating and head movement.
The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band.
Door BURSTS open, bottom hinge rips from the jamb. Leavitt is
slammed to the ground. Passport Officer shoves the practicing
Speaker out of the way- Turns to the wide-eyed 32 year-old.
PASSPORT OFFICER
NOW. HURRY.
Leavitt's face already swollen-black-bleeding, scanning the
room with terrified fury in his eyes. He sees the handle of
the knife sticking from the Huge Man's waistband. His tears
leak all at once.
The Officer takes the knife, turns to Leavitt: dirty 11-inch
blade...
127
127
Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail
they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he
sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit,
decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard,
fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window,
starring it.
They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.
AL-GHAZI
We should not be here...
JANET'S POV: scanning for the trail Suburban and the Mercedes
- she can't help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an
intersection, Fleury yells:
RONALD FLEURY
BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...
Haytham brakes, reverses: the Suburban.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
122.
128
128
Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street,
surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS
huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.
A second passes: these people know where the attackers went.
Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly
just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his
back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past
on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the
little boy was nodding a warning-
What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:
GRANT SYKES
-GET OUT OF-
-big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse
and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield
bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles
bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the
dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor
panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.
A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE
thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off
the roof and into the Land Cruiser.
Frantic, Fleury swats it out.
The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel
into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of
shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4:
returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and
all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds
everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle:
firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who
were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.
129
132
Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old,
hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri-
pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted
at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
124.
We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway.
Passport Officer barks something back.
The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's
head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of
neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in
place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.
DRIVER
READY?
Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his
last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera,
trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it
as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground,
battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin
hammering Adam.
PASSPORT OFFICER (O.C.)
(in Arabic)
GOD DAMN HIM!
32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach
the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and
snot and blood rage.
133
134
-RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the
reticle up to his eye. Grenade blast splits through what's
left of the front window.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
125.
Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down
the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer
has been peaking out of.
Massive, contained detonation.
Passport Officer vanishes. The
32 year-old and his camera are
blown through the Driver
waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.
Because Leavitt was held so
tight to the floor, he escapes
the worst of the blast. Still
fucked up.
Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year-
old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his
back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver
and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as
Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.
135
136
Base of the stairs: Mayes joins Fleury and a dazed Al-Ghazi &
Haytham.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
A tunnel networks through all these
places... they use attached
civilian Apartments, innocent
families.
JANET MAYES
I do not like these people.
RONALD FLEURY
We go in the front door. Haytham -
cover the stairs. Janet - hallway.
Watch the side doors. Watch your
backs.
Silent nods. Bracing for war...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
125A.
They move 3 levels up the stairs into the building, following
the blood-trail from the SUV to the Apartment. PEOPLE step
out of their doors. Al-Ghazi aiming at them:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(in Arabic)
INSIDE!
137
137
The puddle of blood, a trail leading under the door. The
front wall/window/entrance of the next apartment down, still
smoldering from Fleury's grenade. No sounds, words. Our team:
fingers on triggers, weapons to shoulders, sights-aligned.
Ten feet back. Shoulders already flexed with tension,
expecting a suicidal blast at any moment. Janet grabs another
grenade, moves to secure the hallway.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
126.
Intercut Sykes outside. Haytham on the stairs.
RONALD FLEURY
(beat, to Al-Ghazi)
Is Allah on the other side of that
door?
Al-Ghazi raises his prayer beads to Fleury.
AL-GHAZI
(beat)
I think were about to find out, my
friend.
Fleury moves forward: I'm primary through the door. Al-
Ghazi's right with him. Fleury gets three-point-stance low,
hits the door like Jim Brown. Scattered gunfire. Fleury opens
up in response.
Fleury never stops forward motion. Stumbling headlong into a
kitchenette, hard into a refrigerator and cabinets, firing
the whole time. Al-Ghazi blasting anything that looks like a
body. Straight mop-up operation.
138
138
Securing the hallway, Mayes steps into a charred apartment
through doors blown off hinges. She heads in deeper, towards
the bedroom. Finds the closet - it tunnels into the
apartment below. She peers into the hole--
JANET MAYES
ADAM?!
KINGDOM 8/18/06
127.
-- sees a bloody knife below thrown by an unseen hand. Janet:
wide-eyed horror, about to pull back, when she is YANKED into
the hole by her hair.
139
139
Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still
tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker.
Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to
desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's
doing everything he can.
Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping,
dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's
back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere,
Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the
shot gun to Huge Man's head.
Janet: fucked up, but alive.
JANET MAYES
(to Leavitt)
Sykes is going to kick your ass.
Al-Ghazi follows Fleury into the room. Leaning to Janet,
Fleury sees Leavitt, puts his hand on his head. Leavitt's
somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured
breaths.
RONALD FLEURY
Everybody OK?
Slow nods from Leavitt and Janet as Fleury cuts Adam's ties.
FLEURY
There's at least three more of
them.
As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed
backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down -
exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into
another Apartment.
Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a
seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her
eyes. Janet tries her best Motherly smile.
JANET MAYES
It's okay Little One.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
128.
The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt
outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock.
Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A
blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door,
and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into
the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the
metal-crashing sound of automatic GUNFIRE.
Sirens overheard outside now.
140
140
Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the
room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a
man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering
FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A
little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The
collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the
room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence
draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away.
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM:
Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family,
the defiance on the faces of these young souls.
Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks,
spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is
not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then
take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age,
never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Is everyone alright?
Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw
earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds
her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds
her hand out: I can help you little one.
The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes:
okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's
eyes on her, piercing.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(to the little girl, in
Arabic)
It's okay.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
129.
Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to
her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her
little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a
gift for you.
Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a
marble...
Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.
Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER
staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al-
Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(in Arabic)
Let me help you up, Old Man...
The old man nods a `no.'
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(in Arabic)
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!
Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al-
Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing
fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his
eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(dazed, starting to
realize)
...Hamza.
The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under
arrest.
ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.
NASSAR
You are a traitor to your
country... a traitor to your God.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I am no traitor to my God. You are.
Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15
year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM.
Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the
floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather
with him.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
130.
Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only
see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son...
not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:
RONALD FLEURY
...Don't...
The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger
again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims
it at the boy's chest.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
...drop it, Son...please...
...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough
to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half
something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his
hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking
shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another
round into the chamber.
Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.
Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's
fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the
old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing,
the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still
screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers
something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying
teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for
his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in
Haytham's eyes.
A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the
bleeding...
Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears
spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man,
back down to Al-Ghazi.
Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
You got him. You got him... You got
him.

142
One last convoy heading out of town. Fleury, Leavitt, Janet,
and Sykes: battered war scars, million mile stares.
143
146
Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle.
Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas
stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet,
obviously fucked up.
Grace approaches.
DIRECTOR GRACE

Confusion from Janet.
