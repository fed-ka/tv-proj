The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.
More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third
BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of
an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed
through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.
A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang
off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.
where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine,
which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously
atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.
His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face,
late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.
He opens his eyes.
RUDY (V.O.)
I never was much for the holidays.
CUT TO BLACK:
THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND
rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."
And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS."
FADE IN:
Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the
Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.
The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick
absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.
NICK
What's the first thing, man? What's
the first thing you're gonna do?
RUDY
Haven't thought about it.
NICK
Hell you haven't.
RUDY
Get to thinking about it, it won't
happen.
NICK
We walk outta here, we hit that road,
what's the first thing you're gonna
do.
RUDY
Ain't there yet.
NICK
Three days, man.
RUDY
Not yet.
NICK
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin,
Christmas on the outs.
Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet,
hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his
cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.
RUDY
Hot chocolate.
NICK
What?
RUDY
Get a hot mug of chocolate.
(nods)
First thing I'm gonna do.
NICK
(smiles)
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
RUDY
And some pecan pie.
Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the
prison's entrance road. Longingly.
NICK
She's gonna be out there, man. Right
there. Right there waiting.
RUDY
Yeah.
NICK
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and
right into her arms.
RUDY
Yeah.
NICK
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing
her own damn sheets, you read that
part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves
in the whole week, drinking wine,
taking baths, man, see if they got
those room service steaks... anything
I want to do. Remember when she wrote
that? Anything I want...
RUDY
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but
the time they get outside is too precious to give up.
RUDY
All those pictures she's sent...
y'know... you sure they're all of
her, Nick? You hear sometimes they
don't send their real pictures. Could
be her cousin or something.
Nick studies him.
NICK
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
RUDY
I'm just saying.
NICK
Why you gotta. We were gonna give
you a ride someplace, man. Now I
just don't know.
RUDY
I'm just talking.
NICK
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road
again. A snowy wasteland.
NICK
I'm gonna marry this girl.
Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door
BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS,
make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered
in snow.
EXIT GUARD
Your world and welcome to it,
dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now!
We'll keep the lights on for ya!
Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill
hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in
summer.
Secondhand shoes. No possessions.
He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All
fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the
fenceway.
BEYOND THE GATE
There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN,
several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats
and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.
The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks
the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.
The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives
rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade
slaps on backs. Reunion time.
The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head
down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he
can't help himself -- he glances up --
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN
bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball
on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.
RUDY
drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.
The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy
road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.
The door opens. And Rudy steps out.
The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.
The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We
get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips
turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's
Ashley.
She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow
obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them
shivering. Both of them standing there.
And finally:
RUDY
You Ashley?
Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.
RUDY
I'm Nick.
CUT TO:
Light snow falls. Rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and
Ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:
RUDY
Well, I don't know about that --
ASHLEY
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good
at. I mean, they'd give us some free
games or something, wouldn't they?
Since you worked there?
RUDY
Security, Ash, I just worked security.
They wouldn't be rolling out the red
carpet --
ASHLEY
And the slots, slots I'm good at
too. Wouldn't that be fun?
RUDY
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
ASHLEY
We could live it up and --
RUDY
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I
used to work.
It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.
ASHLEY
I just... I thought you'd have friends
there...
Rudy softens, touches her arms:
RUDY
Hey. I been in prison for two years,
Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't
want to see me.
He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.
ASHLEY
Well, they don't know what the hell
they're missing.
Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside
joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to
the roof.
She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:
ASHLEY
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to
disturb us for the rest of the year.
I get back in that room, you better
be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
RUDY
I'll see what I can do.
ASHLEY
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring
his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their
shopping score. Gifts and goodies.
RUDY
(sings, sotto)
I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-
pum-pum. No treasures for the king,
pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...
Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags
on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.
As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway,
arcing into the blackness.
CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward,
emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush
painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru
a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster."
The rig all alone at a snowy rest area. Gabriel, Merlin and
Jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. Gabriel surveys,
then lifts a piece of paper:
GABRIEL
"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have
been dreaming of you constantly, and
knowing you are out there makes these
walls not seem so close or so strong
or so cold..."
(to Merlin/Jumpy)
Women live for this stuff.
(reads on)
Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming
'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on
me here, Nicky... where are we...
oh, right, other side...
(turns paper over)
"Someday I'm gonna take you up by
Lake S. Before I went in, before
goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my
situation, I used to work up at this
casino, working security. Used to
watch for people stealing chips,
counting cards, getting piss-drunk,
that kinda shit. Indian place, they
hired this reject outta Vegas to run
it, got about as much business sense
as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a
fun place to run some numbers and
play."
Gabriel puts the letter down.
GABRIEL
You're a good writer, Nick. I give
this writing an A-plus.
RUDY
I never worked at no casino.
ASHLEY
(hopeless)
Nick...
Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:
RUDY
That's the guy I was in with, I did
my last ten months with him. He rode
a two-year bit for manslaughter --
split a guy's skull open at a bar
for harassing his girl. That's Nick
Mason. He worked at that casino.
He's the one who wrote her letters.
Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job
was a Quickie Lube, I did five for
lifting cars. I don't know shit about
blackjack, I don't know shit about
Indians. I'm not him.
Gabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter.
GABRIEL
Bury this guy.
Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He
HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.
ASHLEY
Gabriel, you promised!
GABRIEL
I promised that when he helped us,
we'd be gone! When he helped us!
Loverboy don't want to play!
Merlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up.
ASHLEY
You promised me!
GABRIEL
And you promised me you'd get your
sweetheart to help!
Rudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught.
GABRIEL
He'd rather die than be with you,
he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend
anyway.
(to Merlin/Jumpy)
Bury him all over the place.
ASHLEY
NO!
She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her
into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out
of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.
Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark
and snowy woods ahead...
MERLIN
Beats prison, I guess.
ASHLEY (O.S.)
NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!
Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a
handgun, as he muses for the very first time:
JUMPY
The problem with prison... is that
it is founded on the fundamentally
flawed perception of rehabilitation
through punishment. A society can't
hope to create a "changed man" by
surrounding him with the worst in
his fellow man; what it
"rehabilitates" is solely a conviction
that if he can survive the inhumanity
of prison, what then, can he not
withstand? He has seen man's darkest
soul and kept his sight: what is
left for such a man? What faith?
What fear?
At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --
JUMPY
Don't get no blood on my boots --
The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber.
Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --
RUDY
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!
Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.
RUDY
About the Tomahawk! What the hell do
you want to know!
His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.
RUDY
I spend six months writing poetry
and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over.
Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want
me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.
Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles.
GABRIEL
Everything.
Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:
ASHLEY
I love you... Nick, I love you...
Rudy won't meet her eyes.
GABRIEL
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
RUDY
She says a lot of things.
GABRIEL
She's getting you to help us... 'cause
she knows if you don't, you're dead.
You just tell us what we need to
know, you two live happily ever after.
My sister loves you, motherfucker,
and I ain't gonna have you break her
heart.
RUDY
Wish I had a brother like you.
GABRIEL
A girl says she loves you, you say
something.
Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness.
RUDY
I had better sex in prison.
GABRIEL
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna
be working together here.
(to his boys)
Get him back in the rig.
Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to
him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes
silent, casts her eyes to the snow.
PUG (O.S.)
He's not the guy, Monster.
Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled
next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw.
It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.
PUG
Whole time you were driving, he was
telling her he's not the guy, he's
not the guy. I know why he'd tell us
he's not the guy. why's he telling
her he's not the guy? What if he's
not the guy?
Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:
GABRIEL
The man who wrote those letters loved
Ashley, boys. He lived for her love.
(nods)
Let's see him live for love.
Gabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches.
GABRIEL
Where's she work?
RUDY
What?
GABRIEL
(forces gun harder)
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't
she? Where's she work?
RUDY
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
GABRIEL
What's her middle name?
RUDY
(thinking hard)
Samantha.
GABRIEL
What'd they call her in high school?
RUDY
Bam Bam.
GABRIEL
What'd they call her in college?
RUDY
What college.
GABRIEL
Where'd she drop her cherry?
ASHLEY
Gabriel!
RUDY
Canada.
GABRIEL
Be more specific.
RUDY
A station wagon in Canada.
GABRIEL
What's her greatest fear?
RUDY
Her brother.
GABRIEL
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
RUDY
No. It's her brother.
Rudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs.
GABRIEL
That's love.
He puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath.
GABRIEL
Let's get back on the road. It's
time to start talking, Nick. Time to
start telling tales --
RUDY
Nick don't talk till Nick gets
something.
Gabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back.
It's a showdown.
RUDY
Hot. Chocolate.
The trucker slowly smiles. His crew chuckles.
MERLIN
You want that for here or to go?
RUDY
I been in Iron Mountain for two years,
truck driver. I do one more crime,
I'm back there for good, so fuck you
and fuck your sister and fuck your
trucker friends. You want to hear
about some goddamn job of mine? I
want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
They've stopped laughing.
RUDY
And some pecan-fucking-pie.
The "Motor City Monster" RUMBLES along a two-lane blacktop.
Across barren Michigan tundra. A sign reads "You Are Now
Entering Powahachee Indian Lands. No Littering."
A Midwestern castles-and-Camelot-themed chain hotel, amidst
an outcrop of roadside exit civilization: fast food and gas.
The Great Lakes Trucking rig parked in the hotel's lot.
The Chevy Nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow
of the gaudy neon axe.
Rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as Merlin unlocks
his cuffs. Gabriel reaches to help Ashley out --
ASHLEY
Get your goddamn hands off me --
She edges toward Rudy, then stops. A chill still there.
GABRIEL
You got one hour.
RUDY
I'm gonna need some money.
Gabriel hands a bill.
RUDY
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten
dollars?
GABRIEL
Don't tip.
RUDY
Monster. If we're working together
here, we gotta be working together.
I can't walk in there looking like
the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten
bucks to throw down. You don't want
me getting noticed, right? Not getting
noticed costs a guy at least a couple
hundred.
Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers
together. Merlin, Pug and Jumpy reach for their wallets,
grumbling. Gabriel takes a few twenties from each.
Rudy nods thanks as Gabriel hands him the cash --
GABRIEL
(threateningly)
Don't. Lose.
Rudy pockets the wad, hooks his elbow for Ashley to slip her
arm through. Grins with a drawl:
RUDY
You ready to gamble, darlin'?
She regards him warily, but puts her arm in his.
RUDY
(to the boys)
Y'all take care of my guitar.
He tips his hat, and strides for the casino entrance. Gabriel
and his truckers watch them go.
MERLIN
(grumbles)
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
GABRIEL
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch
their every fuckin' move.
Gabriel and Pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave
the casino. wandering into-the parking lot... away from them.
GABRIEL
Where the hell's he going?
PUG
Where the hell's your sister?
As the figure unlocks the driver's door of a Trans Am --
GABRIEL
Get him!
Pug REVS the engine, speeds through the lot, cutting off the
Trans Am from backing away.
Gabriel jumps out, HAULS the cowboy from his car and sees
it's the College Kid. Rudy's gone.
COLLEGE KID
(scared shitless)
Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it...
-- to the back of the building. In his stolen clothes, he
charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy
expanse of meadow beyond.
Running for a thicket of winter woods.
Merlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley
follows, stumbling to keep up.
GABRIEL
Where the HELL did he go?
MERLIN
Monster. There never was a structure
change. This place was built the
same from day one.
PUG
That motherfucker --
MERLIN
And Monster... he was talking with
the casino manager. Nick was talking
to him.
Gabriel darkens.
GABRIEL
Get. Him. Back.
Rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps
struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the
cover of trees. From far away...
ASHLEY (O.S.)
Nick! Run! RUN!!!
Rudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view
back at the parking lot. They see him.
And charge into the snowfield.
Rudy breaks into the trees.
Gabriel pushes Ashley into the Nova and peals out of the
parking lot. Onto reservation roads.
Rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper
into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward,
shivering, breath frosting --
-- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but
struggling too. With guns held.
Rudy keeps battling through the drifts --
-- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest;
the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to
struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him.
Rudy keeps running.
Merlin, Jumpy and Pug keep up their steady march. Rudy's
running figure now only fifty yards distant.
MERLIN
You keep running, Nick! Keep running
now! Can't keep warm if you don't
keep running! We'll just be right
back here... keeping track of your
trail.
ANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints.
Pug FIRES off two shots.
They KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting...
MERLIN (O.S.)
Wherever you run... we'll get there.
Fast as you want... we'll be there.
We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve,
fifteen, twenty-hour days.
Rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush
away his footprints. Realizes it's useless.
A BULLET whistles through the pine branches.
MERLIN (O.S.)
We got nothing but time.
Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --
-- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder.
Closer. It's a car's engine.
Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out
a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale.
Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.
As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner
comes a Chevy Nova --
-- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he
floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy.
Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded
slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --
ASHLEY
No!!!
-- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the
other way. Gabriel fights her for control --
-- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road,
hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom,
a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!
On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel
leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.
AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM
Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.
BACK UP AT THE ROAD
Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top
edge and takes aim --
ASHLEY
RUN!!!
-- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --
Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding
and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --
TO THE BOTTOM
-- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles
to clear the ice from his face --
-- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.
RUDY
That's for reading her mail.
He extends a hand to Ashley --
RUDY
Come on.
-- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls,
the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the
rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.
More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way
down the ravine.
Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's
slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge
two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.
RUDY
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
ASHLEY
Nick, the ice is --
RUDY
Get to the bridge!
(waving at traffic)
HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at
their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --
-- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She
vanishes from sight in an instant!
Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at
the ripples in the freezing water.
Ashley's not coming up.
RUDY
Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.
Then the highway. Safety within sight.
But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly
and LEAPS into the ice-hole --
-- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body
like needles. He writhes, spinning around --
-- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at
the ice above her. Strength giving out.
Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights,
panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further
away from the opening.
With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm,
pressing the barrel against the ice above them --
-- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches
for a sheath of ice, splashing --
TO THE SURFACE
-- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces
beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.
Instinctively, they spin around --
TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG
-- standing right behind them. Guns trained.
GABRIEL
(rubs his jaw)
At the rate you're going, Nick...
I'm gonna have a hard time ever
considering you family.
He extends his hand, a gesture of help. But menacing.
GABRIEL
How lucky ya feeling now.
CUT TO:
A bitter cold sunset. Through a room's window, Rudy and Ashley
lie tangled in sheets on the carpet.
Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window
into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He
stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.
AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER
Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and
gear boxes in the back seat.
He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and
slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming
it around until it trips the door lock.
The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --
Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck.
And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing
MERLIN AND JUMPY
stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way
toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.
ON SCENE
Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.
Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.
Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars,
heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances
back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem
to. They stand at the Nova, talking.
Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs
turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building.
He slips around the corner, out of sight.
AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL
Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving
toward a side entry --
-- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.
Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling
water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this
wall.
Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.
Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting.
Because his breathing has stopped.
Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the
same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free
the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.
Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --
RUDY
Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a
bike, it's like riding a bike!
But there's nothing. The engine won't start.
Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway,
the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.
RUDY
How far you gonna get, Rudy...
Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced
to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an
shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.
And his eyes find the Blazer.
Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake
down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."
Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding
on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front
bumper.
The wheels start to move.
The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs
ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space
below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up
speed, rolling on its own.
The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his
feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper,
the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --
-- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --
-- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --
-- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right
through the window to his room --
The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards
Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their
car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces
overnight.
Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut.
Rudy hits the snow --
ASHLEY
Gabriel!
GABRIEL
That's for the hundred bucks worth
of pay-per-view.
(then KICKS him)
And that's for the two hundred you
took outta your minibar.
RUDY
(chokes, pained)
You guys were paying for the room, I
just figured --
Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at
Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --
-- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's
face.
It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.
GABRIEL
(cruel smile)
You wanted a weapon, convict? You
got one.
Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and
Pug haul him up. With venom:
GABRIEL
Merry Christmas-Eve.
The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with
Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.
The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering
Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."
The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.
Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons
chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.
A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.
Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.
Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.
A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa
coat.
AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.
A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.
And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.
Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the
empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa
Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic
tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.
RUDY AND ASHLEY
sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots,
cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.
ASHLEY
Where should we go, Nick? When we're
gone from here... where should we
go...
The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several
fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:
PUG (O.S.)
Okay, who had the cheeseburger with
bacon; what about a roast beef, I've
got two roast beefs here --
JUMPY (O.S.)
Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --
MERLIN (O.S.)
I got a bacon too; there another
bacon in there?
PUG (O.S.)
I got a bacon for him and a bacon
for me; there's four cheeseburgers
and two roast beefs --
MERLIN (O.S.)
Somebody better give me something
with some goddamn bacon --
As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.
Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.
RUDY
This time right now... Dad's stacking
wood out back, getting ready for
tomorrow. Little blaze in the
fireplace. Mom's setting out the
good silver, hanging her cinammon
sticks, up in the doorways. Getting
out her scratchy old records...
singing along...
Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.
RUDY
I don't know where you're going.
But I'm going home.
ASHLEY
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we
go together. Remember?
RUDY
Well. I'm going home.
GABRIEL
sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white
cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast
beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a
savage bite.
Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.
Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.
ON FULL SCENE
The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures
scattered, watching day turn to night...
CUT TO:
The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights
now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a
dozen cars in the parking lot.
The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley
inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling
stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:
GABRIEL
Go.
Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.
Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.
[NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end,
are in their Santa Claus suits.]
RUDY AND JUMPY
make their way across the lot, heading for the entrance.
RUDY
Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you
something. You have any problem with
the fact that we're on our way to
take millions of dollars from an
Indian casino?
The Native American considers. As they walk:
JUMPY
Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's
gone a long way toward restoring
wealth and pride to communities who've
been economically isolated and
enslaved for centuries. Stronger
infrastructure, better schools, higher
employment... they're all the results
of reservation casino success stories.
Still, many natives believe that
these are temples to a godless
materialism and greed that will only
infect the souls of indigenous peoples
until their love of money has
destroyed the spiritual values their
ancestors died to protect and their
homelands have become no different
from any United States suburb,
satellite city or industrial park.
Destroying the Indian legacy once
and for all and leaving behind a
nation of selfish, angry natives, of
which I, it's true, am one --
-- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --
Gabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal
triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one,
hurries back down the casino road.
Ashley sits between Merlin and Pug. Gabriel jogs by the car.
Ashley checks her watch:
ASHLEY
Three minutes.
Ashley's eyes on her watch. Nods to Merlin and Pug:
ASHLEY
Go.
Merlin and Pug march toward the entrance, hands in pockets.
Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a
RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY,
just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.
Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen
spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.
-- as the Firemen hear the GUNFIRE, pulling holstered pistols --
Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He
takes a few wary steps toward the road --
-- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind
him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.
ASHLEY
Your turn.
Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.
The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in
reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley
collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.
The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a
couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.
A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a
grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been
no traffic here for awhile.
The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook.
Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is
fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.
A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.
Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer
gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer
to five feet away from, the ravine drop.
IN THE CAB
Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --
TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE
-- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is
in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with
a can of gasoline.
GABRIEL
You almost got away with it, Santa.
Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your
car, got halfway to Canada till you
caught some ice in the road. By the
time you hit bottom down there, whole
car was burning like a comet.
Musta
burned up all that money too.
Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls
of bills into the car.
GABRIEL
Buncha guys in red suits busted in,
they'll say. Started shooting. They
won't be able to remember... if it
was three, or four... or five. Four
dead Santas and some burned-up cash.
Merry Christmas, The End.
RUDY
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it
hers.
Gabriel smiles at him.
GABRIEL
She told me 'bout the convict
magazines. Had to figure there'd be
some boys in the pen with some useful
knowledge. With nobody to talk to.
Nobody to listen. So we stocked up
on stationery.
Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.
GABRIEL
Hard life being a trucker's girl.
Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.
RUDY
I saved your life.
ASHLEY
You shouldn't have.
RUDY
He did love you, you know. Nick. He
did love you.
ASHLEY
Who wouldn't.
So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.
RUDY
Maybe this is where you wanted him,
Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine,
dead as ice with a burnt-up heart.
Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause
what you did for him was make him
the happiest held ever been. You
showed him hope and taught him mercy.
And he died a peaceful man. You wanted
to destroy some convict... and all
you did was save his soul. Remember
that. Love your money and remember
that.
Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:
ASHLEY
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
RUDY
I'm glad it was me.
ASHLEY
Merry Christmas.
GABRIEL
Get in the car.
Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops
at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.
GABRIEL
Get in the CAR!
RUDY
How'd you know my name...
He turns back to Ashley.
ASHLEY
What?
RUDY
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
ASHLEY
What are you talking about?
Rudy looks at Gabriel. He's frowning. To Ashley:
RUDY
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
ASHLEY
I... you told me your name was Rudy.
You told me a million times, back in
the truck, telling me you weren't
Nick --
RUDY
No --
ASHLEY
You were screaming you weren't Nick!
And we just didn't fucking believe
you!
RUDY
But I never said Rudy.
ASHLEY
You said it a million times!
RUDY
I never told you my name.
He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.
GABRIEL
Ash?
RUDY
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
GABRIEL
Ash?
RUDY
How'd you know my name.
Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --
ASHLEY
Men.
-- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.
Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of
shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley,
incredulous.
She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel
falls still.
Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.
Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare
each other down for a long moment, before:
RUDY
Where is he.
A silence.
No one moves.
And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of
the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."
A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon
steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.
It's Nick Mason.
Alive and well.
NICK
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.
NICK
I missed you, beautiful.
ASHLEY
I missed you too, Nicky baby.
They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of
him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:
ASHLEY
For your information. I never fuck
the wrong guy.
Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.
NICK
Oh, hey. Have you two been properly
introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy
Duncan, I did almost a year with him
in the Mountain. Read him all your
letters, talked about you all the
time, made him feel like he really
knew you.
(turns to Rudy)
My friend... wantcha to meet Millie
Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha?
My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked
at that bar in Motor City, where I
manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't
talk about her much once the Ashley
letters started coming, I guess.
Rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.
NICK
Millie here used to serve drinks to
these gunrunning truckers, real big
talkers, talking bout a real score
one day. I was in the Mountain, man,
what the hell, why not let her get
friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em
an idea she had, 'bout writing guys
in prison. Getting one who could
show 'em a sure thing.
RUDY
She set them up. All of them.
NICK
Why not have her pretend to find me?
Pretend to write me and reel me in?
Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose
as some sister of his named Ashley?
RUDY
And you set me up.
NICK
Always wanted to rob that casino,
Rudy. Way back when I worked there.
What better way than to get some
guys to rob it for me.
Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:
NICK
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the
shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does
he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty
to put out the story I was dead.
Once the wound healed up...
(notes cash-sacks)
Got out of the Mountain this morning.
And tonight I'm a rich man.
RUDY
How'd you know I'd do it.
NICK
Do what?
RUDY
Walk outta there and tell her I was
you.
Nick looks back at Ashley.
NICK
Because every time I read her letters,
Rudy... you listened.
(to Ashley)
Keep your gun on him.
Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and
lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.
NICK
Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk,
Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll
say. So we gotta have five Santas
not walk out. Gotta have five...
(working)
This'll burn right away... in the
fire...
Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs.
NICK
Hell, you never needed to convince
Ashley you were me. Just the dumb
fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked
enough about the Tomahawk in the pen
for you to get by --
RUDY
Talked about the old man's weapons
stash, probably forgot I'd remember
NICK
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if
you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd
start convincing 'em soon enough.
Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in.
NICK
They had the weapons and the
willpower. We just gave them their
inside man.
RUDY
You gave them me.
NICK
I gave them me.
(shrugs, smiles)
Said some nice things about me, Rudy.
I appreciate it. But don't worry. I
do love her. And she loves me. You
had that right all along.
Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car
into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:
NICK
Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!
Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick
steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.
IN THE CAR
Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his
wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of
his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --
-- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The
switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to
his right wrist!
Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through
the Santa belt --
-- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either
Ashley or Nick to see --
IN THE TRAILER
Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick
is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --
NICK
Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time
with you!
IN THE CAR
The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of
trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column,
RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!
As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races
over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the
dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --
-- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate
the right leads --
IN THE TRAILER
Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the
flaming car to the trailer's edge --
-- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --
-- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --
IN THE CAR
Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --
RUDY
LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A
BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!
-- and the ENGINE IGNITES!
Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and
looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --
RUDY
RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND
THE WHEEL!
-- and SLAMS the accelerator.
ON FULL SCENE
As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back
into the trailer --
Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --
-- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's
legs between metal and metal!
ASHLEY
NOOOOOOO!!!
Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."
RUDY
RULE TWO!
Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage.
She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --
-- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --
-- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --
-- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her
onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off
the ridgetop --
-- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking,
blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.
The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
The same four shots that opened the film. The Santa on the
floor of the cage (Pug), the Santa on the hood of the car
(Merlin), the Santa in the hallway (Jumpy).
And the Santa lying face-down on the snowy road. Gabriel.
The last of the opening images. Rudy's motionless Santa
figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit
still aflame. He opens his eyes.
ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD
Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at
Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.
Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist
down.
He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:
NICK
...Rudy... help me... Rudy...
Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.
He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the
truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.
NICK (O.S.)
...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!
The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.
Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom.
He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.
And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.
He stares at them.
A long time.
DISSOLVE TO:
In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges
the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty
roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw --
35 Miles."
He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes
across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the
soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little
Drummer Boy" start to rise --
With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."
With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window,
seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway.
Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.
-- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into
mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.
DISSOLVE TO:
A cul-de-sac of Norman Rockwell Michigan homes. Graced with
pines and a pristine snowfall. Christmas trees in windows,
lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.
No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long
gone, walking up the road.
At cul-de-sac's end. Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.
After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER
and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside;
a dining table visible beyond them.
The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock. Concern.
MOTHER
Rudy...? Rudy?
FATHER
Son? Is... is that you...?
The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.
The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room,
finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden
with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and
wine.
The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.
The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.
Yes, it's Rudy.
Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes
a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings,
and sets it in front of him.
And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.
His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The
other relatives look likewise.
All staring at Rudy.
Then, while he eats, without another sound...
...the Mother takes her seat at the table...
...and the Father pulls up another chair.
They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.
There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of
glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.
CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to
the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.
There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle
Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage
Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and
her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...
...and at the head of the table...
Rudy Duncan.
Home for Christmas.
CUT TO BLACK.
