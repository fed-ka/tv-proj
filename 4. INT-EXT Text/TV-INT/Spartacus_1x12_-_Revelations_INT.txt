  SOLONIUS sits chained to the wall. Face bruised and hair 
  disheveled. The once proud lanista has been stripped of his 
  jewelry, wearing nothing but a dirty loincloth. BATIATUS 
  enters. Solonius barely looks at him.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It wounds the heart. To see a man 
                        once so elevated, plummet to such 
                        depths.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Your dog Ashur. Was he always upon 
                        your leash, even when licking my 
                        ass?

                                        BATIATUS
                        His loyalty never wavered.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The man is most skilled in deceit.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Or perhaps you were too blinded by 
                        envy to perceive truth.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You flatter yourself.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                        Did you not have eyes towards my 
                        ludus? My champions? My wife?

  Solonius knows the sting of truth in that.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You attempt to steal glory from the 
                        House of Batiatus. Yet here you 
                        sit, nothing but blood and sand for 
                        your efforts.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Capua will see you for what you 
                        are.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man who brought the 
                        Magistrate's murderer to justice? A 
                        hero of the people?

                        May the gods protect me from their 
                        wrath.

  A ROAR echoes from the arena. Batiatus glances up.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Crixus makes quick work of his 
                        opponent. I must return to the 
                        pulvinus... to announce your 
                        execution.

  Solonius can't help but muster a begrudging respect.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Well played. I underestimated you, 
                        Batiatus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are not the first to die for 
                        that mistake.

  Batiatus turns and moves out of the cell, WIPING US TO --



  MOVE WITH Crixus as he returns from the arena. He passes 
  AGRON tending his brother DURO, bruised and bloodied from an 
  earlier fight. Crixus continues on, glaring at

  SPARTACUS,

  as he goes. Spartacus doesn't even notice, his mind focused 
  only on vengeance against Batiatus. DOCTORE approaches with 
  Spartacus' swords. Spartacus glowers.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I request words with Batiatus, yet 
                        you return absent the man.

                                          DOCTORE

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have pressed for audience all 
                        week. Dominus forgets who his 
                        champion is.

                                          DOCTORE
                      It is you who forgets title of 
                        master and slave.

  A tense beat, broken by the FANFARE OF TRUMPETS. Spartacus 
  swallows his anger -- for the moment.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Apologies. I have made many 
                        mistakes since becoming Champion. 
                        Know that I intend to rectify them 
                        shortly.

  OFF Spartacus, his true intentions barely concealed behind 
  burning eyes...



  FOLLOW Batiatus and Doctore as they move through the villa.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would not have Agron risk himself 
                      on behalf of brotherly bond. See 
                        him separated from Duro in future 
                        games.

                                          DOCTORE
                                  nods)(
                        What of Spartacus? He grows 
                        restless at not receiving audience.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The proceedings with Solonius have 
                        filled my attentions. Send Mira to 
                        occupy his thoughts. I will summon 
                        him in the morning.

  Doctore nods and heads back to the ludus as Batiatus steps 
  into the --

  TRICLINIUM

  to find ASHUR. HOUSE SLAVES fit him in new, expensive robes. 
  Batiatus grins at the sight.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Robes, fit for a man of 
                        intelligence and breeding! You wear 
                        them well.

                                        ASHUR
                      As I do the mantle of humble 
                        servant.

  Batiatus waves the Slaves out of the room.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This day beheld the end of 
                        Solonius. A welcomed spectacle, 
                        given purchase by your loyalty and 
                        cunning.

                                        ASHUR
                        I took great pleasure in the act.

  Batiatus pours wine.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As do I in the rewarding of it. You 
                        are to be removed from the ludus 
                        immediately.

                                        ASHUR
                                  concerned)(
                        Removed?

                        You shall reside in the villa! 
                        Elevated far above the common men, 
                        your devious fucking mind close to 
                        elbow.

  Batiatus shoves a cup of wine in his hand with a laugh. 
  Ashur is overwhelmed. This is a huge fucking deal.

                                        ASHUR
                        Gratitude seizes the tongue.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps a woman could aid in 
                        untangling it. Name any slave, and 
                        the wet joys of her body are yours.

  Ashur's wheels kick into high gear, sensing opportunity.

                                        ASHUR
                        I confess to certain longings. For 
                        one not yet soiled by the other 
                        men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Give voice to desire, and see it 
                        fulfilled.

  OFF ASHUR, a sly grin bending his lips...                                                                                    10.



  Spartacus sits and stares ahead. Killing Batiatus his only 
  thought. The door to his cell opens, revealing MIRA. 
  Spartacus glances over, says nothing. Mira offers 
  explanation

                                        MIRA
                        Apologies. My presence was 
                        commanded.

                        they were gladly received...

  She moves to touch Spartacus' face. He brushes her away, 
  irritated. Mira flares at the rejection.

                        with blood. And you discard a 
                        simple touch?

                        them, or prove yourself again an 
                        ass.

  A beat. Spartacus glowers, gives in.

                      He appears absent weight of 
                        pressing concern. If he harbored 
                        suspicion --

  Mira catches the intense hatred flashing in Spartacus' eyes. 
  She pauses, gauging the meaning of it.

                        And what matter is the Champion so 
                        keen to broach?

  Spartacus doesn't answer. Mira begins to put the pieces

                        Batiatus follows. What secrets did 
                        Aulus reveal in final breath, that 
                      so inflamed?

  Spartacus locks eyes with her. She tenses as the true nature 
  of his intentions slam into her.

  OFF SPARTACUS, hardening in his resolve for vengeance...



  Crixus and Naevia collapse into each other's arms, naked, 
  breathless and flush.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You move... with strong purpose...

                        Spurred... by your victory.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  laughs playfully)(
                        I thought you did not favor the 
                        games?

                                        NAEVIA
                      It is not the games. It is the 
                        champion that plays them.

                                        CRIXUS

                        Spartacus yet holds the title.

                        But for a moment. Soon glory will 
                      be restored to its proper place.

                                        CRIXUS
                        When I defeated Pericles and you 
                        were not in the pulvinus... There 
                      is no meaning in glory, without 
                        your eyes to witness.

  Naevia takes him in, deeply affected by his words.

                                        NAEVIA
                        They will never again be absent.

  They kiss, their souls entwining.

                        Naevia?!

  They scramble in panic to avoid being caught.

                        Quickly!

  Naevia slips her dress back on. Crixus pulls her close for 
  one last, quick kiss before disappearing through the gate.

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        Naevia!

  Naevia locks it with Hector's KEY. She turns around, just as 
  Lucretia descends the stairs.

  Naevia discretely slips the key into her robe.

                        What business do you attend, that

                        required of you by Dominus. Come.

  Lucretia heads back up the stairs. OFF NAEVIA, concerned by 
  Lucretia's ominous tone as she follows, WIPING US TO --



  CLOSE ON a flame lighting a candle. REVERSE TO FIND Ashur as 
  he sets the candle amongst several others lit throughout the 
  room. NAEVIA enters, eyes filled with fear. Ashur drinks her 
  in.

                                        ASHUR
                      My heart quickens at such a vision. 
                        Please...

  Ashur motions for Naevia, who enters with much trepidation.

                        You spoke with Doctore, after it

                        A thing of no consequence. Turn it 
                        from your thoughts. As I have from

                        I have admired your beauty for many

                        Always the forbidden fruit. Until 
                        now...

  Ashur brushes a stray lock of hair from her eyes and leans 
  in to kiss her. Naevia tenses as his lips near. He pauses at 
  the last second, enjoying the game.

  Ashur is now behind her, his lips close to her ear.

  Tears well in Naevia's eyes as Ashur slips the robe from her 
  shoulder. It falls to the floor, WIPING US TO --



  Lucretia paces the room in anger as Batiatus reclines in 
  bed.

                        You give her away as if a common 
                        whore! I preserved her chastity 
                        since she was a child, towards 
                        presenting it as a gift!

                        The only gift of chastity is in its

  SLAVES bustle about, cleaning and decorating. Batiatus

                        flowers!

  A SLAVE hurries out, passing Hector and Spartacus as they 
  enter. Batiatus brightens.

  Mira tenses as Batiatus moves to greet Spartacus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Apologies for delay in receiving 
                        you. I have been consumed by the 
                        tumult of recent events.

                        Much has changed.

  Spartacus subtly scans the room. Searching for a weapon.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The world reforms at our feet, the 
                        very earth thrusting us to

                      At great cost.

  His eyes land on a nearby FLAGSTAFF. They shift to the CLUB 
  dangling from Hector's belt. They finally settle on a small 
  KNIFE beside a bowl of fruit.

                                        BATIATUS

                      he is not the man who took her 
                        life.

  Spartacus takes a step towards the knife. Mira's heart 
  freezes in her chest -- but Spartacus' revenge is 
  interrupted by VARRO'S WIFE AURELIA entering with flowers.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Aurelia?

  Aurelia stares daggers at Spartacus, turns to Batiatus.

                        Will that be all?

  Batiatus waves her out. Spartacus watches her go, stricken.

                        Varro's debts properly repaid.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I pledged my winnings to such a 
                        cause. You did not tell her this?

                      Of course. Yet she would have no 
                        coin from your purse. Nor mine, 
                        unless obtained by means of fair 
                        labor. She wishes to serve the 
                        House of Batiatus, until all debts 
                        are balanced.

  Spartacus reels from this news. His eyes flick back to the 
  knife. He stands frozen. Conflicted. He comes to a decision, 
  delaying his revenge. For now.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She is a good woman. And worthy of 
                          consideration.

  Mira can't help but darken at that. Batiatus grins.

                        And shall have it in abundance. Now 
                        what matter have you been so eager 
                      to discuss?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

  ON SPARTACUS, head spinning, needing to gather his thoughts.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I merely sought word towards 
                        Varro's wife, and that she had been 
                        provided for.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Excellent! Then all is well between 
                        us!

  OFF BATIATUS, beaming, not knowing how close he just came to 
  a bloody end...



  Hector leads Spartacus back the ludus. Mira hustles up.

                                        MIRA
                        I require words with Spartacus.

                                        HECTOR
                        And why the fuck would I allow 
                        that?

                                        MIRA
                                  hissed)(
                        Because my tongue remains silent 
                        towards the gate key you lost. You 
                        would have it remain so?

  Hector realizes she is forcing his hand. Scowls.

                                        HECTOR
                      Be quick.

  Hector moves off a bit to give them a moment. Mira moves 
  closer to Spartacus. Speaks so as not to be overheard.

                                        MIRA
                        Opportunity presents itself, yet 
                        Batiatus lives.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        For the moment.

                                        MIRA
                        What delays your hand?

  Spartacus doesn't answer. Mira snorts in disgust.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        Last night the lives of every slave 
                        under this roof meant nothing to 
                        you. Then Aurelia appears, and you 
                        grow a fucking conscience!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Varro was as a brother. I will not 
                        see his wife put to risk.

                        killed her husband.

  Mira storms away. OFF SPARTACUS, feeling the weight of her 
  words...



  TWO GUARDS flank Ashur as he carries out the last of his 
  belongings. Ashur spots Crixus, breaks into a bright smile.

                                        ASHUR
                        Crixus! I had hoped to pass you! A 
                        parting gift...

  He hands him a clay tablet.

                                        CRIXUS
                        What shit is this?

                                        ASHUR
                        A memento of your battle with 
                        Theokoles. The city was filled with 
                        such novelties after Spartacus 
                        brought the rains.

  TIGHT ON THE TABLET, depicting Spartacus defeating 
  Theokoles, Crixus lying wounded in the b.g. Crixus seethes, 
  hurls the tablet to shatter against the wall.

                        The craftsmanship was rather poor.

  Crixus snorts at Ashur's robes, his stuff.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus finally removes you from

                        Ah, witty turn of phrase. One of 
                        the many splendors I shall miss of 
                        being a gladiator.

                        You were never a gladiator.

  Ashur darkens, the subject yet tender.

                        No. Not after your blade found 
                        itself in my leg.

                        One that has given great reward. My 
                        new station affords pleasures far 
                        beyond those dreamed by common 
                        gladiators. Even one who was once

  Ashur smiles warmly as he moves off with the Guards, WIPING 
  US TO --



  Naevia stands next to Mira, her shame barely masked behind a 
  forced smile. Aurelia enters with a tray of food. Mira 
  hisses at her, voice filled with contempt.

                                        MIRA
                        No, that goes to the balcony. 
                        Quickly. The Legatus arrives.

  Aurelia nods, passes Lucretia adjusting Batiatus' robes as 
  she heads out.

                        The new girl is slow to the task.

                                        BATIATUS
                      An act of charity.
                                (eyeing Aurelia as

                      We shall yet find proper use for 
                        her.

  Ashur enters and takes his place at Batiatus' side.

                        A great day, Dominus. One that 
                        shall be remembered.

  He smiles at Naevia. The heart catches in her throat as she 
  bites back the tears. THE ATRIUM DOORS SWING OPEN -- and 
  Ilithyia strides in, absent Glaber.

                                        BATIATUS

  Lucretia eyes Ilithyia warily as Ashur and Batiatus exit. Is 
  Ilithyia playing games?

                        I am moving back to Rome!

  Lucretia takes that in, not caring for the implication.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        But your time in Capua has been so 
                        brief.

                        Painfully. Yet now that my husband 
                        campaigns for Praetor, he insists I 
                        remain at his side.

  Lucretia puts a hand to her stomach, fighting back a wave of 
  nausea.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        Are you well? The blood drains from

                      My heart but flutters... at the 
                        thought of losing you.

  Ilithyia smiles sympathetically.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Memories of our time together will

                        friendship, Lucretia, has forever 
                        altered my life.

  Ilithyia leans in and kisses Lucretia. Softly. Lingering. 
  She pulls away with a faint smile and heads for the door. 
  OFF LUCRETIA, a wave of unease washing over her as she 
  watches Ilithyia exit...                                                                                    24.



  Naevia escorts Crixus. Naevia avoids his eyes, barely 
  keeping it together. Crixus whispers to her.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You fill my thoughts. I long for

                        interrupted.

  Unable to hold it back any longer, Naevia begins to cry. 
  Crixus stops, gently wiping away her tears.

                                        CRIXUS
                      It is but one night. Your touch 
                        will be missed, but no cause for 
                        this.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Yes, cause. Enough to drown us both 
                      in tears.
                                  with difficulty)(
                        Dominus has given me to another.

  Crixus is stunned. His surprise quickly gives way to anger.

                        Who?
                                (pulls her closer, 
                                  desperate)
                        Tell me the man's name!

                                        NAEVIA
                      It does not matter. We have lived 
                      in a dream. And now must awaken.

  Naevia hurries away, tears burning her cheeks. OFF CRIXUS, 
  his world spinning out of control...                                                                                    28.



  Crixus enters. Heart heavy. Still reeling.

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                      Do not be troubled, mighty Crixus.

  Lucretia appears in a flowing, translucent gown. The OPAL 
  NECKLACE Crixus gave her (in ep. 104) gracing her neck.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Capua cheers your name once more.

  Lucretia moves to Crixus. Circles him. Her finger tracing 
  the chiseled curves of his flesh.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Soon you will seize the mantle of 
                        Champion from that fucking 
                        Thracian. And everything shall be 
                      as it was before you fell to 
                        Theokoles.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I long for it to be so.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As do I.

  Lucretia kisses him passionately. Crixus tries to respond in 
  kind, but thoughts of Naevia invade. Lucretia pulls back, 
  eyes filling with uncertainty and the creeping tinge of 
  fear.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Something is wrong...

                                        CRIXUS
                        Apologies, Domina. I --

  Lucretia's legs half buckle. Crixus catches Lucretia, 
  realizing she wasn't referring to him.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Domina?!

  Lucretia clutches her stomach, half conscious.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                                  calling out)(
                        Naevia! NAEVIA!

  OFF the moment...                                                                                    29.



  Batiatus storms in, Ashur in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The shit fuck beckons me to the 
                        city, only to spurn me as he would 
                        a thin waisted whore! Once again 
                        the gods spread cheeks and ram cock 
                      up fucking ass!

                                        ASHUR
                        Perhaps a gentle nudge, to remind 
                        the Legatus of your importance...?

  Batiatus considers that, nods.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Make arrangements. Glaber will bend 
                      to my fucking will. Or break in the 
                        denying of it.

  Ashur nods and hurries back out. Batiatus heads for the 
    bedchambers.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Lucretia!



  Batiatus enters, breathing fire.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You need to have fucking words with 
                        Ilithyia --

  He freezes. Lucretia is on the bed, attended to by MEDICUS 
  and Naevia. Mira stands off to the side.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        What has happened? Lucretia...?

  Lucretia locks eyes with him... and smiles.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I am with child.

  Batiatus struggles to process that. Lucretia laughs.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You are to be a father, Quintus.

  Batiatus rushes to Lucretia, overcome with joy.

                      We must celebrate!

  Mira rushes out, WIPING US TO --



  Ilithyia sips wine as SLAVES brush her hair in preparation 
  for bed. Glaber sweeps in, removing his armor.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Finally. I had feared you absorbed 
                        for the night.

                                        GLABER
                        The curse of Mercato's 
                          incompetence. The cousin of Crassus 
                        vanishes, and the fool has no 
                        theory rattling in his empty head.

  Ilithyia subtly turns away to hide her reaction.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Theories pale against the obvious. 
                        Licinia's tongue was suspected of 
                        lounging in less esteemed places 
                        than around her husband's cock...
                                  pouting)(
                        Whereas mine has made do with 
                        naught but idle conversation.

  Ilithyia steps up to kiss him, but Glaber holds her off.

                                        GLABER
                        I fear it has not been as idle as 
                        you would have me believe.

  Ilithyia tenses.

                        What promises have you made to 
                        Batiatus and his faded bitch? The 
                        flesh monger looks to me with 
                        rheumy eyes, brimming with 
                        expectation.

                        husband...

  She strokes his bare chest, kissing his neck.

                                        GLABER
                        Batiatus is little better than the 
                        beasts that bear his mark.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        True, but he does provide a certain 
                        amusement.

  Ilithyia slips out of her gown, revealing naked perfection.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)

                      My promise discharged, we shall 
                        return to Rome. And more civilized 
                        company.

  Glaber pushes Ilithyia against a nearby dresser and enters 
  her. Ilithyia reaches out in ecstasy, her hand knocking over 
  her cup. The spreading wine TRANSITIONING US TO --



  CLOSE ON a pool of spilled wine. PULL OUT to find Aurelia 
  quickly picking up the pieces of a shattered wine jug. Mira 
  glares.

                                        MIRA
                        Fetch another. And fucking hold 
                        onto it this time.

  Aurelia moves to comply. Spartacus appears from the shadows 
  on the other side of the gate.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Aurelia. I beg a moment.

                        Alone.

  Mira stares daggers at Spartacus, then storms back up the 
  stairs. Aurelia stays, but refuses to look at Spartacus.

  Aurelia locks eyes with him, barely containing her fury.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It is my duty. Varro asked that I 
                        see you taken care of.

  Spartacus has no reply, save the swell of guilt in his eyes. 
  A somber beat.

  Aurelia heads for the stairs. Spartacus hisses after her.

  Batiatus and Lucretia lead Glaber and Ilithyia into the 
  Triclinium where a feast has been arranged. Several of 
  Glaber's Men follow at a respectful distance.

                      As your eyes witness, no coin has 
                        been spared in restoring the villa! 
                        All will marvel upon privileged 
                        entry, and be humbled by the 
                        storied history of the House of 
                        Batiatus!

  Glaber takes in the villa, impressed despite his feelings 
  towards Batiatus.

                      It is a vast improvement.

                      My heart is moved by the tragedy. 
                        Yet my head remains fixed. What 
                        advantage would I gain from 
                        association with a lanista?

                      My gladiators ignite the passion of 
                        the crowd. Lend name to my cause, 
                        and see their deafening cheers 
                        transformed -- into demand for 
                        Claudius Glaber, and his desired 
                        position of Praetor.

  For the first time, Glaber seems to be seriously 
    entertaining the idea of granting patronage. Ilithyia subtly 
  disrupts the thought.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        They do favor Batiatus' men like no 
                        others. Especially Spartacus.

                        all the Republic. For I have taken 
                        a wild beast, and forged him into a 
                        god.

                        I would see words made flesh.

                        Easily conjured. Spartacus trains 
                      in the square with the other men.

                        for the stench. Summon the Thracian 
                      to the villa. With the rest of your

                        All.

  OFF GLABER, expecting his command to be obeyed...



  A crush of GLADIATORS are assembled, all in chains. Glaber 
  moves past Agron and Duro, then Crixus. Crixus glances 
  across the room at Naevia, who averts her eyes in shame. 
  Ashur notes the building rage in Crixus.

  GLABER COMES TO REST

  in front of Spartacus, looking him over in cool dissection. 
  Batiatus tenses.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                        The Champion of Capua. A sad day 
                        when an honored city elevates a cur 
                      to such position.

  Spartacus catches sight of Aurelia standing near Mira, says 
  nothing. Now is not the time.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)

                        I see you have taught the animal 
                        not to speak out of turn. I would 
                        have demonstration of other tricks 
                        the Thracian has learned. Unchain 
                        him.

  Batiatus reluctantly nods for Hector to unchain Spartacus. 
  Spartacus steps forward, taking two practice swords from 
  Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Which of my men would you have

                        Formation.

  They draw their swords and spread out, forming a huge circle 
  around Spartacus. Mira, standing near Aurelia, tenses.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus wields practice swords. I 
                        fear he is at disadvantage.

                                        GLABER
                        I but give him chance to prove his 
                        legend. Iovis.

  IOVIS, a thick-jawed brute, steps forward with a grin. 
  Doctore shoots Batiatus a look -- this is not right. 
  Batiatus signals Doctore to stand down. Ilithyia grins 
  wickedly as she watches from Lucretia's side.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        How exciting.

  Lucretia shoots her a tight look.

                                        GLABER
                        Begin!

  Iovis charges. Spartacus deflects, his twin wooden swords 
  slicing the air with deadly, practiced intent. Iovis is 
  completely dismantled by Spartacus' superior skill and 
  agility. He crashes to the floor, bleeding and unconscious.

  SPARTACUS

  locks eyes with Glaber, ready for more.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Vesper! Linus!

  VESPER and LINUS rush in from opposite sides, attacking 
  Spartacus. Batiatus tenses, realizing Glaber intends to kill 
  Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Legatus --

                                        GLABER
                        You opened this door, lanista. And 
                      we shall pass through it.

  Spartacus battles Vesper and Linus. Vesper manages to slice 
  Spartacus across the shoulder. Spartacus grunts, redoubles 
  his own assault. Vesper goes down. Glaber snarls, signaling 
  the rest of his men to attack.

  MIRA

  looks on with worry as Glaber's remaining men swarm in. 
  Spartacus takes a few hits, driving him back. His eyes land 
  on Batiatus for a brief, frozen moment. Spartacus' resolve 
  hardens -- he will not die while Batiatus yet lives.

  SPARTACUS ERUPTS,

  a man possessed. He counters and attacks, a demon of pain 
  and vengeance. MEN scream as BLOOD splatters.

  CRIXUS WATCHES,

  detached from the life and death struggle as his eyes 
  continue to flick to Naevia. A smile bends Ashur's lips as 
  he drifts towards Naevia, intent on seeing his own battle 
  with Crixus concluded.

  SPARTACUS SPINS AND ATTACKS

  Glaber's men in a frenetic orgy of violence. The last man 
  crashes to the floor. Spartacus stands in the center of a 
  circle of the semi-conscious, bleeding men. Batiatus beams.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

  Spartacus bows his head in "respect".

                        Dominus.

                        This savage caused Rome great 
                        offense!

  Glaber surveys his injured men -- and can't help but 
  consider Spartacus with begrudging respect.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Yet it appears you have broken the 
                        man.

  Ashur slides in next to Naevia in the background.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        The way he bows in deference. Would 
                        I be afforded such courtesies, I 
                        wonder, if patronage were to be 
                        awarded?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He would be yours to command, as 
                        all my men.

  Glaber locks eyes with Spartacus.

                                        GLABER
                        Kneel. And it shall be so.

  Spartacus hesitates. Batiatus tenses. Spartacus glances to 
  Aurelia -- and complies.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Legatus.

  Glaber smiles in satisfaction. Batiatus glows, all his hopes 
  and dreams about to be realized. ANGLE ON ASHUR

  as he seizes the moment to bring his own devious plans to 
  fruition. He gently brushes back Naevia's hair to kiss her 
  neck -- SMILING AT CRIXUS AS HE DOES.






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  REVERSE ON CRIXUS

  as the shock of recognition slams into him that Ashur is the 
  man Batiatus gave Naevia to. Naevia looks at him for the 
  first time. Her sad eyes a silent confirmation.

  CRIXUS SNARLS IN RAGE,

  launching himself across the room. TIME SLOWS as Batiatus' 
  eyes widen in shock. Doctore starts to move, but it's too 
  late. Crixus knocks Spartacus over and slams into Ashur, 
  TIME RESUMING as they smash to the ground.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You fucking cunt!

                        Crixus!

  Lucretia gasps as Crixus smashes Ashur in the face. Blood 
  splatters. Ilithyia fights to stifle a GIGGLE. Crixus 
  bellows in rage, but is pulled off by Doctore, who struggles 
  to contain him. Spartacus rises, rushes to help Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  a hiss)(

                        Speak!

  Crixus says nothing. Naevia starts to speak to defend him, 
  but Ashur cuts her off.

                                        ASHUR
                        I but touch my gift, and Crixus 
                        goes mad. I felt her maidenhood 
                        long absent when we lay together. 
                        Now I know whose cock was in her 
                        first.

  Ilithyia glances at Lucretia, her eyes dancing at the 
  revelation. OFF LUCRETIA, her face flushing with rage and 
  betrayal...                                                                                    40.



  Naevia CRASHES to the floor. Face bloody. A BRUISE across 
  her right cheek. Lucretia towers over her, eyes wild.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You little whore!

  Lucretia viciously kicks her in the stomach.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        How long?! How fucking long?!

  Naevia says nothing, trying to catch her breath. Lucretia 
  rages, kicking her repeatedly.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Answer me! How long have you

                        long have you been luring him into 
                        your filthy cunt?!

  THE GATE KEY dislodges from Naevia's robe, landing on the 
  floor in SLOW MOTION with a thunderous metallic BOOM. A 
  frozen beat. Lucretia slowly retrieves it.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        What is this?

  Naevia SPITS blood, shaken and terrified.

  Tears well in Lucretia's eyes, rage giving way to the sting 
  of treachery.

                        You alone knew my feelings for him.

  Naevia looks in Lucretia's eyes for the first time. Defiant.

                        Crixus never loved you. He only did 
                      as commanded.

  That hits Lucretia hard. She turns away.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Mira!

  Mira enters.

                        Bring me a knife.

  Lucretia looks to Naevia, murder dancing in her eyes. OFF 
  NAEVIA, fear constricting her heart...



  Batiatus tries to calm the turbulent waters with Glaber.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have assurance Crixus will be 
                        punished.

                                        GLABER
                        I fear your hands too soft for the 
                        task.

  Lucretia enters, wiping blood from her hands with a cloth. 
  Ilithyia clocks the blood, tensing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You mistake them. They are as 
                        steel, hardened to their purpose.

                                        GLABER
                      As I to mine. I return to Rome, 
                        absent unworthy entanglements.

  Glaber turns to go with Ilithyia. Batiatus erupts.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Do not turn from me!

  Glaber spins around in anger.

                                        GLABER
                        You forget your place, lanista!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                        Clear the fucking room! Tell Ashur 
                      to bring our gift for the Legatus!

  Batiatus' house Slaves scurry out.

                                        GLABER
                        Keep your gifts. I would part as 
                        from a troubling dream, untethered 
                      by the memory of it.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Oh you will remember this day. 
                        Until you lay to slumber, never to 
                        awaken.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I fear we have let events run the 
                        best of us.

                        Perhaps a cup of wine to cool our 
                        heads.

                                        GLABER
                      We are long past civilized 
                        recourse. Your husband presses 
                        issue. And I would see it closed.

  Ashur, now with a broken nose and swollen eye, appears with 
  an ornate rectangular box.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As would I.

  Batiatus motions to Ashur, who hands the box to Glaber.

                                        GLABER
                      Do you really believe this will 
                        make a difference?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Open it and see.

  Glaber scowls as he pulls off the top revealing A WOMAN'S 
  DECAYED, SEVERED HAND resting inside, rings still gracing 
  boney fingers. Glaber tenses in surprise. Ilithyia SHRIEKS.

                                        GLABER
                        What is this abomination?

                        But a piece of the whole. Licinia. 
                        Cousin of Crassus.

  Fear rises in Ilithyia's chest. Lucretia shoots Batiatus a 
  worried look. This is a very dangerous game he's playing.

                                        GLABER
                        You murdered Licinia?

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. Your wife did.

  Glaber stares at Ilithyia in disbelief.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      He lies.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A most heinous act. One I was 
                        content to help obscure, under 
                        promise of her aid in obtaining 
                        your favor. Now I fear Licinia's 
                        body may resurface. On the grounds 
                      of your villa, perhaps?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I will see the tongue ripped from 
                        your fucking mouth!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Even so ruined, it would yet speak 
                        the truth.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                to Glaber)(
                        Cladius. You cannot believe me 
                        capable of such a thing.

  Glaber looks deep in her eyes. Searching for the truth for a 
  tense beat. He finds it, veiled behind her pleading eyes. 
  Glaber suddenly SLAPS Ilithyia hard across the face, sending 
  her to the floor, blood leaking from a busted lip.

                                        GLABER
                                to Batiatus)(

                        further embarrassments. Make all 
                        other arrangements with Ilithyia. 
                        She will be remaining in Capua.

  Batiatus beams as Glaber sweeps out. OFF ILITHYIA, bleeding, 
  watching the life she knew leave with him...



  Glaber's Men roughly herd the shackled Gladiators into the 
  cells. Iovis shoves Duro.

                                        DURO
                        Fuck ass, you Roman cock.

  Vesper CRACKS Duro with a truncheon. He half collapses into 
  Agron's arms, face bleeding. The Gladiators yell and 
  protest. Glaber's men shove them into the cells and lock 
  them. Spartacus whispers to Agron and Duro from the 
  adjoining cell.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would caution softer words.

                        The shit keeps rising higher in 
                        this fucking hole.

  Spartacus considers that, a plan starting to form.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Perhaps it best not to be present, 
                        when it fills the mouth.

  This is not said lightly. Gets their attention.

                                        AGRON
                        What do you speak of?

                        Nothing sounds much like escape.

  Spartacus' look confirms that this is exactly his meaning.

                                          DURO(cont'd)
                        And how would "nothing" find way 
                        through Batiatus and all his 
                        fucking Romans?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        There is but one path.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS, his eyes darkening with impending 
  violence.

  OFF the ominous proclamation...
