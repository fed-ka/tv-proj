2ND DRAFT - 9/28/11BLACK.  Silent.  The Void.  Until--

A FAINT FLAME SPARKS TO LIFE.  Feeble.  Wheezing as it 
struggles to breath.  And moving...

The tiny flame crawls across the darkness...  Until it 
disappears for a moment...  And then--  KABOOM!

SMASH TO:

EXT MERCHANT SHIP - DAY

--where SMOKE BILLOWS OUT OF THE JUST-FIRED CANNONS of this 
trading vessel.

ON THE DECK, sailors move urgently to their stations.  Almost 
to a man, they look good and scared... Except, that is, for--

THE MERCHANT CAPTAIN, standing on the quarterdeck.  Glaring 
out towards the sea defiantly, where we see--

A PIRATE SHIP, bearing down on us.  Just a few hundred yards 
away.  A BLACK BANNER flies from its mainmast...

The Captain strides off. Off the Mate, shaken, we go--

ACROSS THE DECK, where SAILORS SWIRL ABOUT PREPPING THE SHIP.  
Among them, we find one man without a job to do.  This is the 
 COOK SHIP S(doughy, 40s). Looking out at the approaching

the pages.  Looking for something.  Running out of time.  

Finally, he finds the page he was looking for.  Rips it out, 
rolls it up, inserts it into a SMALL LEATHER POUCH... 

INT. MERCHANT SHIP - BELOW DECK - MOMENTS LATER

The Cook emerges, trying to blend in.  Heads down a corridor, 
but quickly has to take cover as he s almost steamrolled by--

A THRONG OF MEN emerging from the armory, carrying CUTLASSES, 
RIFLES--  The Cook hides--  Waits for them to pass...

The coast clear, he emerges.  And takes note of the armory, 
and its HEAVY IRON DOOR...

The Young Sailor shuts the door.  Locks the deadbolt.

A monster so violent and cruel,

The Mate watches as the Pirate Ship closes in... A PIRATE 
SNIPER takes a potshot at the Mate-- Misses by inches.  The 
Mate recoils.  Realizes he s out of time... He makes the sign 
of the cross, then enters the bunker, and SLAMS THE DOOR--

sound of MULTIPLE THUDS up above... Off Cook and Sailor--

GRAPPLING HOOKS FLY OVER THE BULWARKS of the Merchant Ship, 
landing on the deck with a SERIES OF THUDS, before being 
pulled tight...  Straining...  Pulling us closer to the

THE QUARTERDECK BUNKER, looking out through a small LOOPHOLE.  
It s cramped in here.  Dark.  Merchant Sailors (including the 
First Mate) peer out of the loopholes, RIFLES at the ready.  

ON THE MERCHANT CAPTAIN, at the rear of the crowded bunker.  
Nervous.  Waiting.  Listening to the sounds of the GRAPPLING 
ROPES straining, as his ship is hauled in by the Pirates.  Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   5.


Around him, SAILORS hold cutlasses, axes...  In case the 
bunker is breached.  

FIRST MATE
Collision up!

And as the Pirate Ship finally SLAMS INTO THE MERCHANT SHIP--

INT. MERCHANT SHIP - ARMORY - SAME

The Cook and Sailor are thrown to the ground from the 
collision... As they fall, we see THE LEATHER POUCH slide out 
of his hiding place, into the open.  Meanwhile--

INT. MERCHANT SHIP - QUARTERDECK BUNKER - SAME

The Sailors right themselves, resume their positions by the 
loopholes--  Peer out to see--

PIRATES-- Swarming onto the deck--  Among them, their PIRATE 
CAPTAIN, identifiable even at this distance by the way he 
confidently directs and positions his men...

Fire!

The Gunmen FIRE their muskets through the loopholes. But the 
Pirates respond...  Throwing SMOKE GRENADES onto the Merchant 
Ship deck...  Quickly, THE DECK IS COVERED IN A HAZE OF 
SMOKE.  The Pirates disappear into it.  And all goes silent.

The Merchant Captain stares out into the smoke.  Beat.

MERCHANT CAPTAIN (CONT D)
Powder boxes.  On my command.

By his feet, a RUNNER nods, before ducking down a ladder to--

THE SUB DECK, where the Runner silently SIGNALS another 
SAILOR, stationed down a narrow corridor... Then ANOTHER... 
Until the silent message finally reaches--

A GALLEY FULL OF TRIGGER MEN...  A DOZEN OR SO, spaced out in 
the dark.  Lit only by the faint flame from their HOT IRONS.  
Each stands by a FUSE dangling from the ceiling...  Leading 
to BOOBY TRAPS on the deck above...  

BACK IN THE BUNKER, with the Captain, as he peers out into 
the silent smoky haze.  Listening.  Waiting for some signal 
as to the pirates position...  Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   6.


MERCHANT CAPTAIN (CONT D)
Come closer, bastards...

The silence persists. The tension builds.  And we GO:

INT. MERCHANT SHIP - ARMORY - SAME

Where the Cook and the Sailor are dusting themselves off, the 
ship quiet for the moment.  The Cook notices, however, that 
the Sailor is HOLDING THE MYSTERIOUS POUCH he dropped...

SAILOR
What is it?

And as the Cook takes a HACK AT THE SAILOR, we CUT BACK TO:

INT. MERCHANT SHIP - SUBDECK - SAME

BACK with the Trigger Men, irons at the ready.  Above, they 
can hear the faint sound of FOOTFALLS.  CREAKS in the wood.  
The pirates are right above us...  

From up the corridor, the SILENT SIGNAL arrives--  The 
TRIGGER MEN LIGHT THEIR FUSES--

BACK IN THE BUNKER, the Captain waiting for the sound of 
exploding pirates...Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   7.


But there is no bang.  No nothing.  Just silence.  The 
Captain turns to the Runner by his feet--

MERCHANT CAPTAIN
I told you to fire the mines!

RUNNER
We did, sir.

On the Captain...  Starting to get that sinking feeling...

MERCHANT CAPTAIN
How did he do that...?

FIRST MATE
Sir.  We may still have time--

MERCHANT CAPTAIN
(ignoring him)
Those mines were hidden.  Proofed 
against tampering. A dozen of them.

FIRST MATE
Sir, if we do not surrender now, 
Flint will kill us all--!

The Captain quickly produces a PISTOL--  POINTS IT IN THE 
 FACE.   A tense beat.  Things getting out of hand, MATE S
rapidly...  But the moment is broken by--

A FAINT KABOOM of a cannon firing in the distance... Followed 
quickly by a loud CRACK of impact.  Then SILENCE.  Looks 
exchanged--  What the hell was that?  The Men all crowd up to 
the LOOPHOLES...  Peer out... And then they hear--

A DEEP, HORRIBLE GROAN...  Like from some kind of monster...  
Goosebumps all around the bunker.

The Captain then sees something out in the smoke... He inches 
closer to his portal to get a better look...  Just in time to 
see something coming this way...  SOMETHING HUGE...

Below deck, the fight now over.  A few pirates search the 
belly of the ship for cargo.  At their lead is an older

locked door... The ARMORY.

GATES
No, but I have business here, so 
the job falls to you.   Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   20.


BILLY
And what is the job, exactly?

GATES
The Captain is going to ask Richard 
for a favor.  Richard is going to 
say no.  When that happens, the 
Captain will, most likely, react 
poorly.  When that happens, I need 
you to restrain him.  

Billy stops dead in his tracks.  It takes Gates a few steps 
before he realizes.  Doubles back to Billy...  

GATES (CONT D)
No cargo moves off this island

connections.  He is not someone we 
need to be making an enemy of.

He reaches in, and pulls out--  A BOOK.  THEN ANOTHER.  A 
handful of journals of varying sizes.  

Silver looks around.  Makes sure no one is watching him...  
Carefully selects THREE BOOKS that are the same size as his 
MYSTERIOUS TORN-OUT PAGE...

He opens one. On the first page: Captain s Log -- Vol.1.  
Silver compares the mystery page-- THE HANDWRITING MATCHES.  

 He then quickly flips through the book.  But it doesn t
appear to be missing a page.  Opens the next book.  Flips.  
Nothing missing there either.  Ditto, the third one.  But he 
notes that the books are labelled Vols. 1, 2 and 4.  THERE S 
ONE MISSING.  Off Silver, getting closer to an answer--

MOMENTS LATER, we find Dufresne, hunched over a makeshift 
table, recording cargo as its unloaded in a ledger...

Bleeding from a knife wound to the

Maybe this is better.  Be rid of

Flint responds with a nod.  PULLS HIS SWORD.   

Singleton pulls his sword... And--

Billy looks up, surprised.  Flint staggers toward him,

Billy looks up, sees Flint staring back.  A silent message.  
Are you with me...?  

Billy is frozen.  He holds the captain s fate in his hands.  
We stay on his face for a VERY LONG TIME, before--
