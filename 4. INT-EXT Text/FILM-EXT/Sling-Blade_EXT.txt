Karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap. He
stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few
people around stare at him, then he starts walking.
A SERIES OF SHOTS
Karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the
window at a man having his hair cut.
In front of the police station.
Staring at an empty school yard...
Karl stands and stares at the building for a moment. He sees
a woman take a tray of food from the window.
When she's gone, he walks up to the window. A pimply-faced
TEENAGE BOY comes to wait on him.
BOY
Can I help you?
KARL
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or
'nother d'eat.
BOY
Well, what did you want?
KARL
You have any biscuits for sale?
BOY
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Karl stands in silence for a moment.
BOY (CONT'D)
Did you decide, sir?
KARL
What you got that's good to eat?
BOY
Well, I guess it's all good.
KARL
What do you like to eat here?
BOY
French fries. I like to eat them
pretty good.
KARL
French-fried potaters.
BOY
Yeah.
KARL
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get
some of them I reckon.
BOY
Sixty for small and seventy-five
for large.
KARL
Give me the big'uns.
Karl digs in his pocket for money.
Karl sits on a bench eating french fries. After a moment, a
twelve- or thirteen-year-old BOY comes out of the laundromat
wrestling three or four big bags of laundry. He can't seem to
get a plan together for carrying them all. Karl gets up and
goes over to him. The boy looks up at Karl, a little startled
by Karl's strange figure looming over him.
BOY
These dang things are heavy. Hard
to carry, too.
KARL
What you got in there, warshing?
BOY
Yeah.
KARL
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to
tend to it?
BOY
I got a mama, but she's at work
over at Ben's Dollar Store. My
daddy's dead.
(pause)
He got hit by a train.
KARL
How fer you going with them sacks
full of warsh?
BOY
About a half a mile I think it is.
KARL
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't
give out first.
BOY
Okay. You don't have to though.
Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.
They walk in silence for a while before the boy finally
speaks.
BOY
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's
your name?
KARL
Karl's my name.
FRANK (BOY)
What's you last name?
KARL
Childers.
FRANK
What are all them books?
KARL
Different ones. One's the Bible.
One of 'ems a book on Christmas.
One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
FRANK
How come you're carryin' them
around with you.
KARL
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
FRANK
Don't you live somewhere?
KARL
I did live there in the state
hospital.
FRANK
Why'd you live there?
KARL
I killed some folks quite awhile
back. They said I wadn't right in
the head and they put me in there
in the nervous hospital instead of
puttin' me in jail.
FRANK
They let you out?
KARL
Yeah.
FRANK
How come?
KARL
They told me I was well. They had
to turn me loose.
FRANK
Are you well?
KARL
I reckon I feel all right.
FRANK
You don't seem like you'd kill
nobody.
They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up
the sidewalk.
FRANK (CONT'D)
This is my house. You can just set
those bags on the porch.
Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each
other in silence for a moment.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Do you like to play football?
KARL
I never was much count at it. I
never did get picked out fer it.
FRANK
Me and the Burnett twins and some
boys plays down at the junior high
practice field all the time. If you
ever want to come by and play. We
ain't no good either. Well, I'll
see you later.
He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door.
Karl is walking down a residential street. He stops in front
of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the
house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares
at it. A curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the
window. He comes and opens the door.
FRANK
Hey there. I thought I heard
somebody on the porch. Wasn't your
name Karl?
KARL
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
FRANK
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
KARL
You told me to come by.
FRANK
Did you want to play ball with us?
KARL
I ain't no good at it. I just come
by.
FRANK
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to
go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar
Store. She's workin' two till
eight.
KARL
All right then.
He starts to walk away.
FRANK
Wait a minute. You want to go with
me? You can meet my mama.
KARL
I don't want to worry your mama
with company.
FRANK
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's
real nice. She'll give us somethin'
if we ask her to. Candy or
somethin'.
KARL
I was kindly needin' to do some
tradin'. Reckon they sell
toothpaste?
FRANK
They sell some of everything. Come
on let's go. I won't tell her about
you bein' in the state hospital for
killin'.
Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit.
FRANK
This is what I call my secret place
'cause I come out here when I feel
like bein' by myself. I used to
come here with Karen Cross. She's
kind of like my girlfriend, or used
to be. She says she likes Jerry
Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
back 'cause I love her. We used to
come here and hold hands and talk
and read books to each other with a
flashlight. She didn't want to have
anything to do with me in front of
other people 'cause I don't have
any money. Well, mama and me, I
mean. She seemed to like me a whole
lot when we were out here though.
She said she loved me, too. Out
here. Settin' right on that stump
you're on. See, her daddy's a
dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry
Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice
plant. Was your folks well off?
KARL
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough
to scrape by on, I reckon.
FRANK
They still around, your folks?
KARL
My mother's dead. My daddy's
s'posed to be around still. He
don't want to have nothin' to do
with me though.
FRANK
How do you know?
KARL
He never did want to. I figure he
ain't changed his mind much.
FRANK
How did your mama die?
KARL
(long pause)
You don't need to know all of that.
You're just a boy.
You need to think about good
thoughts while you're still a boy.
They'll be plenty of time for the
other.
FRANK
I've had a lot of bad thoughts
since my daddy died. Sometimes I
wish I was still real little and he
was still here. My mama's real
good, but I wish I had both of 'em.
(pause)
When we went to Memphis one time in
the car, it was rainin' so hard we
couldn't see the road. But I wadn't
scared because I thought as long as
daddy was drivin' nothin' could
happen to us. I feel that way about
mama now.
(he looks at the ground
for a moment)
Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
is Doyle Hargraves. He works
construction so he makes a pretty
good livin'. He still don't help
mama out with any money though. He
ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
don't like me at all. Mama says
it's because he's jealous I belong
to my daddy instead of him. He
stays with us all night sometimes,
but he's got his own house.
Somebody told me it's so he can
still have other girlfriends. I
like it on the nights when he ain't
at our house. I'm not so nervous
then.
KARL
How come her to keep bein'
girlfriends and all with him if
he's mean to her?
FRANK
She says it's for the times when
he's good to her. She's lonely
since daddy died. She said
sometimes she don't know why.
(pause)
He threatened to kill her if she
ever left him. My daddy would kill
him if he was here and somebody was
mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
But he's not able to do anything to
Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
to go with men instead of women.
That makes him not to be able to
fight too good. He sure is nice
though. He's from St. Louis. People
who are queer can get along better
in a big town. He got transferred
here to work. But mama said the
real reason he left is 'cause his
daddy hated him. For bein' the way
he is. I wish he liked to go with
women. I'd rather him be mama's
boyfriend than Doyle.
Pause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Karl.
(pause)
You know when I said daddy got hit
by a train.
KARL
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me
that.
FRANK
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself
with a shotgun on purpose.
KARL
Why did he do that, reckon.
FRANK
'Cause he didn't have enough money
to take care of us the way he
wanted to. That's what the letter
said. He got laid off from work and
had to just work odd jobs. I
thought he took care of us fine.
(pause)
Karl, did you really kill somebody?
KARL
Yeah, I did.
FRANK
Who did you kill?
KARL
Two people.
FRANK
Were they bad people?
KARL
I thought they was.
FRANK
Maybe they needed it.
KARL
I growed up and got taught it ain't
right to kill nobody.
FRANK
It's okay if you're lookin' out for
yourself. If it's self-defense. Was
it self-defense?
Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
doesn't answer.
FRANK (CONT'D)
My daddy was good. I think too many
good people die. It ain't right.
That's what I think.
Karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books
staring at the door. After a moment, we hear a car door slam
and footsteps on the porch. Then we hear Vaughan's voice.
VAUGHAN
Karl?
Karl turns to face Vaughan.
KARL
Yes sir.
VAUGHAN
So, you're really going to stay
here?
KARL
That boy wants me to.
VAUGHAN
Did you knock on the door yet?
KARL
Naw, I ain't.
VAUGHAN
How long have you been standing
here?
KARL
Quite a spell, I reckon.
VAUGHAN
Listen, before you get very used to
staying here, I think you and I
need to talk about a few things.
Can I take you to lunch?
KARL
I done et just a little bit ago.
VAUGHAN
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
KARL
I reckon I can stand to eat a
little somethin' or 'nother at
noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox
generally gets me a box of french
fried potaters. But I reckon he can
lay off doin' it tomorrow.
VAUGHAN
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and
get you at noon.
They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know
exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a
moment, Frank answers the door.
FRANK
Hey. Y'all come on in.
The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
"band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's
wheelchair as it rolls back and forth.
Bill Cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man.
Bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start. A car
pulls into the parking lot and Gerry Woolridge gets out of it
and comes over to Bill.
BILL
How 'bout you, Jerry.
WOOLRIDGE
How are you, Bill?
BILL
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick
tiller here. What's got you down
this way?
WOOLRIDGE
Just thought I'd check on Karl and
see if everything's working out.
BILL
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for
them rackets and breathin' things
he does. Ain't threatened me with a
killin' or anything.
(laughs)
But boy you couldn't of been more
right about him fixin' things. That
son of a bitch is a regular Eli
Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves
french fries. Eats four larges and
don't even so much as belch. I'm
proud to have him.
WOOLRIDGE
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
BILL
He's gone to stayin' over with that
Wheatley boy and his mama in their
garage. I think that little boy
adopted him damn near like a
mascot. But he's got a key here to
come and go as he pleases.
Everything's worked out good.
WOOLRIDGE
Can I see him?
BILL
Sure.
Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on
new mowers in the front window.
BILL (CONT'D)
Scooter! Run get Karl for me.
Woolridge and Karl lean on the hood of Woolridge's car. In
the background, Bill and the old man tinker with the tiller.
WOOLRIDGE
Are you sure you're okay staying
with that woman and boy?
KARL
Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE
Do they know about you?
KARL
My history.
WOOLRIDGE
Yeah.
KARL
I told 'em about it. They know I'm
well. That Mizz Wheatley made me
some biscuits.
WOOLRIDGE
I'll be.
KARL
That boy, he's my friend. He likes
the way I talk and I like the way
he talks.
WOOLRIDGE
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I
just wanted to check on you. I'll
say bye to Bill and get on back.
They walk over to Bill.
BILL
Karl, see if you can figure out
what's wrong with this thing. It
won't crank up and ever'thing seems
to be put together right.
Karl squats beside the tiller.
WOOLRIDGE
I'll see you, Bill.
BILL
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry
about your boy here, he's doin'
good.
Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.
KARL
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
BILL
See there. Thinks of the simplest
thing first.
Karl and Melinda are walking in the moonlight. It seems a
little hard for Melinda to keep up.
MELINDA
You walk fast, don't you?
KARL
I reckon.
They walk a little farther in silence.
MELINDA
These is the worst shoes I own for
walkin'. How far did you want to
go?
KARL
I ain't really thought about it too
much I don't reckon.
They walk until they disappear into the darkness.
Holding the flowers, Karl is walking down the sidewalk toward
the Wheatley house when he sees Frank coming out the front
door with a book and a flashlight. He sees Karl.
FRANK
Hey Karl, you off work?
KARL
Yeah.
FRANK
Where'd you get them flowers?
KARL
That gal that made employee of the
month give 'em to me for awalkin'
with her.
FRANK
I was goin' to the secret place. I
borried one of your books to take
down there. You ain't mad, are you?
KARL
Naw. You can look at all my books
you want to.
FRANK
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
KARL
That's than un on Christmas I was
tellin' you about.
FRANK
You want to go with me?
KARL
Yeah.
Karl and Frank sit in the clearing, Karl on the stump, Frank
on the ground. Frank is shining the flashlight on the book.
He finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight.
FRANK
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a
while.
KARL
All right then.
FRANK
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a
long time ago, didn't they?
KARL
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like
to tore me up when I read about
that pore little cripple boy.
FRANK
Yeah, me too.
(pause)
That was nice of that woman to give
you them flowers.
KARL
Hit was right thoughty of her.
FRANK
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
KARL
All right then.
FRANK
You know that girl I told you
about. The one I love.
KARL
Yeah, I recollect it.
FRANK
Would you go see her with me? I
kind of thought I might take her
some flowers like that woman done
you.
KARL
If you want me to.
FRANK
I ain't got no money to get 'em
with but I bet Vaughan will let me
have some of them flowers at the
store.
KARL
I bet he will. I got a little money
if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
FRANK
I usually get run off by her mama
or daddy if they're home. Reckon
why they don't like me?
KARL
They ort to. You're a good boy.
FRANK
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean
I don't love her.
KARL
Naw.
FRANK
And I don't try to touch her. You
know, in a bad way. Foolin' around,
sex and all.
KARL
That's real good. You ort not to if
ye ain't married to somebody. Bible
tells you that much. Hit tells some
things that don't seem right too, I
reckon. I guess a feller ort to
foller it close as he can, though.
(pause)
You don't touch yourself, do you?
FRANK
What do you mean?
KARL
Pull on your works. Your privates.
FRANK
Oh, jackin' off?
KARL
Yes sir. You ort not know that
language.
FRANK
I didn't know till here while back
a year or two ago when I spent the
night with Ronnie Smart one time.
He said just tug on your peter and
think about your mama. I tried it,
but I felt funny thinkin' about my
mama. So, I switched over to
thinkin' about his mama and then
what he told me would happen,
happened. It sure tingles, don't
it?
KARL
You ort not to pull on yourself
that away.
FRANK
I kind of like you tellin' me what
to do and not to do. Just like my
daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'
me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to
do. Mama said the only way to ever
get away from him is for him to get
away from us. That we can't leave
him or he'll try and hurt her.
KARL
He ain't no count.
FRANK
You don't seem like a daddy. You
seem like a brother.
(pause)
Wonder what makes you like somebody
right off when you don't even know
'em like what happened with me and
you.
KARL
I don't reckon I know.
FRANK
And then some people you don't like
right off. It's funny.
(pause)
You know why I want you to play
ball with me?
KARL
Naw.
FRANK
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if
you ain't no good. It takes your
mind off of everything else while
you're doin' it. When you run real
fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
don't think about anything else. I
ain't no good, but my daddy always
said he was proud of me when I
threw a ball or ran with it. Did
you have any brothers and sisters
growin' up to play with?
KARL
I had one there for little bit. Hit
didn't get old enough to play with.
FRANK
Why not? It died?
KARL
Yeah.
FRANK
Why?
KARL
Hit was borned a little too early
on. My mother and father made hit
come too early some way or other. I
reckon they changed their mind
about havin' another'n. I was about
six or eight year old then and they
didn't care too much for me so I
reckon they didn't need somethin'
else to worry 'em with.
FRANK
So it died when it come out?
KARL
My daddy come to the shed out back
and got me and said throw this here
away and handed me a towel with
somethin' in it. I went for the
trash barrel there and opened up
the towel to see 'cause they was a
noise and somethin' movin' in it.
Hit was bloody-like around that
towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty
baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
FRANK
It was alive?
KARL
Yes sir. Right then it was.
FRANK
A boy or girl?
KARL
A little ol' boy.
FRANK
You threw it in a trash barrel?
KARL
I didn't feel right about doin'
that. I takened a shoe box from
there in the shed and emptied out
some screwdrivers and nuts and
warshers from it and put the little
feller in that and buried him in
the corner of the yard there. That
seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
FRANK
It was still alive when you buried
it?
KARL
I heared it cryin' a little through
that box.
FRANK
That don't seem right. It seems
like you should have kept him alive
and took care of him if he was your
brother.
KARL
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon
I didn't know what to do. I didn't
know how to care for no baby. Mama
and Daddy didn't want him. They
learned me to do what they told me
to. These days I figure it might of
been best to give him right back to
the Good Lord right off the bat
anyhow.
FRANK
That makes me feel real sad.
Couldn't you have done somethin',
Karl? I would have. I wish I would
of had him. He'd be here right now.
Livin'.
KARL
Hits been hard thinkin' about it.
They ain't a day goes by I don't
think about it. I kindly have a
picture of it up in my head that I
see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have
bad thoughts on it. I wished they
was somethin' I could of did, too.
Shouldn't no bad things happen to
childern. All the ol' bad things
ort to be saved up for folks that's
growed up, the way I see it. I
shouldn't of told you about that. A
boy ort not hear about such things.
It just kindly come out.
FRANK
I didn't mean to say anything bad
about you. I know you're good. You
didn't mean no harm.
(pause)
Did you ever think about killin'
yourself on purpose like my daddy
did?
KARL
I've studied about it. The Bible
says not to or you end up goin' to
Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I
call it Hades.
FRANK
Bible says the same thing about
killin' others, too.
KARL
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Frank, flowers in hand, and Karl approach a very nice two
story house. They get to the door and Frank rings the
doorbell.
FRANK
I always get nervous when I hear
that doorbell. I'm okay just
walkin' over, but somethin' about
that dang doorbell. They have one
room where you can't walk on the
carpet or sit on the furniture. I
don't see much sense in havin' it.
The door opens and we see an older black lady, the
HOUSEKEEPER.
HOUSEKEEPER
(eyes Karl)
Son, I don't know why you keep
comin' over here. You know these
folks don't want you here. They run
you off ever' time. Don't keep
doin' this to yourself. You a sweet
boy. Now go give them flowers to
somebody that'll enjoy 'em.
FRANK
Ma'am, I really want to give them
to Karen.
HOUSEKEEPER
(to Karl)
You his daddy?
KARL
No ma'am.
HOUSEKEEPER
Well, whoever you are, you ought to
talk some sense into him. That
little old girl is way too fast for
him and don't wanna see him no way.
FRANK
Will you get her for me. Please. I
really want to see her.
She'll want to see me, too, 'cause
we're not in public. Just don't
tell her folks I'm here.
HOUSEKEEPER
(sighs)
Okay.
She disappears and a moment later KAREN appears. She's
thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed.
KAREN
(put out)
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming
over here. My parents really don't
want you to.
FRANK
I wanted to bring you some flowers.
They're pretty good ones.
KAREN
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm
not an idiot. Besides we have a
garden full of flowers.
She eyes Karl.
FRANK
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.
He's my new friend. But I feel like
I've always known him. I thought
you should meet him.
KAREN
Why? Hi, Karl.
FRANK
He's gonna be around a lot and I
hope you are too, so...
KAREN
Here give me the flowers, I'll do
something with them. Thank you. Now
you better go. Maybe I'll see you
down at the secret place one day in
a week or two or something. I have
a boyfriend now you know. And we're
pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
She proudly displays the ring.
FRANK
Can you go there with us now? Me
and Karl. We could just hang out.
Karl has some cool books.
KAREN
Frank, I just like you as a friend.
Only at the secret place. Okay? I
can't go there now. I'll see you
later.
FRANK
But maybe just for awhile --
KAREN
I'm closing the door now. I told
you, I'll see you later.
She closes the door. They stand therefor a moment, then walk
away down the sidewalk.
FRANK
She said she'd see me later. That's
kinda good, right?
KARL
I reckon.
Frank and Karl walk up the steps to the house. Frank opens
the door and they enter.
A MAN and a TEENAGE BOY stand by a pickup truck. A small
generator is on the tailgate.
BILL
Karl, lift this thing down and
carry it to the back. It's on the
blink.
(to man as Karl unloads
it)
We'll have it for you in a day or
two, Walter.
WALTER
Y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'
that?
BILL
Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a
bulldozier. Fix anything, too.
(confidentially)
He's mentally retarded, but he's a
whiz on small engines. Lord works
in mysterious ways.
Karl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and
watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The
man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles
his hair.
WALTER
Hell, he didn't just make the team,
Coach says he's probably gonna
start at end on defense. He's a
chip off the old block. Ain't you,
Steve?
STEVE
I guess so.
Karl turns and goes in the shop.
It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl,
Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up.
Four boys are lined on defense. They break the huddle and
come to the line. They are on about the fifty-yard line.
Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. He later als it to
Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run
toward him. Then he takes off like the wind. He runs funny,
kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. All the others
are chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on
about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl
sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the
ball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end
zone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other
boys. Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground.
FRANK
Way to go, Karl. We got a
touchdown. That was a good lateral,
man. That was just like the
Wishbone.
KARL
I dern near had me a touchdown till
them boys got a-hold of me there so
I figured I better give it off to
you. I seen you over there
follerin' me.
FRANK
We're liable to win if we keep this
up. For somebody like you, you sure
run fast.
He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Come on, let's kick off to 'em.
Karl and Frank, dirt, grass stains and all, walk toward home.
FRANK
I know you could of scored them
three touchdowns by yourself
instead of throwing 'em over to me.
KARL
Them boys was tryin' to pull me
down pretty hard.
FRANK
You're strong though. You let me
make them touchdowns so I'd feel
good. My daddy used to do that kind
of thing.
They walk in silence for a moment.
FRANK (CONT'D)
It don't matter to me about us
losin' does it to you?
KARL
No sir.
FRANK
It was fun, anyhow.
KARL
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin'
else just like you told me I'd do.
FRANK
Can we play ever' Saturday?
KARL
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't
like you. I'm old and give out.
(pause)
I'm proud of ye.
Karl is walking down the street past rundown houses. He comes
to an old gray woodframe house. It is in bad repair, the
paint is peeling, the yard is grown up. There is an old
wooden shed in the back yard. He stands looking at it for a
moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
shed. He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.
Karl walks across the yard to the house.
Karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in
the corner and kneels down. He pushes some grass aside to
reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across. In front of
it, the ground is raised a little. He stares at the rock for
a moment and touches it.
KARL
Little feller.
Karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river
below.
Karl is walking away as Linda pulls up in her car and gets
out with fast-food bags.
LINDA
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't
you want some chicken and things?
KARL
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
LINDA
Well, okay. I got you some.
KARL
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't
gonna be in there when you get
indoors.
LINDA
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
KARL
He wanted to go off and play, I
reckon.
(pause)
You go in there and you and that
Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have
to worry yourself none.
LINDA
All right then. Well, I'll see you
later. If you see Frank, tell him
to come on back home. I don't get
to see him all day except Sundays.
He can play tomorrow.
KARL
Ma'am?
LINDA
Yeah.
KARL
You're a good mama to that boy. You
care for him. You work hard fer him
to take care of him. You light him
up in his eyes, I've seen it. He
wouldn't know what to do without
ye.
LINDA
Well thank you, hun. That's real
good of you to say. I wouldn't know
what to do without him either.
KARL
You've been real good to me, too.
It ain't ever'body that'd make
biscuits in the middle of the
night. You and that boy has give me
a good feelin'.
LINDA
We sure like havin' you.
KARL
Thank ye.
(Karl walks away, then
turns)
I'm just getting around to tellin'
you, but I fixed your warshin'
machine.
Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a
stick. He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees
Karl coming toward him.
FRANK
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come
out here?
KARL
I knowed you'd be here.
(Karl sits on the stump)
What are you a-doin' digging with
that stob?
FRANK
Just diggin'.
(pause)
I ain't ever gonna be happy now.
Not with that son of a bitch movin'
in for good. I wish me and you and
Mama could just run away. But she
said he would find us wherever we
went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think
it would of been better if I wadn't
ever born.
KARL
I'm glad of it you was borned.
(pause)
I reckon I ain't gonna be there in
the garage no more.
FRANK
You have to Karl. You have to look
out for me. You don't let that son
of a bitch run you off.
KARL
You're just a boy. You ort not to
use that sort of language.
FRANK
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'
bad about you, but why don't you
stop Doyle when he gets that away?
You're older than him. You're
strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let
him do that to me and Mama.
KARL
That feller's a whole sight meaner
than me. He'd just whup the tar out
of me.
FRANK
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,
you know that. A kid my age
shouldn't be tired of things.
KARL
I'm tired, too, Frank.
(pause)
If I ain't around no more, it don't
mean I don't care fer ye. I care
for ye a good deal. I care for you
more than anybody they is. We made
friends right off the bat.
FRANK
I care for you, too. But you'll be
around, don't say that.
KARL
Hit don't make no difference where
I was to be. We'll always be
friends. There ain't no way to stop
that.
(pause)
I aim for you to have these books.
He hands him the books.
KARL
Maybe you can make more sense out
of them than I can.
I made you a little old book marker
and stuck it in that book on
Christmas.
FRANK
You don't want to give away all
your books.
KARL
I aim fer you to have 'em.
FRANK
Man. Thanks.
(pause)
You know when you get a feelin' and
you don't know why?
KARL
Yes sir.
FRANK
I've got a feelin' today.
KARL
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
FRANK
Like something different. I don't
know.
(pause)
You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
KARL
Will ye do somethin' for me if I
ast you to?
FRANK
You know I would. Whatever you
want.
KARL
Don't go home tonight and stay with
that Doyle. He's got it in for ye
tonight. I got me a feelin', too.
Feels like to me you ort not be
there in that house with him
liquored up and mean. Ye mama
neither. When you get up from here,
I want you to go to that feller's
house. Your mama's friend. I want
you to give me your word on it.
FRANK
Okay. I give you my word. Is
ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you
all right?
KARL
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly
want to put my arm around ye for a
minute and then I'm gonna go on and
leave here.
FRANK
Okay.
Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand
on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then
Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes
the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a
folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be
happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in
the trees.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Karl!
Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other
through the trees.
Karl knocks on the door. After a moment, Vaughan answers in a
pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt.
VAUGHAN
Karl, what are you doing here? Come
in.
KARL
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast
you fer a favor.
VAUGHAN
Okay.
KARL
This evenin' I want you to go get
Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and
have them stay with you tonight.
VAUGHAN
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
KARL
That dern Doyle is in a bad way
again with that drinkin' and bein'
mean to folks. Will you give me
your word you'll do it?
VAUGHAN
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt
them, has he?
KARL
Naw, not yet.
(hands the bag to Vaughan)
I want ye to give this to Mizz
Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe
there's a little somethin' to hep
out. Hits what I've earned fixin'
lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill
Cox.
Vaughan takes the bag.
VAUGHAN
What about you, Karl? Do you want
to stay here?
KARL
I don't reckon you have to go with
women to be a daddy to a boy.
(pause)
You've been real square dealin'
with me. The Bible says two men ort
not lay together. But I'll bet you
the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody
like you to Hades. Some folks calls
it Hell, I call it Hades.
(Karl starts away)
That boy lives inside of his own
heart. Hits an awful big place. You
take care of that boy.
Vaughan watches Karl walk away.
Karl stares at the bus station door.
Karl stares at the house from the sidewalk.
Karl stares into the river.
Karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the
living room.
