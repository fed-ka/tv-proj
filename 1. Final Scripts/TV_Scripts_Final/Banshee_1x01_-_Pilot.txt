                                    May 16, 2011      EXT. ATTICA PRISON - MORNING

      An outer gate slowly opens to reveal...

      LUCAS HOOD (40) -- lean, rugged, dangerous-looking -- 
      standing in a holding area, just being released.  He wears a 
      denim shirt and jeans.  He steps past the gate, watches it 
      close behind him, and only then turns to face the world.


      VARIOUS SHOTS OF LUCAS:

      Walking along the highway/ On a city bus, looking out the 
      window/ In a mostly empty bar, drinking a beer.  He makes eye 
      contact with the SEXY BARTENDER.  She flashes a flirty look. 


      INT. THE BAR S STOCKROOM

      Lucas roughly pulls the bartender s tank top over her head. 
      She s wearing nothing beneath it.  She kisses him as he moves 
      her back against a stand of beer kegs.

      He pulls off her skirt and panties and then he s fucking her 
      up against the kegs.

      CLOSE ON Lucas s hungry expression: he hasn t touched a woman 
      in years.


      EXT. BAR PARKING LOT

      Lucas expertly hot-wires an S.U.V. and then we cut to... 


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

      Lucas drives the S.U.V. - PULL BACK to see he s driving ON 
      THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE toward the Manhattan Skyline.


      EXT. HISHI SALON - DAY

      A large, trendy, Greenwich Village hair salon.  Lucas crosses 
      the street and steps inside.


      INT. HISHI SALON - CONTINUOUS

      Techno MUSIC.  Flamboyant haircutters work and gossip.  Lucas 
      takes in the scene, then moves with purpose toward the back.                                                                                      2.


      An ATTRACTIVE ASIAN STYLIST (35) in a tight leather miniskirt 
      sees Lucas through the mirror as she cuts a woman s hair.  
      Only when she speaks do we realize she - JOB - is a  he. 

                                  JOB
                    Fuck me...


      INT. JOB S BASEMENT LAIR - MOMENTS LATER

      Job comes downstairs to find Lucas standing at a workstation 
      full of state-of-the-art computer monitors and equipment.

                                  LUCAS
                          (not turning around)
                    Hi, Job.

      He runs his finger across a monitor and the screen comes 
      alive with files.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Cool.

                                  JOB
                          (nervous)
                    You re out.

                                  LUCAS
                    I m out.

      Lucas turns to face Job, his expression gravely expectant.

                                  JOB
                          (pleading)
                    Listen, I know why you re here, but 
                    I can t help you.

      Lucas shakes his head: wrong answer.  He reaches back, knocks 
      a monitor off the desk.  It hits the floor with a CRASH.

                  JOB (CONT D)LUCAS
      Hey!Just give me the address.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Why are you assuming that I even 
                    know-

      Lucas picks up another monitor, a light and sleek one.  He  
      tosses it like a frisbee across the room.  Smash.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Jesus!  Quit breaking my shit!                                                                                      3.


                                  LUCAS
                    Worry about what I ll start 
                    breaking when I run out of shit.

                                  JOB
                    Come on, man.  You know how it 
                    works.  The trail is cold.  

      Lucas rips an LCD screen off the wall and tosses it at Job s 
      high-heeled feet, where it bursts into pieces.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Fuck!  Okay, okay!  Just stop the 
                      carnage...

      Lucas looks up at Job and smiles congenially.


      EXT. HISHI SALON - A BIT LATER

      Lucas pulls out of his parking spot.  A few car lengths 
      behind him, a DARK LEXUS SEDAN pulls out to follow.  There 
      are three bad-ass looking MEN in dark suits in the car.  The 
      driver has a chiseled face and a sharp widow s peak.


      EXT. BROADWAY - MINUTES LATER

      Lucas, driving down BROADWAY, checks his mirror.  CLOSE ON 
      the mirror, which shows the Lexus a few cars back.  Lucas 
      floors it, weaving through rush hour traffic.  The Lexus 
      follows and pulls right behind Lucas.  

      Suddenly, Lucas yanks the wheel, braking the SUV sideways. 

                                  MEN IN THE LEXUS
                    WATCH OUT!/ FUCK!

      The SUV slams to a stop perpendicular to traffic.  THE LEXUS 
      CRASHES INTO the SUV s front passenger door.  Other cars 
      swerve and crash into both vehicles.

      Lucas tries to get out, but his door is pinned by another 
      car.  He climbs out the shattered passenger window, runs up 
      and over the Lexus, and takes off running up the middle of 
      Broadway as speeding cars honk and swerve around him.

      GUNSHOTS ring out and bullets shatter the windshields of 
      approaching cars.  Lucas looks back to see WIDOW S PEAK and 
      the other two GOONS chasing him and shooting at him.

      When Lucas looks forward, he sees a DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR BUS 
      hurtling toward him.  The bus driver swerves desperately, 
      jackknifing the bus.                                                                                        4.


      At the last second, Lucas jumps clear of the swinging edge of 
      the bus, which then hits one of the pursuing goons, who grabs 
      hold of a rail and rides it for a moment.  THE BUS JUMPS THE 
      CURB AND SLAMS INTO A BUILDING, CRUSHING THE GOON TO DEATH.

      Lucas looks back to see Widow s Peak charging relentlessly 
      through the melee, shooting.  Looking ahead, Lucas sees a MAN 
      ON A MOTORCYCLE idling at a cross street.  The guy wears a 
      slick suit and looks very Wall Street.  

      Lucas takes a running jump and lands on the bike, straddling 
      the seat, basically in the guy s lap.

                                  LUCAS
                    Get off.

                                  GUY ON MOTORCYCLE
                    Fuck you!

      Lucas shrugs, grabs the handles and accelerates the bike 
      across Broadway through the oncoming traffic.  The Wall 
      Street guy holds on to Lucas and yells indignantly.

      As they tear away down the cross street, Widow s Peak stops 
      and takes aim.

      ON LUCAS, as the guy holding him keeps yelling.  We hear a 
      shot, and A BULLET BURSTS THROUGH WALL STREET GUY S HEAD, 
      TAKING HALF HIS FACE WITH IT.

      Lucas looks back as the dead man falls off the bike. Another 
      shot rings out.  Lucas guns the engine and gets the fuck out 
      of Dodge. 

      ON WIDOW S PEAK and his remaining partner as they watch Lucas 
      speed away.  As approaching SIRENS wail, PULL UP AND HIGH to 
      see the carnage strewn up and down Broadway.


      EXT. BANSHEE P.A. - DAY

      Idyllic Pennsylvania countryside, large stretches of 
      farmland.  Cows in pastures.  Amish farmers work the land.

      Lucas, in a stolen BLACK CAMARO, drives on a two-lane road, 
      passing this farmland.  He passes a sign: WELCOME TO BANSHEE, 
      POP. 11,400.  He drives into town, cruises down Main Street.

      Lucas s POV: young mothers push strollers, skateboard punks 
      jump sidewalk benches.  Three fresh-faced young Special 
      Forces soldiers in tan camo uniforms walk down the street, 
      eating ice cream cones.                                                                                      5.


      Two teenage Amish girls in traditional garb walk by a 
      lingerie shop called Bedroom Eyes: one lingers to look at a 
      window display of a topless female mannequin in a black 
      leather thong.  The other girl pulls her friend along.  

      On Lucas stopping and idling at the red light in the center 
      of town.  To his right is the TOWN HALL.  As he drives out of 
      the frame, we STAY ON Town Hall.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. A TOWN HALL COURTROOM - DAY

      The gallery is empty save for one man sitting in the back:  
      DAN KENDALL (late 20s), the town s ridiculously young mayor.  

      D.A. GORDON HOPEWELL (40s) stands at the prosecution table, 
      next to an assistant D.A.  Over at the defense table sits...

      KAI PROCTOR (45), tall, powerfully built, with an aura of 
      confident power.  He has long, almost boyishly blond hair.  
      His defense lawyer stands beside him.

      An aging Judge enters, pulling his robe on over a track suit.

                                  JUDGE
                    Good morning, everyone.  I ve 
                    reviewed the defense s motion to 
                    dismiss, and, based on the 
                    evidence, or lack thereof, it is my 
                    opinion that the Prosecution cannot 
                    sustain the burden for a trial - 

                      GORDONJUDGE
      -Are you kidding me?!-so I m finding for the 
                                                    defense. Case dismissed.

                                  GORDON
                    Your Honor!

                                  JUDGE
                    You can t take this to trial, 
                    Gordon. You should be thanking me 
                    for saving you the embarrassment.

      The Judge leaves.  Gordon collapses into his seat.  Proctor 
      and his lawyer start out of the room, pausing by Gordon.

                                  LAWYER
                    Gordon.                                                                                      6.


                                  GORDON
                    Andy.  Is that a judge in your 
                    pocket, or are you just happy to 
                    see me?

      Proctor smiles.  He is a silent, menacing presence.  Heading 
      out of the room, Proctor and his lawyer pass the Mayor 
      simmering by the door.

                                  LAWYER
                    Mr. Mayor.

      Proctor and his lawyer exit.  Gordon, still seated, spins in 
      his chair to face the Mayor, who is absolutely stewing.

                                    KENDALL
                    Jesus Christ, Gordon.

                                  GORDON
                    Pace yourself, Dan.  Our day will 
                    come.

      Dan nods curtly, then exits, leaving Gordon alone in the 
      courtroom.  Gordon wearily turns to gather his papers into 
      his briefcase.  Suddenly, in a fit of anger, he violently 
      shoves the whole mess off the table.


      EXT. THE STEPS OUTSIDE TOWN HALL - MINUTES LATER

      Gordon walks downs the steps where he sees:

      CARRIE HOPEWELL (38), striking and sexier than a small town 
      wife has any right to be.  She gives him a kiss.

                                  CARRIE
                    You ll get him next time, 
                      counselor.

      They head down the steps together.

                                  GORDON
                    I m ready for this day to be over.
                          (off her loaded look)
                    What?  No.  Again?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. A BLUE MINIVAN - AFTERNOON

      Carrie drives, Gordon rides shotgun.                                                                                        7.


      DEVA HOPEWELL, 15, rebelliously sexy and precocious, in 
      skimpy black clothes with a Goth edge, sulks in the back 
      seat.  Her younger brother, MAX, 8, thin and frail, small for 
      his age, sits next to her playing a video game on his PSP.

                                  GORDON
                          (at Deva, pissed)
                    You kicked your teacher?!

                                  DEVA
                          (bored)
                      Substitute teacher.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, well that s okay then.

                                  DEVA
                    He s a perv, Mom!  He tried to see 
                    down my shirt.

                                  GORDON
                    Well, with a shirt like that, it 
                    doesn t take much trying.

                      CARRIEDEVA
          (quietly)So it s my fault?! So if I 
      Gordon.get molested by a teacher, 
                                                  you ll just blame my shirt?

      Gordon sighs.  Deva s attire is clearly an ongoing issue 
      between Carrie and Gordon.


      EXT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON

      The minivan pulls past a mailbox that says HOPEWELL, and into 
      the driveway of a mid-sized white colonial.  Max and Deva run 
      into the house ahead of their parents. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Dr. Welling referred Max to a new 
                      pulmunologist.  We have an 
                      appointment next week.

                                  GORDON
                    Great.

      Carrie looks at Gordon, who seems tense and distracted.

                                  CARRIE
                    You want me to cancel on the 
                    Frears?                                                                                      8.


                                  GORDON
                    Crap, that s tonight?

                                  CARRIE
                    I ll tell Joss we can t make it. 

                                  GORDON
                    No, I ll just take a shower, chew 
                    some aspirin.  I ll be fine.


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      They step inside.  Carrie moves down the hall to the kitchen, 
      while Gordon heads upstairs.  


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

      Carrie, sipping at a coffee mug, flips through the mail on 
      her kitchen counter.  She sets down the last envelope and 
      looks up through the picture window facing her backyard.


      CARRIE S POV OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW OF HER BACKYARD

      LUCAS HOOD IS STANDING IN THE YARD, staring right back at 
      her.  She gasps and drops her coffee mug, which shatters on 
      the floor.  Hot coffee splatters by her feet. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Ow!

      She jumps back, stung by the hot coffee.  When she looks up 
      again, Lucas is gone.

      Deva walks in and indifferently takes in the mess as Carrie, 
      still stunned, looks up at her daughter.  The doorbell rings.

                                  DEVA
                    That s Beaty.  Later.

      She leaves. 


      EXT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

      Carrie steps out the back door and looks around the empty 
      yard, shaken.                                                                                        9.


      EXT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

      Deva comes out the front door.  Her friend BEATY (15), also 
      in dark clothes, is waiting for her on the porch. 

                                  DEVA
                    You re late, bitch.

                                  BEATY
                    Whatever, skank.

      The two girls come down the porch steps.


      ON LUCAS IN HIS CAMARO

      He drives slowly past the house, staring with fascination at 
      Deva, turning in his seat to watch her as he passes.

      Deva looks up, sensing his eyes on her, but by the time she 
      registers the Camaro, Lucas has sped up and is out of view.


      INT. LUCAS S CAMARO - A BIT LATER 

      Lucas drives toward the outskirts of town, deep in thought.  
      He sees a dilapidated brick building with neon beer signs in 
      a window.  A sign over the door says: 

                              THE FORGE  

                     Drink-Eat-Both

      Lucas pulls into the lot and parks near two other vehicles.  
      Out back behind the Forge is a small house and a separate 
      garage, and beyond them a LAKE is visible through some trees.


      INT. THE FORGE - MOMENTS LATER

      It s a former Amish blacksmith shop turned into a pub.  In 
      one corner are an old forge oven and anvil.  Tables and 
      chairs, a pool table, a long wooden bar counter.    

      Lucas enters.  The place is empty, but at the bar s far end 
      is a beer pint beside a table setting.  A TV above the bar 
      plays a ball game.  There s no one behind the bar until...

      SUGAR BATES (58), African-American, grizzled, comes through a 
      swinging door from a kitchen.  He sets a plate of steak and 
      fries down near the beer pint, then sees Lucas by the door.                                                                                    10.


                                  SUGAR
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.  I m 
                    between cooks, so it s kind of a 
                    one man show for now.  You re not a 
                    cook, are you?

                                  LUCAS
                          (moving to the bar)
                    Sorry.

      Sugar sizes him up.

                                  SUGAR
                    I m gonna go with shitty day, and 
                    whiskey neat.

                                  LUCAS
                    Shitty fifteen years.  Whiskey s 
                    fine. 

      Sugar sets down a glass, pours Lucas a whiskey.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    One for you too.

      Sugar nods thanks, pours a shot.  They drink, Sugar refills.  

                                  SUGAR
                    You coming or going?

                                  LUCAS
                    I m still working that out.

      Lucas spies a framed photo hanging above a row of bottles; a 
      young black boxer uppercuts a white boxer.

                                  SUGAR
                    That s me... Sugar Bates in the 
                      cruiserweight years.   

                                  LUCAS
                    The other guy looks outclassed.  
                    What d you drop him, in the fifth?

                                  SUGAR
                    The eighth.  He was a southpaw- 
                    they take longer.

      Lucas drains his glass.  Sugar refills it and studies Lucas.

                                  SUGAR (CONT D)
                    So, where d you sit?

      Lucas meets Sugar s gaze, impressed by the man s intuition.                                                                                     11.


                                  LUCAS
                    Attica.

                                  SUGAR
                    I did eight years in Allenwood.  
                    You look fresh.
                          (holds up his glass)
                    Freedom.

      They clink glasses, drink.  Lucas looks to the pub s back as 
      a men s room door opens.  Out steps: 

      A TALL MAN (45) with a no-nonsense bearing, in boots, jeans 
      and a rumpled leather jacket.  He sits to his steak and beer, 
      looks at Lucas and Sugar.  The two ex-cons have gone silent.

                                  TALL MAN
                          (at Sugar)
                    Always this quiet around here?
                          (off Sugar s shrug)
                    Well, let s stimulate the local 
                    economy.  A round on me.

      Lucas and Sugar nod thanks.  Sugar fills his and Lucas s 
      glasses, pours the tall man a beer.   

                                  SUGAR
                    All you tourists buying me drinks 
                    today. 

      He raises his glass, toasting them, and downs the shot.

                                  TALL MAN
                    Actually, I m not a tourist.  

      Bringing his plate, he moves to get the beer and join them.

                                  TALL MAN/SHERIFF
                    Come Monday, I m being sworn in as 
                    sheriff.

      Lucas gives the tall man an appropriating, semi-wary glance.

                                  LUCAS
                      Congratulations.  Do you say 
                      congratulations, or good luck?

                                    SHERIFF 
                    I ll take both, thanks.  I spent 
                    nine years as sheriff in Bend, 
                    Oregon.  Ever hear of it? 

      They haven t.                                                                                    12.


                                    SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    I m not surprised.  Anyway, this is 
                    my first day east.  I drove clean 
                    across the country.  Less to see 
                    than you d think.         

                                  SUGAR
                    I thought a sheriff had to be 
                    elected.

      The tall man nods as he cuts meat and eats.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Me too.  Turns out, under certain 
                      circumstances, the mayor can 
                    authorize a ringer.  Sheriff Hale s 
                    the one who hired me.  I was 
                    looking forward to meeting him.

                                  SUGAR
                    That d be a hell of a trick, since 
                    he died last Tuesday.

                                    SHERIFF
                          (nods knowingly)
                    Liver cancer.  I think he thought 
                    he had more time. 
                          (shrugs)
                    I hope he got my paperwork in.

      SOUND of the front door opening.  Lucas turns to see TWO 
      SILHOUETTED MEN striding inside out of the daylight.  One has 
      a scar on his jaw, the other s bald.

      They glance at Lucas and the sheriff, then stare at Sugar, 
      who sets two glasses on the bar, pours shots of Johnnie 
      Walker.  The sheriff has a bite of steak, watches the thugs.

                                  SUGAR
                          (as he pours)
                    On the house, boys. 

      The thugs leave the whiskey untouched.  

                                  BALD THUG
                    Glad you re feeling so generous.

      He casually draws a GUN.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                          (to Sheriff and Lucas)
                    You two sit tight.                                                                                    13.


      Sugar sighs and goes to the till.  The sheriff unbuttons his 
      coat.  Lucas sees a GLOCK in the sheriff s shoulder holster.  
      Lucas catches the sheriff s eye and shakes his head.  But the 
      sheriff DRAWS HIS GLOCK, jumps up.  

                                    SHERIFF
                    Sheriff s department!  I ll take 
                    that gun now.

      Both thugs step back surprised.  Bald Thug whips an automatic 
      handgun from behind his back, and both point their guns at 
      the sheriff.  Lucas takes it all in, measuring, calculating.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                          (at the sheriff)
                    No, you drop your fucking gun!

                                    SHERIFF
                    The only thing I ll drop is you, 
                    son, if you don t put that weapon 
                    down right now.

      Suddenly, Lucas steps into the center of the stand-off, hands 
      raised.  He speaks in a congenial, easygoing manner:  

                                  LUCAS
                    Okay, what we have here is your 
                    classic Mexican standoff.  I m 
                    actually feeling kind of left out 
                    without a gun, you know?

                                  BALD THUG
                    Who the fuck s this guy now?

                                  LUCAS
                          (to Scarred Thug)
                    Hey, that s the new PZ-600, isn t 
                    it?  That s a hard gun to get.  
                    How s the recoil?

                                    SCARRED THUG
                    Like shaking hands with a baby.

                                  LUCAS
                    Sweet.

                                    SHERIFF
                          (to Lucas)
                    Sit your ass down.

                                  LUCAS
                    Just hear me out, Sheriff.  They ve 
                    got you outgunned.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                  LUCAS (CONT'D)
                    You shoot either one, the other s 
                    got you at close range.

                                    SCARRED THUG
                    Damn straight we do.

                                  LUCAS
                          (to the thugs)
                    On the other hand, one of you boys 
                    is dead, or else shitting into a 
                    bag for the rest of your life. And 
                    for what?  The two hundred or so 
                    bucks Sugar s got in the register 
                    at four PM on a Tuesday?  So, 
                    Sheriff, how about you just let 
                    them take the cash.  Then I ll put 
                    down a card and buy us enough 
                    drinks to make Sugar whole.  What 
                    do you say, fellas?

      The sheriff seems about to nod, when HE SHOVES LUCAS ASIDE 
      AND FIRES AT SCARRED THUG.  The bullet grazes Scarred Thug s 
      shoulder and his gun falls.  In the same instant:

      BALD THUG SHOOTS THE SHERIFF TWICE IN THE CHEST.  The sheriff 
      is blown off his feet, landing across the room.  As Bald Thug 
      turns to shoot Lucas... 

      LUCAS EXPLODES INTO ACTION.  He grabs Bald Thug s wrist as 
      the gun fires.  The shot goes past Sugar s ear and hits the 
      BOXING PHOTO behind him.  Lucas spins and twists Bald Thug s 
      arm into an Aikido lock that breaks it at the elbow savagely 
      enough that BONE BURSTS THROUGH SKIN. 

      Still holding the guy, Lucas grabs the Sheriff s STEAK KNIFE 
      from his plate and HE SHIVS THE BALD THUG once each in the 
      guts, heart, and throat, dropping him as BLOOD SPURTS.

      SCARRED THUG TACKLES LUCAS, pinning him onto a dinner table.  
      He gets his hands around Lucas s throat, strangling him.  
      Wheezing, Lucas grabs a ketchup bottle and bangs it against 
      Scarred Thug s temple.  The thug falls toward him.

      LUCAS JAMS THE KETCHUP BOTTLE skinny-end first into Scarred 
      Thug s mouth and down his throat.  The thug stands, choking, 
      eyes bulging.  

      Lucas hits him in the chest with a flying side kick.  The 
      thug flies back and down.  THE BACK OF HIS HEAD GETS IMPALED 
      ON THE TIP OF THE ANVIL, HARD ENOUGH TO PIERCE HIS SKULL AND 
      SHATTER THE KETCHUP BOTTLE FROM BEHIND.

      SCARRED THUG twitches once and dies, with pieces of bottle 
      glass and ketchup dripping from his mouth.                                                                                      15.


      Lucas moves to the side of the fallen sheriff, who s still 
      alive, barely.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Am I dead?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah.

                                    SHERIFF
                    My first day in town.  Shit.

                                  LUCAS
                    I m sorry.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Christ, that stings.
                          (shudders, fading)
                    I hope my mother was right about 
                    God.

      HE DIES.  Lucas sits on his ass, rubs his throat where the 
      thug was choking him.  Sugar walks out from behind the bar.  

                                  SUGAR
                    Jesus Ripshit Christ.  Is he dead?

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah.

      Sugar walks to where the dead thug is stuck to the anvil.  
      Using his foot, Sugar nudges the corpse till its head 
      unsticks from the anvil.  The corpse drops away.  Sugar comes 
      to Lucas, crouches beside him.  They look at the dead thugs.

                                  SUGAR
                    This is what the Bible calls a 
                      clusterfuck of epic proportions.

                                  LUCAS
                    Two cons and three corpses, one of 
                    them a cop. I don t like that math.

      The two men look at each other as they stand.

                                  SUGAR
                    You get going.
                          (off Lucas s look)
                    They would have killed me, same as 
                    him.  Least I can do is give you a 
                    head start.

                                  LUCAS
                    What about you?                                                                                    16.


                                  SUGAR
                    I got a few tricks.  Now get out of 
                    here.

      Lucas studies Sugar s eyes, then backs out the front door.


      INT. THE FREARS  HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      In a nice suburban home, three well-dressed couples --
      including Carrie and Gordon Hopewell -- are having dinner.  
      All are drinking wine, finishing salads.

      JOCELYN FREARS (40) walks around with a tray, serving what 
      look like small gourmet hamburgers to each guest.  Carrie is 
      picking at her salad with a distracted look.  

                                    JOCELYN FREARS 
                    These are beef brisket sliders with 
                    Cabot cheddar and white pepper cole 
                    slaw.  They re fun, right?

                                  LARRY FREARS 
                    They re small. 

                                    JOCELYN
                          (at Larry)
                    And if I couldn t have fun with 
                    small things, where would you and I 
                    be, huh?

      Everyone except Carrie laughs.  LARRY FREARS (45) rolls his 
      eyes at his wife, then lifts a wine bottle, pours more into 
      Gordon s glass.  He moves on to Carrie s glass.

                                  LARRY FREARS
                    Refill, gorgeous?

      Carrie shakes her head no, absently.  He pours her more wine 
      anyway, then moves on to another guest s glass.  Gordon 
      notices that his wife is tuned out: he squeezes her hand.

                                  GORDON
                    Carrie?  You okay?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah.  I m fine. 

      Trying to brighten, she smiles at him, has a bite of food.  
      We see a tightening shot of Carrie as she struggles to pay 
      attention to the group.  She s a million miles away.                                                                                    17.


      INT. THE FREARS  HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 

      Carrie puts dirty plates in the sink.  She grabs a plastic 
      bag of empty wine bottles, walks down a hall toward a door. 


      EXT. THE FREARS  BACK DECK - CONTINUOUS

      The deck is on stilts ten feet above the back lawn, with a 
      steep side staircase down to the yard.  Carrie comes out onto 
      the deck, puts her bottles in a recycling bin.  She steps to 
      the railing, looks out into the yard, perturbed.      

                                  LARRY (O.C.)
                    What are you doing out here alone?

      Carrie turns: Larry Frears has stepped out onto the deck.

                                  CARRIE
                    I just needed some fresh air.   

      He closes the door behind him, joins Carrie.  He drinks from 
      a whiskey flask, offers her a sip.  She demurs.  He looks her 
      up and down: she s wearing a tight, low cut dress.  Larry 
      drunkenly ogles her breasts.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    I m up here, Larry.

                                  LARRY
                    I know.

      He leans forward and tries to plant a kiss on her mouth.  
      Carrie makes a surprised sound as she steps away from him.

                                  CARRIE
                    What the fuck?    

      Larry holds his hands up.

                                  LARRY
                    I m sorry.  I m a little smashed.

                                  CARRIE
                    Don t worry about it. 

      He looks out drunkenly at his lawn, points to one part of it.

                                  LARRY
                    I need to treat for grubs over 
                    there.

      He suddenly turns on Carrie again, this time grabbing her 
      breast as he kisses her.  In one fluid, explosive motion...                                                                                     18.


      CARRIE BRINGS HER ELBOW DOWN onto his arm, straight-punches 
      his throat, SPINS AND KICKS HIM THROUGH THE RAIL OF THE DECK.

      Larry falls out of view.  We hear a thud and a scream.

      Carrie gasps, shocked at her overreaction.  She looks over 
      the edge of the deck.  Larry is on his back on the lawn.  
      Twisted under him, his arm is horribly broken.

                                  CARRIE
                    Shit!

      She runs down the stairs to him, and kneels over him.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Larry, I m so sorry!

                                  LARRY
                    You bitch!  Stay away from me!

      Jocelyn, Gordon, and the other guests run out onto the deck, 
      and then down the stairs to Larry s side.

                                    JOCELYN
                    Oh my God, what happened?!

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t know.  The railing just 
                    gave way.

                                  LARRY
                    MOTHER OF SHIT, THIS HURTS!!  Call 
                    an ambulance, Joss! 

      Jocelyn whips out a cell and starts dialing.  Gordon fixes 
      Carrie with an inquisitive look.  She can t meet his gaze.


      INT. THE HOPEWELL HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Barefoot, wearing shorts and a tank top, Carrie sits alone in 
      the kitchen, drinking a glass of wine.  The house is dark and 
      silent.  She looks out the window, sees something.


      EXT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

      Moonlight, a breeze, some leaves blowing over the lawn.  Now 
      wearing a sweatshirt, Carrie walks across the grass to the 
      woodshed and steps behind it... 

      ...to find Lucas sitting pensively on a low tree stump.  He 
      is holding a framed picture in his hands, studying it.                                                                                    19.


                                  LUCAS
                    Hi, Sam.

      Carrie stares, at a loss.  Every tension in the universe is 
      sparking between them.

                                  CARRIE
                    How did you find me?
                          (off Lucas s look)
                    Spineless tranny. 

                                  LUCAS
                          (nods toward her home)
                    It s a nice house.  It seems...I 
                    don t know, solid.  So what do you 
                    have, two kids?
                          (off her nod)
                    How old?

      We now see he s studying a framed photo of Carrie, Gordon, 
      Deva, and Max.

                                  CARRIE
                    My son s eight.  My daughter s 
                    thirteen.

                                  LUCAS
                    Huh.  She looks older.
                          (beat)
                    I can smell your perfume from here.

      Carrie pulls a gun out from behind her back and points it.

                                  CARRIE
                          (the hint of tears)
                    You need to leave.  Please.

      Lucas watches her, his expression now dead serious.

                                  LUCAS
                    Sam.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not her anymore.  I m Carrie.

                                  LUCAS
                    Okay.

                                  CARRIE
                          (angry)
                    You could have led Rabbit straight 
                    to me!                                                                                    20.


                                  LUCAS
                    You know me better than that.

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t know you at all anymore.

      Lucas seems pained by that.  He gets up, walks over to her, 
      and presses the barrel to his chin.

                                  LUCAS
                          (sincere)
                    Then just shoot me.  I m a 
                    convicted felon on your property.  
                    You re golden.

      Carrie appears to seriously consider it.  He stares into her 
      eyes, accepting, as she pulls fractionally on the trigger.  
      Then she lowers the gun, stifles a sob.  Lucas considers her 
      gravely, then nods.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    You moved on.  I get it.  Just give 
                    me what I came for and you won t 
                    see me again.

                                  CARRIE
                          (dismayed)
                    I don t have the diamonds.

                                  LUCAS
                    What do you mean you- 

                                  CARRIE
                    -I don t have them! 
                          (off his incredulous 
                            stare)
                    After we screwed Rabbit like that, 
                      I couldn t clear them with anyone 
                    local, and you d gotten caught- 

                                  LUCAS
                    I did not get caught!

                      CARRIELUCAS
      Shit!  I know.  Listen- There were two of us in that 
                                                    building. I led them away 
                                                  from you! 

      Beat.

                                  CARRIE
                    The fence I found, these real 
                      bottom-feeders - Serbians -  they 
                    saw me coming.                                                                                    21.


                                  LUCAS
                    You re telling me that YOU got 
                    rolled?

                                  CARRIE
                    Rolled hard.
                          (gestures around her)
                    Does it look like I m sitting on 
                    ten million dollars?!

      Lucas sits back down on the tree stump, defeated.

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t get the girl.  I don t get 
                    the money.  I spent fifteen years 
                    picturing this day, and this isn t 
                    how I saw it playing out.

      Carrie watches him, devastated.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m so sorry.

      SOUND from off camera.

                                  GORDON (O.C.)
                    Babe?  You out here?

                                  CARRIE
                          (alarmed)
                    Shit!  That s Gordon!

      She peeks around the building, sees Gordon standing at the 
      back door.  She spins back around.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Please!  You have to go -

      But Lucas is already gone.  Resting on the tree stump is the 
      picture frame he was holding.  But the photo itself is gone. 


      EXT. THE FORGE - NIGHT

      We see shuttered windows and on the door a handwritten sign 
      that reads  CLOSED - GAS LEAK.   We track around the building 
      to see Sugar loading a corpse, wrapped in a checkered table 
      cloth, into the back of an old pick-up.  The corpse falls 
      into the truck bed, on top of two other wrapped corpses.

      Sugar climbs into the driver s seat and only then notices 
      Lucas sitting in the passenger seat.                                                                                    22.


                                  SUGAR
                          (startled)
                    Christ!  You trying to kill me? 

                                  LUCAS
                    Sorry.  You got a place picked out?

      Sugar gives him a hard gaze.  Lucas meets it.  Sugar shakes 
      his head and starts the truck.  They drive into the night.

                                  SUGAR
                    You re one of those complicated 
                    types, is that it?

                                  LUCAS
                    Nah.  People just don t always know 
                    simple when they see it.


      EXT. BANSHEE WOODS - NIGHT

      In a dark ravine, Lucas, shirtless, stands waist-deep in a 
      hole, digging.  Two bodies wrapped in tablecloths lie nearby.  
      Sugar emerges through the trees, carrying the third wrapped 
      body.  He lays it down gently.

                                  SUGAR
                    It doesn t seem right burying the 
                    sheriff here with that pond scum.

                                  LUCAS
                    We ll dig him his own hole.

                                  SUGAR
                    Yeah... that d be the Christian 
                    thing to do.

      Sugar grabs a second shovel and jumps down into the hole.  A 
      cell phone RINGS.  Both men look around.

                                  SUGAR (CONT D)
                    That you?

      Lucas shakes his head no.  He climbs out of the grave, goes 
      through the dead sheriff s pockets, pulls out his ringing 
      cell phone.  On the screen it says  MAYOR KENDALL.   Sugar 
      shakes his head at Lucas, don t do it.

      Lucas pushes TALK, answers the phone.

                                  LUCAS
                    Hello.                                                                                    23.


                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    Sheriff Hood?  Mayor Dan Kendall.  
                    Am I catching you at a bad time?

      Phone to his ear, Lucas crouches, rifles the dead sheriff s 
      pockets, finds a bloody badge that says LUCAS HOOD, SHERIFF, 
      BANSHEE, PA.  

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (CONT D)
                    Sheriff?  Are you there?

      Lucas studies the badge, a wild idea firming up in his mind.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yes, this is Hood.   

      Sugar shakes his head at Lucas, incredulous.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    How s the drive going?

                                  LUCAS
                    Less to see than you d think.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    I just wanted to confirm our 
                    breakfast Friday.  You ll be here 
                    by then?

                                  LUCAS
                    I should be.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    Great.  So that s nine am at the 
                    Gravy Train.  I m looking forward 
                    to meeting you in person.

                                  LUCAS
                    I ll see you there.

      Lucas hangs up, pockets the phone.  He looks up to see Sugar 
      gazing at him with bemused curiosity.

                                  SUGAR
                    Tell me you have some kind of 
                    master plan here?

                                  LUCAS
                    I usually just get by on my charm.

      Job sits in his computer lair, his wig off.  The phone rings 
      and Job picks up.

      INT. THE FORGE - NIGHT

      Lucas sits at the bar on Sugar s phone, washing blood off the 
      badge as he talks.  His clothes are muddy.  Sugar is behind 
      the bar, pretending to be busy, but listening to Lucas talk.


      INTERCUT: LUCAS AND JOB

                                  LUCAS
                    I need a favor.

                    Lucas Hood, of Bend, Oregon.

      Job expertly types and touches his screen as data streams.

      A photo of the sheriff in uniform appears on the screen.

                    might have run a picture...

                                  LUCAS
                    So you can t do it.

                                  LUCAS
                    -I ve got the badge.

                                  JOB
                    I don t even want to know.

      Lucas hangs up and hands Sugar the phone.  Sugar considers 
      him for a long moment.

                                  SUGAR
                    Some cons, the minute they get out, 
                    they re just trying like hell to 
                    get back in. 

                                  LUCAS
                    I m not going back.

                                  SUGAR
                    Well, you ve got a revolutionary 
                    method of staying out of trouble.                                                                                    26.


      Lucas gets up and offers Sugar his hand.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks for everything you ve done.

      Sugar shakes hands and watches thoughtfully as Lucas leaves.


      INT. LUCAS S CAMARO - LATER

      Lucas is behind the wheel, conked out.  A KNOCK on the window 
      rouses him.  He looks out at Sugar, who is gazing in at him.


      EXT. SUGAR S GARAGE - NIGHT

      Sugar, carrying linens and a pillow, walks Lucas up an 
      external staircase.  Lucas stops, transfixed by THE MOON 
      hanging low over the woods.  Sugar looks on, understanding. 

                                  SUGAR
                    There s a lot of things that are 
                    hard about getting out.  But seeing 
                    the moon again ain t one of them.


      INT. SUGAR S GARAGE APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Lucas climbs into an old queen-sized bed.  He moves around, 
        unaccustomed to such space.  Eventually he moves the bed two 
      feet from the wall, brings his blanket and pillow and lies on 
      the floor between the bed and wall, staring upward.


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Gordon sleeps in bed.  Carrie s side is empty.  A shower can 
      be heard running.  


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The room is filled with shower steam.  Carrie sits on the 
      floor, arms around her knees, weeping, stricken.


      INT. SUGAR S GARAGE APARTMENT - DAWN

      LUCAS LURCHES UP FROM SLEEP IN HIS PLACE ON SUGAR S FLOOR 

      In a sweaty panic, he gasps for air, his eyes wild.  He is 
      shirtless, wearing only jeans.  He staggers to the door...                                                                                     27.


      EXT. SUGAR S GARAGE APARTMENT - MORNING

      ...and bursts out onto the upper landing of the stairs.  He 
      grasps the railing, haunted and trembling in the cold gray 
      dawn.  Behind him, through trees, the lake glistens.


      EXT. THE LAKESIDE NEAR THE GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

      On the shore, Lucas does push-ups furiously.  Still only in 
      jeans, he has vicious knife scars across his back.  He 
      finishes his push-ups, then kneels, panting, staring at the 
      water, his face looking haunted.


      INT. THE FORGE - LATER

      Lucas kneels, scrubbing the anvil with a soapy rag.  Sugar 
      finishes hanging a FRAMED PICTURE of Muhammad Ali where the 
      boxing picture used to be.  SOUND of car wheels on gravel.  
      Sugar looks out the window...


      SUGAR S POV OUT THE FORGE S WINDOW

      A silver Bentley Continental Coupe pulls in the parking lot.


      BACK ON SUGAR AND LUCAS INSIDE

                                  SUGAR
                    Go back and stay out of sight.

                                  LUCAS
                    What is it?

                                  SUGAR
                    Just go.

      Lucas heads into the kitchen.


      EXT. THE FORGE - CONTINUOUS

      Kai Proctor steps out of the Bentley and surveys his 
        surroundings like he owns them.  

      A VERY LARGE ROTTWEILER also hops out of the Bentley and 
      follows Proctor toward The Forge.  At Proctor s command, the 
      dog sits, stationing itself in front of the restaurant while 
      its master steps inside.                                                                                    28.


      INT. THE FORGE - CONTINUOUS

      Sugar pulls out his BEST SCOTCH, pours a generous glass.  The 
      door opens and Proctor walks in. 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Morning, Sugar.

                                  SUGAR
                    Kai.

      Sugar slides the Scotch across the bar.  Proctor sits down 
      and takes a sip.  These men know each other.

                                    PROCTOR
                    I haven t seen you for a while.  
                    How are the headaches?  Did those 
                    Mexican painkillers I got you help?

                                  SUGAR
                    They did, thanks.  So, what brings 
                    you around?

                                    PROCTOR
                    I seem to have misplaced two of my 
                    men.  Randall and Munson.

      REACTION SHOT OF LUCAS: he s in the kitchen, standing near 
      the door, eavesdropping attentively.

                                  SUGAR (O.C.)
                    Munson the bald one?

                                    PROCTOR (O.C.)
                    That s right.  One of the boys 
                    thought they might have been headed 
                    out this way yesterday afternoon.


      BACK ON SUGAR AND PROCTOR

                                  SUGAR
                    They didn t come here.  I d have 
                    taken note if they did.

      Proctor looks at him, hard.

                                    PROCTOR
                    If any of my employees ever stepped 
                    out of line, hassled you in any 
                    way, I d expect you to call me.

                                  SUGAR
                    I would.                                                                                    29.


                                    PROCTOR
                    What I mean is, I wouldn t want you 
                    taking matters into your own hands.

                                  SUGAR
                    Look at me.  Hell, even my pubes 
                    are gray.  No one runs from a fight 
                    faster than an old fighter.

      Kai looks at him for a long, uncomfortable beat, and then 
      over his shoulder at the picture of Ali.

                                    PROCTOR
                          (pointing to the picture)
                    What happened to your title fight?

                                  SUGAR
                    Oh... I knocked it off the hook the 
                    other night, busted the frame.  I m 
                    having it redone.

      Proctor stands, finishes his Scotch, still watching Sugar.

                                    PROCTOR
                    You ll let me know if you need any 
                    more of those painkillers.

      Sugar nods.  Walking out, Proctor passes the anvil.  He 
      pauses to run his finger along the anvil s wet edge.  He 
      studies his finger for another agonizing beat.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Thanks for the drink.

      He leaves.  Lucas steps back in.

                                  LUCAS
                    That s some car. 

                                  SUGAR
                    You re thinking of stealing from 
                    Kai Proctor, you might as well just 
                    put a bullet in your own head now.

                                  LUCAS
                    Kai Proctor.  There s a name.

                                  SUGAR
                    What the man doesn t own, he runs.  
                    What he doesn t run, he burns to 
                    the ground.

                                  LUCAS
                    He seemed to like you well enough.                                                                                    30.


                                  SUGAR
                    We go back a ways.  But I m not 
                    kidding.  You want to maintain a 
                    quality of life, you steer clear of 
                    him.

      Lucas gazes out the window, watching the Bentley drive off.  


      EXT. HISHI SALON - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

      The sidewalk outside the salon bustles with pedestrians.  


      INT. JOB S BASEMENT LAIR - SIMULTANEOUS

      Job, in full drag, works at his computers.   

      CLOSE ON: The monitor.  We see Sheriff Lucas Hood s driver s 
      license.  Job drags a photo of OUR Lucas over the photo of 
      the dead Sheriff. 

      AN EFFEMINATE YOUNG MAN (20s) with an Elvis pompadour enters.

                                  ELVIS
                    Job.  Two suits, badly tailored.  
                    They re looking for you.

      Job hits a button and his monitor shows the salon upstairs. 
      TWO MEN in dark suits stand at the reception desk.  They are 
      the men who chased Lucas a few days ago.

                                  ELVIS (CONT D)
                    Cops?

                          (troubled)
                    Let s hope so.

      He stands and starts unplugging a row of back-up hard drives.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    I want all the back-up drives in 
                    the car, now.

      Elvis collects them.  Job runs to a safe, hits buttons.  He 
      pulls out stacks of cash, which he throws in a duffel.  He 
      hands the bag to Elvis, who is holding the hard drives.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Keep the engine running.

      Elvis goes into a closet, through a hidden back door and up a 
      staircase.  Job gets onto his computer and types in a code.                                                                                    31.


      CLOSE ON: The computer screen, which reads: Wipe Drives?

      Job clicks: the screen fills with naked women swimming 
      underwater.

      Job turns to go upstairs, when the door opens and the men in 
      suits step into the basement.  They are Widow s Peak and his 
      partner, who has a buzz cut. 

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                      Gentlemen, we don t open until ten, 
                    but if you ll come back upstairs, 
                    I ll see when we can fit you in.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Down here might be better for the 
                    private nature of our inquiry.

                                  JOB
                    Inquiry?  Can I see some ID?

      Widow s Peak pulls out a wallet and hands Job a business 
      card.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    This isn t a badge.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    No, it s not.

      BUZZ CUT PUNCHES JOB IN FACE.  Instead of going down, Job 
      punches the guy right back, a wicked left cross. 

      JOB WHIPS A BUTTERFLY KNIFE OUT OF HIS BRA, flips it open in 
      a blur, and slices a gash down Buzz Cut s jaw.  But before he 
      can strike again, Widow s Peak grabs Job s knife arm and 
      punches him repeatedly in the face until the knife falls.  

      Widow s Peak drops Job into a chair.  Job bleeds from nose 
      and mouth.  

                                  BUZZ CUT
                          (draws his gun)
                    You fucking slope cunt!

      He shoves his gun under Job s chin, but Widow s Peak grabs 
      his arm and pushes his partner away, flashing him a stern 
      look.

      Widow s Peak pulls up a second chair, sits on it backwards, 
      gets in Job s face.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    We work for Mr. Rabbit.                                                                                    32.

                          (scared by the name)
                    Oh, sweet fuck.
                          (off Widow Peak s stare)
                    The guy you re after... he came in 
                    a few days ago.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    And what did he want?

                                  JOB
                    The usual.  ID.  Credit cards. 

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Where is he now?

                                  JOB
                    I have no idea.

      Buzz Cut pistol-whips Job across the face.

                                  JOB (CONT D)
                    Okay, okay!  I ll get you the file.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    That would be helpful.

      Job gets up shakily and goes into the closet. 


      INT. HISHI SALON - BASEMENT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

      As a bloody Job moves to the back of the deep storage closet, 
      he slips through the hidden doorway and heads up the stairs.


      EXT. HISHI SALON - BACK ALLEY

      Elvis sits in the Range Rover, singing along to Justin 
      Bieber.  


      INTERCUT BETWEEN THE BACK ALLEY AND THE HISHI BASEMENT LAIR:


      IN THE LAIR

      The two men look around at all the equipment.  As Buzz Cut 
      presses a rag to his jaw, Widow s Peak looks at the naked-
      women screen-saver.  He touches the screen, the screen-saver 
      disappears, replaced by the image of the deleting program. 

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Shit!                                                                                    33.


      They draw their guns and rush over to the closet.


      IN THE BACK ALLEY

      Elvis, still singing to himself, sees the bloodied Job emerge 
      from the building.

                                  ELVIS
                            (immediately hysterical)
                    Oh my God!  Oh my God!


      IN THE LAIR

      Both men stand in the closet.

                                  BUZZ CUT
                    The fuck did he go?

      Widow s Peak spots the stairs in the back.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    There!

      They run for the stairs.


      IN THE BACK ALLEY

      Job pulls out a small disc that he is wearing on a chain 
      around his neck.  The disc has a red button in the center.

      As Job struts away from the building, he pushes the button.  
      Behind him... 

      THE SALON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL.  As flames and 
      bricks fly behind him in slow motion, Job keeps walking, 
      unfazed.


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Carrie, naked, lies in her bed as Gordon vigorously goes down 
      on her.  But even as she moves with him, she stares off to 
      the side as she remembers...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    34.


      INT. SAM S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

      Lucas and Carrie, naked, have intense, sweaty sex.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON: The hard, craggy face of a powerful-looking, 
        seventy-year-old man with dark, malevolent green eyes.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      INT. SUGAR S GARAGE APARTMENT - DAWN

      Lucas, sleeping on the floor, lurches awake in a panic once 
      again: whoever the green-eyed man he saw in his dream is, 
      Lucas is clearly terrified of him.

      A PROGRESSION OF SHOTS reminiscent of earlier: Lucas bursts 
      out of the garage, grips the railing, gasping for air. He 
      does push-ups on the shore, then stops and sits, panting.

      He pulls from his pocket the picture of Carrie, Gordon, Deva 
      and Max and stares down at it as he catches his breath.  

      Sugar appears and crouches beside him.  As Lucas puts the 
      photo away, Sugar puts $200 on the ground between them.

                                  SUGAR
                    You don t strike me as the kind of 
                    guy who takes much advice.  But I m 
                    going to try.  That s two hundred 
                    dollars.  Take it and go.

                                  LUCAS
                    I can t.

                                  SUGAR
                          (insistent)
                    Look around you.  You re free, man!

                                  LUCAS
                    No.  I m not.

      He takes the money, grabs half of the twenties, and hands the 
      rest back to Sugar as he walks back to the garage.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    I ll pay you back in a day or so.

      Sugar shakes his head as he watches Lucas walk away.                                                                                    35.


      EXT. THE GRAVY TRAIN DINER IN DOWNTOWN BANSHEE - DAY

      Lucas steps out of the diner: beside him is MAYOR KENDALL.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thank you for breakfast.

                                  DAN
                    My pleasure.  

      As they walk, Lucas checks out the town, assessing 
      everything, including the mayor at his side. 

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    I pissed off half the City Council 
                    when I authorized Sheriff Hale to 
                    bring in a ringer.  But someone s 
                    got to break Proctor s choke hold 
                    on this town.  Every sheriff we ve 
                    had, including your predecessor, 
                    has ended up on Proctor s payroll.

                                  LUCAS
                    Hale was crooked?

                                  DAN
                    Till he got sick.  Then he got 
                    religion.

                                  LUCAS
                    You brought me in to take down one 
                    guy?

                                  DAN
                    He s not just one guy.  There s no 
                    criminal enterprise around here 
                    that doesn t start and end in his 
                    pockets.  

                                  LUCAS
                    Aren t you a bit young for a mayor?

                                  DAN
                    I had my reasons.
                          (changes the subject)
                    I know you don t start till Monday, 
                    but I figured I d take you by the 
                    Cadi.

                                  LUCAS
                    The Cadi?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    36.


      EXT. THE CADI - MORNING

      The Banshee Sheriff s Department is in an old car dealership.  
      Floor to ceiling windows, and a large front lot.  Up on the 
      wall, the letters  CADI  are all that remain of the fallen 
      Cadillac logo.  Dan and Lucas stand in the lot, taking it in.

                                  DAN
                    The old Sheriff s Department burned 
                    down three years ago.  Electrical 
                    fire.  Someone in City Hall had let 
                    the insurance policy lapse and they 
                    didn t have money to rebuild.  
                    Froemer s Cadillac had just gone 
                    under, so...

      He gestures at the building, looking a bit chagrined.


      INT. THE CADI - MORNING

      Dan leads Lucas inside.  It s a strange, shiny amalgam of 
      Sheriff s department and former luxury car dealership.  In 
      back, there are three free-standing holding cells.  There is 
      still one gleaming Cadillac parked in the b.g. against a 
      wall.  Two DEPUTIES sit at their desks.  They are:

      EMMETT YAWNERS (40), African-American, tall, clean-cut, built 
      like a tank.  He s doing paperwork.  The other deputy is...

      BROCK LOTUS (48), a dour, middle-aged troll of a man.  He 
      sits at his computer, clacking keys, staring at the screen. 

      Emmett stands and comes over.  Brock stays put.

                                  LUCAS
                    What s up, fellas?

                                  DAN
                    Emmett Yawners here holds the all-
                    time rushing record at Penn State.

      Lucas and Emmett shake hands.

                                  EMMETT
                    Welcome to the BSD. 

                                  DAN
                    And this is Brock Lotus. 

      Brock grudgingly stands and walks over.                                                                                    37.


                                  BROCK
                          (mutters)
                    Nice to meet you, sheriff.

      He puts extra emphasis on that last word, and flashes Dan a 
      dirty look.  The look is not lost on Lucas.

                                  DAN
                          (covering)
                    Deputy Lotus is the longest-serving 
                    member of the department. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Is that right?

      The door flies open.  In comes DEPUTY SIOBAHN KELLY, 30, a 
      sexy redhead, dragging along a surly tweaker in handcuffs.

                                    TWEAKER
                          (at Siobahn)
                    You fucking fascist!  I didn t do 
                    anything!

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Yeah, you re a model citizen.

      Siobahn wrestles the guy across the room back toward the 
      holding cells.  She spins him around against the bars.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    I m going to remove your cuffs now.  
                    If you try to fight me again, I ll 
                    remove your testicles.

      She uncuffs him, pushes him into the cell, locks him in.  As 
      she joins her colleagues, she notices Lucas.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                          (inquisitive, flirty)
                    Hey- hi.

                                  DAN
                    This is Lucas Hood.  Your new boss.

                                    SIOBAHN
                          (at the mayor)
                    Shit, Danny, you could ve said so 
                    sooner.
                          (to Lucas)
                    Siobahn Kelly.

      She wipes her hands on her jacket, shakes hands with Lucas.                                                                                    38.


                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    You re younger than I pictured.  

                                  LUCAS
                          (eyeing the mayor)
                    There s a bit of that going around.

                                  DAN
                    Siobahn, I thought you might give 
                    the sheriff a tour of Banshee.

                                    SIOBAHN
                          (nods toward the cell)
                    I d love to, but I have to write up 
                    Charlie Sheen over there.

                                    TWEAKER (O.S.)
                          (at Siobahn)
                    Nazi twat!

                                  LUCAS
                    That s okay.  I think I d like a 
                    tour from the longest-serving 
                    member of the department anyway.

      Lucas and Brock stare at each other.  Brock grumbles, grabs 
      his radio off his desk and heads out, with Lucas behind him.


      INT. BROCK LOTUS S SQUAD CAR - DAY

      Brock drives Lucas around the outskirts of Banshee.  They

      They pass a stand of woods and then a metallic warehouse with 
      livestock trailers in its large parking lot/loading area.

                    That s the slaughterhouse...

      They come to a giant modern complex that is the SENECA STAR 
      CASINO.  Brock nods at the casino.

                    There s s the casino...there s the

      LUCAS S POV: A seedy pawn shop in the shadow of the casino.                                                                                    39.


      They drive into town, pull onto BROAD STREET and see a 
      commotion in the lot of PAT S LUMBER.  Four burly blue collar 
      workers have surrounded three Amish men and are preventing 
      them from loading their wagons with sheets of wood.

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    Oh shit.  Not again.

                                  LUCAS
                    What s going on?

                                  BROCK
                    The Moody boys build furniture. The 
                    Amish mills have been driving down 
                    their prices.  We ve had incidents.

      In the lumber lot, COLE MOODY (40), shoves a younger Amish 
      guy away from the lumber.  His brothers, TOM, DEX, and MARCUS 
      close ranks, as the two older Amish men attempt to reason 
      with them.

                                  LUCAS
                    They won t hit back.

                    Terrific.  You ve seen Witness. 

      Brock parks at the curb. 

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    You d better let me handle this.

                                  LUCAS
                          (agreeable)
                    Yeah, sure, I ll just wait here.

      But then, before Brock can move, Lucas jumps out of the car, 
      strides toward the commotion.  Brock hurries after him.


      EXT. PAT S LUMBER PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      Lucas approaches the Moody brothers:

                                  LUCAS
                    Why don t we all take a moment and 
                    talk this out?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Who the fuck are you?

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.  I m the new sheriff.                                                                                    40.


      Cole looks over to Brock.

                                  MARCUS MOODY
                    Lotus, I thought you were supposed 
                    to take over when Hale kicked.

                                  BROCK
                    Yeah, you and me both.

      Reaction shot of Lucas looking at Brock: now he gets it.

      The Amish man tries to stand up: Cole kicks him back down.

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    That s enough, Cole.  I m sure your 
                    wife s got better things to do than 
                    bail your ass out of jail again.

      Lucas steps between the Moodys and the fallen Amish man.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Hey, I m not through with him.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah, you are.

                                  DEX MOODY
                    If you re the sheriff, why aren t 
                    you in uniform?

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t get sworn in until Monday.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    So there s nothing stopping us from 
                    fucking your shit up today.

                                  LUCAS
                          (grins)
                    I hoped you d make that connection. 
                    Come on, Cole.  Fuck my shit up. 

      The Moody brothers leave the Amish man and surround Lucas.  
      Brock draws his gun.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Relax, Brock.  I got this. 

                                  BROCK
                    You sure?

      When Lucas nods, Brock snorts (like  your funeral ) and 
      holsters his weapon.                                                                                    41.


                                  COLE MOODY
                          (at Lucas)
                    Just to be clear, I m about to 
                    pound a civilian, not a-

      Before Cole can finish his sentence, LUCAS DRIVES A HEEL KICK 
      INTO THE GUY S CHEST THAT SENDS HIM FLYING BACKWARDS.

      Dex punches Lucas in the face.  Lucas blocks the follow-up 
      and hits him with four speed punches to the solar plexus, 
      finishing him off with A MUAY THAI STYLE KNEE TO THE FACE.

      REACTION SHOT OF BROCK: he s stunned at Lucas s skills.  

      TOM PULLS A HAMMER from his tool belt and charges Lucas, 
      swinging.  Lucas ducks the swing only to be kicked in the 
      head by Marcus.  Tom comes back at him with the hammer.  
      Lucas grabs Tom s wrist, and flips him into a pallet of 
      cinder blocks. 

      Cole, back on his feet, comes up behind Lucas wielding a long 
      pipe.  He pulls back to swing at Lucas s head, when a hand 
      appears from off camera and grabs the pipe, stopping its 
      motion. 

      WIDER: Lucas and Cole both turn at the same time to see Kai 
      Proctor standing behind Cole, holding the pipe.

                                    PROCTOR
                    That s enough, Moody.

      Proctor s presence takes the fight out of the Moodys.  The 
      fallen brothers slowly get to their feet, groaning.  

                                  COLE MOODY
                          (instantly docile)
                    Mr. Proctor.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Four on one should be enough of an 
                      advantage, without adding plumbing 
                      implements into the mix.

      Lucas helps the fallen Amish man to his feet.  Cole Moody and 
      his brothers start to leave.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Hold on.

      The Moodys pause and look at Proctor.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (indicates the Amish men)

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Why don t you boys help them load 
                    their wagons.

      The Moody brothers start dejectedly loading lumber onto the 
      wagons.  The Amish men do so too.  Proctor looks to Lucas.  

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    And you are...?

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.

                                    PROCTOR
                    The new sheriff.

      Proctor shakes Lucas s hand.  Meanwhile Cole Moody glares 
      furtively at an older Amish man loading lumber beside him.  

                                  COLE MOODY
                          (under his breath at the 
                          old Amish man)
                    Fuckin  Dutchie.  This isn t over.

                                    PROCTOR
                          (to Lucas)
                    Kai Proctor.  I m sorry if I 
                    stepped on your toes here.   

                                  LUCAS
                          (looks at the Moodys 
                            obeying Proctor)
                    Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you-

                                    PROCTOR
                    I m in meats.

      He hands Lucas a card.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Come by the slaughterhouse.  I ll 
                    set you up with some steaks.

      Lucas considers the card. 

      CLOSE ON: Proctor s card.  It says  PROCTOR MEATS.   The logo 
      is a flank of red raw beef.

      Lucas takes one last appraising look at Proctor, then he 
      heads over to Brock.  

                                  BROCK
                          (still incredulous at 
                            Lucas s handiwork)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    43.

                                  BROCK (CONT'D)
                    You know, some people call us peace 
                      officers... 

      Lucas pats Brock s shoulder and walks off toward the car.  
      Brock shakes his head and follows.  

      Lucas sees a BMW coupe passing by on the street.  Deva 
      Hopewell is riding shotgun, beside an older BOY, 18.  Lucas 
      watches as the BMW turns into a supermarket parking lot far 
      down the street.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks for the tour, Brock.  I m 
                    going to take a walk.

      Lucas walks off, as a perplexed Brock watches him go.

      BACK ON PROCTOR who is watching the Amish men secure their 
      load.  Moody and his men have finished helping: they leave.  

      Proctor approaches the oldest Amish man tying down lumber.

                                    PROCTOR
                    It s good to see you, father.

      The man stops what he s doing, his face suddenly strained.  
      Kai stands there, but the man won t meet his gaze.  Kai holds 
      his ground, his face a mixture of pain and contempt.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (bitterly)
                    You re welcome, by the way.

      Only once Kai has walked away toward his Bentley does his 
      father, ISRAEL PROCTOR (65), look up to watch him go.


      EXT. A CORNER OF THE SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER  

      The BMW is parked near a Dumpster, away from other cars. 


      INT. THE BMW - CONTINUOUS

      Deva, in only a bra and skirt, is making out with the 
      shirtless guy.  They re groping and going at it.  As his hand 
      starts moving under her skirt, she playfully catches it and 
      pushes him away.

                                  DEVA
                    I have to go.

      She sits up and pulls on her shirt.                                                                                    44.


                                  BOY
                    Come on.  Stay.

                                  DEVA
                          (getting out of the car)
                    I ll see you later.

      The boy climbs over to the front seat.


      EXT. THE BMW - MOMENTS LATER

      The boy lowers his window as Deva walks away.  

                                  BOY
                          (joking)
                    But I love you!

      Deva laughs and flips him the bird.  Then she turns to go and 
      collides with...LUCAS, who is walking into the lot.

                      LUCASDEVA
      Sorry.No, my bad...

      She moves around him and heads out of the lot.  Lucas makes 
      sure she isn t watching him, then opens her wallet (which he 
      just picked from her pocket).  He sees her HIGH SCHOOL ID, in 
      the transparent pocket of the wallet.

      CLOSE-UP INSERT OF PART OF THE ID:    DOB 6/28/97 

                                  LUCAS (O.C.)
                          (to himself)
                    Thirteen years old, my ass...

      BACK ON LUCAS as he flips the wallet shut.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Deva!

      She turns, surprised.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    You dropped this.

      Deva walks back to him.  He hands her the wallet.  She takes 
      it but regards him suspiciously. 

                                  DEVA
                    How d you know my name?

                                  LUCAS
                    It s on your ID.                                                                                    45.


                                  DEVA
                    Right.  Well, thanks.

      She starts walking off again.

                                  LUCAS
                    Your boyfriend can t give you a 
                    lift back to school?

      Deva turns, backing away as she responds.  

                                  DEVA
                    Who says he s my boyfriend?

                                  LUCAS
                    Well, I hope he s not your brother.

      She laughs.

                                  DEVA
                    Who says I m going back to school?

      She turns and leaves. Quietly stricken, Lucas watches her go.


      EXT. PROCTOR MEATS SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY  (ESTABLISHING)

      The metallic warehouse on the edge of town.  


      INT. PROCTOR MEATS SLAUGHTERHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Proctor steps out of a den, pulling on his jacket.  Before 
      the den door closes, we see A NAKED HOOKER sprawled across a 
      bed.  TOM BURTON, 35, Proctor s right hand man, impeccably 
      dressed in a suit and bow-tie, stands waiting for Proctor.

                                  BURTON
                    He s here.

      Proctor walks down a hallway.  Keeping pace, Burton hands him 
      a file.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    The P & Ls...

      Proctor reads as he walks, moving toward the increasingly 
      loud DIN OF WHINING SAW BLADES. 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Our numbers are down at both strip 
                    clubs?                                                                                    46.

                    Well, with the economy where it is - 

                                    PROCTOR
                    Men will pay for tits until they re 
                    broke or dead.  Fix it.

      Proctor shoves the file back at Burton as they walk through a 
      double set of safety doors into...


      INT. THE KILLING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      A vast area where slaughtered cows are hanging from steel 
      hooks to bleed out.  WORKERS in white Hazmat-looking suits 
      and headgear are skinning the carcasses.  

      Proctor and Burton enter the room to find Cole Moody standing 
      there looking nervous.  Proctor waves at the WORKERS, who 
      turn off their saws and switch to clean-up work.  

      Burton hangs back as Proctor walks over to Moody.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    They said you wanted to see me.

                                    PROCTOR
                    First time you ve seen a 
                      slaughterhouse?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Yeah.

                                    PROCTOR
                    It s a relatively humane procedure.  
                    We stun the beasts with a pneumatic 
                    captive bolt gun - one of these. 

      He takes one of the cylindrical bolt guns off a table and 
      shows it to Moody.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    One bolt to the brain does the 
                    trick.  Then we cut them and hang 
                    them up to bleed out. 

      Moody stares at the bolt gun, wondering what the hell is up.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Listen-                                                                                    47.


                                    PROCTOR
                    -The Old Order Pennsylvania Dutch 
                    don t like being called  Dutchies.   
                    It s derisive.  Like if I called 
                    you a Mick or a Kraut- which are 
                    you by the way?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Both, actually.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Okay, a mongrel then.  My point is, 
                    you called my father a fucking 
                    Dutchie.

      Moody backs away in fear, staring at the gun.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    I was just running my mouth!  I had 
                    no idea he was your father.

      Proctor waits a beat, then puts the gun down and shakes his 
      head at Moody, amused.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Relax, Moody.  It s not loaded.

      Proctor smiles.  Moody dares to appear hopeful.  Then in a 
      flash, PROCTOR GRABS MOODY BY THE NECK AND BASHES HIS FACE IN 
      WITH THE BOLT GUN. 

      As Moody goes down, Proctor plants his knee on Moody s chest, 
      and continues to violently pound his face in.  Moody screams 
      and flails as BLOOD AND TEETH FLY from his mouth.   

      Proctor stands, his own face spattered with Moody s blood. 

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (enraged)
                    Now put your fucking teeth back in 
                    your fat, bigoted mouth, and get 
                    the fuck out of here!

      On hands and knees, Moody looks around, dizzy.  He feebly 
      grabs as many teeth as he can off the bloody floor.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Back in your mouth, I said.

      Moody pops the dozen shards of teeth from his palm back into 
      his mouth, which is still gushing blood.  He gets up, mouth  
      shut tight, and stumbles toward the door.                                                                                       48.


                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (to Burton)
                    If he spits any of them out before 
                    he leaves the building, shoot him. 

      Burton nods and escorts out the reeling Moody.


      INT. PROCTOR MEATS SLAUGHTERHOUSE - PROCTOR S PRIVATE DEN

      Proctor steps back into a den that is part bedroom, part 
      study.  He hangs up his jacket, his face still speckled with 
      blood.  The naked HOOKER lies on the bed reading a magazine.

                                    PROCTOR
                    I m sorry for the interruption.

      She sits up, crawls to him, reaches for his fly.  Proctor 
      stops her, opens a roll-top desk near him and takes out a 
      white Amish bonnet.  He tosses it to the hooker.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Put that on.

      She smiles gamely, puts it on, and moves to him.  She kisses 
      his blood-speckled face, then unzips and drops his pants.  
      She licks her lips and goes down on him.

      Seeing the blood on his shirt, he unbuttons it and shrugs it 
      off.  His back is covered with a huge TATTOO OF A BLOODY 
      CHRIST NAILED TO THE CROSS.  

      As the hooker s head bobs, Proctor studies his knuckles and 
      casually pulls out a shard of tooth.


      EXT. THE PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

      In the back alley, Lucas, dressed in black, wearing a small 
      black knapsack, climbs some external pipes up to the roof.  
      He kneels by a large AIR HANDLER, and pulls a power drill and 
      bits out of his knapsack.  He whistles quietly to himself as 
      he matches a bit to the bolts on the air handler.

      Lucas unscrews the bolts with the drill and turns the handler 
      on its side.  He unscrews the exposed duct beneath it and 
      pushes it aside, then lowers himself into the pawn shop. 

      Using a penlight, Lucas casually browses the showcases.  On 
      the wall behind one of the counters, his light falls upon a 
      large CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT.                                                                                     49.


      Penlight in his mouth, he picks the lock on a steel door to a 
      back office and steps in.  He looks around, then walks to a 
      painting and pulls it off to reveal a wall safe.  He smiles. 


      INT. THE CADI - LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

      Lucas stands before a mirror, staring at himself in his new 
      Sheriff s uniform.  He pulls at the pants, which are loose.

                                    SIOBAHN (O.C.)
                    They get your size wrong?

      He turns to see her pulling on her own shirt and sees the 
      briefest flash of skin as she does, and a nasty burn scar  
      across her scapula.

                                  LUCAS
                          (bunching up the pants)
                    Nah, it s good.  

      She grabs a safety pin and comes up behind him.  

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Here, let me...

      He watches in the mirror as she kneels to pin him from 
      behind.  Her shirt is open on top, and he enjoys the view.  
      Catching him looking, she merely goes on pinning the pants.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    Bring the pants to the Martinizing, 
                    across from the Gravy Train.  
                    They ll take them in for you.

                                  LUCAS
                    I will, thanks.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    You got any family coming to the 
                      swearing-in?

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t have any family, coming or 
                    not.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Well, we ll all be there, and at 
                    Proctor s reception for you 
                    tonight.

                                  LUCAS
                      Reception?                                                                                    50.


                                    SIOBAHN
                    Say what you will about Proctor, 
                    but the man knows how to throw a 
                    party.  

      She stands, smiles at Lucas in the mirror, smooths his shirt.

                                    SIOBAHN (CONT D)
                    Now that s what a sheriff looks 
                    like.

      In the instant that she playfully smacks his ass, rousing 
      ROCK MUSIC begins.  She walks away and we CUT TO:


      INT. BANSHEE TOWN HALL - COURT ROOM - DAY

      THE ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, in full uniform with his 
      right hand raised, stands facing the robed judge, getting 
      sworn in.  Watching are his deputies, Mayor Kendall, Gordon 
      Hopewell, and three Amish elders, including Israel Proctor.


      EXT. BANSHEE TOWN HALL STEPS - A SHORT WHILE LATER

      THE MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, flanked by his deputies, exits 
      the town hall and surveys Banshee s Main Street.


      INT. THE PAWN SHOP - OFFICE - DAY

      THE MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, Emmett, and the PAWN SHOP OWNER - 
      50s, decrepit - standing side by side, can be seen through a 
      large, blown-out hole in the wall, staring at where the safe 
      used to be.


      EXT. PAWN SHOP PARKING LOT - DAY

      Lucas gets into his official Sheriff s car and, with Emmett 
      riding shotgun, Sheriff Lucas Hood drives back into town.

      THE MUSIC ENDS.


      INT. HOPEWELL HOUSE - MAX S BEDROOM - EVENING

      Deva sits on Max s bed with him, playing God of War with him 
      on PlayStation.  On the bedside table are an array of pill 
      containers, and on the floor is a standing oxygen tank.

      Carrie, dressed up in a black cocktail dress, comes in.                                                                                    51.


                                  CARRIE
                    Max, did you take your meds?

                                  MAX
                    Yes.  Where are you and Dad going?

                                  CARRIE
                    Your dad just has to show his face 
                    at a party for the new Sheriff.

      She lifts a clear oxygen mask off the night table, holds it 
      toward her son.  Max wilts at the sight of it. 

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Just for an hour.  Deva will take 
                    it off at nine.

      Max takes the mask, puts it on.  Deva helps him adjust it.  
      Carrie kisses them both.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Call my cell if you need us.

      Deva nods and Carrie leaves.  After a beat, Deva turns to 
      Max, who s already pulling off his mask.  She waits until 
      it s off.

                                  DEVA
                    You ready?

                                  MAX
                    Bring it!

      They continue playing.


      EXT. KAI PROCTOR S MANSION - THE BACK LAWN - NIGHT


      CLOSE ON: AN ICE SCULPTURE OF THE MUSCULAR, MYTHOLOGICAL 
      ATLAS CARRYING THE WORLD ON HIS SHOULDERS

      Champagne spills down over the sculpture into a basin of ice.  
      A server ladles it into flutes.  SOUND of LIVE ROCKABILLY.

                                                                WIDER TO REVEAL:

      On a grand patio overlooking a sweeping green lawn, well-
      dressed MEN AND WOMEN mingle.  SERVERS in white coats 
      circulate with trays, offering champagne and rare beef on 
      skewer points.  A four-piece BAND plays near a dance floor.

      An in-ground swimming pool is near the patio and floating 
      atop the water are two dozen Japanese paper LANTERNS.                                                                                    52.


      Lucas stands talking with Emmett and his wife, MEG (35), a 
      blond knockout.

                                  MEG
                    Where will you be living, Sheriff?

                                  LUCAS
                    I m still working that out.

      Dan Kendall joins them in a blazer and tie. 

                                  DAN
                    Sheriff, if you ll come with me, 
                    it s meet-and-greet time... 

      He pulls Lucas away from them, just as Brock arrives.

                                  BROCK
                    Emmett.  Meg.

                                  MEG
                    Hey, Brock.

                                  BROCK
                          (eyeing Lucas)
                    I m telling you, there s something 
                    wrong with that guy.

                                  EMMETT
                    He seems up for the job.

                                  BROCK
                    You didn t see him take down the 
                    Moody boys.  He went through them 
                    like they were cardboard. 

                                  EMMETT
                    So, you re upset that our sheriff 
                    knows how to fight.

                                  BROCK
                    It wasn t fighting.  It was fucking 
                    combat.

                                  MEG
                    Emmett, if you insist on talking 
                    shop, I ll find someone else to 
                    dance with.

                                  EMMETT
                    But baby, would he have my moves?

      Emmett follows her to the dance floor and we CUT TO...                                                                                    53.


      Carrie and Gordon arriving through an archway leading from 
      the house down a grand staircase onto the patio and back 
      lawn.

                                  GORDON
                          (sardonic)
                      Understated, as usual.

                                  CARRIE
                    Only in Banshee would a DA attend a 
                    party at the home of the guy he 
                    just brought up on racketeering 
                    charges.

                                  GORDON
                    Well, you know what they say...if 
                    you can t beat  em, drink their 
                    booze.  I ll find the bar.

      He wanders off.  Carrie moves around the perimeter of the 
      party, occasionally smiling or returning a greeting.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. KAI PROCTOR S MANSION - BACK LAWN - A BIT LATER

      The party s in full swing.  Proctor arrives at the archway, 
      looking sharp in a dark Armani suit, and surveys the crowd 
      below like a sovereign ruler, before heading down the stairs, 
      greeting numerous luminaries along the way.

      Lucas stands by a wet bar not far from the pool, talking to 
      Dan and some other men.  Proctor approaches Lucas.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Sheriff Hood.

                                  LUCAS
                    Mr. Proctor.  This is some shindig.

      They shake hands.

                                    PROCTOR
                    You ll find out that Banshee is not 
                    at all the backwater town it 
                    sometimes pretends to be.
                          (to Dan)
                    Good evening, Mayor.

      He extends his hand.  The Mayor doesn t shake it.  A beat of 
      tension as Proctor withdraws his hand.                                                                                    54.


                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    I ll chalk up your bad manners to 
                    your age, and choose not to take 
                    offense.

                                  DAN
                    No, please.  Take offense.

      Proctor smiles dangerously, like Dan is a mosquito he could 
      crush at will.  There s clearly some bad blood here.  Then 
      Proctor turns to Lucas.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Enjoy the party, Sheriff.  And 
                    welcome to Banshee.

      Proctor moves off into the crowd.  Looking over Lucas s 
      shoulder, Dan sees Carrie moving through the party.

                                  DAN
                    Carrie!  Come meet the sheriff.

      Carrie steps over just as Lucas turns around to face her.  
      She is stunned.

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.  It s a pleasure to 
                    meet you.

      Carrie s jaw has dropped. 

                                  DAN
                    Um, Carrie?

      She snaps out of it, shakes Lucas s hand and offers a smile.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m sorry- I m not myself tonight.

      Gordon wanders over with two drinks, hands one to Carrie.

                                  GORDON
                    Good, so you two have met?

                                  LUCAS
                    Ages ago. 
                          (ignores her dirty look)
                    Mrs. Hopewell, you don t sound like 
                    you re from around here. 

                                  GORDON
                    You ve got a good ear, Sheriff. 
                    She s from New England, originally.                                                                                    55.


                                  CARRIE
                    Vermont.  The Northeast Kingdom, up 
                    by the Canadian border.

                                  LUCAS
                     The Northeast Kingdom.   That 
                    sounds like something out of a 
                      fairytale, you know?  Like 
                    something made up.

      Carrie, simmering, registers the jab.  Siobahn appears at 
      Lucas s side in a strapless red dress.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Hey boss!  Congratulations.

                                  LUCAS
                    Deputy Kelly, you are wearing the 
                    hell out of that dress.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    You re only saying that because 
                    it s true.

                                  LUCAS
                    Well, Mrs. Hopewell.  Very nice to 
                    meet you. 

      He walks off with Siobahn on his arm, leaving a stunned 
      Carrie in the b.g.  


      EXT. THE FORGE - NIGHT

      Sugar finishes locking up and walks around back to his small 
      house.  He discovers his front door slightly open.


      INT. SUGAR S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Sugar picks up the baseball bat in his front hall and moves 
      into the house, scowling.

                                  SUGAR
                    Who s in here?!

      He turns into his kitchen, and stops.  On his kitchen table 
      are five twenty dollar bills held down by the CRUISERWEIGHT 
        CHAMPIONSHIP BELT last seen hanging in the pawn shop.  Sugar 
      lifts the belt, running his fingers over it emotionally.  He 
      looks toward the front door and smiles.                                                                                     56.


      EXT. KAI PROCTOR S MANSION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

      Carrie stands in the dark, leaning against a car, having a 
      quick smoke.  Lucas emerges beside her.

                                  LUCAS
                    Still sneaking cigarettes, huh?

      Carrie is momentarily startled, then shakes her head and puts 
      out the cigarette.  She looks at him.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    So...

                                  CARRIE
                          (irate)
                      A sheriff?  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  LUCAS
                    They ve got a great health plan.

                                  CARRIE
                    You won t need it in prison.

                                  LUCAS
                    You used to have more faith in me.

      He starts to move toward his Sheriff s car, parked a few cars 
      down.  Carrie grabs his arm: her touch jolts him.

                                  CARRIE
                    Why are you doing this?

                                  LUCAS
                    You know why.

      They share a look weighted with pain and history.  Finally, 
      Lucas walks to the back of his car and pops the trunk.  

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Come here a second.

      She joins him.  In the trunk is the wall safe from the pawn 
      shop, with bits of drywall still stuck to it.


      A SHOT FROM OUT OF THE TRUNK UP AT THE TWO OF THEM

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    It s an Empire, Mercury series. 
                    I ve got no tools, but you could do 
                    this in your sleep.                                                                                    57.


                                  CARRIE
                          (incredulous)
                    I can t fucking believe this.

                                  LUCAS
                    Come on, it s the least you can do.

                                  CARRIE
                    No!  This - what you re doing - is 
                    crazy. If you don t end it, I will.

                                  LUCAS
                    You re not in the position to blow 
                    any whistles, Carrie from Vermont.  
                    I ve already gone down alone once.  
                    I won t do it again.

                                  CARRIE
                    You re insane.

      She storms away.  Lucas shrugs and closes the trunk.

      As Lucas ambles back toward the mansion, he hears movement 
      behind him.  He half turns to see who s there, and we see...

      COLE MOODY S GROTESQUELY BLOATED AND BATTERED FACE.  Moody 
      swings something at Lucas s head, too fast for Lucas to 
      react, and we SLAM TO BLACK.


      EXT. KAI PROCTOR S MANSION - THE BACK LAWN - A BIT LATER

      Carrie, standing beside Gordon, checks her iPhone.

                                  GORDON
                    The kids?

                                  CARRIE
                    No, but can we pretend?

                                  GORDON
                          (smiles)
                    I think we ve stayed long enough.

      They put down their glasses and, holding hands, move toward 
      Proctor to make their good-byes.  Proctor is standing near 
      the bar, entertaining a small circle of guests.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Kai.  Thanks for having us.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Gordon.  Glad you stopped by.                                                                                    58.


      They shake hands.

                                  GORDON
                    This isn t awkward at all.

      Proctor smiles.  But before he can respond...

      A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, and a bullet hits the bottles on the wet 
      bar between him and the Hopewells.  They jump back in shock.

      ON MOODY, his face bruised and swollen, moving wildly through 
      the crowd pointing a .357 Magnum.  Moody s mouth, almost 
      devoid of teeth, is a bloody mess.

                                  MOODY
                          (screaming, drunk)
                      PROCTOR!!!!

      Guests scream and run for cover.  Gordon turns, frozen in 
      place, but CARRIE TAKES HIM DOWN HARD just as Moody shoots 
      again.  The shot hits the bar, just above Proctor s head as 
      he hits the deck.

      Proctor backs up against the bottom of the wet bar.  He has 
      nowhere left to go.  Carrie and Gordon lie on the ground with 
      a few others in the area between Moody and Proctor.

      SLOW-MO: Moody levels his gun at Proctor.  Proctor looks up 
      at him with fearless contempt.  

                                  MOODY (CONT D)
                          (garbled)
                    Dutchie Motherfucker.

      Moody starts to squeeze the trigger, when TWO GUNSHOTS go off 
      and TWO ROUNDS RIP INTO MOODY S CHEST.  MOODY FLIES OFF HIS 
      FEET AND INTO THE POOL.

      HARD PAN across to see LUCAS, STANDING SHAKILY UNDER THE 
      ARCHWAY, GUN EXTENDED, blood pouring down his face from a 
      gash on his forehead. 

      Carrie, Proctor, and everyone else stares at him as he holds 
      onto the archway with one arm for support, straining to stay 
      upright and conscious.

      PULL BACK ON THE GRISLY TABLEAU:  Moody floats dead in the 
      pool, blood billowing out from him, as the floating paper 
      lanterns swirl and eddy around Moody s corpse.                                                                                      59.


      EXT. AVENUE A IN MANHATTAN S EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT

      Widow s Peak walks down the sidewalk, limping slightly.  We 
      only see the right side of his face.  He comes to an unmarked 
      old door between two shops.  He looks above the door at an 
      unseen camera.  The door CLICKS open.


      INT. MR. RABBIT S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

      A cavernous old tavern.  In the room s middle is a bar and 
      all around the bar are small tables, some of which hold chess 
      boards.  A bartender polishes glasses.

      There are four older men, each alone at his own table in 
      front of a chess board.  Each smokes and drinks whiskey.  
      Each also wears a black suit and a white shirt.

      Pacing between the men, glancing at the chess boards, is the 
      malevolent man we saw for a second in Lucas s dream. He is...

      MR. RABBIT, 70, a gangster with a full head of white hair and 
      a large, powerful frame.  His face is craggy, creased, with 
      piercing green eyes.  He is the same man that Lucas saw in 
      his dream earlier.  

      Widow s Peak stands waiting.  The bartender looks up at him, 
      takes an extra moment to register something about his face.  
      Mr. Rabbit slowly makes his way around the bar.  One of the 
      chess players moves a piece, then speaks quietly: 

                                  FIRST CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                          (Ukrainian accent)
                    Yours-

      Rabbit never even looks at the board.

                                  MR. RABBIT
                          (Ukrainian accent)
                    Knight to Rook Four.

      He reaches Widow s Peak, studies his face for a moment.

                                  SECOND CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                    Yours-

                                  MR. RABBIT
                    Pishak to Queen Three. 

      We slowly pull around to see the left side of Widow s Peak s 
      face, which has been badly burned.  Gleaming in his wrecked 
      eye socket is a completely black, brushed metallic orb.                                                                                     60.


                                  MR. RABBIT (CONT D)
                    So, no documents.  No software, no 
                    hardware, nothing.  Everything at 
                    this hairdresser s - burned.    

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Yes. 

                                  THIRD CHESS-PLAYING MAN
                    Yours-

                                  MR. RABBIT
                          (eyes on Widow s Peak)
                    Queen to Knight Two.  Check mate.

      Third Chess-Playing Man swears under his breath in the b.g.

      A beat passes.  Rabbit fixes Widow s Peak with a gaze that 
      could bore through the core of the Earth.

                                  MR. RABBIT (CONT D)
                    You will find them both.  Quickly.

      CLOSE ON: Rabbit s craggy face, simmering with rage.

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.
