PRESIDENT CONRAD DALTON meets with SECRETARY OF STATE VICTOR 
MARSH.  Both in their fifties, both charismatic, they could 
t   And aren have been college buddies.  But they weren t.
buddies now.  They are politicians.  They respect each other 
but the tension is palpable.

PRESIDENT DALTON
This is the first time an Iranian 
leader has set foot in the White 
House since the Shah.  If the 
Secretary of State has nothing much 
to say, the world will notice.

MARSH
Just because they stopped saying 
out loud that they want to wipe 
Israel off the face of the map 
 mean their goal has doesn t
changed.  I think the visit is 
premature.

They exit the Oval Office and walk through the corridors of 
BUSY PEOPLE who pretend not to notice them.

MARSH
I have a plane to catch myself.

PRESIDENT DALTON
Getting out of town for the 
weekend?

MARSH
Martha s Vineyard.  

PRESIDENT DALTON
I know this goes without saying but 
we have no White House business off 
the coast of Massachusetts.  

MARSH
Have you been inside the State 
Department plane?  I take that rat 
trap as little as possible.  
Finally invested in a GS5.

Can I help it if I married well?

PRESIDENT DALTON

They shake hands.  Marsh leaves.3.



Victor Marsh sits aboard his private jet with his young 
ambitious speechwriter, ROGER, 30.  Roger is working on his 
laptop.  Marsh reads some papers.

Elizabeth eats dinner with her old friends from the CIA days.  
ISABELLE (45), JULIET (38) and GEORGE (50).  They are all

that we were in the business of

 CELL PHONES GO OFF.  They check their Juliet and Isabelle s

Reading from a text:

GEORGE
Victor Marsh s plane just went down 
over the Atlantic.  

They look at each other.  



Elizabeth is making breakfast.  Seated at the table and 
staring at their phones are her two kids, CAROLINE (15) and 
ADAM (13).  Caroline is a conventional popular girl and Adam 
is a budding anarchist.  Henry enters the kitchen. Observes 
his surroundings.

HENRY
I thought we said no gadgets at the 
table.10.


ELIZABETH
We did.  And then the kids never 
 came to the table.  Besides, it s

HENRY

She nods.  He flicks on the small TV in the kitchen.  The 
kids OBJECT.

HENRY (CONT D)
Oh, wait.  My screen is competing 
with your screens?

They continue to grumble as the news appears on the screen.  
 a report But then the headline grabs their attention.  It s
on the death of Victor Marsh.

NEWS ANCHOR

 plane at this time.  State s
According to the flight manifest, 
he and Roger Vance, one of his 
speech writers, were headed to 
Caracas, Venezuela.  The White 
House has confirmed that he was not 
on State Department business and 
that the plane was a private 
Gulfstream Five belonging to Marsh 
and his family.

CAROLINE
Mom, do you think it was terrorism?

ELIZABETH

HENRY
Still.  Why was he going to 
Venezuela?  Is that a resort 
destination?

ADAM
Exactly. When will you guys 
acknowledge the obvious conspiracy 
around us at all times?

ELIZABETH
(to Henry)
You had to wind up the anarchist?11.


HENRY
Sorry.

They turn their attention back to the news, images of plane 
debris floating in the Atlantic.



Elizabeth, in full barn gear, is mucking out a horse stall.  
Which amounts to raking shit.  But the way she throws herself 
into it, we can see that she somehow enjoys it.  She is 
approached by Adam, who is carrying a cell phone.

ADAM
I thought you were going to do 
something relaxing today.

ELIZABETH
This relaxes me.  

ADAM

Adam waves the phone at her.

ELIZABETH

ADAM

Elizabeth stares at him.

ELIZABETH
That s a prank.  Hang it up.  

ADAM

Elizabeth takes the phone from him.  Now Caroline is running 
toward them.

CAROLINE
Mom, there are like a thousand 
 going black cars outside.  What s
on?

Elizabeth absorbs this, then speaks to the phone:

ELIZABETH
Hello?



Elizabeth, looking a mess (and maybe smelling like one, too) 
in her barn gear sits across from President Dalton and his 
ENTOURAGE of Secret Service Agents.

PRESIDENT DALTON
In addition to the personal loss, 
it s a bad time to be without 
diplomatic representation.  So I 
 waste any time on this.  I can t

think, how you work.  I trust you. 13.


Elizabeth stares at him. He realizes she needs more.  He 
signals to the entourage to leave the room.  They do. 

PRESIDENT DALTON (CONT D)
I wanted to nominate you when I was 
first elected.  I was talked out of 
my choice by well meaning advisers.   
Marsh and I never got along.  He 
was a decent man but he was always 
 running for office.  I couldn t
trust his point of view.  I think 
it s dangerous to have a politician 
in that role.  And I know you,

This is going to happen.

TWO MONTHS LATER



Not a pretty place.  We HEAR a lot of yelling--Arabic and 
English.  Syrian PRISON GUARDS are dragging TWO YOUNG 
AMERICAN MEN, brothers ALEX AND ETHAN COLE (24, 22) toward a 
cell.  They roughly throw the two kids into their tiny and 
filthy cell and slam the door.  Ethan grips the bars and 
yells after the guard.

ETHAN

His older brother, ALEX, is more resigned.  A prison guard 
keeps yelling in Arabic as they walk away.

A meeting is in progress.  Everyone gathered around a large

They sit back down.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
Two American kids arrested and 
imprisoned in Syria for attempting 
to join Jabhat Al-Nusra.  Alex and 
Ethan Cole, brothers from Hartford, 
Connecticut.  Intel on them is that 
they are self-proclaimed 
journalists.  They have an activist 
website called One Free World, the 
basic premise of which is war bad, 
peace good. 

FLETCHER
So they re joining a jihadist group 
to drive home that point?

ELIZABETH
Al-Nusra is not a jihadist group.  
They have jihadist elements but 
their immediate goal is to 
overthrow the Syrian government 
which, I think we all agree, is not 
a paradigm of virtue.

FLETCHER
I stand corrected.  The kids are 
peace loving freedom fighters.  

ELIZABETH
There s no reason to think they had

amateur journalists. Mainly, they

Ethan and Alex Cole lie on bare ragged pallets on the floor, 
not sleeping.  From down the corridor we hear the sound of a

Alex fixes a dead stare on the ground.  Shakes his head.  
Ethan begins to cry.  



Elizabeth sits with the PARENTS of the kidnapped kids, JANE 
and STEWART COLE.  Forties, middle class, educated 
professionals. They are distraught about their sons.  
Elizabeth listens to their story. 

JANE

the world with his blog.  He says

reasons.

ADAM

ELIZABETH
And yet it sounds a lot like 
complaining.  

She looks to Caroline who is picking at her food.  

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
How about you?

Caroline just shrugs.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
Come on.  

CAROLINE
Do you want to hear details about 
me missing my boyfriend?

ADAM
I vote no.

ELIZABETH
What about your classes?  You were 
excited about French literature.

Caroline is lying on bed.  A KNOCK and Elizabeth enters.

ELIZABETH
Hey.  Do you want to talk about it?  

CAROLINE
I know you expect me to be a strong 
and independent woman.  It makes me 
feel like an idiot, whining to the 
Secretary of State about my 
boyfriend.

Caroline starts laughing.  Elizabeth laughs, too. Enjoying 
the mother daughter bonding.  Then:30.


CAROLINE

music and cry.

Elizabeth absorbs the mood swing and leaves.



Henry is in bed reading.  Elizabeth enters wearing pajamas, 
towel drying her hair.

ELIZABETH
Did we do the right thing?

HENRY
We absolutely did the right thing.

Great, thanks.

Daisy and Jay leave.  Elizabeth sits down and stares at the

Elizabeth sits with Dalton and Russell Jackson.  They are 
looking at the video.

PRESIDENT DALTON
When did this come in?

ELIZABETH
About an hour ago.  Unfortunately, 
it comes on the heels of an 
unsuccessful attempt to liberate 
the prisoners.

JACKSON
How unsuccessful?

ELIZABETH
We were given disinformation on the 
location. Nothing disastrous but

is obviously their next move.

Not the worst outcome I could

beautiful Secretary of State.

ELIZABETH
We are happy to have your highness 
and his family.  

NUNGUNDE
What about your family, Madam 
Secretary?  Do you have children?

ELIZABETH
I have a son and a daughter.

NUNGUNDE
A nice small family.

ELIZABETH
Well, I just have the one husband.  
So.

A beat as everyone stares.  Nungunde actually laughs at this.  
His wives laugh along with him.

NUNGUNDE
I am honored to have twenty-seven 
children.  

ELIZABETH
That sounds like a lot of work.

NUNGUNDE
I am blessed to have wonderful 
partners.  

ELIZABETH
Your Highness, if I could take a 
moment to discuss a matter of 
international importance.

NUNGUNDE
Of course.  

ELIZABETH
 aware that the AIDS I know you re
epidemic in your country has 
continued to grow despite its 
decline in other developing 
nations.  
(MORE)61.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Early in your reign you took steps 
 to address it but lately it hasn t
been on the forefront of your 
political agenda.  Certainly a man 
of your education and obvious love 
of family understands how important 
 like to work this issue is.  We d
with you to put it back at the top 
of your list.  

The King feels on the spot--not happy to be called out on 
this matter but knows the press is watching and listening.

NUNGUNDE
It would be an honor to do so, 
Madam Secretary.

ELIZABETH
 sure you can enlist the aid of I m
your wives--Sibhale, Majaha, 
Lindelwa, Nomcebo, Nolwazi, Siviwe, 
Temily, Dzeltwe, Andiswa, Bongeka, 
Faniswa, Cokisa, Khuzani, Onele and 
Nosisi.

She has nailed all the names.  The King is impressed.  Not to 
mention the wives.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
 perspective is an A woman s
important thing.  You have no 
shortage of that.  

The King nods.  The press takes notes.  Across the room, 
Nadine watches with the rest of the staff.  Elizabeth s eyes 
connect with hers.  A slight smile and nod.  Nadine is 
starting to get it.  



Elizabeth and the staff file in.

JAY
At this rate the kids from Syria 
are never going to make the news 
cycle.

ELIZABETH
Keep it that way.  

The others feather off, leaving her alone with Nadine.  
Moment of truth between two strong women.

NADINE
Nice work, Madam Secretary.

ELIZABETH
Thank you.

A smile between them.  A future alliance is born.  As 
 surprised to see Henry Elizabeth heads to her office, she s
standing there.  She goes in and closes the door.  



As she approaches him:63.


ELIZABETH
How long have you been here?  If 
you wanted to come to the dinner I 
could have wrangled an invitation.  
I know some people in the State 
Department.

His serious expression throws her.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)

 no other way to say it:There s

HENRY
George is dead.

Elizabeth registers shock.

ELIZABETH
What?  How?

HENRY
Single car collision.  Into a 
telephone pole.  No witnesses.  

ELIZABETH
Oh, my God.

Henry hugs her.  She is too stunned to cry.  She pulls back, 
paces away from Henry, flustered, gears grinding.

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
 an accident.That wasn t

A beat as Henry stares at her.  

HENRY
I know.

On the two of them--

FADE OUT.
