TITLES OVER:
A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to
the early 1900s:
"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears
over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of
articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG"
and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc...
Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the
fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH.
We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome
deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex
Browning.
Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths.
Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of
another and the face- down body of Alex Browning.
MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous
deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre
deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...
LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its
corners and place it in the center of all the others:
A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180
Friday marks one year anniversary.
END TITLES.
FLASH TO BLACK as a HAND ENTERS FRAME, PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
CHAOS. Evan, the driver of the Trans Am, impatiently speaks to
DETECTIVE SUBY, late 40s, professional with an open face that makes
him a great listener.
EVAN
I don't know what you want from me.
Some crazy chic k blocks the highway
with her car, said there'd be an
accident and there was. Big deal.
Even a broken watch is right twice
a day...
Officer Thomas Burke passes by, heading into --
Kat, Eugene, Nora, Tim, and Rory sit in a large room, waiting to give
statements. Unlike Evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.
KAT
Not to sound insensitive, but how
much longer is this going to take?
EUGENE
If I don't get back to my classroom
soon, the kids'll tear the room
apart.
NORA
Those poor people. To think it
would've been us if not for...
PAN OVER TO REVEAL KIMBERLY. She's still in shock, her mind far away.
Thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.
THOMAS
Tell me again how it started.
KIMBERLY
Like I said, it was like I was
there. I remember everything. The
sounds of the crashes, the smells,
the look on Shaina's face...
THOMAS
Do you remember what triggered it
all?
KIMBERLY
The log truck...and everybody I
guess. Everyone was driving like a
maniac. And somehow I knew
something horrible was going to
happen, even before it did.
Something clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly,
like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.
THOMAS
You knew? You just mean a hunch,
right? A bad vibe, maybe?
The other drivers stare at Kimberly.
KIMBERLY
More than that. All the songs on
the radio were about car crashes.
Some kid's banging toy cars
together.
(lookin g at her)
She was dialing her cell phone with
her headset on.
(points to Rory)
His car was leaking oil all over
the road.
RORY
Hey, don't be knockin' the
Chevette.
But the others listen intently now. Especially Kat, who spies her
headset buried deep in her purse.
KIMBERLY
Billboards about accidents. Kids
yelling "pile up" for no reason.
It all felt...just wrong.
Just like...
(swallows; hesitates)
THOMAS
Like what?
Kimberly sighs and looks down. The room becomes eerily silent, except
for the FLICKER of a florescent light.
KIMBERLY
I know this sounds crazy...but you
all heard about Flight 180, right?
The kid who got off the plane?
Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling CRASH as Rory, le aning back in
his chair, tips over. Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly
and picks himself up.
THOMAS
You mean Alex Browning.
KIMBERLY
(looking down)
...My Premonition was just like
his.
NORA
What are you talking about?
EUGENE
(sarcastic)
Oh, you must have read about that
kid who had a dream about a plane
crash so he got his buddies off the
plane? Then the thing blew up just
like in the dream?
NORA
Maybe...
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire
tones.
EUGENE
But this is where it starts to get
freaky. So a month goes by,
everything seems cool, but then the
survivors start dying one boy one.
'Cause when your number's up, it's
up, right? Some people said Death
itself started coming for them,
hunting down every last one, until
they were all dead.
Everyone tenses up.
THOMAS
Well, not quite all of them. Clear
Rivers checked herself into a
padded room at Stoneybrook.
Kimberly, affected, looks to Thomas for confirmation.
KIMBERLY
You do believe me, don't you?
BANG! Everyone jumps as Detective Suby pounds on the door and opens
it.
DETECTIVE SUBY
Officer Burke? Could I see you in
here?
The DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two -
way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously.
DETECTIVE SUBY
Tell me you didn't start up on that
Flight 180 shit again.
(beat)
Did you?
THOMAS
Of course not. That would be
irresponsible and unprofessional.
Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable.
THOMAS
Look, you weren't there. It was
weird. She knew that log truck was
gonna cause an accident, she knew.
(beat)
Never mind.
DETECTIVE SUBY
I thought we we re finished with
this bullshit. This is police
work, not the psychic Hot Line.
But Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When
Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens.
KIMBER LY
But if I was never meant to pull
over, then we all should have died
in the pile up.
TIM
Which means Death could be coming
for us.
Detective Suby looks pissed o ff.
DETECTIVE SUBY
Way to console the witnesses Burke.
At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket
and wave goodbye to the others.
DETECTIVE SUBY
You got 'em thinking Death is after
them? Shit, they're the luckiest
sons o' bitches on the planet. Get
this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday
the kid wins the lotto and today
some looney bitch b locks traffic
and he avoids the worst pile up in
years. I should be so damn
unlucky.
Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what
they've heard.
KAT
What if it's true? What if it's
happening all over again?
The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed,
stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm.
NORA
You're all certifiable, you know
that? I can't believe I've been
listening to this crap. Come on,
Tim, let's go outside.
TIM
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
EUGENE
Look lady, we're just yankin' your
chain.
RORY
Yeah, you're acting like we all
just got the Diff'rent Strokes
curse or something.
Eugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted.
NORA
What's wrong with you people?
Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door,
the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to
calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence.
Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside.
Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.
MR. BURROUGHS
Kimberly...
The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam
burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest,
sobbing.
MR. BURROUGHS
Can I take her home?
Thomas nods.
DETECTIVE SUBY
Sure, you can all go.
By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat
and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless.
KAT
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now
this nonsense.
RORY
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya,
but I've been over this X-Files
shit since the sixth season.
As Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then
DARKNESS.
Kimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea
before her. Both are shaken.
KIMBERLY
I know it's crazy, but I'm really
scared for the others. I've got
this terrible feeling.
MR. BURROUGHS
What feeling?
KIMBERLY
That it's not over yet.
She picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands.
MR. BURROUGHS
Don 't worry. Everything will be
fine, you'll see.
A dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. Evan
appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some
packages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he
climbs.
The stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK
apparently left by some kids.
As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing
Evan to lean against -
THE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan
slowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.
EVAN
Motherfucker.
A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward
the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just
misses it!
He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -
The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and
he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself
and continues down the hallway.
Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small
packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.
Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,
who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing
his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to
the fridge and grabs a drink.
In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a
grease-filled frying pan.
Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the
sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --
And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide
forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.
Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the
frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts
the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.
He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter
next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out
HEY E.
PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -
the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the
microwave and turns it on.
ANGLE ON STOVE
The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his
answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his
packages...
VOICE (O.S.)
Dude! You suck! You buy one
fucking ticket in your whole life
and win twenty grand? We're going
whoring in Prague, you know this!
(whisper)
Hold on, the boss is coming.
A CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.
ANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And
ugly sound.
As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He
slides it over his wrist, admiring it.
ANGLE ON KNIFE
Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about
an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.
By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond
encrusted horseshoe ring.
He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is
FLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION
from the microwave startles him.
The RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!
EVAN
Damn it!
Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When
he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.
Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the
GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.
Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil
from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.
Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE
slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He
continues yanking... Stuck.
He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His
fingers reach for it.
Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to
knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.
The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.
Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the
Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it
threatens to turn on one of the switches.
ANGLE ON FINGERS
In the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.
And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.
EVAN
Come on, come on...
Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the
SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against
the knife in the toaster.
When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,
knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.
The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the
door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.
EVAN
Jesus Christ!
Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He
begins COUGHING in the smoke.
Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the
kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire
escape.
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears
a creak and looks up just as --
A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan
jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire
completely engulfs the kitchen.
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.
He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.
A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick
shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest
level, intact.
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges
once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing
and gently drops to the ground.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --
SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his
legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming
right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly
PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's
watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.
Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas
scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180
"survivors".
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing
the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the
word, "PREMONITION" --
SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.
Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder,
humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to
his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.
DETECTIVE SUBY
(as if entranced)
Ooooh, I see it now. Your
future... A transfer to another
department.
Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas,
embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.
THOMAS
You've made your point.
DETECTIVE SUBY
Good. Cause we just got some new
info and I don't ne ed you getting
freaky on me.
THOMAS
What?
DETECTIVE SUBY
Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he
wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas
looks stunned.
Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and
crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream.
KAT
No, Mom. Just turn on any station,
they've been playing it all day.
(beat; rolls her eyes)
Yes, Mother. Channel four will do
just fine. Here it is, gotta go.
She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage.
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
Route 18 was backed up for almost
nine hours today when a record
breaking pile up...
Nora and Tim watch the same report.
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
...killed An estimated 18 people.
Emergency crews spent hours sifting
through the wreckage.
Eugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch.
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
...hoping To recover any survivors
from this tragic collision. So
far, the police are refusing to
release the names of the victims
until their families are notified.
Mr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly
enter behind him from the kitchen.
ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)
The camera of a highway patrol car
managed to catch this shocking
footage --
B/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to
the ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV.
MR. BURROUGHS
My Lord...
A GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting
back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV --
but she stops him.
KIMBERLY
Don't.
I have to see this.
Mr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on.
It's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist
at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn
everywhere.
RORY
Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right
there? That's my fuckin' car right
there! Oh God, that's dope.
After high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a
freshly chopped line.
ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)
In other news, a freak accident
took the life of a lotto winner.
Rory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the
report, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a
train.
MONTAGE
Of Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the
news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by
EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to
grading blue books.
TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER
Tim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in.
NORA
Come on, Tim, lights out already.
Tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book.
TIM
Mom?
NORA
Yeah?
TIM
You think... You think those guys
were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Nora swallows, trying to seem brave.
NORA
Oh, please. Some people just need
some serious rewiring, that's all.
But neither of them are convinced.
NORA
Get some sleep.
Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim
opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs
it in.
Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the
closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business
card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again.
NORA
Officer Burke, please?
Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his
hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.
KIMBERLY
It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten
anymore.
Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective.
MR. BURROUGHS
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that
you're safe.
KIMBERLY
I love you too, Dad.
Goodnight.
But Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink.
MR. BURROUGHS
You know, after your mother died...
Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.
MR. BURROUGHS
There were so many times I didn't
think I could last another day. I
can't even tell you some of the
things I th ought about.
KIMBERLY
I used to have those feelings, too.
But that's when I'd think of Mom.
Her strength...and courage. And
I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to
be as brave as she was. And the
bad thoughts would go away.
MR. BURROUGHS
(choking up)
I don't know what I'd do if I lost
you.
Mr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as
he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING
out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr.
Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there
is none. And he leaves.
DISSOLVE TO:
The room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and
turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A
porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety.
A BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in
bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the
candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of
a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again.
Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling.
Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL.
Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from
the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.
She can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and
flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously
turns on her computer.
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of
a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard.
PHYSICIAN
...at the request of the patient,
you are to relinquish any sharp
objects such as nail files,
pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby
pins, no matches, lighters, belts,
belt buckles, earrings, chokers,
shoelaces...
Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and
punches "4514" into the electronic lock. They continue down another
corridor.
Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G.
PHYSICIAN
...paper clips, watches, food,
drinks, keys, poisons, pills and
medications.
(looks at Kimberly)
You have a cell phone on you?
Kimberly nods, hands it over.
PHYSICIAN
Then I think we're all done.
They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in
another code.
KIMBERLY
Wait. Is she...dangerous or
something?
PHYSICIAN
No honey, but she expects you are.
KIMBERLY
Jesus, how long are you going to
keep her locked up this way?
PHYSICIAN
Depends on her, I guess.
She's
voluntary.
The door hisses open.
REVEAL CLEAR RIVERS
While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her
former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic
paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on
savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by
something unseen.
KIMBERLY
Clear Rivers?
Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside
her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of
water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.
Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight
180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as
seen in the opening title montage).
The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps.
CLEAR
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?
What do
you want?
KIMBERLY
I thought...I thought you might be
able to help me.
CLEAR
(snicker)
Yeah, how?
KIMBERLY
I had a premonition about the Route
18 pile up. .. I saved some people.
And now I think Death is after me.
CLEAR
Nice work. Maybe if you're real
lucky, you'll wind up in here with
me.
(gives Kimberly the once
over)
But I doubt you'll survive that
long.
Kimberly flinches.
KIMBERLY
It's not just about me. Someone I
saved died last night in a freak
accident. What if the others are
in danger, too?
CLEAR
Well, if you put them on the list,
they're already tits up.
KIMBERLY
What list?
CLEAR
Death's list. The precise order
you're going to die in.
Clear's eyes bore into a terrified Kimberly's.
CLEAR
The survivors of Flight 180 died in
the exact order they were
originally meant to die in the
plane crash. That was Death's
original design.
KIMBERLY
(sudden realization)
Exact order? Then I'm next! I was
meant to die with my friends, so
I'm next!
Clear backs away from Kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops
short.
CLEAR
But you said someone else died last
night. That means Death skipped
past you. Someone must have
intervened.
(off Kimberly's confusion)
Sometime yesterday you must have
nearly died, but someone saved you.
Kimberly nods, recalling the events.
KIMBERLY
Officer Burke pulled me away from
the crash that killed my friends.
CLEAR
Congratufuckinglations. That makes
you last to go. But don't worry,
once the others are dead, it'll
come back for you. Always does.
KIMBERLY
That still doesn't make sense. You
said you die in the same order you
were originally meant to. But Evan
Shaeffer died last in my
premonition, not first.
Clear seems very disturbed by that.
CLEAR
It's moving backwards?
Are you
sure?
Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...
HARD CUT TO:
THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE PILE UP
Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then EXPLODES, followed by Evan
screaming in the Trans Am, which gets CREAMED by the semi!
BACK TO:
Kimberly, shaken, does the math.
KIMBERLY
Yes. In my premonition that Nora
woman and her kid died first, then
Evan and then...my friends.
Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs.
CLEAR
Backwards...that's new.
Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens.
CLEAR
That's good. Get all your tears
out now, you'll need your eyes.
(off Kimberly's confusion)
For the signs.
KIMBERLY
Signs?
CLEAR
If you have the same power as Alex,
you'll be seeing signs soon. When
you see anything creepy or ominous,
an in-your- face irony kinda thing?
Don't ignore it. It usually means
the difference between life and
death.
KIMBERLY
(to herself)
The songs on the radio.
(to Clear)
But wait. I don't understand.
Why
is this even happening to me?
CLEAR
That's what Alex used to ask
himself right up until...
For an instant, we see a gentle side of Clear.
KIMBERLY
It's obvious you know what you're
talking about. You beat it. You
have to help us.
Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.
CLEAR
I didn't beat it; I hid from it.
If you were smart you'd put a down
payment on a burial plot and say
goodbye to the dog, because what
little life you have left is over
as you know it. Don't make new
friends, don't fall in love, and
don't ever bother trying to save
others. That's the worst killer of
them all.
KIMBERLY
How can you say that?
What kind of
monster are you?
At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched
teeth.
CLEAR
My family is dead.
My friends are
dead. And Alex...
Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly.
While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a
gruesome picture on its own.
CLEAR
And yes, that's the blade of a
fucking ceiling fan in his head.
Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly. A GUARD
opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons
her courage and turns back to Clear.
KIMBERLY
Know what? I think you're a
coward. I think you hide out in
here because you're too damn bitter
and selfish to care about another
living soul. In my opinion, you're
already dead.
Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about.
Clear Rivers applies fun- tack to the back of a newspaper article and
sticks it on the wall devoted to Flight 180.
REVEAL
A photo of Eva, "Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder".
Clear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors
of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces.
TIM
Not so much.
Dr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself.
The RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM.
She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank.
A startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She
vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet.
The DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which
sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the
side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet.
Tim looks petrified as Dr. Lees unveils a tray full of PICS, CARVERS
and EXTRACTING FORCEPS.
The KA-CHUNG of construction outside makes it im possible to
concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr. Lees picks up a pic
and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth. CU of PIC gently
prodding Tim's teeth.
DR. LEES (O.S.)
I'm a little disappointed, Tim.
Does your mom know you've been
smoking?
Tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches.
DR. LEES (O.S.)
Yeah, that'll have to be filled.
A BANG from the window startles Dr. Lees. His HAND JERKS, but luckily
the pic was removed from Tim's mouth.
Dr. Lees whips around in time to see a PIGEON flutter away from the
window.
DR. LEES
Jesus. Every day at the same damn
time. Now this'll only sting for a
moment.
Dr. Lees picks up a large SYRINGE and moves it toward Tim's open
mouth.
DR. LEES
Open big. Wiiiiider...
Tim's eyes radiate fear. The MOUTH OPENS. Reluctantly. Tim nervously
eyes the window as the needle enters...
ANGLE ON
NEEDLE heading toward his gumline --
BANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees'
hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr.
Lees looks towards the window angrily.
DR. LEES
How the hell do they expect me
to... Would you rather have the
laughing gas?
Tim nods his head ferociously.
DR. LEES
Jean?
I need you in here.
(waits)
Jean??!
Jean continues vacuuming. The vacuum makes contact with Nora's foot.
After a minute, Dr. Lees angrily switches on two compressors: Oxygen
and Nitrous Oxide.
By now, the NO mask has been attached around Tim's nose. As Tim
drifts off, Dr. Lees lowers a DRILL into his mouth.
DR. LEES
Open big. Wiiiiiider.
Excruciating SOUNDS of the drill going through enamel.
INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS
Racing to the medical complex throughout.
THE WAITING ROOM
The WATER TRICKLES into the outlet. The vacuum sparks and dies just
as --
BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE
BANG! SFX: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed
through the window. In the other room.
DR. LEES
Goddamn it already.
Dr. Lees marches out of the room to investigate. Another quick
electrical surge and the OXYGEN COMPRESSOR flutters off. The needle
drops. But the NITROUS flow remains strong.
ANGLE ON FISH MOBILE
Spinning from a new breeze. Suddenly, a small round PUFFER FISH FALLS
directly into Tim's mouth.
Soft, gurgling and choking.
Nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly
right. Dr. Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it.
BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE
SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but
rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops.
Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue
our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes.
They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame
and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth.
REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to
make sure nobody saw...
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small
chapel, creat ing a loud CREAK. A corpse in an open casket sits at the
front of the chapel, post -wake.
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to
get to a side door.
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
An ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of
a furnace make it all the more eerie.
As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the
shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven.
They edge closer. They peek inside the --
Oddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a
momentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all!
They jump back - bumping right into:
MR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has
inexplicably appear BEHIND THEM.
MORTICIAN
Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an
eye out for you.
The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY
toward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
KIMBERLY
Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.
Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.
MORTICIAN
Come to... Pick my brain?
The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's
mouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards
the bloody tooth on a metal tray.
MORTICIAN
(to Kimberly)
Flesh and bone require 1,600
degrees for cremation. Gold,
prosthetics and other metals must
be removed before the final --
CLEAR
(not falling for this
again)
Just a simple question and we'll
leave you alone with your new
friend.
The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and
hits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze.
MORTICIAN
Fire away.
CLEAR
How do you cheat Death once and for
all?
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down
to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
MORTICIAN
Dead.
But still fresh.
Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear
has had about enough.
CLEAR
(to the Mortician)
Look, we drove a long way to get
here. So if you happen to know how
to get this death monkey off our
backs, it sure would be swell if
you told us.
The Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING.
MORTICIAN
For what purpose? You seek a back
way out of a room with but one
door. You can't cheat Death; there
are no escapes.
CLEAR
Bullshit. You told me Death has a
distinct design, a blueprint,
unalterable. But Alex and I
cheated Death not once, but dozens
of times. If the design is flawed,
it can be beaten.
A sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring
OFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't
flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.
MORTICIAN
Such fire in you now. People are
always most alive just before they
die. Don't you think?
Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.
CLEAR
It can be beaten.
And you know it.
CREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven.
MORTICIAN
Some say that there is a balance to
everything. An equilibrium that is
the connective tissue of the
universe. They say that for every
lif e there is a death, and for
every death a life...
His words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters.
MORTICIAN
Solus novus anima licet evinco
mortis; Only new life can defeat
death.
(off their confusion)
The list of life is forever set by
the Divine Plan, the guiding hand
that plots the course of the
universe, down to its tiniest
element s.
Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses
on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.
MORTICIAN
The list accounts for every life;
from the dawn of man to the great
apocalypse. But the introduction
of life that was not meant to be, a
soul forbidden to roam the earth,
that could invalidate Death's list,
shatter its very existence.
Evan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly.
THOMAS
What the hell does that mean?
MORTICIAN
(with finality)
To figure that out you'll have to
follow the sign s.
The Mortician grabs Kimberly.
MORTICIAN
But be warned. To disrupt the
grand design is to unravel the
tapestry of the universe. When you
pull all the threads apart, you may
find yourself hanging from them.
The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go.
CLEAR
One last question. Why is Death
working backwards this time?
The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex.
MORTICIAN
(shakes head; a sick
smile)
Sorry, time's up.
KIMBERLY
Comes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror-
stricken. She begins hyperventilating.
THOMAS
What is it? What did you see?
It's so bad, Kimberly can't speak. She coughs and gags as if recently
drowned. Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers.
QUICK CUTS:
A POWER REPAIRMAN
On a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a LAWN BOY pull-
starts a WEED WHACKER close to broken glass, a MECHANIC on a tall
ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female DOG WALKER with
three dogs approaches the ladder.
CLEAR
You have to tell us now.
KIMBERLY
I...I...
Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an
angry drill sergeant.
CLEAR
You're strong. Do you hear me?
You're a fucking warrior. Nothing
scares you. In fact you happen to
be the single most powerful woman
on earth. Now what did you see?
The words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her
breath back, and speaks without a hitch.
KIMBERLY
I was driving a white van. It
must've gone out of control because
it crashed into a lake and I
drowned. It was...horrible.
CLEAR
You were there?
KIMBERLY
I can practically taste the water
in my throat. And something else.
The smell of flowers...
CLEAR
(confused)
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was
a premonition?
Thomas gently releases her, paces.
THOMAS
Remember the onramp? There was a
pregnant woman in a white delivery
van.
CLEAR
Holy shit. He said "only new life
can defeat death."
(off looks)
If she gives birth to a baby that
was never meant to be born, a brand
new soul that was never part of
Death's Design...
KIMBERLY
It throws the entire Death list out
of whack. And a new list has to be
rewritten f rom scratch. We all
start over with a clean slate.
THOMAS
It sounds all well and good, but
what if we're wrong?
CLEAR
Please, what else could it mean?
KIMBERLY
(to Thomas)
So if you give us the pregnant
lady's number, we can warn her
about the lake and she'll live long
enough to have the baby.
CLEAR
So let's do it.
THOMAS
(realization)
Shit, I don't have her number. She
was never interviewed. She took
off right after the accident.
KIMBERLY
How are we going to find her?
There must be thousands of white
vans in this state.
THOMAS
Hey, I'm a police officer,
remember?
Thomas works a VCR, scanning BACKWARDS through the video footage from
the patrol car camera. We see the SUV's explosive collision with the
jack- knifed semi. Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the
crash.
KIMBERLY
Oh God...
Thomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor.
THOMAS
I, uh...sorry.
Kimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up. She forces back
the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away.
KIMBERLY
I know, I know. We need my eyes.
Clear sits beside Kimberly.
CLEAR
It's all right.
I'll take watch.
Kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's
already buried the need to cry.
KIMBERLY
I'm okay. Just caught me by
surprise. Put it back on.
Clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.
CLEAR
Make sure all these people will be
at the meeting tonight.
THOMAS
Taken care of.
THE MONITOR
Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down
the onramp.
KIMBERLY
There it is.
THOMAS
Got it.
Thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past
the White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot.
As Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate
number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame
by frame.
CLEAR
I don't get it. Why is everything
happening so fast? After Flight
180. A month went by before anyone
died. And now five people are dead
in less than a day.
Thomas' computer screen finally fills with information.
THOMAS
Here we go. The vehicle's a
delivery van registered to Jorge
and Isabella Cruz. And Christ,
there's almost a dozen domestic
disturbance complaints on these
two.
CLEAR
We need to hurry.
They all get up and leave.
Ominously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's
Pacer - a white van!
Thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and
Clear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see
where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning
the walkway.
THOMAS
Let's lay this on her gently now.
The stress alone could upset the
pregnancy.
Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when
AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.
All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate
from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.
But nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and
as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and
purposefully to the front door.
He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a
ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at
the last second by its owner -
JORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's
BARKING:
JORGE
What?
THOMAS
I'm Officer Burke.
I'm looking for
an Isabella Cruz.
Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog.
JORGE
Shut up!!!
The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it
lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once
again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.
Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns.
THOMAS
Are you Jorge Cruz?
JORGE
Maybe.
What's this about?
THOMAS
May we come in?
JORGE
No.
What's this about?
ANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile
floor. She takes in what she can see of --
THE ROOM
As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn.
Furniture over-turned.
THOMAS
(a little stern)
It's about your wife, Isabella.
Now is she here?
Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.
JORGE
No.
I'm alone.
But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares
through the house, into a bedroom and sees -
A FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.
THOMAS
Look, pal, it's probably nothing.
But I need to see --
Jorge is already closing the door.
JORGE
Forget it. You'll need a warrant.
I know, I'm a lawyer.
Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past
Jorge's grasp.
JORGE
Stop!!!
You can't go in there!!!
Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to
the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes
a closer look at Clear.
YOUNG WOMAN
We never meant to hurt you
Isa...You're not Isabella!
Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas.
JORGE
I'm going to sue your ass!
KIMBERLY
Whose blood is that on the floor?
Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut.
JORGE
Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts
this afternoon. Now arrest her!
KIMBERLY
Where's Isabella? Did you finally
kill her you fucking wife beater?
Jorge flinches. It's time to come clean.
JORGE
We had a fight. Some things got
broken, the dog went crazy, she
left me. Wouldn't say where she
was going.
THOMAS
What was the fight about?
JORGE
Take a guess.
THOMAS
Does she have a cell phone?
A way
we can contact her?
JORGE
She did.
He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor.
CLEAR
We're wasting time with this piece
of shit. Let's just get to the
meeting.
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
JORGE
Hey, when you find her, tell her
the kid's half mine.
Clear mutters something as they exit the house.
CLEAR
We can only pray it doesn't come
out retarded.
Jorge hisses something at the Rotty, which CHARGES them and SPRINGS!
But Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.
DISSOLVE TO:
Rory follows some PEOPLE into the elevator. The elevator doors close
on his shoe -- trapping Rory in an awkward position.
One MAN frantically pushes the DOORS OPEN button to no avail.
Finally, as the elevator rises, Rory YANKS his foot free.
MAN
Jesus Christ. I wrote to
management two weeks ago about
these friggin' bumpers.
Rory bends down and inspects his shoe.
RORY
Damn, is that dogshit?
Rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the Man's face - see? -
before disgustedly slipping it back on.
DING. The doors open. The man hurries out and the elevator DOORS
CLOSE on Rory's smirking face.
HARD CUT TO:
REVEAL - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch. It's obvious
the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. Clear and Kimberly await
their reactions. Nora raises a trembling hand.
NORA
Does anybody have a Valium?
Kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.
KAT
You'll want to take --
Nora pops it in her mouth.
KAT
-- half of that.
Nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. Across the loft,
Thomas paces, phone in hand.
THOMAS
(quietly, into phone)
Any word yet on the Dodge van?
Damn.
Eugene alone seems unafraid. He uses a GRABBER - a long pole with
movable claw on the end - to OPEN THE SKYLIGHT. When done, he
balances the long pole precariously against the wall.
An OMINOUS BREEZE enters. Clear notices MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over
the desk by the couch.
NORA
So that would mean... I'm next.
EUGENE
Nobody's next. This is crazy.
First death's stalking us and now
premonitions?
KAT
This can't be happening. My
career's at a peak, I finally met a
cute guy, I just bought a new
house...
RORY
Just shut the fuck up and maybe
you'll live.
Kat's hands ball into fists. The hatred is mutual. Clear reaches for
a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing MAGAZINE PAGES blowing
over until their weight tips over a PENCIL HOLDER which spills pens
out. She takes the box to Nora.
CLEAR
You're not next, Nora. Nobody has
to be next. That's the point.
Last time, we didn't plan. We
weren't organized. Now we can help
each other.
She reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the
others.
CLEAR
Think what would have happened if
Kimberly had been able to warn you
with the word pigeons...
Nora's head falls. Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.
KIMBERLY
The point is, as long as you know
what to beware of, you have a
fighting chance. It can be beaten.
If I call you and say subway, get
to a high rise fast. A place where
no subway could possibly go, get
it?
Everyone nods in understanding. Rory fidgets, sniffling, then POUNDS
the table in frustration. Startling Kat.
RORY
Why the hell did I ever get on
Route 18 in the first place?
That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.
Clear, very alert, looks at the tipped PENCIL HOLDER. PENS ROLL
toward the end of the desk, toward a large White Pages directory
which hangs precariously off the edge just so.
CLEAR
Anyone read today's paper?
The
article on Evan Shaeffer?
No one says a word.
CLEAR
The only reason he was on Route 18
was because he own the lottery and
had to collect the winnings.
RORY
That lucky bastard.
CLEAR
What about the rest of you?
Kimberly, you were driving to
Daytona. Was Route 18 your first
choice?
KIMBERLY
The new freeway was faster, but
Route 18 was the way my mom used to
take, so...
They take turns going around the room.
THOMAS
Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but
he called in sick so I got...
(blanches)
Drake's never sick.
KAT
I was my first day of jury duty.
EUGENE
Jury duty? That's randomly
selected by social security
numbers.
CLEAR
Random, sure.
EUGENE
What, you think Death planned for
each of us to die in the pile up
weeks ago? You're nuts.
Clear fumes. Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet.
RORY
Last July I dialed a wrong number
and got a radio station by
accident. They asked me what
number means "good luck" in Jewish.
KAT
Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
RORY
Anyway, I guessed it right and won
these.
Rory holds up two Yankee tickets.
RORY
The best way to get to Yankee
Stadium is Route 18.
KIMBERLY
I don't know what's weirder, the
dialing a wrong number part or that
Death would set you up nine months
in advance.
THOMAS
(realization)
Whoa, nine months?
KIMBERLY
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
ANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY.
REVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on
the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be
heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door.
ISABELLA
Yes, I'd like to report a domestic
squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz
why, does it matter? I'm at the
Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white
van. So what? Just get over here.
Isabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL
BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a
rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN.
Kimberly whispers into the phone.
KIMBERLY
I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard
time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll
stay here at Virginia's tonight and
see you tomorrow. I love you too.
She hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear
keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table
into the about-to -fall White Pages directory.
CLEAR
Remember everyone, just because
Kimberly's got the power doesn't
mean we're not all capable of
seeing signs to some extent.
The pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips
over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW.
Small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze.
Everyone in the room watches them rise.
RORY
It's like Forrest Gump.
They float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP!
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber
- which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
Clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH
mounted on the wall.
The Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted
SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP
and SLIDE DOWNWARD!
Clear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill
impales the seat cushion between her legs!
CLEAR
Fuck. Should have seen that
coming. The institution's made me
soft.
Clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene
isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen.
EUGENE
If Death has got such a hard-on for
you, maybe you should get the hell
away from us.
KIMBERLY
We need her. She's the only one
who's dealt with this before,
idiot!
Kimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks
grateful.
CLEAR
We're all going to have to open our
eyes from now on. Look out for
each other. Sleep in shifts.
(looks around apartment)
And we've got to safeproof this
deathtrap.
MONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT
Everyone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the
fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp
objects away, affix padding to chart corners...
Kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box,
nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a
hanging mirror off the wall.
KAT
Screw this. I'm going outside for
a smoke.
THOMAS
You think you should?
It's not
safe out there.
KAT
So? Nora's gotta bite it before me
anyway, right?
Kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and
grabs it just in case. Thomas smiles 'good job' at her.
Kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from
the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. Kimberly
looks concerned.
KIMBERLY
Where are you going, Nora?
You
okay?
Nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated.
NORA
Four years ago my husband died.
Now Tim. There's nothing left for
me.
Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain.
KIMBERLY
Don't say that. Once you lose
hope, it's already too late.
Eugene snickers. Nora looks up, anger surfacing.
NORA
If it's my time to go, to be in
heaven with my family, then I can
accept that.
KIMBERLY
You can't give up. Don't accept
Death's plan. Trust me, you can
fight this. If we can just survive
long enough until that baby is
born, we can --
Nora looks more resolute than ever.
NORA
If you'll excuse me, I have a
funeral to prepare.
Everyone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door. Except Eugene,
who stands up as well.
EUGENE
Yeah, why am I listening to a girl
who just got out of the nut house?
As Eugene heads out, Kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him.
KIMBERLY
Seeing you die once was enough for
me.
EUGENE
Whatever. I control my life, not
fate.
CLEAR
I'll be sure to put that on your
tombstone.
Rory presses a cell phone into Eugene's hand on his way out.
RORY
Be careful. And even if you don't
believe, give this to Nora.
Eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times. Nora nervously
ties her long hair back in a single braid.
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
RORY, standing on the couch, pulls a POLICE ACADEMY DIPLOMA off the
wall - and slips - stumbling BACKWARDS into the closet.
Staggering, he accidentally knocks some COAT HANGARS and a VOLLEYBALL
TROPHY from the high shelf to the floor.
Thomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt. He then lowers his
gaze and sees --
The figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of
wire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array.
From Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man
with hooks emanating from his body. The sodium vapor lamp casts an
OMINOUS GLOW around the image.
RORY
...man with hooks. I see a man
with hooks. Someone?!?!
The others look over, trying to see what he does.
THOMAS
(unsure)
I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's
going to be killed by a man with
hooks?
Kimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp
ominously FLICKERS OUT AND DIES.
Everyone looks around for a hesitant beat, then Thomas picks up his
cell phone. Clear first walks, then RUNS out the door.
The elevator finally comes. Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in
front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of
PROSTHETIC LIMBS.
MUZAK plays AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.
EUGENE
Going down, right?
The Gaunt Man says nothing. The DOORS CLOSE.
Eugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's
disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF:
THE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally
close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy.
EUGENE
Um, by the way, your shoe's untied.
Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries
tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell
phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then
looks embarrassed.
EUGENE
Probably for you, anyway.
Nora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES. It's hard to make out Thomas'
yelling.
NORA
Officer Burke?
I can't hear...
A beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks
and hands of the Prosthetic limbs. Terror. She freezes.
EUGENE
What is it? What's wrong?
But Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing
unintelligible STATIC.
INTERCUT CLEAR
As she frantically hits the elevator button. When it fails to come,
she runs downstairs.
Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the
door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets
snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards.
NORA
Let me go let me go!
EUGENE
Oh, watch it, you've caught your
uh...
The Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his
outward appearance.
MAN
Goodness gracious, darling, let me
help you with...
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora
desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the
elevator.
Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette.
KAT
You alright, Nora?
The elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her
head inside, body outside the elevator.
Eugene pounds on the BUMPERS, but they don't seem to work!
NORA
My God, someone please let me out
of this --
INTERCUT
The UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby.
The Elevator RISES!
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level -
then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT!
Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor!
Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator
repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS.
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends.
Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs
to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail.
All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try
to pull her back down.
The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down
into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering
away as the body convulses.
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A
bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head,
still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND
POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator.
Eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently.
Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered.
EUGENE
...no escapes my ass. I control my
fate. I die on my terms, hear me
Reaper cockscuker?!
Eugene's in another world. He approaches Thomas and lunges for his
GUN - yanking it from the holster!
THOMAS
What the hell are you...?
EUGENE
Ain't going out like that.
On my
terms!
THOMAS
Just take it easy!
A twisted insane smile comes to Eugene's face as he jams the
gunbarrel to his temple. The others shrink back in terror.
He PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK! Eugene tries again. CLICK!
Thomas looks stunned as Eugene goes through every round, CLICK CLICK
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLI CK...
Kimberly breaths a sigh of relief.
KIMBERLY
You don't keep it loaded?
Thomas' eyes disagree. He reaches in and GRABS the gun away from
Eugene, who stands there trembling. Thomas cracks open the cylinder.
Loaded.
RORY
Maybe they were all duds.
THOMAS
Six in a row? Never. Impossible.
That's like
(sinking realization)
...winning the lottery.
CLEAR (O.S.)
It wasn't his turn to die.
Everyone turns to see Clear and Kat, standing in the doorway,
DRENCHED IN BLOOD. Kat trembles uncontrollably.
KAT
Can we find the pregnant woman,
please?
DISSOLVE TO:
Flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room. In
the newly conformed safe house, Kat and Clear relax as best they can
in Thomas' dry clothes.
Thomas makes another phone call. In the corner, Eugene shivers to
himself. Desperately looking for signs of danger. He looks over to
Clear.
EUGENE
Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about
before. I...
CLEAR
Your entire world view just went
out the window. I couldn't expect
a religious conversation overnight.
We'll get through this.
(beat)
I promise.
Eugene looks immensely relieved. Rory ambles over to Kimberly, his
typical callousness gone.
RORY
Can I ask you a question?
KIMBERLY
Sure.
RORY
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
KIMBERLY
I...I don't know.
Rory nods. He expected as much. He fishes his LICENSE and KEYS out of
his pocket.
RORY
And you're gonna die after me,
right?
KIMBERLY
I guess so.
RORY
(re: keys and license)
Would you take these? And if I
die...
(tears well up)
Could you throw all my drugs out?
Paraphernalia, porno, you know...
Anything that would break my mom's
heart.
Kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline. When
she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys.
The PHONE RINGS. Rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode.
Thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up.
THOMAS
A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella
Cruz is being detained up in
Greenwood. Let's finish this
thing.
Isabella, pissed, is in a holding tank. Small town deputy STEVE
ADAMS, 30's, CLEANS HIS GUN in her direction.
ISABELLA
What do you mean "grand theft
auto?" This is insane.
STEVE
Hopefully the district judge can
straighten it all out by Monday
mor ning.
ISABELLA
(figures it out)
Jorge. When I get out of here I'm
going to sue his cheating ass off.
As she fumes, a rivulet of WATER streaks down her leg.
IS ABELLA
Oh my God.
Steve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps.
STEVE
Are you kidding me?!
Oh, man.
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.
STEVE
C'mon.
Let's go.
As Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem:
GREENWOOD LAKE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT.
Deputy Steve speeds the White Van up the narrow winding road.
Isabella breathes Lamaze- style through intense pain.
ISABELLA
Promise me...I won't have the
baby...in this van.
Speeding up the incline, Steve tries to speed around a Volkswagon
Beetle, but cars scream by in the opposite direction.
ISABELLA
Get around it!!!
Steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas, dangerously riding the
shoulder around the Beetle.
Way ahead of the Beetle, on the left side, is a LAKE.
Rory excitedly makes a connection.
RORY
Remember the theater in Paris that
collapsed last year, killed
everyone inside?
Everyone nods, anticipating...
RORY
I had tickets to go, but one day
I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid,
sippin' lattes an' such, and this
dude gets whacked by a falling
sign.
CLEAR
Carter.
RORY
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a
shopping cart for four hours.
'Course, missed the show...
CLEAR
What about you, Kimberly?
Did you
anyone from Flight- ?
Clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from Kimberly's
face. Even Eugene looks concerned.
EUGENE
Are you okay?
The car becomes completely silent (except for the slight SCRAPING) as
Kimberly prepares to tell her story.
KIMBERLY
A little over a year ago, my mother
and I went to the mall. I was
supposed to meet her outside, but I
got caught up watching some news
report about some kid who committed
suicide. I kept thinking, "How can
you strangle yourself in a
bathtub?" That's retarded.
Thomas mouths, "Tod?" to Clear. Clear nods.
KIMBERLY
It felt wrong. And yet...
(continuing)
There were gunshots outside and I
ran...
(chokes up)
Some kids tried to jack her car.
She fought them off - she was a
fighter - and they killed her.
Kimberly looks to Clear.
KIMBERLY
After the funeral I had this
overwhelming feeling that it should
have been me. I figured that's how
everyone must feel. But I guess I
was right.
Thomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand. As he
looks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a
cigarette.
INTERCUT BRIAN
The tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a
cord and starts up the whoodchipper.
CLEAR
It's all starting to come together.
When Alex got us off Flight 180, it
didn't just change our lives. It
affected everyone and everything
we've come into contact with ever
since.
EUGENE
I'm not sure I understand.
CLEAR
Being alive after our time caused
an outward ripple - a rift in
Death's design.
Eugene nods, slowly getting it.
EUGENE
So if you never got off the plane,
none of us would be ali ve in the
first place.
CLEAR
That's why Death is working
backwards. It's tying up all the
loose ends, sealing the rift once
and for all

CU LEFT TIRE
A thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement.
BRIAN
The wood chipper roar s loudly. Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk
SHOOTS from the spout --
The airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve
veers out of control.
Kat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly
jerks the wheel to the right.
Kat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire
SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the
oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van!
Isabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van
has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road
toward a LAKE!
STEVE
Hang on!
The SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the
embankment, spinning and rolling towards --
THE GIBBONS' FARM
At the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits
at the edge of the property!
The SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it!
INSIDE THE SUV
All Kat can do is cover her head with her arms.
THE WHITE VAN
Speeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The
White Van is ready for splashdown.
Steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's
able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard
jerk.
STEVE
We're okay, we're okay.
THE PROPANE TANK
It's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely
misses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary
fence and right into --
AN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE!
The Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation
ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere.
Just as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS
through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory --
coming to a rest just behind Kat's head.
INSIDE THE WHITE VAN
Steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows
down. Isabella squeezes his hand white.
ISABELLA
Please.
It's not going to wait.
STEVE
I've got to stop and help those
people.
ISABELLA
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Steve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He
floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio.
THE EXPEDITION
The dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET
WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL
SPIKE that skewers the vehicle.
Rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it.
Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to
open the door, but it won't budge.
KAT
Not my time.
Amazing...
THOMAS
Is everybody alright?
A BLOODY HAND SEIZES HIS SHOULDER!
Thomas turns to see
Eugene SPASMING in the back seat! He clutches his ribcage in agony
and wheezes! Blood trickles from his mouth.
KAT
He can't breathe!
He can't
breathe!
CLEAR
Oh my god, Eugene!?
Eugene's head tilts forward, unconscious.
Typical chatter as the staff preps Isabella. Steve paces nervously in
the background.
STAFF
...contractions coming quicker now.
Take her pressure and CTG. One
centimeter dilation. Prep the
epidural stat.
Isabella breathes Lamaze style in the hospital bed, her feet in
stirrups. A NURSE rocks Isabella's body back and forth, until her
back arches almost unnaturally forward.
In the BG, an OBSTETRICIAN, 50s, sterilizes his hands in a scrub
sink.
A female ANESTHESIOLOGIST hustles over, swabbing a LONG EPIDURAL
NEEDLE. The nurse places a mask over Isabella's face. The
Anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of Isabella's spine.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
She's going to have to stop moving
if I'm going to --
The Nurse SNEEZES.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Goddamn it, keep her still!
NURSE
Sorry, doctor.
XCU NEEDLE
Tracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra.
ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE
It buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors
and nurses, hovering above the --
ANESTHESIOLOGIST, who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine,
finding the proper vertebrae.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Perfectly still now...
Everyone freezes. SILENCE. As the tip of the needle presses the skin
down --
The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear. And STINGS!
FLINCH!
The NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong?
ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Done.
(tears welling)
Now could someone please find the
open window and fucking close it?
UNKNOWN POV
A NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look
of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so
fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform:
KALARJIAN
THOMAS (O.S.)
Kimberly! Slow down!
BACK TO:
Kimberly "comes to" at the wheel -- FLAILING DESPERATELY at the
steering wheel. She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the
neglected steering wheel.
CLEAR
Slow down! We're...
Kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars
are backed up at a stop sign. Kimberly screams and SLAMS on the
brakes.
The truck SKIDS on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a
LANDSCAPING TRUCK parked on the shoulder.
Kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty
feet into the air, DUKES OF HAZZARD-style.
And lands miraculously without a scratch! On a parallel road. And
keeps going. Dumb, insane fucking luck.
Kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window.
She turns around with a cocky smile.
She rubs her throat and FLOORS IT again to Thomas' horror, more
determined.
CLEAR
(eyes darting)
What did you see? What am I
looking for?
KIMBERLY
No, it's not here. This one was
different. More like the pile up
and the van going into the lake.
It wasn't just a sign, I was there.
CLEAR
(confused)
Another premonition?
KIMBERLY
Yes. I was in a hospital. There
was screaming... A nurse was
choking me. I couldn't tell wh at
she looked like, but the name tag
was right in my face. Kalarjian.
THOMAS
Kalarjian?
KIMBERLY
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is
going to choke Isabella to death!
WIPING FRAME, a NURSE enters a room and reads a clipboard on an
unseen patient's bed.
REVEAL EUGENE lying in a hospital bed, wired to the latest medical
hardware. Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR
TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.
The NURSE'S HAND reaches down to Eugene's neck...
Eugene WINCES when the Nurse gives the tube a friendly little SHAKE
to check if it's stable.
NURSE
Sorry. Can you feel that in your
trachea?
Eugene rolls his eyes. Stupid question.
NURSE
Quite complaining. I got burnt
babies in the Children's Ward
braver than you.
She sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear. Eugene opens his mouth
as if to speak.
NURSE
Don't bother. You won't be talking
for at least a month. Think you
can handle that, Jabberjaw?
Eugene looks ready to cry. The Nurse sits on the bed, jarring Eugene
enough to make him WINCE again.
NURSE
Don't worry. Everyone learns to
love me once they get used to my
sense of humor, okay?
Eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature.
ANGLE ON
Oxygen valve. PAN OVER AND DOWN TO
Eugene tries to watch a news flash of HIS accident on the TV across
the room, but a bulky ORDERLY blocks his view.
ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)
...ironically impaled through the
head as a result of an emergency
airbag deploying.
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in
front of him, again obscuring his view. Eugene frantically pantomimes
writing.
ORDERLY
Need a pen? Sure. If you like,
I'll bring crosswords for you, too.
Eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers
his movement.
ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)
...police Have speculated that one
of the deaths may have been
narcotics related and urge children
to stay away from d rugs.
Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An
ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop.
ANCHOR MAN
Good advice, Sue. And stay in
school. Up next, Johnny Showers
has the weather...
A WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations.
Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing
the huge cart out of the room.
The sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV
which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES.
ORDERLY
Jeez, it's freezing in here.
The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just
below the ceiling.
Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong.
ANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE -
Bursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of
the room.
A hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly.
ADMINISTRATOR
What are you doing? The Henzels
are still waiting for you in the
Children's Ward --
The Orderly smacks his forehead - shit. Totally forgot.
ORDERLY
Right, right, right.
Gregory's big
day.
ADMINISTRATOR
And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy
can't feel her legs.
The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The
Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past.
The HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room.
The OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV.
Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial
ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER:
ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY
Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons,
and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over:
ANCHOR
WOMAN (O.S.)
Mor e tears were
shed this morning
in the wake of
yesterday's tragedy
that rocked the
Tri -State area...
Suddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking.
The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS.
Eugene goes white with terror. He looks back to --
The broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine
frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch.
Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters.
Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk.
CLEAR
Isabella Cruz.
What room's she in?
RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry, I can't give out that
info unless you're a relative.
CLEAR
I'm her sister.
The Receptionist eyes her dubiously.
RECEPTIONIST
I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz.
Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and
seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned.
CLEAR
Delivery rooms are downstairs.
I'll find Eugene and catch up with
you.
Kimberly and Thomas hurry to the elevator banks...then reconsider and
enter the stairwell.
Eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed, trying to inch the call-
switch closer and closer to him. But it won't budge.
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and
disappears by his stomach!
He pounds desperately on the empty food tray, his side rails, looks
toward the door --
Outside the door, you can't hear a thing in the bustling hallway as
people rush by. Kimberly and Thomas rush past his door, lost.
THOMAS
Hurry, I think she's this way.
BACK TO EUGENE
His eyes scream insanely, but he respirator tube prevents any sound
from escaping him. And that's when the RAT appears on the floor and
begins gnawing on the respirator's power cord!
When Eugene sees this, the EEG machine climbs off the charts.
Clear takes off down the hallway. The Receptionist, shaken, dials her
phone.
RECEPTIONIST
Security?
The Obstetrician voices concern.
OBSTETRICIAN
Listen to me, Isabella, I need you
to stop pushing.
ISABELLA
What's wrong? IS the baby all
right?
OBSTETRICIAN
It's a breach. If I can't reverse
it, we may need to do a Caesarian.
The Obstetrician's hands go to work. Steve looks ill.
STEVE
Maybe I should step outside.
INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS
Running down the corridor.
PA ANNOUNCEMENT
Code Blue in Delivery Room 6.
Code
Blue!
The rat GNAWS away at Eugene's power cord, Eugene looks trapped,
helpless, tortured.
His eyes dart from the sparking TV to the gnawed power cord to the
useless call- switch.
Clear walks up and down the corridor, scanning room numbers as she
passes. A -169, A- 171, A-173...
CLEAR
B-187...B-187...
A HAND suddenly GRABS Clear and shoves her against the wall. REVEAL A
SECURITY GUARD leering at her.
SECURITY GUARD
Just where do you think you're
going?
Clear struggles to get away, getting sympathetic looks from an OLD
MAN walking a rolling IV STAND down the corridor.
Isabella is pushing again.
OBSTETRICIAN
Almost there. I see the head...
The NURSE takes a pair of SCISSORS off a tray.
Clear plays possum, offering no resistance to the Security Guard as
the Old Man wheels his IV STAND along.
Suddenly, Clear grabs the stand - and WHAMS the heavy wheeled base
into the Guard's BALLS! As the Guard recoils, she thoughtfully hands
the IV back to the Old Man and runs.
The Nurse is startled when Kimberly and Thomas BURST THROUGH the
door. In the BG, a puzzled Steve peeks inside until Kimberly pulls
the door closed.
NURSE
What are you doing in here?
Get
the hell out! Right now!
Finally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to
swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking
Isabella.
OBSTETRICIAN
Isabella, look down and see your
son.
To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST
INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other.
It's a magical moment --
Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the
delivery room as Clear runs up to them.
CLEAR
A guard grabbed me before I could
find Eugene.
THOMAS
Don't sweat it.
It's over.
CLEAR
She had the baby?
KIMBERLY
New life defeats death. We've done
it. Death has to rewrite the list.
We're safe.
Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the
others.
Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her.
Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision --
HARD CUT TO:
UNKOWN POV
Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined!
THOMAS (O.S.)
Kimberly! Are you okay?!
Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her
trance. Thomas helps her to her feet.
THOMAS
Are you okay? You just face
planted!
KIMBERLY
I know how it feels to be dead.
Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO
SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others
toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE.
CLEAR
What did you see?
KIMBERLY
I was dead. And came back to life.
An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
THOMAS
But it's over. Isabella's baby was
the key. You saw her die and
everything, right?
KIMBERLY
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
THOMAS
Impossible. She was on the onramp.
Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.
CUT TO:
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN
Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly
suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.
Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an
accident.
BACK TO:
Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt.
KIMBERLY
I'm not sure... I don't think
Isabella was ever destined to die
in the pile -up.
THOMAS
Then what's the premonition of the
lake supposed to mean?
CLEAR
Can you remember anything about it?
Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:
Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which
SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.
BLACKNESS.
DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)
Ready and...CLEAR!
The SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life.
KIMBERLY'S POV
Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's
face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian".
It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --
An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same
POV as the premonition.
NURSE
She's back!
DR. KALARJIAN
Five CC's of narcodon. I want her
stabilized and prepped for ICU.
Kimberly turns her head to see
THOMAS
Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking
wet). Thomas doesn't respond.
An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes
his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.
Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS
UPRIGHT.
THOMAS
Kimberly?!
He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved,
he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the
platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.
KIMBERLY
(whispering)
Welcome back. We did it.
For
real.
THOMAS
I know.
I can feel it too.
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood
into the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an
ethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.
They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic
hospital.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
