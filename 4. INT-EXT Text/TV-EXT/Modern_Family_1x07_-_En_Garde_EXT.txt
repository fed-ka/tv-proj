      Luke puts on his glove.*

                Oh yeah, I can already feel it.  This 
                is your sport.

                                LUKE
                Last year you said basketball was my 
                sport.

                                PHIL
                Look, I ve said a lot of things I wish 
                I could take back, but I can t.

                                PHIL (CONT'D)
                What I can do is be the dad you need 
                to help you become... masterful.  Do 
                you want to be masterful? 

                                LUKE
                I guess.

                                PHIL

      Phil squats several feet away. *

                                PHIL (CONT D)
                Okay.  Our journey of ten thousand 
                hours starts with a single pitch.*

      Luke assumes the pitcher s stance.  

                                PHIL (CONT D)
                  I believe in my boy.  Okay, let s burn *
                one in here.

      He winds up and throws a wild pitch well over Phil s head.*

                Good start!*

      Another wild pitch.   *

                                PHIL*

      After three more wild pitches:*

                Okay, good first hour.  Toss me that *
                glove, I ll put some oil on it.*

      The glove goes flying over Phil s head.  *


      Mitchell and Cam walk through the parking lot toward the Gym 
      entrance.  They spot Claire, Alex and Haley approaching from 
      another direction. 

                                CAMERON
                      (re: Claire)
                So, there s no part of you that wants *
                to clear the air with your sister?*

                                MITCHELL
                No.*

                                CAMERON
                Fine, that s your family s way and I ll *
                respect that.  But you should know it s *
                very hard on people who love you.  We *
                feel the tension, we hear the snide *
                words that cut like knives. *

                                CLAIRE*
                Hi guys!  I brought orange slices.*

                Claire, Mitchell still resents you for 
                quitting the figure skating team when 
                you were kids.*

      Mitchell and Claire stare at Cameron.*

                                CLAIRE*
                So, is that what your little jab was *
                about this morning?*

                                MITCHELL
                Okay, I guess I am still a little *
                angry.  You stole my moment.*

                                CLAIRE*
                  Twenty-one years ago.*

                                  MITCHELL*
                It didn t matter to you because you *
                had plenty of your own moments -- 
                  cheerleading, school plays, making out *
                with the quarterback --

                                CLAIRE
                Hey, you made out with him, too.

                                MITCHELL
                But we had to keep it a secret.  You *
                  shouldn t have quit, it was selfish.  *

                                CLAIRE*
                Okay, fine.  You want to know why I *
                quit?  I did it to protect you.

                                MITCHELL
                From what?  Glory?

                                CLAIRE
                Look, I was bigger than you.  I was 
                afraid that you couldn t lift me.  You 
                dropped me a lot at practice.  I 
                didn t want to see you humiliated in 
                front of everyone.  

      Mitchell seems to soften.

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)
                Now can you please just forgive me and 
                move on?

                                MITCHELL
                Of course.

      Mitchell and Claire hug.  During their hug:  

                                MITCHELL (CONT D)
                I m sorry.  I know it probably seems 
                so petty.MODERN FAMILY "En Garde"     9/10/09  Shooting Draft                21.


                                CLAIRE
                Well, a little, but we all have our 
                stuff.  I m just glad you finally got *
                it out of your -- Are you trying to 
                lift me?

      Sure enough, Mitchell has moved from hugging her to trying to 
      lift her.

                                MITCHELL
                        (struggling)
                Well sure, it s harder now, you ve let 
                yourself go.


      Claire runs the last few yards toward Mitchell.  She jumps and 
      he lifts her over his head perfectly.  They beam with pride.  


      Jay, Gloria, Cameron, Haley and Alex exit the gym led by a 
      beaming Manny.  Jay tries in vain to look inconspicuous 
      carrying a giant trophy.

                How about now?

      We PULL OUT to show Mitchell and Claire performing their old 
      routine in the parking lot.  Mitchell has his arm around her 
      waist as they run/glide/spin between the parked cars.

                I guess every parent wants that for 
                their child.  And maybe a little bit 
                for themselves too.   So sometimes we 
                push them too hard.  And that leads to 
                a lot of resentment and guilt.  So, 
                how much is too much?  Here s where I
