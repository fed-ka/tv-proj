    Zoom! A small and shabby van bullets past us and away down a 
    long country lane.

    A beat when all seems to go quiet and then...

    A police traffic pursuit car rockets past in its wake, all 
    lights flashing and the howler sounding, closing the distance 
    between them.


    Looking ahead, driving at speed, everything seen by the 
    headlight beams. Stone walls, overhanging branches, the 
    occasional cluster of dark buildings, but not another car or 
    living soul.


    The van rips past us and away in a dizzying whip-pan and a 
    deafening roar... A second or so of near-silence and then the 
    cruiser rips through the frame in close pursuit.


    A north-country road, high on the brow of a hill with the 
    lights of a valley town spread out in an immense carpet 
    beyond.

    A police city van is coming up the road, and over a radio 
    link we hear:

                                VAN DRIVER
                        (radio)
                  On the Cable Road now.

    We pan with it as it drives by and away.


    POV from the pursuing cruiser... For a moment there s no 
    clear view of the car ahead, but we see a flash of something 
    leaving it.                                                                                    4.




    Here comes the shabby van, hardly slowing for the turn.

    At it takes the corner, the bigger Police Van is arriving at 
    the junction.

    The Police Van brakes sharply and Sanders  vehicle swerves to 
    avoid a head-on collision, leaving the road and ploughing 
    into a ditch.


    Later. A white gatepost is briefly illuminated by slow-moving 
    headlight beams.

    And now we see why. Mike walks at the roadside, scanning the 
    ground with his flashlight. He s backlit by the beams of the 
      cruiser, creeping along behind him at 2 or 3 mph.

    Almost immediately, he spots something. He signals for the 
    cruiser to stop, and then moves in for a closer look.

    ANGLE ON THE VERGE, pushing in... on a small bundle wrapped 
    in medical-grade paper towel. It s about the size of a bag of 
    sugar and secured by a cheap silver chain with a crucifix. 
    Impact has loosened the wrappings.

    Mike crouches, shining his flashlight onto it from all angles 
    and then reaching in to lift a corner.                                                                                     5.



    We don t see what s revealed. But we see Mike s face in the 
    reflected glow of his flashlight beam.

                                MIKE
                  Oh.

    Opening credits.

    Big closeup of Bruno, a senior CID officer. His eyes scan a 
    scene of disturbing awe.

    The scene before Bruno -- we see that we re in a sloping 
      woodland of widely-spaced trees. The ground between the trees 
    has been taped off into areas like an archaeological dig. The 
    ground is peppered with holes like tiny open graves, marked 
    with numbered flags.

    Some have been dug out already. Others are being worked on by 
    forensics officers in cool-looking, properly fitted blue 
    Scene Suits.

    DS Cook is carefully picking his way across the ground 
    towards Bruno, following the marked way.

    At one hole, a small cardboard evidence box is being draped 
    in a black cloth.

    DS Cook reaches Bruno.

                                DS COOK
                  Did you authorise some government 
                  bloke to enter the evidence tent?

    Bruno looks at him sharply... Clearly, he didn t.


      Rachel s by the car, trying to make a call but frustrated by 
    the lack of a signal, as DS Cook approaches.

                                DS COOK
                  So. Special Branch are doing 
                    drivers now?

                                  RACHEL
                  I m not his driver. I m his 
                  bodyguard.

                                DS COOK
                  What does he need a bodyguard for?

                                  RACHEL
                    Somebody bombed his car once. If 
                  you want to make him blush, ask him 
                  where the shrapnel is. And 
                  If that look means you re about to 
                  start taking the piss, save it for 
                  your mates back in Trumpton.

                                DS COOK
                  Don t knock it. If I keep my nose 
                  clean and find enough stolen bikes, 
                  maybe someday I ll get given an old 
                  bloke to look after.

    Red rag to a bull.

                                  RACHEL
                  That  old bloke  is a science 
                    troubleshooter for the government. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    9.

                                  RACHEL (cont'd)
                  And don t think he s in it to make 
                    himself popular. There s at least 
                  one multinational with a dirty-
                  tricks department gunning for him.

                                DS COOK
                          (backing off)
                  Okay.

                                  RACHEL
                  You want to try a week on the road 
                  with him. You d soon change your 
                  tune.

                                DS COOK
                  I said okay.

                                  RACHEL
                        (regaining face)
                  I need a hotel for tonight.

                                DS COOK
                  All the road warriors come straight 
                  off the motorway and into the 
                    Novotel. (beat) It s not far from 
                  my house.

                                  RACHEL
                  That ought to be worth a discount.


    Bruno leads Hood along the access route taped out by Scenes 
    of Crime Officers.

                                HOOD
                  The man you arrested. Is he a 
                    microbiologist or a medical man?

    Bruno thinks this is hilarious.

                                BRUNO
                  Hah.

                                HOOD
                  What s so funny?

                                BRUNO
                  You haven t seen him. He s a 
                  caretaker. Says he s been getting 
                  twenty quid a time to incinerate 
                  the bundles. Once he realised what 
                  they were he couldn t bring himself 
                  to stick  em in the fire.                                                                                  10.



                                HOOD
                  Or give up the twenty quid. Who s 
                  been paying him?

                                BRUNO
                  He won t say a thing now he s 
                    sobered up. We ll see how he feels 
                  after Accessory to Murder.

                                HOOD
                    Technically a foetus is medical 
                  waste. Can that still be murder?

                                BRUNO
                  All right, then. Something under 
                  the abortion act.

                                HOOD
                  Clone foetuses abort themselves. 
                  They nearly always go wrong.

                                BRUNO
                  Well, for God s sake. Then you re 
                    telling me I m wasting my time?

                                HOOD
                  You re not wasting your time. This 
                  isn t about scratching around for 
                    something to pin on a caretaker. 
                  It s bigger than that.

                                BRUNO
                  It can be as big as it likes. I 
                  need a crime and a charge. If I 
                  don t have that, I move on. So what 
                  are you telling me?

                                HOOD
                  That you re looking at evidence of 
                  an attempt at human cloning. 

                                BRUNO
                  And I m Flash Gordon. 

                                HOOD
                  It s the twenty-first century, 
                  Inspector. At least make an effort 
                  to keep up. 

    At one of the graves, something s being lifted out into a 
    waiting box and a cross and chain dropped in after.                                                                                  11.



                                HOOD
                  It s the work of a man who s been 
                    trailing this kind of misery across 
                  half of Europe.

                                BRUNO
                  Fine. Give me a name.

                                HOOD
                  I don t know his name! No-one even 
                  knows what he looks like. When they 
                  get close to him in one country he 
                  moves on to another. He ll keep on 
                  doing more of the same until sheer 
                  chance gives him a live birth.

                                BRUNO
                  Why?

                                HOOD
                  Fame, fortune and a place in 
                    history. And you re looking at  the 
                  cost. If you won t go after him, 
                  get out of the way and I will.


    Rachel waits alone by the car as a very dark-of-brow Hood 
    comes stalking back to her. He talks on the move...

                                HOOD
                  I just about persuaded him to flag 
                  it up with local hospitals. Thirty 
                  babies in thirty graves... You know 
                  what that says to me?

                                  RACHEL
                  I can t even guess.

    Gets straight into the car...

                                HOOD
                  Thirty mothers. How do you keep 
                  them quiet?

    And slams the door.

    Kelly is being helped from the building by Lena Muller, 40s. 
    A tall woman, dark and a bit sinister. One of the staff leads 
    Davy by the hand, another brings Kelly s shopping.

    They cross to where a slightly shabby dark car waits at the 
    kerb with its hazards blinking.

    We can hear Rachel s voice leading sound over the end of the 
    scene.


    Just off the motorway. A big, run-down old cotton mill that s 
    been converted for business units. It s barely a step above 
      dereliction.


      Rachel s sitting behind the wheel in the parked car. Hood s 
      standing beside it to make a personal call.

                                HOOD
                  Hello, Miranda. It s daddy. I 
                  assume you re not there or it s not 
                  convenient to pick up the phone, 
                  so... just to let you know I m in 
                  the area for a while. Give me a 
                  buzz if you feel like it. Usual 
                    number.

    He ends the call and gets into the car.

                                  RACHEL
                  Everything all right?

                                HOOD
                  I assume so. You know what it s 
                  like. She ll be busy.

                                  RACHEL
                  Heads up.

    Sanders is emerging from the building.

                                HOOD
                  Is that the boy?

    Right behind Martin Sanders, and without his awareness, DS 
    Cook steps out of the doorway and points him out in near-
    pantomime fashion.

                                  RACHEL
                  That s the boy.

    She starts the car.

    With Sanders -- he s leaving the police yard when the car 
    brakes to a halt ahead of him and Hood steps out. He opens 
    the car s rear door by way of invitation.                                                                                  20.



                                HOOD
                  Martin Sanders?

    Sanders starts to take a step back, but now Rachel s moved in 
    right behind him.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Who are you?

                                HOOD
                    Professor Alan Hood. Guess what I 
                  want to talk about.

    From his pocket he produces the silver cross and chain and 
    dangles it before Sanders.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                    Where d you get that?

                                HOOD
                  I stole evidence. There. Now you ve 
                  heard my confession. I m ready to 
                  hear yours.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  The magistrate said I can go.

                                HOOD
                  Good for the magistrate. Last 
                  chance to come on board, Martin. 
                  Your own free will.

                                  MARTIN SANDERS
                  Get lost.

    With an air of mild regret, Hood nods to Rachel and sets off 
    around to the other side of the car.

    Sanders suddenly finds that Rachel is crowding him toward the 
    open vehicle door. He s about to protest when she bangs her 
    knee into his thigh in what, in the playground, we would have 
    called a  deadleg . 

      Suddenly it won t take his weight, and she grabs him to 
    steady him.

                                  RACHEL
                  Sorry. Did I do that? Sorry.

    Sanders protests but isn t able to resist as she bundles him 
    into the back of the car...

    Where Hood now waits.                                                                                  21.



    As Rachel goes back around to the driving seat, she catches 
    DS Cook s eye across the yard...

    And winks.


    The converted mill we saw earlier.

    Hood s car comes into the mill yard and stops.


      Rachel s following a designated escape route that exploits 
    the visual possibilities of the building.


    Hayward reaches his car and drops into the driving seat. 
    Something like an old BMW, swish in its day but auction-
    fodder now.

    Not a man of action -- he s flustered and panicking. He 
    fumbles his keys and has to retrieve them from the floorwell.


    Rachel completes the escape route and reaches ground level on 
    a different side of the building.


    Hayward gets his car started and backs out of his parking 
    space in such haste that he clips the next vehicle.

    Then he shifts to forward, but as he sets off...

    Hood stands in the way of his exit. 

    Hayward doesn t slow, but presses hard on the horn.

    On Hood, hand raised in a signal to halt, realising that 
    Hayward intends to do no such thing.

                                HOOD
                  Ah.

    When Rachel suddenly appears, drawing her 9mm Automatic and 
      tracking the car as it heads straight for Hood and it s going 
    to run him down if she can t stop or divert it...

    She s aiming low, and it s BANG! BANG! without success at the 
    tyres before she raises her aim and fires at the car itself.

    On Hayward -- both rear side-windows are blown out as the 
    bullet passes through the car, and Hayward s terrified 
      reaction is to duck and violently jerk the wheel.

    Angle from above -- the swerving car narrowly misses Hood.

    On Hayward -- terrified, but recovering control.                                                                                  29.



    She runs forward. But by the time she reaches Hood, Hayward s 
    around the corner of the building and gone.

    She s incandescent and she doesn t hold back one whit.

                                  RACHEL
                  You stupid old man! What do you 
                  think you were doing?

                                HOOD
                  Me?

                                  RACHEL
                  Do you think my job s a joke?  I m 
                    supposed to keep you safe, and look 
                  how you carry on.

                                HOOD
                  Well, I m sorry, but that s the 
                  last thing I was thinking about.

                                  RACHEL
                  Tell me something I don t know!

    Rachel returns the firearm to its concealed holster and 
    storms toward their car. 


    First we see the back windows of Hayward s car, with sheet 
    plastic taped to replace the shot-out glass.

    Through the plastic, we see something blurry moving.

    And then we shift our point of view to see that it s Lena 
    Muller, hastily deserting their crummy back-streets flat with 
    a couple of suitcases. As she brings them around to the open 
    boot we find Sidney Hayward on his mobile, just putting his 
    own bag in.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Kelly, it s Doctor Hayward. Stay 
                  away from the clinic. We ve had a 
                  bit of an emergency. Has anyone 
                  been to see you?

                                KELLY
                  No. What if I have to call you?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  You can still call me, just don t 
                  go back to the building. Is there a 
                    problem?

                                KELLY
                          (feigning okay-ness)
                  No.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Good. Stay healthy, have this baby -
                  - everyone wins.

    He ends the call.

                                LENA MULLER
                          (scornfully)
                    Everyone wins.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  We should get out now.

                                LENA MULLER
                  And do what? Look at us. Look at 
                  this!

    She points at the plastic covering the car windows.                                                                                  32.



                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  That s what I mean! I was shot at! 
                  It was like the Wild (f*****g) 
                  West!

    He does that thing where you censor yourself but the word 
    leaves a shadow.

                                LENA MULLER
                  And where do you think we re going 
                  to go? You can t even cover a 
                    child s bus fare. If it s going to 
                  be like this then Luciano has to 
                  pay you more!

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Oh, yes. He ll go for that.

                                LENA MULLER
                  It s all right for him. He s miles 
                  away! We re stuck here looking 
                  after the girls and taking all the 
                    chances!

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Well, that s hardly going to be 
                  news to him, is it? As far as he s 
                    concerned it s the whole point of 
                  the setup.

                                LENA MULLER
                  Then start talking up how promising 
                  the new one is. See if that loosens 
                  his wallet.  Cos we ll all be quids-
                  in if one of them beats the odds. 

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  You think that s the answer.

                                LENA
                  Isn t it?

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  If any one of those freaks of 
                  nature ever does draw breath, 
                  that s the day the real trouble 
                    starts.


      Low-rise and fairly modern.                                                                                  45.

      Morning. 

    Hood s car makes the turn in through a gateway and we go with 
    it to see...

    A big house in the stockbroker belt.

                                HOOD
                  He s had a board up.

    We let the car go, and end on an estate agent s board with a 
    SOLD sign.                                                                                  52.



    OMITTED276276


    Hood and Rachel get out of the car. Hood stands looking at 
    the building.

                                  RACHEL
                  What were you hoping to see?

    A man s emerging from the main building. Looks like he d been 
    disturbed from dusty work.

                                HOOD
                  Would you be Mister Gifford?

                                  GIFFORD
                  Who are you?

                                HOOD
                  Alan Hood. You don t know me. Can 
                  we talk inside?

                                  GIFFORD
                  What about?


    Hood and Rachel, walking to the car. 

    Hood looks back. Gifford s watching them from a window.

                                HOOD
                  I made a mess of that.

                                  RACHEL
                  You did.                                                                                  55.



                                HOOD
                  I was so busy looking for the 
                  cloner I hadn t even thought about 
                  the client.

                                  RACHEL
                        (moving closer)
                  Don t stress about it. Look.

    He looks down. She s showing him something, using her body to 
    screen it from Gifford s view.

                                HOOD
                  What s that?

                                  RACHEL
                  A cordless extension. 

                                HOOD
                  I don t get it.

                                  RACHEL
                  The first thing he ll do is make a 
                  panic call.

    They get into the car.


    Hood and Rachel, standing by the car with their heads 
      together listening in. Hood s hand is clamped over the 
      mouthpiece.

                                  GIFFORD (PHONE)
                  Give me one good reason why not.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD (PHONE)
                  We ve got a girl out there with the 
                  most viable foetus yet.


    Hood lowers the phone.

                                  RACHEL
                  Could they be that close?

                                HOOD
                  It s always possible.

      Rachel s looking at the phone.

                                  RACHEL
                  We need to return that.                                                                                  58.



                                HOOD
                  Yes.

    He weighs it in his hand for a moment, and then brings his 
    arm back and chucks it over the hedge like a stick for a dog.

                                  RACHEL
                  Hood!

                                HOOD
                  Don t shout at me. I m pissed-off.

                                  RACHEL
                  What at?

                                HOOD
                  Me! I ve screwed it up.

                                  RACHEL
                  You know Gifford s the client and 
                  now you ve got a name for the 
                    cloner!

                                HOOD
                   Luciano . Pass me the mafia 
                  phonebook.

                                  RACHEL
                  Get in the car.

    She moves to get behind the wheel.


    Sidney Hayward and Lena Muller head down the deck accessway 
    toward...


    Hayward taps on the door, only to find it swings open a few 
    inches.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Kelly? It s Doctor Hayward.                                                                                  60.



    He leads the way, and Lena follows with a guilty glance back 
    to see if they re being observed.


    Gifford s in his Range Rover. It s decent but four or five 
    years old. He s emerging from his driveway when...

    He almost collides with Hayward s car as it makes the turn 
    in. Hayward jumps out, his car blocking the way.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  She needs an emergency c-section 
                  with no questions asked.

    Gifford starts to speak, but Hayward speaks across him.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    Without surgical intervention your 
                  son will be dead before the day s 
                  out, and the host mother with him. 
                  Your choice.                                                                                  61.



                                  GIFFORD
                    Luciano wanted to be there at the 
                  birth.

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  He s on his way. I can fix up the 
                    hospital but you need to front the 
                  cash.

    Gifford glances at the Range Rover.

                                  GIFFORD
                  Give them my number. I ll sort 
                    something out.

    Hayward moves to get back into his car. As he goes around 
    it...

                                  SIDNEY HAYWARD
                  Just one thing. You do know we re 
                    talking viable here. Nobody s 
                    promising perfect.

    He gets in.

    On Gifford -- having to deal with the full implications of 
    that for the first time.

    OMITTED290290


    At the door. Lena Muller opens it, expecting to see 
    Hayward...

    But it s Roly. He s not expecting her, either.

                                ROLY
                  Does Kelly Fox live here?

                                LENA MULLER
                  Sorry.

    Lena flashes him a perfunctory half-smile and moves to close 
    the door.

    He stops it, and shouts past her into the flat.

                                ROLY
                  Kelly! Are you in there?

                                DAVY (O.S.)
                  Dad!

    That s blown it. Roly pushes his way in.

    The door is kicked back to slam in our face.


    Gifford s Range Rover turns in under some bunting and a sign 
    that reads, CARS BOUGHT FOR CASH.


    Later.

    Hood and Rachel approaching on the access deck.

                                HOOD
                  Do I annoy you sometimes, Rachel?

                                  RACHEL
                  Oh, Hood. As if.

                                HOOD
                  That s a yes, really, isn t it?

    She doesn t reply -- she s double-checking numbers on the 
    doors as they pass.

                                HOOD
                  I m going to take that as a yes.                                                                                  64.



                                  RACHEL
                  Is this the one?

    The door s wide open.

    Hood starts forward, but Rachel stops him with a light hand 
    against his chest.

    Makes a finger-against-lips gesture for silence and then 
    points to a spot at a safe distance from the door.

    Hood retreats to it without question. Rachel doesn t take out 
    her gun, but unbuttons for quick access as she goes in.

    We stay with Hood. Watches the door, looks all around.

    Rachel comes out, less tense, taking out her phone.

                                  RACHEL
                  She s not here. The boy s in his 
                    playpen. And there s a man with a 
                  pair of surgical scissors in his 
                  neck.

                                HOOD
                  Dead?

                                  RACHEL
                  Not too happy about it.

    Hood goes in as Rachel speaks into her phone.

                                  RACHEL
                  Ambulance, please.


    An ambulance siren can be heard somewhere in the distance. 
      Rachel s at the rail, watching for it.

    Hood emerges and joins her.

                                HOOD
                  He doesn t know where they took 
                  her. But it looks like we ve got a 
                  baby on the way.

    OMITTED298298


    A white house in neat grounds. Hayward s car stands outside. 
    Lena Muller is waiting by the entrance as an airport taxi 
    pulls up.

    From the taxi steps Luciano, 40s. The understated prosperity 
    of a successful clinician, the looks and charisma of a 
      professional charmer.

    Lena Muller accompanies him into the building.                                                                                  66.




    A rusty low-rent minicab is pulling away from the house, and 
    as it clears our line of sight we see Gifford walking toward 
    the door.


    Hood s car comes tearing down the driveway and halts in front 
    of the entrance.

    Hood jumps out. Right there before him is Hayward s car with 
    its crudely-repaired windows.

    As Hood and Rachel head into the building, Lena Muller is 
    just emerging.

    Without knowing who she is, Hood stops to speak to her. 

                                HOOD
                  Do you know where they put the  
                    teenaged mother who came in today?

                                LENA MULLER
                  I m sorry. I don t work here.

    Hood and Rachel head on in.

    Lena Muller turns her head to watch them. She has the eerie 
    calm of someone who s seen that it s the time to cut and run, 
    and can do so without doubts.

    Taking a breath and settling her shoulders, she turns and 
    walks off up the drive.


    Looking down from the treatment room s first floor window 
    onto the forecourt before the entranceway.

    A black cab stands there with Lena Muller holding the door 
    open. 

    Luciano crosses to it.

    As he s about to get in, he turns and glances up.

    Angle on Hood, looking down from the window.

    Closer on Luciano -- his eyes lock with Hood s and then he 
    turns to get into the cab.

    Angle on Hood -- he vanishes from the window.


    We go with Hood as he races down the corridor, out through 
    the entranceway, and onto the empty forecourt...                                                                                  74.



    Where the cab is long gone.
