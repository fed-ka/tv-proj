      The basement door opens and a dark-clothed HUNTER guides 
      Stiles down the stairs by twisting his arm behind his back.

                                  STILES
                    Ow, ow, ow--

      With a shove, the hunter sends Stiles tumbling down the last 
      steps. Despite his lacrosse pads, he CRASHES painfully to the 
      concrete floor.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Ow.

      The door above slams shut, plunging the room into darkness. 
      Stiles reaches up, trying to feel along the wall when he 
      hears--

      BREATHING.

      He holds still, listening close. The breaths come urgent. 
      Tight, frightened gasps. And it s more than one person.

      Hand on the wall, Stiles pushes himself to his feet. He finds 
      a dark cord and grasps hold of it. He follows it with his 
      fingers up to a switch and--

      A LAMP CLICKS ON.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/124.

      Boyd and Erica sit propped against the wall, bound and 
      gagged. They stare back at Stiles, bloodied and weak, eyes 
      filled with fear, pain and worst of all... hopelessness.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      DEPUTIES finish questioning players while Stilinski talks 
      with Isaac and Scott, both of whom are now changed out of 
      their uniforms. Flipping the pages of his note pad, 
      Stilinski s hands are noticeably shaky.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I have to meet the medical examiner 
                    and figure out what happened with 
                    Jackson, but I ve got an A-P-B out 
                    for Stiles. His Jeep s still in the 
                    parking lot, which means... well, I 
                    don t know what it means. If he 
                    answers his phone or email or if 
                    either of you see him--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/125.

                                  ISAAC
                    We ll call you.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Guys, after everything that s 
                    happened lately...

                                  SCOTT
                    He probably just got freaked out by 
                    the attention or something. We ll 
                    find him.

      Stilinski nods, but doesn t look encouraged. He motions for 
      his men to follow and the locker room begins clearing out.

      An unusually distraught Coach approaches Scott. He can t seem 
      to stop turning his whistle over and over with his fingers.

                                  COACH
                    McCall, we need you on the team, 
                    okay? You know I can t put you back 
                    on the field next season unless 
                    your grades are up. 

                                  SCOTT
                    I know, Coach.

                                  COACH
                    I mean I yell and scream a lot but 
                    it s not like I hate you guys. 
                    Well, I kind of hate Greenberg, but 
                    that s different. I m just saying 
                    we need you. Get your grades up, 
                    okay? Get back on the team.

                                  SCOTT
                    I will.

      Still gripping the whistle, Coach heads for the door. Isaac 
      and Scott anxiously wait for his FOOTSTEPS to fade.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Is that everyone?

                                  ISAAC
                    I think so--

      The sound of METAL RIPPING off hinges turns Isaac around. A 
      locker door CLATTERS to the floor as Scott rifles through the 
      inside, pulling out one of Stiles s SHIRTS.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    You re going to find him by scent?          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/126.

                    We both are. Here, smell this...

      Scott holds out one of Stiles s SHOES.

                                  ISAAC
                    Why do you get his shirt and I get 
                    a shoe?

      But Scott doesn t answer. Past Isaac, Derek stands at the 
      other end of the room.

                                  DEREK
                    We need to talk.

      Peter rounds the corner of the locker cages.

                                  PETER
                    All of us.

                                  SCOTT
                    Holy shhhh---


      Stiles holds a finger to his lips.

                                  STILES
                    Shhhhh.

      But as he reaches for the BLACK BINDINGS around Erica s 
      hands, both she and Boyd continue making muffled protests 
      beneath their gags.

      Stiles grabs the binding and--A BLUE SPARK OF ELECTRICITY 
      LIGHTS the room. Stiles leaps up, snatching his hand away 
      with a YELP.

                                  GERARD (O.S.)
                    They were trying to warn you it s 
                      electrified.

      Gerard casually steps down the stairs into the basement.

                                  STILES
                    What are you doing with them?

                                  GERARD
                    At the moment, just keeping them 
                      comfortable. There s no point in 
                    torturing them. They won t give 
                    Derek up. The instinct to protect 
                    their Alpha is too strong.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/127.

                                  STILES
                    Okay... What are you going to do 
                    with me?

                                  GERARD
                    I m not going to kill you if that s 
                    what you re thinking.

                                  STILES
                    Good. Because Scott can find me. He 
                    knows my scent. It s pungent. It s 
                    more like a stench. He could find 
                    me even if I was buried at the 
                    bottom of a sewer, covered in fecal 
                    matter, urine and pure human filth.

                                  GERARD
                    You have a knack for creating a 
                    vivid picture, Mr. Stilinski. Let 
                    me paint one of my own. Scott 
                    McCall finds his best friend 
                    bloodied and beaten to a pulp. 
                    How s that sound?

                                  STILES
                    I d kind of prefer a nice still 
                    life or landscape.

      Gerard closes the distance between them.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    All right, what are you? Ninety? I 
                    bet I could kick your ass up and 
                    down this room--

      Gerard STRIKES him. Fast and shockingly brutal, the blow 
      sends Stiles to the floor.

      Boyd and Erica watch helplessly as Stiles turns to look up. 
      With almost a look of pity, Gerard grabs Stiles by his 
      lacrosse shirt and drags him up.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Okay, wait, wait--

      But Gerard strikes him again. And again.

      FADE IN:


      Isaac behind him, Scott keeps a cautious gaze on Peter and 
      Derek at the other end of the locker room.

                    You know, I thought the same thing 
                    when I saw you talking to Gerard at 
                    the Sheriff s Station.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, hold on. He threatened to 
                    kill my mom. And I needed to get 
                    close to him. What was I supposed 
                    to do?

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek s uncle. A little while back, 
                    he tried to kill all of us so we 
                    set him on fire and Derek slashed 
                    his throat.

                                  ISAAC

                                  DEREK
                    The short version is he knows how 
                    to stop Jackson. And maybe how to 
                    save him.

                                  ISAAC
                    That should really help now. Since 
                    he s dead.

                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Jackson s dead. It happened on the 
                    field.

                    And it looks like he did it

      Derek and Peter share a look. Neither seem relieved.

                    Why s nobody taking this as good

                    Because if Jackson s dead, there s 
                    no way it just happened. Gerard 
                    wanted it to happen.

                                  DEREK
                    But why?

                    of opportunity is closing. Quickly.


      Outside the hall, Argent reaches to knock at the open door 
      when he sees Gerard and Allison inside, talking quietly. 
      Noticing his son, Gerard gives a smile and whispers one last 
      thing into Allison s ear.

      As he turns, Argent moves just slightly enough to block his 
      way out the door.

      Argent lets him move past. Now alone with Allison, he 
      approaches, watching her unload the crossbow, darts and her 
      ring knife.

                    are.

      Allison heads to the closet to change out of her clothes.

                    I m tired and all I want to do is 
                    pass out, okay?

                    Don t forget. You owe me a new bow.

      A LOUD SNAPPING SOUND turns her head.

                                  ARGENT
                    And a new crossbow.

      Allison s knife in hand, he s used it to sever the weapon s 
      string. He sets the broken crossbow down on her desk. 

      With Allison s furious gaze on his back, Argent strides out 
      of the room.


      A curtain yanks aside to reveal a BODY BAG lying on a gurney 
      in the dark room. Melissa throws a quick glance behind her to 
      make sure she s alone and then cautiously approaches.

      A CLEAR DROP of what appears to be the Kanima s VENOM seeps 
      from the edge of the BODY BAG and down off the gurney to 
      collect in a thick puddle on the floor.

      Kneeling down, Melissa hesitantly dabs the tip of a pen at 
      the venom. Strangely, it appears to be hardening. 
        Solidifying.

      Rising, Melissa reaches for the zipper of the body bag. Then *
      pauses, hand hovering.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1212.

      Phone to his ear, Stilinski rifles through the mess of his 
      son s room.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Yeah, I m not finding any kind of

      Stilinski is on him immediately, turning his face left and

      Stilinski quiets under the desperate plea from Stiles who 
      appears more emotionally than physically beaten. Pushing 
      aside his anger, Stilinski gently pulls his son into his 
      arms.


      A PHONE BUZZES. Scott yanks it out of his pocket and breathes 
      in relief at the text message.

      Derek and Isaac glance back only for a moment while Peter 
      approaches the staircase.

                    But you didn t look here.

      Fingers reaching carefully along the base of one of the wood 
      steps, Peter snaps up a panel, freeing it.

      While Derek, Isaac and Scott look on, Peter reaches inside 
      the staircase, feeling for something hidden underneath the 
      steps. He pulls out a large and dusty LEATHER CASE.

                                  DEREK

      Scott s PHONE BUZZES again and he pulls it out of his pocket

                    Mom, I can t talk right now.

                    yourself.

      She turns back to view the now open body bag. 

      Inside, Jackson lies almost entirely encased in VENOM seeping 
      from his CLAWS. Transparent and hardening, it appears to be 
      forming some kind of protective shell around him. Almost 
      like... a COCOON.

      Head buried under his pillow, Stiles rolls over when he hears 
      a KNOCK at his door.

                                  STILES
                    Dad, I said I m fine.

      But the KNOCK comes again. Dragging himself out of bed, 
      Stiles swings the door open to reveal Lydia standing outside 
      his room.

                                  LYDIA

      She nods to his lip and cheek.

                    Oh, nothing. Don t worry about it. 
                    I m fine. Totally fine. How are you 
                    doing?

      She meets his eyes and now he notices just how utterly 
      distraught she is.

                                  LYDIA
                    They won t let me see him. I was 
                    supposed to give him something. He 
                    kept asking for it back.

      She opens her hand to reveal she s holding Jackson s HOUSE 
      KEY still attached to a necklace chain. She looks up, tears 
      filling her eyes again.

      All three lean in for a closer look at the chrysalis rapidly 
      forming over Jackson s body. Lying perfectly still, Jackson 
      doesn t move. Doesn t even breathe. Until--

      His head SHUDDERS violently. Everyone SCREAMS, jumping back. 
      A strange GURGLING emanates from inside the bag. A wet 
      wheezing sound.

                    Okay, okay--

      Melissa yanks the zipper but it gets stuck. Jackson s mouth 
      begins to open, revealing the Kanima s FANGS.

                    Mom, zip. Zip, Mom, zip--

      Finally she yanks it closed. In the silence, the three of

      As Jackson s claws begin to push up at the body bag from 
      inside, Derek s VOICE hammers at Scott.

      Gerard s eyes SNAP open. Head resting on a pillow in bed, he 
      stares at the ceiling as if seeing something faraway. When he 
      blinks-- 


      A LIGHT clicks on. Allison looks up from her bed to see 
      Gerard at the door.

      Argent yanks his gun from its holster, FIRING round after 
      round at the Kanima as it springs up. The creature takes a 
      hit, but manages to slip around the SUV.

      Clip dropping to the pavement, Argent reloads and BLOWS THE 
      WINDOWS out of the SUV, trying to hit the creature.

      Gerard watches, almost amused.

      Before Argent can pull the trigger again, the Kanima s tail 
      snakes out, WRAPPING around the barrel of the gun. A second 
      later the weapon flies into the air and--

      Argent goes down, knocked across the pavement.

      The Kanima spins around to face Derek, back on his feet and 
      now a full werewolf. His SNARL of RAGE is joined by two 
      others--

      Scott and Isaac. Also transformed.

      The three wolves circle the Kanima. One after another they 
      launch their attack. Vicious bites, claws raking across 
      scaled skin. 

      But they re far out-matched.

                                  GERARD
                    What...

      Derek s eyes widen as Gerard coughs, BLACK BLOOD appearing at 
      his lips.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    What is this? What did you do?

                                  SCOTT
                    Everyone kept telling me Gerard 
                    always has a plan. Well...

      Scott raises his eyes to reveal a now confident, even 
      triumphant gaze.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I had a plan too.

      Gerard yanks his SILVER PILL BOX from his pocket.

                                  GERARD
                    No... no...

      He pours several capsules into his hand, some spilling to the 
      floor around him--


      Scott holds out Gerard s pill box.

                                  SCOTT
                    You dropped this.


      BLACK BLOOD now running from his nose, Gerard raises a 
      handful of the CAPSULES and crushes them in his hand. The 
      capsules burst into a puff of GRAY ASH--

                                  GERARD
                    Mountain ash.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1233.



      With Scott by his side, Deaton pours the gray ash from the 
      bottle marked with the ROWAN symbol into the CAPSULE FILLING 
      MACHINE, carefully filling a dozen of Gerard s pills.


      Scott steps back as Gerard sinks to his knees, lurching in 
      agony. Black blood pours from his nose, from his tear ducts, 
      ears, even around his fingernails. Spilling to the floor as--

      Head thrown back, Gerard SHRIEKS in pain as he spits up a 
      streaming fountain of BLACK BLOOD.

      The others retreat in terror, scrambling away from the 
      macabre display.

      Only Scott watches unblinking, knowing and expecting the 
      effect. Derek peers at him with a mixture of shock and most 
      surprisingly, respect.

                                  DEREK
                    Why didn t you tell me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because you might be an Alpha. But 
                    you re not mine.

      He steps forward as if to help Gerard up. But with the blood 
      still dripping from his lips, the senior Argent raises his 
      hate-filled eyes and looks to the Kanima.

                                  GERARD
                    Kill them.

      Veins pulling taut at his neck, he shouts with every last bit 
      of strength he has.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Kill them all!

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT FIVE          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1234.


                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Gerard collapses down as just a few feet away--Allison wrests 
      the Kanima s hand free from her neck and pushes off. But with 
      its other claw, the creature sends her sprawling. 

      It whirls about to face Scott for the attack when--

      The roar of a VEHICLE S ENGINE fills the warehouse. The 
      Kanima spins at the sound of BRAKES SQUEALING and HURTLES 
      BACK, tossed right off its feet by--

      A blue Jeep.

      Eyes squeezed shut, Stiles looks up from the wheel and turns 
      to the others.

                                  STILES
                    Did I get him?

      Scott almost laughs. But then the Kanima LEAPS onto the hood 
      of the Jeep hand swinging a clawed hand up with a shriek.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson!

      The creature pauses, blinking in confusion. The passenger 
      side door of the Jeep creaks open and Lydia steps out. Lit by 
      the headlights of the SUV she almost glows in the darkness.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Jackson?

      Her hands come up. The Kanima pulls back as if to strike her 
      down. But then she opens her hand to show what s held in her 
      palm...

      Jackson s key.

      The creature blinks as it looks on the key and--


      Lips parting from a deep kiss, Jackson and Lydia lie back in 
      his bed. She tries to curl up next to him but he reaches for 
      something on the night table.

      He turns back to her with the HOUSE KEY in his hand.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1235.

      CONTINUED:3535

                                    JACKSON
                    Here. It s for the front door.

                                  LYDIA
                    A key to the house? Already?

                                    JACKSON
                    What? It s not a wedding ring.

                                  LYDIA
                    So you re just making me a more 
                      accessible late night booty call?

                                    JACKSON
                    Late night. Late morning. Late 
                      afternoon.

      She laughs, now able to curl up against him. Pressing the key 
      into her palm, she allows herself a smile. Unseen behind her, 
      the look in Jackson s eyes is the same.

      Neither willing to say it or let the other see it, they re 
      both, nevertheless, perfectly and utterly in love.


      The Kanima's eyes blink back to HUMAN EYES, the eyes of 
      Jackson, now half transformed again.

      Lydia gives him one last look of regret, as if knowing what s 
      about to happen.

      Jackson slowly turns to face Derek who is now standing once 
      again. Jackson lowers his clawed hands, lowering his 
      defenses. Purposefully making himself vulnerable to attack.

      Derek grabs the moment and strikes, DIGGING his claws into 
      Jackson s ribcage.

      Seeing his chance, Peter rushes out and guts Jackson from the 
      back. As the wolf hands tear back, Jackson staggers forward 
      and--

      Lydia takes hold of him before he can fall. Struggling to 
      keep him up, she slowly guides him to his knees.

      Red blood--human blood--on his torso, Jackson looks on her 
      with his own eyes, seeming to recognize her. Then he whispers 
      a question.

                                    JACKSON
                    Do you... still...          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1236.

      CONTINUED:3636

      He can't seem to find the strength or breath to finish. 
      Lydia, however, knows what he was asking.

                                  LYDIA
                    I do. I still love you.

      Finally, Jackson s eyes close and his head gently rests on 
      her shoulder.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I still love you.

      The others watch silently as she holds Jackson there. Only 
      when his hand opens and releases the key to the ground does 
      she finally let him lie.

      As gently as he can, Stiles takes Lydia s arm and helps her 
      up. She turns into him, trying to find comfort in his arms.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Gerard?

      Argent looks over. The others follow Allison s eyes to a pool 
      of black blood and the faint trace of footsteps. He s gone. 

                                  ARGENT
                    I doubt he s far.

      Now human, Derek helps Isaac back to his feet. Finally, they 
      begin moving, an exhausted group of people turning to go.

      But then the SOUND OF CLAWS scratching cement catches their 
      attention. Lydia turns first to see--

      Jackson s hands moving. Claws at his fingertips, they scratch 
      at the pavement as life begins to tremble its way back into 
      his body, wounds already beginning to heal on his torso.

      Head lifting up, he sucks in a breath as if coming up for air 
      after diving into water.

      Scott, Derek and Peter brace themselves for a new attack. But 
      something different happens.

      When Jackson opens his eyes, they begin to glow. No longer 
      slitted and reptilian, they burn an intense BLUE. His mouth 
      draws open to reveal FANGS growing. Not two rows, but pairs 
      of uppers and lowers.

      As he pushes up to his knees, strands of hair appear at his 
      cheeks, growing toward the ears which now taper out to 
      points.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1237.

      CONTINUED:3636

      With the others watching in silent awe, Jackson finally 
      stands. And finally becomes... a WEREWOLF.

      A PRIMAL ROAR fills the metal works as Jackson cries out at 
      the night like a bird spreading its wings for the first time.

      His eyes dim back to normal, claws retracting. He lowers his 
      head and breathlessly looks to the others. Somehow alive. 
      They stare back at him, incredulous.

      Finally Lydia runs into his arms. Scott and the others 
      breathe in relief. Except for Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                  STILES
                    He scratched my Jeep.


      The first whisper of sunrise begins to spill into Allison s 
      room. Fingers intertwined, she and Scott sit on the edge of 
      her bed in silence.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m sorry.

                                  SCOTT
                    You don t have to say sorry.

                                    ALLISON
                    I do. I have to. For what I did 
                    What I said. For everything. And 
                      especially for what I have to do 
                    now.

      Disentangling her fingers from his, she looks into his eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay.

                                    ALLISON
                    No, it s not.

                                  SCOTT
                    It is.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott, I m trying to break up with 
                    you.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1238.

      CONTINUED:3737

                                  SCOTT
                    I know. And it s okay.

                                    ALLISON
                    How is that okay?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because I can wait.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m not making you wait for me. I 
                    can t do that.

                                  SCOTT
                    You don t have to. Because I know 
                    we re going to be together. We re 
                    meant to be together.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott...

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay.

      She looks in his eyes, finding no trace of uncertainty.

                                    ALLISON
                    There s no such thing as fate.

                                  SCOTT
                          (with a smile)
                    There s no such thing as 
                      werewolves.

      Tears slipping down her cheeks, Allison actually breathes a 
      small laugh. Scott gently brushes her tears away and then 
      presses his lips softly to hers. A short, but sweet kiss. 
      Allison breaks it, pulling back and opening her eyes to look 
      at him.

      Finally, Scott rises from the bed and turns for the door 
      where he sees Argent waiting. 

      As he passes by, Allison s father gives him the slightest of 
      nods. The closest to a thank you Argent can manage at the 
      moment.

      Scott gives a last look back to watch Argent sit next to 
      Allison on the edge of the bed. He puts his arm around her 
      and she gently rests his head on his shoulder, glancing up to 
      find the doorway empty. 

      Scott is gone.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1239.
