Dale gets smaller and smaller.
IK DALE'S HAND
The Polaroid picture becomes clear of Kirbo and Dale.
MIRROR
She is smaller and smaller.
KIRBO
A kind of win fills his senses.
Wendy rushes into the street crying.

(LATE NOVEMBER)

SHOTS of lunchtime in D.C.: Clerks, pages, government
employees of all description leave work and venture
forth for the lunch ritual.
Wendy leaves the Welfare office and hurries down the
street. She comes to the window of a modest coffee shop
and looks inside. Her father is waiting for her.
AFTERNOON
Dealing with her emotions, she drives Jules' Jeep through
the Georgetown streets. The back of the Jeep is filled
with her clothes, etc.
Kevin is waiting on the doorstep with flowers, champagne,
and a stack of newspapers.

As Leslie pulls up, he greets her by pressing a newspaper
against the windshield. After a moment, she focuses on
a small article entitled: "THE MEANING OF LIFE"; OBSER-
VATIONS BY KEVIN DOLENZ.
LESLIE
You did it!!!
Down below Jules jumps into a small dark Mercedes, helped
by a slightly nefarious-looking hunk. They wave to
Leslie.

Who's that?

LESLIE
Jules' boss and lover...
International banking seems to
be getting sexier.
KEVIN
Speaking of which...
As she closes the window, Kevin attacks her again.
LESLIE
Kevin, I've been thinking.
KEVIN
Me, too, and I don't like to count
my cornish hens before they hatch,
but I do think I'll be getting a
raise. And I was thinking we
could get a place together.
LESLIE
Kevin.
KEVIN
I know it's fast. But I also know
I love you.
LESLIE
I don't think you do love me.
KEVIN
What?
LESLIE
I mean we love each other as
friends. But... Kevin, you were
sitting on all these incredible
feelings... all tied up in that
box with my pictures in desperate
need of a love affair. And me...
well, I needed to break the Alec
habit... and it's only natural I
would turn to you in my confusion.
But this doesn't feel real. It
feels manufactured.
KEVIN
It's me, isn't it?
LESLIE
Are you kidding? You're a little
 miracle.
(CONTINUED)
101.
150 CONTINUED: (2) 150
KEVIN
But not a big miracle like Alec.
LESLIE
Oh, Alec was the big miracle for
a long time... But I think I'd
like to try life without any
miracles for a while.
Kevin realizes how serious Leslie is.
KEVIN
Well, having your first byline,
and losing the love of your life
in the same night has a certain
'The Gods must be laughing at
me' feeling.
LESLIE
I'm not the love of your life.
KEVIN
Who says?
LESLIE
I say.
KEVIN
But you're a girl, what do you
know?
Leslie embraces him with deep friendship.
Kevin and Kirbo walk away from the theater advertising
the "WOODY ALLEN FESTIVAL."
KI RBO
I don't think I need the eggs
anymore. Dale Biberman gave me
enough cholesterol for a lifetime.
You were right all along... Love
stinks.
KEVIN
I've had second thoughts. Intimacy
is dangerous and shattering... but
ultimately necessary.
KIRBO
But, Kevin, I used to wait outside
her house,. ring the bell and then
when she'd come to the window I'd
run away. Just to get a glimpse
of her.
KEVIN
The night Leslie gave me the kiss-
off, I fucked a black hooker three
times.
KIRBO
Not Naomi, from our corner?
KEVIN
Naomi from our corner.
KIRBO
I think you better go to the
doctor and get some shots.
KEVIN
I used a rubber. She put it on
me with her mouth.

They stop as they reach St. Elmo's. Looking inside, they
see Alec at his usual table.
103.
KI RBO
I always thought we'd be friends
forever.
KEVIN
Forever got a lot shorter suddenly.
They move on, passing a sign on the door: "WAITER
WARTED." Kevin points to it.
KIRBO
No, as soon as I get back in
school, I'm going to work part-
time for a law firm. Did you know
there are as many people in law
school as there are practicing
lawyers?
KEVIN
Sounds familiar.
KIRBO
How'd she put the rubber on with
her mouth?
Alec, Kevin and Kirbo climb up the fire escape. They
arrive at the second floor to find burglar proof grill-
work locked in place, but the windows are still wide open.
ALEC
Jules, what are you doing? You'll
freeze...
He stops.
KEVI N
To death. Exactly!
The three young men start tearing at the bars frantically.
Alec, Kevin and Kirbo cannot budge the bars.
KEVIN
The whole country is.falling apart,
but these five bars are made
perfectly.
ALEC
We need something that cuts
through metal.
KEVIN
Or an experienced thief.
KIRBO
I'll find Billy.
Kirbo dashes down the fire escape.
KEVIN
I was kidding.
(CONTINUED)
166 CONTINUED:
KIRBO
Billy's working at the big Chevron
station on Michigan. He must have
a hacksaw or something...
Kirbo takes off on his bike as Alec looks at Kevin.
ALEC
Billy is working in a gas
station???
KEVIN
He needed the money.
Suddenly, Alec and Kevin become aware that they are
alone.
ALEC
I saw your article.
KEVIN
Yeah, well, yesterday's editorial
achievement is today's garbage
wrapper, right...?
Kevin tries to laugh charmingly. Alec tries to laugh
along with him, but suddenly rage returns.
ALEC
You little shit!!!
He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is
so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the
fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs
upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of
scraps of paper fall from his pocket.
Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees
them.
LESLIE
Alec, no!!!
Kevin, still hanging upside down, tries to hang on to
Alec. Papers continue to fly.
KEVIN
My notes!
ALEC
You won't need any more notes on
the meaning of life.
KEVIN
(upside-down,
STRAINING)
I'm kinda betting on you not doing
it, Al... think of your political
career.
Leslie runs into the alley underneath them.
LESLIE
Alec, stop Iit!
She frantically starts climbing the fire escape.
LESLIE
Alec!!!
BACK TO ALEC AND KEVIN
ALEC
After all I've done for you.
KEVIN
I feel I've done a lot for you,
too, Al... so pull me up and we'll
call it even.
ALEC
What you did for me was take the
woman I was going to marry.
The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto
their landing. She struggles with Alec.
LESLIE
Alec, stop it right now!
Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow
truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with
an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.
BILLY
Looks pretty ultimate up there...
168 CONTINUED:
He helps Kirbo, who is struggling with a two-wheeler
dolly holding a large tank of oxygen and acetylene.
LESLIE, ALEC AND KEVIN
KEVIN
You think this is helping Jules?
With Kevin's life still in his hands, he suddenly
remembers Jules.
He slowly pulls Kevin onto the fire escape.
LESLIE
Are you all right?
Kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with
Billy.
KIRBO
Hey! Help.
Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec
and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her
hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.
LESLIE
Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's
so cold.
ALEC
Very noble how you ran up here to
save your lover.
LESLIE
He's not my lover. Jules, listen...
ALEC
Bullshit.
LESLIE
I have never lied to you once
since the day I met you... you
cocky shithead.
(CONTINUED)
110.
170 CONTINUED: 170
Alec knows it's the truth.
LESLIE
Hang on, Jules. We all love you.
She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands,
but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her
hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her
hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath
onto them. Much emotion passes between them.
LESLIE
Your breath, your breath is so
sweet.
ALEC.
Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so
profoundly sorry.
Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley.
KIRBO
Blowtorch, anyone?
ALEC
Give it to me.
KEVIN
Do not hand him a blowtorch!
Kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars. SPARKS and
fire fly. Suddenly there is a PHENOMENAL POUNDING from
inside the apartment at Jules' front door. It stops
everyone on the fire escape.
Billy pounds on the door as Ron watches nervously.
BILLY
(FRIENDLY)
Jules, it's Billy. Open the door.
(NO REPLY)
Okay, Jules... Open up the goddamn
door, or I'm coming right through
it.
No reply. Billy spots a large metal fire extinguisher at
the end of the hall.

178 CONTINUED: 178
LESLIE
You want some coffee, Ron?
Ron enters tentatively and joins them as JULES and BILLY
start SHOUTING and LAUGHING LOUDER.
RON
You know, until today I thought
gay people were nuts.
A large bus pulls out as Leslie stands at a coffee
vending machine. Alec approaches.
ALEC
Need someone to blow on your hands?
She smiles, but shows him her gloves. As she searches
for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his
own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he
talks.
ALEC
Did you know that I.always wanted
to make you coffee? I tried once
-- when you were in the shower --
but it didn't turn out right, so I
threw it out and cleaned everything
up so you wouldn't know. I don't
like doing things I'm not good at
-- like making coffee and saying
I'm sorry...
He looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup
from the machine.
ALEC
Leslie, I'm sorry.
They exchange a tender glance, and then Leslie takes a
sip from the steaming cup.
LESLIE
Alec, this is soup.
ALEC
What?
LESLIE
This is soup.
Alec's nervousness turns to embarrassment as they both
start to laugh. Old feelings surge.
LESLIE
I love you.
They look at each other for a moment.
LESLIE
We need time.
ALEC
I know.

Kirbo comes running over.
KI RBO
The bus is leaving.
Alec and Leslie Join him and they quickly move to where
Jules. Kevin and Wendy are saying goodbye to Billy who
has his suitcase and sax. A bus waits.
JULES
'Bye, baby.
She hugs him expansively. Billy next kisses Leslie and
shakes hands with the guys at the same time. Wendy waits
until last and then they embrace emotionally.

She whispers into his ear.
WENDY
Go ultimate.
Billy smiles at her as she fights tears.
BILLY
I'll keep in touch.
WENDY
(LAUGHING)
No, you won't.
He wants to say more to all of them, but the bus is wait-
ing and he hops on it. The door closes and the bus backs
out of the terminal. Billy stands near the driver and
waves out at them.
HIS FRIENDS
watch him pull away.
BUS
As it pulls backward, we can see Billy with his friend's
reflections on the bus's windshield SUPERIMPOSED OVER his.
The bus's headlights flare INTO the CAMERA. The images of
all of them mix with the white, hot GLARE SUPERIMPOSED
OVER this, for a brief second we see IMAGES of them all
from past, from school, from St. Elmo's, ,etc.
The SCREEN GOES totally WHITE with incandescent
brilliance as we --
`Alec, Leslie, Kevin, Krbo, Wendy and Jules walk together
slowly.
WIDER SHOT
Coming upon St. F'1mo's, they stop. Looking,in the
window...

They see their old tables filled with younger students,
led by Claton, the undergrad.
