                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROAD/INT. BUS - DAY11

      LIGHTNING ripples silently through the clouds above a traffic 
      filled road. Leaning over the steering wheel, the BUS DRIVER 
      peers up at the darkening skies ahead.

      Coach looks over her shoulder, whistle hanging from his lips. 
      He breathes a low grumble of displeasure at the storm. Until 
      something catches his eye in the rear view mirror.

      A BLAST OF THE WHISTLE startles a teenager standing to talk 
      to a girl in the seat behind him. 

                                  COACH
                    Sit down.

      The teen drops back, revealing a bus filled with the Cross 
      Country team. Some study, some text, others sleep. In one 
      seat, Isaac and Boyd exchange tense whispers.

                                  ISAAC
                    Stop thinking about it.

                                  BOYD
                    Like you re not thinking about it 
                    too?

                                  ISAAC
                    Okay, we both stop thinking about 
                    it.

                                  BOYD
                    I can t.

                                  ISAAC
                    Yeah, well, you can t do anything 
                    about it either.

                                  BOYD
                    You sure about that?

      He nods to a row behind them where Ethan sits, checking his 
      PHONE for a message. Beside him, Danny watches Ethan push the 
      phone back into his pocket with a frustrated breath.                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/132.

        CONTINUED:11

                                  DANNY
                    You okay?

                                  ETHAN
                    Yeah, why?

                                  DANNY
                    That s like the third time you ve 
                    checked your phone in five minutes.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just waiting for a message.

                                  DANNY
                    Anything important?

                                  ETHAN
                    No. Nothing.

      His tone belies his words, however. Turning, he gazes 
        surreptitiously down the aisle to Scott and Stiles sitting in 
      one of the back seats.

      While Stiles taps a finger over his tablet, Scott leans his 
      head against the window, heavy eyelids beginning to close.

      INT. ABANDONED MALL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK22

      GLOWING YELLOW EYES SNAP OPEN. Shifted into werewolf form, 
      Scott turns, letting loose a defiant SNARL as--*

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Hey, you still with me?

      INT. BUS - DAY33

      Blinking back to the present, Scott turns to Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, sorry. What was the word?

      Stiles looks down at a VOCABULARY APP on his TABLET.

                                  STILES
                      Anachronism.

                                  SCOTT
                    Something that exists out of its 
                    normal time.

                                  STILES
                    Nice. Next word: Incongruous.                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/133.

        CONTINUED:33

                                  SCOTT
                    Um... can you use it in a sentence?

                                  STILES
                    Sure. It s completely incongruous 
                    for us to be on this stupid bus 
                    headed to some useless cross 
                    country meet after what just 
                    happened.

                                  SCOTT
                    Out of place. Ridiculous. Absurd.

                                  STILES
                    Perfect. Next word: Darach.
                          (off Scott s look)
                    We gotta  talk about it sometime. 
                    And we re going to be here for the 
                    next five frigging hours.

      But Scott turns to the window and the passing landscape.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Fine. Next word: Intransigent.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stubborn, obstinate--

      The bus hits a BUMP and Scott sits up with a GASP.

                                  STILES
                    You okay?

      He nods, but with a pained expression.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    We shouldn t have come.

                                  SCOTT
                    We had to. There s safety in 
                    numbers.

                                  STILES
                    There s also death in numbers. They 
                    call it a massacre.
                          (reading from the tablet)
                      Bloodbath, carnage, slaughter...

      He trails off when he notices Scott barely listening, chest 
      rising with labored breaths.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I m getting Coach to stop the bus.                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/134.

        CONTINUED:33

                                  SCOTT
                    No, I m all right.

                                  STILES
                    You don t look all right.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ll be fine by the time we get to 
                    the meet.

                                  STILES
                    Let me take a look at it.

      He reaches for the hem of Scott s shirt, but he puts a hand 
      over it.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m okay.

                                  STILES
                    If you re okay, then stop being so 
                      intransigent and let me see it.

      With a reluctant nod, Scott lifts his shirt to reveal SLASH 
      MARKS CRUSTED IN BLOOD all over his torso. DARK BRUISES 
      surround each painful-looking wound. 

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Dude...

                                  SCOTT
                    I know it looks bad, but it s 
                    because they re from an Alpha. 
                    It ll take longer to heal.

                                  STILES
                    Then how come Boyd and Isaac are 
                    fine?

      They glance over the edge of the seat to see Boyd and Isaac 
      peering back at them. With no answer, Scott returns his weary 
      gaze to the window and the world blurring past.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can t believe he s dead. I can t 
                    believe Derek s dead.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/135.


      INT. ALLISON S CAR - DAY44

      The reflection of the SCHOOL BUS shimmers across the 
      windshield of Allison s car while she tries to keep a 
      stealthy distance behind it.

                                    ALLISON
                    You think I m getting too close? 
                    I m getting too close, aren t I?

                                  LYDIA
                    That depends. Are you just 
                    following the bus? Or are you 
                    planning to mount it at some point?

                                    ALLISON
                    So I should back off?

                                  LYDIA
                    That also depends. Do you mean the 
                    bus? Or the ex-boyfriend you re 
                    currently stalking?

                                    ALLISON
                    After what happened, I m not 
                    letting him out of my sight. And by 
                    the way, this started when he came 
                    knocking on my door.

                                  LYDIA
                    For what?

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    This...

      INT. ARGENT APARTMENT/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK55

      Scott holds up an ARROWHEAD attached to a broken shaft.

                                  SCOTT
                    I found it outside the school. 
                    Right where Isaac got Boyd and Cora 
                    to turn back.

                                    ALLISON
                    How do you know it s not from the 
                    archery team?

                                  SCOTT
                    We don t have an archery team.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh.                  TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/136.

        CONTINUED:55

                                  SCOTT
                    And if we did they probably 
                    wouldn t use military grade armor-
                    piercing titanium arrowheads. I 
                    looked it up.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe it s one of my father s.

                                  SCOTT
                    I thought you guys had some kind of 
                    agreement that you both stay out of 
                    all of this.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is that what you want to tell me? 
                    To stay out of it?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. And I m not saying you were 
                      definitely there. I m just saying 
                    if you were it probably wouldn t be 
                    a good idea. If you were there.

      He gently sets the arrowhead on her desk.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can take care of myself.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know. But these guys--if you 
                    didn t notice, they re pretty 
                      terrifying. And they ve got some 
                    serious advantages. Like super-
                    human strength.

                                    ALLISON
                    You re pretty strong. And I can 
                    handle you.

                                  SCOTT
                    Me?

                                    ALLISON
                    You don t think I d have a chance

      He holds still, not exactly sure how to do that when--SHE 
      TAKES A SWING AT HIM. He catches her by the wrist. Then 
      catches her other hand when she swings it as well.

      Allison pulls back, but he pulls forward. Her face draws 
      close enough to kiss. She wears a playful smile on her lips. 
      A challenge in her eyes.

      Cautious, Scott releases her. But keeps his hands up in a 
      defensive posture. And with good reason--

      Allison comes at him lightning fast. With a flurry of kicks 
      and hits, she sends him retreating back against the door. But 
      in one swift move, he grabs her and turns her around.

      Arms yanked behind her, Allison hits the door, pressed 
      against it with Scott behind her. She struggles, but his grip 
      is too strong. She can t break free.

      She rubs at her wrists, the skin red where he held her. Scott  
      turns to go, but pauses at the door.

      She nods but still doesn t look back. Finally, Scott steps 
      through the door to leave.

      The elevator doors open. Scott drifts in from the corridor, 
      mind elsewhere as he reaches for the panel to hit the button 
      for the LOBBY. But then he notices SOMEONE already there,

      to a complete stop. Coming to the Driver s side, Coach peers 
      out at a sea of RED BRAKE LIGHTS ahead while chewing on his 
      whistle.

      Beside Boyd, Isaac checks the TRAFFIC on his phone.

      Boyd barely hears him. Breath tight, his hands clench into

      and starts Scott rising from his seat.

      Blood on his claws, he gazes up, helpless to do anything but 
      watch--

      TWO GRAPPLING BODIES tumble forward, teetering on the edge of 
      an escalator platform--Ennis and Derek.

      Pushing himself to his feet, Scott desperately reaches out. 
      But he s too late. Ennis and Derek topple over. The world 
      turns upside down, spinning about.

      THE SOUND OF BODIES hitting cement sends Scott charging to 
      the platform s edge. He looks down several flights below 
      through the collapsed floor and into the darkness where--

      Ennis and Derek lie frighteningly, fatally still.

      THE CHIME of the front door opening raises Deaton s eyes from 
      his work. When he steps around the corner, he finds Morrell 
      waiting at the gate. 

      In the shadows behind her, Aiden and Kali hold up a bloody, 
      barely breathing Ennis.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/WAITING AREA - DAY2222

      Black blood seeping through his teeth, Ennis tries to stay on 
      his feet with Aiden and Kali s help. Morrell approaches 
      Deaton at the gate.

                                    MORRELL
                    We could use a little help.

                                  DEATON
                    Try the hospital.

                                    MORRELL
                    Open the gate, Alan.

                                  DEATON
                    No.

      Leaving Aiden to carry Ennis s weight, Kali steps behind 
      Morrell, threateningly close.

                                  KALI
                    Help us or maybe I just kill her.

      Kali s eyes LIGHT with an insidious RED GLOW. Unimpressed, 
      Deaton simply shakes his head.

                                  DEATON
                    Not here you won t.

      THE RED GLOW abruptly vanishes from her eyes, like a candle s 
      flame blown out. Kali blinks in shock as if pushed by an 
      unseen force.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    I suggest you leave. Don t make me 
                    insist.

      But Morrell stays her ground with a desperate plea.

                                    MORRELL
                    Alan, if he dies, they ll go after 
                    the others. And don t think your 
                    little proteg , Scott, won t find 
                    his way into the middle of it. 
                    They ll kill him. You know they 
                    will. Alan, please.

      Finally and reluctantly, Deaton clicks the gate open.                TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/1324.


      INT. BUS - DAY2323

      A CRACK of THUNDER draws Coach s eyes to the ceiling. His 
      growl of frustration is only slightly louder than Jared s 
      moan in the seat nearby.

      She grabs the sewing kit. No threader. So she tries again. 
      The end of the thread presses against the needle, but slips 
      past the eye. She tries again with mounting frustration.

                    to make it.

      Deucalion finds his way to the steel table where Ennis lies. 
      Deaton watches the blind man carefully place a hand over 
      Ennis s chest, fingers lightly tracing toward his chin.

      Ennis blinks, opening his eyes. He smiles weakly up at 
      Deucalion as he recognizes him. Slowly, the blind Alpha leans 
      down and ever-so-gently kisses him on both cheeks. As Ennis s 
      smile fades with dark realization, Deucalion does something 
      far less gentle...

      Hand on the side of his head, Deucalion STABS a single claw 
      into Ennis s temple. His body SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY, but only 
      for a moment. With a last twitch, he relaxes and lies still.

                    We know one thing. That wasn t for

      INT. ABANDONED MALL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK4242

      SNARLING, Derek rushes Deucalion. But Kali launches toward 
      him, feet slashing. At the same time, Ennis quickly takes 
      both Boyd and Cora to the ground.

      Above, Ethan and Aiden leap off a platform. TWO FEET land 
      below, the Twin Alpha formed. The creature ROARS, turning to 
      face--

      Scott and Isaac, both now transformed and charging into the 
      fight. But as bodies hit the floor, limbs crack and blood 
      flies--

      Ennis wraps his powerful arms around Isaac, Kali shoves Cora 
      to the floor with a foot over her neck and the Twin Alpha 
      drags a struggling Scott into a vise-like hold.

      Spitting blood, Boyd tries to push himself up from the cement 
      floor as Derek turns to find him lying at his feet.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Kill him. The others can go.

      All eyes look to Derek. Boyd peers up at him while still 
      trying to find the strength to rise.                TEEN WOLFEP#305"FRAYED"GREEN2/1/1339.

                    You re beaten. Do it, Derek. Take 
                    the first step.

      Held by the Alphas, Scott and the others look on Derek and 
      the choice presented to him.

                                  KALI
                    Are we serious with this? Look at 
                    him. He s an Alpha? To what? A 
                    couple of useless teenagers?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Some have more promise than others.

      He turns slightly, almost as if he s looking at Scott. But 
      the others keep their eyes on Derek.

                                  KALI
                    Let him rise to the occasion then. 
                    What ll it be, Derek? Pack or 
                    family?

      Kali s eyes glow a fierce RED as she pushes her foot down on 
      Cora s neck, threatening to break it.

      Derek looks from his sister to Boyd, an impossible decision. 
      Until, his ear picks up a familiar SOUND--

      THE DRAWING OF A BOW STRING.

      Derek ducks down as a FLASHBOLT ARROW whistles past and 
      strikes the Twin Alpha, EXPLODING against him in a BLINDING 
      FLASH. 

      Scott slips free as Ethan and Aiden break apart, bodies 
      tumbling back.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Your eyes--cover your eyes!

      FLASHBOLT ARROWS FIRE one after another, bursting into 
      brilliant whorls of light--

      A LAMP CLICKS on in Argent s office illuminating a detailed 
      MAP OF BEACON HILLS covering the desk.

                    Not us. I m getting the consulting 
                    business back up and running, and 
                    you need to graduate. That s called 
                    normal life. And it s what we 
                    agreed to.

      Allison s gaze falls on the MAP. Argent places an open book 
      down, partially covering it. There s an oddly concerted 
      effort to make it look like an absentminded gesture.

                                    ALLISON
                    So we just ignore it?

                                  ARGENT
                    We stay out of it.

                    People are dying all around us. An 
                    Alpha pack s trying to kill my 
                    friends. How do I stay out of that?

                                  ARGENT
                    There s a saying for these kind of 
                      situations. The kind you have to 
                    navigate carefully. It s called 
                    threading the needle. It s finding 
                    a safe path between two opposing 
                    forces.

                                    ALLISON
                    It sounds like  saving your own 
                    ass. 

                                  ARGENT
                    They re not your family.

                    With all the family I ve lost, I 
                    could use a few friends.

      She turns for the door.

                    Allison--

      He starts to speak again, but it s Scott who calls her name 
      this time--

      INT. ABANDONED MALL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK4444

      Blinking against the FLARE OF LIGHT, Scott spots a shape 
      behind a distant column.

      Lowering her bow, Allison gives him a quick smile and pulls 
      back into the shadows. Using the moment of surprise, Scott 
      launches toward Kali. Claws swiping, he sends her retreating 
      back from Cora.

                                  SCOTT
                    Run!

      As Derek pulls Boyd to his feet, Ennis drops Isaac and 
      charges like a battering ram toward Scott. But astonishingly, 
      Scott drops his shoulder and rushes in to meet the Alpha.

      As they CLASH with brutal force, for the briefest second, 
      Scott s EYES GLOW RED--the eyes of an Alpha.

      Allison blinks, shocked by the surge of color. 

      Above, Deucalion turns his head as if sensing it, breath 
      taken away by this significant moment.

      But Scott tumbles back to the floor, eyes returned to yellow 
      and not recovering nearly fast enough when he sees--

      Derek pulled to his feet by Ennis. Scrambling forward, Scott 
      swipes at Ennis's ankle, catching him right in the Achilles  
      heel.

      Ennis staggers forward. Derek's feet hit the floor, but he 
      stumbles as well, Ennis's hands still locked on him. Both 
      werewolves tumble BACKWARDS.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Derek--

      Ennis and Derek both go off the side of the escalator 
      platform. Their bodies fall, SLAMMING TO THE PAVEMENT with a 
      TERRIBLE CRACKING SOUND the world turning black.

      Struggling to carry her bag, coat and an armful of papers to

      She starts the engine and turns to the window to reach for
