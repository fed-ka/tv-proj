child is HELEN, quite unkempt, in body a vivacious little

thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the
movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the

But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel

That is not a proper thing to say.
Annie, be humble.

You'll need their affection, work-

ANNIE, not quite comprehending, looks at gift.
A gift with our affection.
ANNIE opens a small box and sees a garnet ring. She
looks up, blinking, then down.
ANNIE
Dear Mr. Anagnos,

But she swallows over getting the ring on her finger
and cannot continue until she finds a woebegone joke.

That is only half true, Annie.
ANNIE
Which half?
The train lurches. ANAGNOS bends and kisses her on the
cheek and says,
ANAGNOS
Goodbye. Goodbye.
