                   I didn't know how else to reach
                   you.  I know she was your friend.                 (X)
                   I'm so desperately sorry...                       (X)

                   Did Miss Lane tell you about the
                   Lakes?                                            (X)

                                    SUPERMAN
                   No.

                   robber the one who killed Miss
                   Lane?                                             (X)

    Suddenly galvanized, Superman FLIES OFF.                         (X)
