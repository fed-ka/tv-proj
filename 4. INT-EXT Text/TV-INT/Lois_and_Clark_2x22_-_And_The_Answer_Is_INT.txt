
    There's a KNOCK at Lois' door.  A beat, then she ENTERS 
    FRAME, her hair in rollers.

                                    LOIS
                   Hang on, Clark.

    She glimpses herself in a mirror.  The rollers.  Can't let 
    Clark see her like this.  What to do?.  She TIPTOES to the
    door, stealthily UNLOCKS it, then scurries away.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   It's open!

    She disappears into the bathroom as CLARK enters with 
    something obviously on his mind.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois?

                                    LOIS (O.S.)
                   I'll be out in a minute.  You're a
                   little early.

                                    CLARK
                   I know.  It's just... there's 
                   something I want to talk to you 
                   about.

    The HAIR DRYER kicks in from O.S.

                                    LOIS (O.S.)
                   I can't hear you!  Hold on a 
                   minute, I'll be right out.

    Clark eyes a photo on a shelf showing Lois and him holding a
    Kerth award.  Over this...

                                    LOIS (O.S.)
                   where are we going for breakfast?

                                    CLARK
                   I thought we'd try Callard's.

                   What?l I can't hear you!

    Clark smiles, shakes his head, then focuses on the photo.  A 
    beat, then he begins talking to the photo.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois... I have something to tell
                   you... I'm Superman.
                         (no good)
                   Lois, have you ever noticed how 
                   much I look like Superman?  Well, 
                   it's funny you should say that, 
                   because...

    He whips off the glasses, mimes waiting for her response.  
    No good.  Then...

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Hey!  Guess what?  I'm Superman!
                         (nah)
                   Lois... I've wanted to tell you 
                   this for some time.  Before we go 
                   any further in our relationship,

                   What are you doing?

    Startled, Clark turns to see Lois standing at the edge of 
    the bathroom, the long cord on the dryer allowing her to 
    catch him in the act.  As she flips off the dryer...

                                    CLARK
                   I uh... uh... I've got something to
                   tell you.

    She unplugs the dryer, absently carries it with her thru...

                                    LOIS
                   It's not good news, is it.

                                    CLARK
                   Well, I don't know.  Maybe.

                                    LOIS
                   No, it's not.  I can tell by your
                   face.

                                    CLARK
                   Maybe you'd better sit down.

                                    LOIS

    Clark sits next to her on the couch.  A beat, then...

                                    CLARK
                   You know how you always complain

                   we're starting to talk about

                                    LOIS
                   I recall mentioning it once or
                   twice.

                                    CLARk
                   Well, there's a reason for that.  
                   And it has nothing to do with my 
                   having a fear of intimacy, or being 
                   afraid of falling in love, or 
                   anything like that.

    She waits.

    almost relieved.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Maybe you should just answer that.

    Lois snatches up the phone, unhappy with the interruption.

                                    LOIS
                   Hello?  Yes, he's right here.

    Jace slips the diary into his jacket pocket.  As he heads 
    for a nearby bar...

                                    NIGEL
                   So tell me Mister Mazik.  Exactly 
                   how did you come by possession of 
                   that diary?

                                    JACE
                   I found it.  Buried in a box of 
                   my old man's stuff.  He died four 
                   years ago but no one ever got 
                   around to going through his junk.

                                    NIGEL
                   And now you're robbing one of his
                   jewelry stores?

                                    JACE
                   Just getting what should have been 
                   mine.  The old man left everything 
                   to my suck up brother.

                                    NIGEL
                   I see.  Whereas your father made 
                   his fortune the old fashioned way, 
                   you're just going to steal yours.

                                    JACE
                   Let me tell you something.
                   Everyone thought he was just a 
                   humble junk man who made it big 
                   through hard work.  But all he 
                   really did was follow this and 
                   invest well.  Plastics in the 
                   sixties, oil in the seventies, 
                   computers in the eighties.

                                    NIGEL
                   And why is it he never revealed
                   Superman's identity?

                                    JACE
                   Mainly because he died before
                   Superman ever showed up.

                                    NIGEL
                   How very fortunate for you.

                                    JACE
                   Very.

                                    NIGEL
                   I'd like to see it.

                   Right.  Half of what we get by 
                   having Superman under our control.
                   That's our deal.  And the diary 
                   ain't part of it.  Got it?

                                    MARTHA
                   This is so romantic.  Spending our 
                   anniversary in Metropolis.

                                    JONATHAN
                   Yeah.  It was a good idea.
                         (and then)
                   Did Clark seem okay to you?  He was
                   acting kinda odd.

                                    MARTHA
                   Jonathan.  Of course he's acting 
                   odd.  Haven't you been listening to 
                   him?  He's in love.
                         (and then)
                   And speaking of love...

    She reaches into her suitcase and withdraws a small object 
    WRAPPED in tissue paper.  She hands it to Jonathan.

                   Happy Anniversary.

                                    JONATHAN
                   Aw... thank you.

    Jonathan unwraps the paper, revealing a beautifully hand 
    carved wooden box, 12 inches by 12 by 3.

                                    MARTHA
                   It's a memory box.  I carved it
                   myself.  Look inside.

    Jonathan opens the lid, revealing it's filled with small, 
    smooth stones.  A word is painted on each one.

                                    MARTHA (CONT'D) 
                   Each pebble represents a year of 
                   our marriage.  After I buffed them, 
                   I painted a word on each that 
                   corresponds to something that 
                   happened to us in different years.
                         (lifts a few)
                   See?  This one says 'wedding.  'And 
                   this one says 'Clark.' And this 
                   one says 'Florida,' for that 
                   vacation we took in '79.  Now all 
                   our memories are in one place.

                                    JONATHAN
                   I love it.  And you.

    They kiss, then he reaches into his suitcase and withdraws 
    an envelope.  Beaming, he extends it to Martha.

                                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
                   Happy Anniversary.

                   Gee... an envelope.
                         (opens it)
                   It's... a gift certificate.

                                    JONATHAN
                         (enthusiastic)
                   Yeah.  To Costmart.  I know some
                   people say it's run by crooks, but
                   they have nice stuff there.

                                    MARTHA

                   You're right.  I don't need
                   anything.

    They hear a SOUND in the living room, bailing them out.

    She tosses the envelope in her suitcase and heads for the

    Martha steps out of the bedroom, Jonathan right behind.
    Clark's obviously upset.

                                    CLARK
                   He said he's got some kind of diary
                   that tells everything about me.
                   And he's threatening to reveal who
                   I am unless I do what he wants.

                                    MARTHA

                   Steal for him.

                   a change.  Life may be a lot easier

    Lois finishes with a pounding flourish as Clark arrives.

                                    CLARK
                   I think we need to talk.

                                    LOIS

    She rises and heads for the conference room.  Confused, 
    Clark takes a quick look at her screen, reacts, then turns 
    it off before anyone else can see.



    Lois paces as Clark enters, closes the door behind him.

                                    CLARK
                   Look, I owe you an explanation...

                                    LOIS
                   Don't.  I can't listen to another
                   stupid story about your barber, or
                   your doctor, or you just remembered
                   you have a library book due!
                         (exhales, then)
                   What you owe me is respect.  I'm 
                   tired of the lies, Clark.  What 
                   kind of relationship can we have if 
                   you're not honest with me?

                                    CLARK
                   I've always been honest with you 
                   Lois, except for one thing.  And 
                   when I tell you what it is... well, 
                   I hope you'll understand.

    He's so sincere it deflates her anger.  She approaches him, 
    searching his face.

                   Okay.  But he said you'd want to
                   talk with him.  Something about a
                   dumpster.

                         (reacts, then, to Lois)
                   I'm sorry.  I have to take this.

    He lifts the phone.  Their eyes meet, then Lois looks away
    and leaves the room.  Grimacing, lifts the receiver to his
    ear.

    FADE IN:


    Clark quickly enters and takes in the sign of struggle: 
    several suitcases knocked over and kicked aside; a fallen 
    lamp; one end of the couch shoved too close to the coffee 
    table.  He lets out a sigh of anguish and frustration.

                                    CLARK
                         (to himself)
                   All right, whoever you are, let's 
                   see what your fingerprints look 
                   like.

    Clark quickly moves around the room and does a SUPER CLOSEUP
    SCAN of: the suitcase handles; the fallen lamp; the top of 
    the coffee table.  They're all clean.

                                    CLARK
                         (frustrated)
                   No fingerprints, so... what about 
                   footprints?  Or a piece of your 
                   hair?

    He SUPERSCANS the floor.  Then a throw rug.  There's 
    something an the rug, but it's a blurred series of 
    overlapping prints... nothing definite.  He spots a hair and
    instantly picks it up, then frowns.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Mom, when did you start dying your
                   hair?

    He tosses it away in frustration and begins to pace around 
    the room.  He picks up the lamp; rights the suitcases.

    Suddenly, the Watchman in Clark's pocket beeps.  He pulls it

    on the screen.

                   we?

                   Don't bother looking for me.  I'm 
                   nowhere nearby, but my eyes are 
                   everywhere.

    Clark checks himself.

                   What do you want?

                   mentioned?  Well, gosh, I forgot to 
                   tell you where to take the stuff.
                   I want it delivered to me by 
                   midnight tonight.  I'll be waiting 
                   behind the fountain in Centennial 
                   Park.  No diamonds, no parents.  
                   And if I smell anything funny, 
                   you'll be an orphan, comprende?

    The screen goes black.  A thoughtful look crosses Clarks's 
    face.

                                    CLARK
                   'Smell anything funny.' Hmmmm.

    He sniffs the air and we ZOOM IN an his nose.  A second 
    later he SUPERSPEEDS and SNIFFS around the apartment and 
    suddenly stops like a pointer on a scent.  He takes a final 
    sniff and smiles.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I... uh... was looking for Clark.

                                    LOIS
                   Is that why he left?   Are you and 
                   he working on something?  Something 
                   you don't want me to know about?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   No!  Isn't he at the Planet?  I... 
                   just came by to say 'hello' to his 
                   folks, but... I guess they went out 
                   to get groceries... or frozen 
                   yogurt.  Or... coffee.

    Superman lamely trails off.  He's dying to get out of here.

                                    LOIS
                   But if you thought he was at the 
                   Planet, why'd you think he might be 
                   here?

    Superman gulps.  She's got him.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Because... I stopped here first, 
                   and if he wasn't here, I figured 
                   he'd be at the Planet.

    Lois digests this.  It makes sense.  Her antennae retract a 
    bit.

                                    LOIS
                   Well, he's not there.

    Superman starts to LEVITATE in anticipation of leaving... 
    and cutting short any more Lois questions.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I guess I'll catch him later then.
                   See ya.

    Martha stands on a chair and scrutinizes an air vent set in 
    the wall above bar head . . It's about ten inches wide.  
    Jonathan steadies the chair for her.

                                    MARTHA
                         (still rankled)
                   It must've taken a lot of thought 
                   to come up with the idea of a gift 
                   certificate.

                                    JONATHAN

                         (halfheartedly)
                   Well, I _did_ consider a few other
                   things before I settled an it.

    Martha steps down from the chair.

                                    MARTHA
                         (re: vent)
                   Even if we _could_ get the grill 
                   off, neither one of us could get 
                   through it.

    She heads for the door and, for the lack of any other 
    option, tries the doorknob.  It gives her an electric shock, 
    which causes her to jump back.

                                    MARTHA (CONT'D)
                   Ow!

                                    JONATHAN
                   Martha, are you all right?!

                                    MARTHA
                         (shaking her hand)
                   I'm fine.  Maybe I can use your 
                   gift certificate to buy some 
                   Bandaids when we get out of here.

                                    JONATHAN
                   if you don't like it, just come out
                   and say it.

    Martha drops to the floor and tries to look under the door.
    Jonathan stiffly kneels down next to her.

                   I can't see anything.  Must be some
                   kind of seal.  Usually you don't 
                   see that.

    She waves off Jonathan's help as she stands up.  She studies 
    the doorknob again and looks up at the single, overhead light.

                                    JONATHAN
                   You want me to get you something 
                   else?  Tell me.  I'll be happy to.

                                    MARTHA
                   You know, if we had some wire, 
                   maybe we could run it from the 
                   light to the doorknob and short it 
                   out, then we could really get to 
                   work on it.

                                    JONATHAN
                   Martha, would you just look at me
                   for a second.

    Martha, who's been avoiding eye contact all this time, 
    finally looks at him.

                                    MARTHA
                   Jonathan, I guess I'm just hurt, 
                   that's all.  I guess I was 
                   expecting a little more.

                                    JONATHAN
                         (beat)
                   Maybe there is.

    Martha looks at him for a moment, then suddenly digs in her 
    pocket and pulls out the gift certificate.  She studies it 
    for a second, sees Jonathan's encouraging look, and flips it 
    over.  On the back there's a note in Jonathan's handwriting.  
    Her face falls.

                                    MARTHA
                   I'm supposed to use this to get a
                   _book_ at the book counter?

                   It better be a really great

    Clark is on the phone, trying to keep his temper.  He 
    glances at his watch; it's getting late.

                                    CLARK
                         (into phone)
                   Yes?  Hello?  I've been on hold for 
                   twenty minutes.  No, I can't call 
                   back later, I just want to speak to 
                   someone who can tell me who flew

                   is an emergency.  Is there a

                         (increasing anxiety)
                   No no no!  Don't put me on hold.

    They put him on hold.  Clark grits his teeth and checks his 
    watch.  It's almost 8:00 pm.  Damn!

    He checks his watch again, makes a decision and slams down 
    the phone.  He pulls open a drawer and yanks out his copy of 
    the Metropolis Yellow Pages.  He flips to the jewelry store 
    pages.  On one page there are a dozen ads of various shapes, 
    all for store names beginning with "M".  One ad is for 
    "Mazik's Jewelry.  The only thing finer than our diamonds, 
    is our service."  Clark reads the address: "1651 N. Thornton 
    Street".

                   Oh, looking to buy me something?

    Clark jumps.  He didn't hear her approach.  He awkwardly 
    stands; he wants to leave.

                                    CLARK
                   Um, I... forgot to get an 
                   anniversary present for my folks.
                   I've gotta get one before the 
                   stores close.

                   Good idea.  You better take care of
                   that.

    The lack of Lois's resistance makes Clark pause.

                   You're not mad?

                   accept, that we both have
                   separate lives.  No matter how

    Clark does so.
                                    JACE (CONT'D) 
                   Thank you so much.  And, Clark,

                   follow the courier. If you do, Ma
                   and Pa will die... I'll be in

    Jace reaches out to turn off the communication.

                                    CLARK
                   Hey!

    Jace's hand stops aid-air.

                                    JACE
                   Yes, Clark?

                   I bring you these diamonds, you 
                   release my parents, was that the 
                   deal, was that what you said?

                   Yes, Clark.

                   I lied.

    The Watchman screen goes dark. Off Clark's reaction --



    Jace turns to Nigel.

                                    JACE
                   Isn't this fun?

                                    NIGEL
                   Getting greedy?

                                    JACE
                   I'm thinking maybe another little 
                   job or two.  We might as well get 
                   stinking rich before we kill him.

    He smiles.  Nigel remains stony-faced.

    Lois and Clark are at Lois's desk, sitting so close to each 
    other they're practically one person.  They don't look like 
    they've gotten much sleep.  Lois in wearing what she wore 
    yesterday.  She's an the phone.

    She gets to the purpose of her call:

                   I need to talk to somebody who can

    Perry's across the room checking a layout, keeping an eye on 
    Lois and Clark.  As Jimmy walks-by him:

    pleasure.

    Lois is talking rather animatedly, if quietly, on the phone.

                                    PERRY
                   Like he hasn't had much sleep

                   I don't usually do this, but how 
                   about this:  I'll give you a free

                         (the phone squawks, then)

    Some more SQUAWKING from the phone, then she's on hold.  She 
    sees Perry and Jimmy staring at her and Clark.  They quickly 
    turn away and go about their business.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)

                   I don't think this is going to

    The doughnut-scarfing COP from "Chi of Steel" has entered 
    the room, moves over to Lois and Clark.

    The cop takes a photo out of his pocket, doesn't show it to

    He and Lois both look from the picture to Clark's glasses.
    Clark adjusts his glasses, hanging onto them lest somebody
    decide to take them off his face for comparison purposes.

                   names Nigel St. John uses.  What is 
                   going on, Clark?  What could Nigel

                   Nicholas S. Janacek, Flight 697,

    Lois and Clark are sitting across from Jace.  No Nigel.
    Jace is being very charming.

                         (to Lois)
                   But you're not bothering me at all,
                   Miss Lane. I'm honored. I read
                   your articles all the time.
                   They're wonderful. And yours, too,
                   Mr. Kent.  Yours are just... super.

    Clark blanches as Lois plows ahead:

                                    LOIS
                   Thank you. Do you know a Nicholas
                   S. Janacek?

    Clark's looking at the wall behind Jace. He activates his
    X-RAY VISION and sees a bedroom -- empty.

                                    JACE
                   Janacek?  No, I don't believe I do.
                   Why do you ask?

                   We're trying to trace him for a
                   story we're doing.  You paid his
                   plane fare from England a couple of
                   days ago.

    Clark's LOOKING THROUGH the wall to his left.  A roof
    garden.  Nobody there.

    Clark's looking through the wall to his right.  A kitchen.
    Nobody there.

                                    LOIS
                   You don't seem very concerned.

                   You report them lost, you get new 
                   ones.  But I'm really impressed at 
                   your resourcefulness.  I thought it 
                   would take, oh, I don't know, 
                   _Superman_ to pry that kind of 
                   information out of an airline.

    Clark looks at Jace, who smiles at him.  Isn't this fun?  
    Jace stands up.

    He closes the door behind them.  As we hear their RECEDING 
    FOOTSTEPS, we also hear the WHIR of an ELEVATOR.  Jace's 
    private elevator, which opens into his living room.  After a 
    moment, it stops and the doors open to reveal Nigel.

                   I think you were wrong, Nigel.  I
                   thought she was sweet.

                   All right.  Anything to see your

    He pats Nigel's cheek.  Nigel would like to strangle him.



    Lois and Clark, standing by-the fax machine, waiting for
    something to come through.

                   eyes.

    She does.  He pushes her hair back, just the way Clark did.
    Her face registers the shock of recognition at this
    intimate, familiar touch.

    He takes an enormous breath and BLOWS A HUGE, ICY BLAST at

    Jace uses the Kryptonite to "push" Superman into the room.
    Superman trips and falls in a heap.

    Jace tosses the Kryptonite into the room as he and Nigel
    back out.



    Jace closes the door and locks it.  Then he throws a switch
    on the wall and -



    The vent near the ceiling begin to HISS gas.  Superman sees
    this.  The Kents cough.  He tries to got up but can't.

                   I read all about how you did the
                   same thing to Luthor.  Kind of

                   my old man.  I ever tell you how I

                   Reading _is_ fundamental.

    He turns and strolls down the hall.



    The gas is filling the room.  The Kryptonite is on one side,
    Superman and the Kents on the other, right under the vent,
    as the Kents try to keep from passing out.

                                    SUPERMAN

                         (she does)
                   Dad, go get the Kryptonite.

    He moves back across the room.  Summoning the very last of
    his strength, Superman BLOWS an ICY JET of air at the vent.
    It FREEZES white and --

    Jonathan winds up and throws the rock.  It SHATTERS the vent
    like balsa and goes RATTLING AWAY.



    The door is KICKED out.  Superman and the coughing Kents
    emerge.  Superman moves straight to Lois and kneels to her.

    The Kents stand back, holding each other and watching, as he

    relaxes but there is still no life.  He grips her hand in

                                    JONATHAN
                   To get you the book they're holding.

    He hands her a wrapped gift.  As she opens it, father and 
    son exchange sly smiles.  The gift is a book on Italian art.


                                    JONATHAN (CONT'D)
                   You like it?

                                    MARTHA
                   Oh, anything from you, I love...

                                    JONATHAN
                   The kidnapping kind of screwed up 
                   my plan but... the idea was, gift 
                   certificate to book... book is in 
                   Italian and hopefully we both know 
                   some Italian by the time we get 
                   back from...
                         (Martha finds two plane
                          tickets)
                   ... Florence.

                                    MARTHA
                         (stunned)
                   Oh, Jonathan.

    She hugs him.  Clark looks on at his parents, so in love.  A 
    wistful smile.



    Clark leads his parents across the bullpen to the elevators 
    as Jimmy and Perry look on.

                   Heard from Lois?

                                    JIMMY
                   Feeling better.

                   She or Clark tell you how they
                   bagged this?

    He lifts the paper.  Headline reads:  HEIR KILLS EX-SPY.
    Pictures of Jace and Nigel.

                                    JIMMY
                   They're a couple clams.

                                    PERRY
                   You ever get the feeling we'll 
                   never really know everything that's 
                   going on with them?

                                    JIMMY
                   Hey, Chief?

                                    PERRY
                   Yeah?

                                    JIMMY
                   Instead of always standing around 
                   watching Lois and Clark, wondering 
                   what they're doing, what if we... I 
                   don't know... got lives of our own 
                   that were a little more 
                   interesting?

    This stops Perry in his tracks.  He looks at the lad.

                                    PERRY
                   Son, you're shootin' a bullseye.
                   It's like we're supporting 
                   character in some TV show that's 
                   _only_ about them...

                                    JIMMY
                   ... and all we do is advance their 
                   plots...

                                    PERRY
                   ... and I, for one, am sick of it.

                                    JIMMY
                         (as they move off)
                   Man, me, too.
