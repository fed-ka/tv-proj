  MUSIC FADES IN.  Something that grooves like  Fergalicious  
  as a group of TEENS stunt their BMX bikes in an empty lot 
  next to a middle income apartment building.

  One Teen rides up a ramp and jumps a ditch.  His friends 
  cheer.  Another Teen, COREY, digs and widens the ditch -- 
  hits on something.  He yells out --

                              COREY
                Yo guys, check this out!

  In his hand he holds a tarnished piece of metal.

                              COREY (CONT D)
                That s straight Five-O!

  INSERT BADGE -- Tarnished and old, but clearly LAPD --


  LAPD Crime Scene.  Uniforms cordon off the area.  DON meets 
  DAVID.

                              DAVID
                Badge traces to an LAPD Officer.  
                Went missing in 1990.

                              DON
                Missing?

                              DAVID
                John Everett.  Twenty-three years 
                old.  Bureau originally worked the 
                case as an unexplained 
                  disappearance. 

                              DON
                Yeah, well finding this badge is 
                gonna change things.

                              DAVID
                Report indicates that Everett was 
                wearing his uniform when he went 
                missing.

                              DON
                Which probably now makes this a cop 
                killing.

                              DAVID
                And means whoever did it is most 
                likely still walking around.

  Don notices LT. GARY WALKER drive up, exits his car.  Another 
  Police Officer (Sgt. Jackson) stays in the background.

                              DON 
                Is that Gary Walker?

                              DAVID
                They said LAPD was gonna work the 
                case with us.  

  As Walker approaches...

                              DON
                How you been, Lieutenant?

  Walker shakes Don s hand.

                              WALKER
                Seen better days truthfully, Eppes.

                      (then, re: bagged badge)
                That it?

  Walker takes the bagged badge, studies it.

                                WALKER (CONT D)
                Man who wore this was one of the 
                finest young cops I ever knew. 

                              DAVID
                You knew him?

                                WALKER
                Everett was on my street crime 
                team.  We hit hard and often... 
                Coupla weeks before he disappeared, 
                he killed a real hard-ass gang 
                banger named Stephon Bradley.

                You think he might have been 
                murdered as payback?

                                WALKER
                I don t think, Sinclair.  I know.  
                  Bradley s older brother vowed 
                revenge at the time.  And Everett s 
                car was found in his neighborhood. 

                              DON
                But you couldn t make a case.

                                WALKER
                Not without a body.

                              DAVID 
                Where s the brother now?

                                WALKER
                Did ten years for armed robbery.  
                Paroled in  02.  Got his college 
                degree on the inside, heard he even 
                writes some poetry now.  
                      (beat)

                Everett after all these years...

                of us, but we re on the same page

                Word was a BSF crew had raided a

                              COLLINS
                Commanders wanted everyone on it.  
                Kid gets killed, politicians wanna

                                WALKER
                So I called everyone back in.

                              DAVIDSON
                Everett had some appointments 
                didn t get the word  till late.  By 
                the time he rolled, we were all out

  Just as a Volvo, 2001, pulls up.  Everyone but Don recognizes 
  the car.  Quick glances as --

  LEIGH EVERETT, 40, gets out and walks over to Walker.

  David, Collins and Davidson watch through binoculars.  CALVIN

                That s him.  That s Calvin Bradley.

                              DAVID 
                  I thought associating with gang 
                members was a violation of parole?

                              DAVIDSON 
                He applied to a Judge for an 
                  exception.  Claimed he was 
                   rehabilitating them. 

                              DAVID
                You guys seem pretty sure he was 
                the one who killed Officer Everett. 

                              DAVIDSON
                1990, Bradley s braggin  to anyone 
                who d listen, he d get revenge on 
                Everett for killing his brother. 

                              DAVID
                Words don t always mean action.

                              COLLINS
                Out there, you learned quickly 
                there was no such thing as an idle 
                threat.

                I m from this neighborhood.  Half 
                the gang bangers I busted, I knew.  
                And they backed up what they said.

                  I screwed up.  I just assumed, 
                given your relationship that you 
                would ve told him.

                              AMITA
                That s why I quit -- at least 
                partly the reason... People assume 
                things because Charlie and I are 
                seeing each other.

                Hey, I was wrong.  I admit it.  But 
                dating in the workplace isn t gonna 
                be a free ride.  Especially for a 
                woman.  We ve made strides, but 
                certain perceptions still exist.
                      (off Amita)
                And giving into those perceptions 
                only perpetuates the stereotype.

  Calvin Bradley walks down the street.  Several kids (12) 
  around.  Some adults on their porches.  Don and Walker pull 
  up.  Kids, people turn to look.

                You know the drill, on the hood.

                Everett did come to see me that 
                day.  To apologize.  He wanted me 
                to understand what had gone down 
                with Stephon.  Only he left my 
                house alive.

                way.  Then they killed him when he

  Walker moves up on the right.  David and Liz take the 
  opposite side.  They reach the front at the same time.

  Liz swings the door open as David, jumps up on the step to 
  the cab, peers inside...no Lopez.

  David grabs a small gear bag, looks inside.

                              DAVID
                His stuff s here. 

  David hops down, looks at Walker and Liz.

                Manager said Lopez went to unload 
                his truck, no one s seen him since.

  Walker looks at the truck.  Then, starts to move towards the 
  back.  David and Liz are right with him.

  They open the door and find Lopez, laying on the floor.  Belt 
  wrapped around his arm, hypodermic next to it.

  David leans over and feels for a pulse he knows isn t there.

                                WALKER
                Lopez was keeping a secret from me
