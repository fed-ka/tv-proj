There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine
is pulling out of the station.
DENNIS
Hit the button, Brian.
Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light
snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down
the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last
instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older
brother.
They stick their tongues out.
The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched
between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at
intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on
sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency
lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.
Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block.
Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping
off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and
pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his
son.
DENNIS
Stay near the truck.
(winks)
And keep an eye out for us, huh?
We're short handed today.
Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis
smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward
a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the
cab.
ENGINEER
Don't stray too far, little man.
Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better
look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking
on purpose.
There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian
watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox
onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window
over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.
Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed
with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony.
A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out
the frame with his axe, and dives in.
A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified,
smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing
to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a
ladder.
Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than
life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between
fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling
darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride,
he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing
a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof.
The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh,
don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head
staring up in astonishment.
Nobody else has noticed it.
Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window;
probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian
starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,
BRIAN
Dad...
He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is
happening very fast in slow motion:
-- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole
as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that
beckons him as --
Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him
clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling
fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT
and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm
that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood,
and something metal that cracks against the pavement and
spins slowly.
A fire helmet.
And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn,
hopeless tears streaming down his face.
AXE
Get us some backup! We need some
goddamn backup!
And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet
spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is
raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to
its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at
the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we
read the printing on the neck guard.
MCCAFFREY
And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy,
protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian
doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his
father's helmet, And puts it on.
The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures
the instant.
Brian and his battered BMW shoot past prairie, cow country,
nervous suburbs and finally a sign: WELCOME TO CHICAGO.
Wind tugging at his bangs, Brian stares down at the graves
of Dennis and Mary Elizabeth McCaffrey.
Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his
tie. He comes to a door, FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF. He takes a deep
breath, steadies his gaze, and enters.
And everybody lined up at attention in dress blues.
CHIEF FITZGERALD
(at podium)
Though the world changes every day,
some things are truly forever:
Courage, devotion, and honor in what
we do. This class is a special one,
for we dedicate it to the three
firefighters that have fallen this
year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter
and Michael Petzold...
(silent beat)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is with
pleasure that I certify that Candidate
Class number 322, having successfully
completed all academy requirements,
are hereby graduated to the Chicago
Fire Department.
Candidates and their relatives CHEER and leap to their feet.
Something struggles inside of Brian. He doesn't stand at
first. Another Candidate, TIM, 20, looks at him strangely.
So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's. And
Brian's standing slowly now, joining them...
An expensive one. We hear a window BREAK.
A Porsche knifes through darkened streets. The DRIVER, 50,
is dressed for success. Pulling up to the brownstone we saw
earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. Another day in the
salt mines.
Climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock
and opens the door. It is the last thing he will ever do.
A THUNDERING EXPLOSION ENGULFS the stoop.
Everyone steps outside, cocks an ear. And here it comes, the
real thing, SCREECHING past in a full-tilt rush. Shouts and
raised toasts.
TIM
Hey, that's my cousin's company!
C'mon! Let's go!
As Brian turns, he suddenly confronted by an elderly
LITHUANIAN WOMAN.
BRIAN
(surprised)
Mrs. Viatkus...
She grabs his cheeks and rattles off in Lithuanian. Brian
can only smile. Then two attractive jean-clad legs step up.
JENNIFER.
JENNIFER
Brian.
BRIAN
(surprised)
Jennifer.
JENNIFER
You're back.
BRIAN
You look great.
JENNIFER
Thanks for calling.
BRIAN
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low
profile... the academy... I graduated
today.
JENNIFER
Huh.
BRIAN
So... I see you're still in the
neighborhood.
JENNIFER
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in
Lincoln Park now.
BRIAN
Yeah? What have you been up to?
JENNIFER
I work for city hall.
BRIAN
Really? No kidding.
JENNIFER
What, you think I just dried up and
blew away when you left? The world
does turn once in awhile Brian, even
without your permission.
Just then, Tim OPENS UP the hoseline, DRENCHING Brian.
TIM
Don't want you overheating, Brian!
Brian ducks the stream and PULLS a length of hose near his
feet, FLIPPING Tim. Brian JUMPS him, shuts off the hose and
pins him to the pavement.
TIM
Okay okay! Uncle!
Brian walks back toward Jennifer
JENNIFER
You've certainly matured.
She turns to leave.
BRIAN
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to
know we can still be friends.
JENNIFER
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Another in a series of fire engines HOWL past. Tim grabs
Brian by the shoulder.
TIM
Let's go, man!
Brian and Tim jump into Brian's car. They shoot blindly down
the street looking for the fire engine, running down red
lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly
hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their
windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren.
TIM
(points)
That way.
SCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there
it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up
alongside the fire engine. Tim leans out the window, shakes
a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the
truck driver's face.
DRIVER
Tim! You crazy motherfucker!
But he's laughing.
TIM
What'cha got?
DRIVER
Box alarm. Walton Ave.
TIM
We'll meet ya.
As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already
dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode
earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie.
Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers
whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.
One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He
watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person
would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian
turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are
gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian
notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice
the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield.
It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy
angles. A dog barks furiously at it.
TIM
(also looking at body)
Man. Something sure put a crimp in
his evening.
BRIAN
Backdraft.
The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy
clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming
back out now, walking toward Brian.
When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask
and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a
dead ringer for HIS FATHER.
STEPHEN
Well, look what we have here. Nice
costume. Rent it?
BRIAN
I want to thank you for coming to my
graduation, Stephen. It was a great
inspiration to me.
STEPHEN
So you're going to fight fires now,
huh?
He pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears.
STEPHEN
(re smears)
Doesn't work on you.
(turns to leave)
See ya around, little brother.
BRIAN
Not likely.
STEPHEN
(turns)
Well, see you're wrong already. Had
a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we
decided in the interest of brotherly
love, that maybe you shouldn't be
way over on the other side of town.
So starting tomorrow, your assigned
to company 17. My company.
(Brian's color drops
a hue)
One case of scotch, you're getting
cheap in your old age, Brian...
And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as
clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts.
A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette.
The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the
mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half
feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks
tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another
slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield.
It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up
as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot,
and crosses the street to the building.
Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the
body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon.
There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs
circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car,
and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.
BRIAN
(to coroner crew)
Hey, you forgot... this.
They're already climbing into the wagon. The driver smiles
creepily.
CORONER DRIVER
We always leave something for the
dogs.
Brian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking
back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance.
A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks
up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy
fire truck on the drive.
BRIAN
Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man?
The kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition.
BRIAN
It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.
He makes his hand into a talking puppet.
BRIAN
(bandito accent)
"Spinach? We don't need no stinking
spinach". Remember?
The kid drops his toy truck and flees inside.
KID
Mom! Mom!
A small one on the river. Several boats bob peacefully. Except
one. Raised high in dry-dock, it's an ancient fishing trawler.
Bachman-Turner-Overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly
fuzzed speakers as Brian climbs the ladder.
BRIAN
Hey.
Stripped to the waist, Stephen's bent-over cleaning out the
guts of the inboard motor. He looks confused to see Brian.
BRIAN
I talked to Helen...
Wrong thing to say. Stephen turns back to his work.
BRIAN
...Man, I thought dad's boat was
finally retired to the family
graveyard. Don't you worry about
falling out of this thing?
Stephen straightens up, his forearms smudged with grease.
Brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck
paint.
BRIAN
I like what you've done with the
place.
STEPHEN
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge. As Brian pops it,
he sees the small pile of city-issue gallon size cans in the
corner. Armorall, solvent, extinguisher foam.
BRIAN
Been ripping off fire stations?
STEPHEN
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that
the department was going to throw
out anyway. Still good enough though
for this tub.
Brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers.
BRIAN
Bachman Turner Overdrive?
(looks through music
rack)
...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen
Bishop? Oh man...
Brian lifts one of the tapes -- an 8-track -- and holds it
carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic.
BRIAN
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
STEPHEN
What, you've never seen one before?
BRIAN
In the Field Museum once.
STEPHEN
It works.
BRIAN
It worked when you were in sixth
grade.
Brian opens the trunk of his old BMW. It's full of stereo
boxes marked BRIAN'S "SOUND SPECTRUM".
Brian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen.
BRIAN
Y'know, I told myself a million times
I didn't want to be a fireman. I
said bullshit to that line about
tradition and family legacy. I know
I split, and I know how you felt...
STEPHEN
Yeah, you know. You know what it
felt like.
BRIAN
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta
know.
STEPHEN
I think you're gonna find out, Brian.
Don't be late tomorrow.
Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets
out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration.
The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the
sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and
comes on.
Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the
century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of
faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up
the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights
flashing, pull out onto the apron.
The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is
Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we
know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey.
STEPHEN
You're too late, probie.
Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs
begin heading down the street.
BRIAN
(chasing)
Goddamn it, Stephen...
Brian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant
before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags
him aboard.
It's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran.
AXE
Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?
The Pumper driver, SCHMIDT, pops in a howling ROCK TUNE as
they zoom off.
SCHMIDT
(re Brian to Adcox)
You know this rug rat?
AXE
Know him? I practically raised him.
(Jewish mom)
And he never calls, he never writes...
Brian shouts over the noise to GRINDLE, 35, one more seat
down.
BRIAN
I'm Brian.
GRINDLE
I'm sorry.
Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins
buckling up his coat.
GRINDLE
Boys, I do believe we have a
barbecue...
As Brian and Adcox fasten up their own equipment --
Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a
five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.
GRINDLE
(staring at confusing
smoke)
I hate it when we gotta fucking go
look for it.
STEPHEN
(to Schmidt)
Call in another alarm. We're gonna
need some back-up.
Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags
the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally
parked Mercedes is blocking the way.
AXE
(to Stephen)
Oh these moments do try me...
STEPHEN
(admiring car)
Be gentle.
Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through
the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it
out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant.
Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out.
Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right.
Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.
SCHMIDT
It's only rock 'n roll, kid.
Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready
to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when
he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at
him in SPANISH.
STEPHEN
Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?
Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the
hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air
tank strap.
STEPHEN
You're doing it wrong.
Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out
over their heads.
STEPHEN
(to Brian)
Stay beside me.
And in they go...
Tim and three guys from his ladder company, come up an
extended aerial ladder, CRASH through a window and
-- And now he's bursting from the building onto a short fire
escape, shouting at the top of his lungs.
BRIAN
I got somebody! I got somebody!
A sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have
arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through
them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire
paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure.
BRIAN
Is she... Is she alive?
The paramedics suddenly stop their efforts. Turn to Brian.
PARAMEDIC
I'm afraid you're a little too late
with this one.
They step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange.
Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The
paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and
shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim,
sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman
that was found inside.
GRINDLE
Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I
heard you two were close.
Photographers have appeared and are flashing the woman. Dizzy,
Brian wanders off, tries to help out with the choking clog
of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly
into
Where he barfs his guts out in private. Doubled-over, one
arm on the brick wall for support, we see the raw terror.
The demons rushing out of him.
BRIAN
Shit...
Someone else does too. Jennifer. Dressed now in a long
expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with
a clipboard. Brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face,
spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her.
STEPHEN
(appearing beside him)
You all right?
Stephen isn't pale. He's flushed and buoyant. All this hasn't
taken anything from him. It's made his day.
BRIAN
Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right
now.
Stephen leans against the wall. Folds his arms.
STEPHEN
Y'know, you got an awful short memory
for direct orders. I told you to
stay beside me.
BRIAN
-- C'mon, Stephen.
STEPHEN
-- You split the team, man. And what
was that crap with the standpipe?
You'd think you and a hose were never
introduced before.
Stephen turns to leave. Brian yells after him.
BRIAN
Goddamn it Stephen!
STEPHEN
-- I told you to stay next to me!
BRIAN
-- I was doin' it! I was up there
fucking doin' it. You don't know,
man, you don't know what I did!
STEPHEN
What you did was drop the ball,
Probie. Get that right.
PENGELLY
(from end of alley)
Hey! Stevie! They're callin' for ya.
Stephen turns to walk away. Pauses.
STEPHEN
Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty
two days a month off sounded pretty
good twelve weeks ago, huh?
As Stephen leaves, we see that Jennifer's been standing at
the end of the alley, listening to them. She's turns and
walks as Brian looks up. We register his surprise. He watches
her head toward a dynamic-looking guy in his 40s, ALDERMAN
SWAYZAK, surrounded by reporters.
SWAYZAK
(to reporters)
Roger, Paul... How's it going, guys?
REPORTER
Another fire in this district. Getting
to be Cinder Alley up here.
JENNIFER
(walking up)
You used that last week.
She hands Swayzak a clipboard.
AXE
(yelling down from
window)
(to Brian)
Hey! Probie! We're still workin'
here, man.
Rimgale walks up to his sedan.
SHADOW
Alderman Swayzak.
SWAYZAK
Investigator Rimgale.
SHADOW
I need to get in the trunk.
Swayzak's leaning on it. We sense the dislike between them.
Swayzak steps aside. Rimgale pops the trunk.
SHADOW
Awful expensive shoes to be wearing
at a fireground, Alderman. But then
I guess you haven't been to too many
fires.
JENNIFER
I wanted to talk to you about Alan
Seagrave's death. We still haven't
gotten a fire report from your office.
SHADOW
You'll have an answer as soon as I
do.
SWAYZAK
People are asking how a prominent
taxpayer got stuffed through the
windshield of his own car. They're
asking me.
JENNIFER
--The point is, Investigator, you
haven't even told us yet if the fire
was accidental. We're starting to
get the feeling your office is
dragging out this case to embarrass
the Alderman because of his fire
dept. reorganization program --
SHADOW
-- You mean his firehouse closing
program, -- Don't you?
JENNIFER
We'd just be very disappointed if it
turned out your office was playing
politics.
SWAYZAK
-- Because I'm not. I care about
this city, and I care about this
department --
Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid.
SHADOW
(calm of a monk)
Alderman, I have a remarkably
uncomplicated job. To decide if a
fire's arson, and if so catch the
pain in the ass doing it. But to be
honest, if my methodical investigative
methods just happen to muck up the
campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees,
well, I guess I can't say I sleep
any less peacefully.
And he walks back to the burned building.
SWAYZAK
I wish I could just fire the son of
a bitch.
STEPHEN
Hey! Swayzak!
Stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. As the TV cameras
turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops
right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin.
STEPHEN
We almost lost a whole company up
there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back-
up since you closed '33. And we really
appreciate it, the guys and me.
Honest. I know you've got my vote
for mayor.
Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen. Brian's there,
following after them.
SWAYZAK
Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's
a problem, please, work with our
task force to fix it.
STEPHEN
Oh yeah, your famous task force...
three guys have already died this
year because of the cuts made by
your "task force"...
GRINDLE
Stevie, c'mon man...
Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand. Swayzak
leans close, out of earshot of the cameras.
SWAYZAK
You see that funny glow that's
starting to blink in the corner of
your eye, Lt? That's your career
dissipation light -- and it just
went into overtime.
STEPHEN
If anybody's light's gonna blink,
it's yours.
Swayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment
between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen
with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face
with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred.
AXE
You're in firemanland now, Swayzak.
Do yourself a favor and just walk
away.
Swayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. Brian
watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss.
BRIAN
This is your city job?
Jennifer shrugs as they pull away.
Brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway.
Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the
balcony of her apartment.
AXE
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
STEPHEN
Tim, fill out the alarm card.
(to Brian)
Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the
ladders and hang some hose.
Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian
sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor
before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns
and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast,
fangs, long greasy hair. It blocks his way, SNARLING with
hate.
GRINDLE
That's The Thing. You can't stay
unless he likes you.
Slobber drools out of its mouth as it GROWLS.
BRIAN
Have you guys got something against
dalmatians?
Brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks
back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs.
Stephen pulls up. Brian opens the door.
BRIAN
Thanks.
STEPHEN
Brian --
(a beat that hangs
there)
-- See ya tonight.
Brian leads Stephen toward his car.
STEPHEN
I'm okay... leave me alone...
Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the
sidewalk.
BRIAN
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson
or what?
STEPHEN
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just
sometimes... sometimes you just gotta
punch somebody out, y'know?
Brian stands there and folds his arms.
STEPHEN
I don't think I can get up.
Brian lends an arm.
STEPHEN
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I
can get on the cover of LIFE magazine,
too.
BRIAN
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Stephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him
up onto the boat.
STEPHEN
...Adcox, those guys...they don't
get it... it isn't the goddamn
promotion... or dad... I'm not my
old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get
me... I don't give a shit about being
a captain... it's just... it's just
they don't trust me anymore...
(blows out painful
breath)
...they don't trust me anymore...
Dark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the
chain link.
Is a practice stand-pipe. Brian counts down to himself, then
rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant
wrench and attaching the hose coupling. He does it again,
over and over.
The sky's gone pink and blue as Brian climbs back over the
fence. Adcox, coming out of a donut shop across the street,
sees him.
DISSOLVE TO:
A truck has JACKKNIFED across the avenue and SPILLED its
contents -- several THOUSAND baby chicks. They're scurrying
everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up. It's
hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the
cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats. There's ghetto
kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the
fire engine.
STEPHEN
(at kids)
Hey! Knock it off!
Brian stops a beat. Rubs his eyes.
AXE
(smiles)
Maybe you should have gotten more
sleep last night.
Brian looks at him. Does he mean what he thinks he means?
Tim is coming out of a small store across the street. He
hands a small bag of groceries to Adcox.
TIM
This everything you wanted?
Everyone grows suddenly silent.
A fireman's without even saying so, "Petzold" on the mailbox,
Engine 17 parked out front. Brian's alone outside, cleaning
the diesel fuel off his arms. Watching a small kid playing
with a toy fire truck in the drive.
Adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette,
lost in himself, watching the little boy play with his toy
fire truck. Stephen's followed him out.
AXE
This job... This fuckin' job
sometimes... To buy it trying to go
the extra yard, man, that's one thing,
but to buy it just because there
wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit...
Stephen leans down close.
STEPHEN
Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck
Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go
into fires for them. You know that.
Christ, you taught me that.
A beat of understanding between them. Stephen looks back at
the house.
STEPHEN
You know Knowlton pretty well?
AXE
Yeah...
STEPHEN
(beat)
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Adcox can't help but smile.
AXE
Biggest in two battalions.
STEPHEN
(beat, smiles)
We're gonna be okay, man...
An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built
in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training
building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each
level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready
beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.
STEPHEN
(looking at watch)
Alright... Go!
Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his
shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building.
There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags
the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.
STEPHEN
Go!
Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the
building.
STEPHEN
That isn't a football, probie. Get
it on your shoulder.
Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end.
Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another
two flights. It's a bitch.
Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming
up with another roll.
BRIAN
Having fun, fireman?
Tim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll.
STEPHEN
You're not breaking any records,
Brian.
Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a
roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.
STEPHEN
Your shoulder. Like this!
Brian lifts it to his shoulder.
STEPHEN
Come on! Pick it up!
They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows
Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word
spoken it's become a race between them.
Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go
up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A
thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats
burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and
SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his
feet.
STEPHEN
Run, damn you!
Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready
to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof,
Brian the "winner" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll,
sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian
starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.
STEPHEN
Roll the hose.
BRIAN
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Adcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back
into the station.
STEPHEN
You heard me.
We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped
badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.
BRIAN
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll
let you win next time.
STEPHEN
(in Brian's face)
You got a problem with drilling,
probie?
BRIAN
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with
drilling. But let's just have one
drill. Not one for the company and
one for me.
STEPHEN
Roll the hose.
Stephen turns and walks away. Brian stands there watching
him in blind fury, finally exploding.
BRIAN
Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna
quit. You hear me!
An awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by
the station alarm klaxon. Stephen smiles.
STEPHEN
Well, thank God for fires...

CUT TO:

Sequence omitted from original script.
Smoke and confusion. A MOTHER is screaming hysterically at
Stephen as he jumps down from the engine.
MOTHER
(grabbing his coat)
My baby! My baby's still up there!
BATTALION CHIEF
Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a
hoseline coming.
Stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. Brian
hesitates a beat, then follows.
Most of the firemen have gathered together for post-fire
coffee and stories. Brian sits off alone on the fire engine
bumper, apart from them. Santos walks up.
SANTOS
They think she's gonna live...
Stephen walks up. Sits down beside him.
STEPHEN
You okay?
BRIAN
I waited... I would have fucking
waited...
STEPHEN
That's not what it's about, Brian.
The point is there was a kid in there.
And what if there'd been two? I went
in because that's what I do. It's my
way. It's dad's way. It isn't
everybody's way.
BRIAN
Dad's way? Where did he tell you
that? In a fucking seance?
STEPHEN
You said you wanted to know something,
Brian. What did you learn today?
(Brian doesn't answer)
What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to
move on?
Brian lingers only a moment before standing.
BRIAN
You're right, Stephen... You win...
You're the best, man...
Brian hands Stephen his helmet and walks away.
Stephen drives past the burned-out brownstone that fried
Alan Seagrave. He parks in the alley behind, walks up the
building, and PULLS OFF a plywood sheet covering a blown-out
window.
A crumbling one in Chinatown. Brian checks the address on
his slip of paper. He stands there a beat, hating himself.
A pre-war theatre closed with a sign: UNDER RENOVATION --
OPENING XMAS 1991. DAVID BENTON, mid-forties, climbs out of
his car and walks to the entrance with some rolled-up
blueprints.
Later and engine companies have already knocked down the
building fire as Brian climbs out of Rimgale's red sedan.
SHADOW
(opens trunk)
Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make
yourself useful.
He starts handing Brian handfuls of equipment cases. Loaded
down, Brian follows Rimgale into the building.
On the short, sloping roof, Stephen stands hammering a shingle
back into place. Helen sticks her head out the dormer window.
HELEN
Stephen, what are you doing here?
STEPHEN
Fixing my roof.
HELEN
It's not your roof anymore.
He stops and tosses the hammer aside. Looks at his watch.
STEPHEN
Where's Sean?
HELEN
He's got piano lessons.
STEPHEN
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
HELEN
He's going to be a fireman.
STEPHEN
Give up, babe. You can't fight it.
Believe me, my mom tried...
HELEN
(beat)
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing
up on the roof like this.
STEPHEN
I just wanted to, I don't know, not
exactly apologize for the other night --
especially since I don't remember
much of it --
HELEN
-- You remember.
STEPHEN
Yeah... I just thought I should say,
I don't know, something.
HELEN
The great communicator.
STEPHEN
Sorry I hit Jackson.
HELEN
He deserved it. He was born deserving
it.
STEPHEN
He treats you okay?
HELEN
Okay.
STEPHEN
I treated you better.
HELEN
You treated me like shit.
But she smiles.
HELEN
You want some coffee?
STEPHEN
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
HELEN
What's wrong, Stephen?
(looks at her)
C'mon, you only beat up the roof
when something's on your mind.
(beat)
How's Brian doing?
STEPHEN
He's out.
HELEN
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
STEPHEN
Y'know, I treated him better than
any other probie I ever had. He
probably hates my guts, but I did
the best thing for him. I made him
finally look in the mirror.
HELEN
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really
about, isn't it? You always have to
be right.
STEPHEN
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when
I'm wrong.
HELEN
Yeah? When was the last time?
STEPHEN
In a fire? Never.
(beat)
Look, I'm his brother. I care about
him, y'know? He was going to get
himself killed. Maybe not today,
maybe not in a year, but it would've
happened. And I couldn't -- I just
couldn't...
HELEN
You can't keep being his father...
Stephen sighs deeply.
STEPHEN
You know what I realized today? I
can't remember my dad's face anymore.
There's pictures of him staring at
me everywhere I go, but the guy behind
them... he's gone...
He sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway.
STEPHEN
I'll see ya around, Helen.
She watches him as he walks lonely up the street.
A Latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against
a beautiful Chicago skyline. An AIR HORN blows, and suddenly
the skyline is MOVING. We're on a huge, private party boat.
Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing
parade of rich and beautiful. Across the sea of champagne
and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak.
He has his hand on her back.
Jennifer spots Brian. She smile, detaches herself and walks
over.
JENNIFER
Hi.
BRIAN
(eyes on Swayzak)
Hey...
(beat)
So are you dating your boss or what?
JENNIFER
If you weren't at least the 300th
person to ask me that, I'd probably
be pissed.
(beat, sighs)
Boy, you sure know it's a man's world
sometimes...
BRIAN
Sorry.
(beat)
Are you dating anyone?
JENNIFER
You think that's really any of your
business?
BRIAN
Well, you did invite me here.
JENNIFER
Marty did.
(beat, smiles)
But I wanted you to come to.
Swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage.
SWAYZAK
Mr. McCaffrey...
BRIAN
Nice boat.
SWAYZAK
It isn't mine.
(to photographer)
Let's get a picture.
Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's
shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker
to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm
sorry... Snap.
SWAYZAK
(seeing someone else)
Larry!
(sotto to Jennifer)
What does he do again?
Swayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to
the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear
the wind-up of a siren.
And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker
Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches
it disappear.
JENNIFER
How's the job going?
She's appeared again beside him.
BRIAN
Okay.
JENNIFER
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail,
isn't he?
BRIAN
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's
not a dummy, though. He's juggling
alot of balls on this one.
JENNIFER
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert
Einstein just to figure out if these
guys were killed by accidents or
not.
BRIAN
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't
enough proof yet to go public. Sure,
we found some chemical shit we think
somebody dumped in the plugs to torch
'em, and we've maybe figured out why
backdrafts, but you can't rush this
stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
JENNIFER
But Rimgale's probably going to come
around to arson.
BRIAN
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
BAMM!
Both of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind
has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow
tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by
the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.
JENNIFER
Save me.
The band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm
that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian
and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through
hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful
as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the
only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked
on each other.
Sweaty, flushed with the evening and a few drinks, Brian and
Jennifer pull up in her car.
BRIAN
Thanks for the invite.
JENNIFER
Got anything to drink in there?
BRIAN
Oh, there might be something stashed
away for emergencies.
Engine 17 roars up, lights flashing, to a high-rise. As the
crew jumps down Tim trips and falls flat on his face.
GRINDLE
Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill
yourself at least wait till the fire,
it's better P.R.
And before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly
pulling out into the street and WAILING off down the block.
The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the
flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves
it. She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost
in the blast of air, and together they hold each other as
the night screams past and...
Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise
fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to
pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl
away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come
out with it.
With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and
grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the
bed.
BRIAN
Excuse us.
Brian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when
suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a
stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus --
it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into
the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along. To hold
his hand.
Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street.
Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat
and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his
strength's gone. He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian.
As Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up. Swayzak
opens the rear door from inside.
SWAYZAK
Inspector.
SHADOW
Alderman.
Rimgale opens the door, climbs out, lingers.
SHADOW
Is there a connection between them,
Alderman?
SWAYZAK
Just catch the son of a bitch.
The door shuts and Swayzak roars away.
Sequence omitted from original script.
With glowing skyscrapers leaping up in the background, it's
an unexpectedly quiet, serene place along the lake. Jennifer
sits alone at a bench, watching an ancient fisherman look
for dinner, as Brian walks up.
JENNIFER
Hi.
BRIAN
Hi.
JENNIFER
We still talking?
(beat)
Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
BRIAN
Swayzak knows something about the
guys that were murdered. I want to
know why he keeps that hidden.
JENNIFER
I don't know anything about it.
BRIAN
You could check. It'd be in his files.
JENNIFER
(beat)
Do you know what you're asking me to
do?
BRIAN
Yes.
JENNIFER
Y'know, four years ago I was working
in a bakery. Two years ago I was
bringing Marty coffee and he didn't
even know my name. I run that office
now. Marty believed in me and I
believe in him. You want me to just
throw that away?
BRIAN
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
And it hangs between them, two people lonely on the edge of
the lake.
Stephen's sits quietly against Helen's back door, lost in
himself. A light comes on. Helen opens the back door.
HELEN
Stephen?
She sits down beside him.
STEPHEN
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
HELEN
What's wrong?
STEPHEN
I...
(beat)
It used to be, when I was a kid,
what meant most to me about this job
was there were no ifs. Life and death,
right and wrong. When someone called
the fire department, we came... Those
guys don't know how much I love
them... You don't leave people
hanging... cause that's what it's
all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till
death do us part. Isn't that what
you heard?... It's you go, we go...
Cause without that, it's the end of
families, it's the end of the fire
department... and when the fire
department stops coming... that's
the end of the fucking world...
(beat)
I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just...
it's just there's nobody I can talk
to...
(beat)
I miss you.
The moment lingers, grows heavy and grey.
Brian drives up and parks. He's half way to the staircase
when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car.
BRIAN
Jennifer?
She hands him a manila envelope.
BRIAN
What is --
JENNIFER
Just take it.
Silence.
BRIAN
I'm sorry.
JENNIFER
That's a dumb thing to say.
BRIAN
You're right.
She starts her car.
JENNIFER
Goodbye, Brian.
The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and
Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar.
They push the door open slowly.
helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater
pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom
door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door
a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...
Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the
gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING
FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian
slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient
himself.
SHADOW
Uh... I sorta got a problem here...
Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale
lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched
through his shoulder.
Brian climbs up onto Stephen's boat. Nobody home. He opens
the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights.
Brian stands before the fire station. His brother's and his.
BRIAN
(breathless)
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta
talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
STEPHEN
-- What are you doing here?
BRIAN
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn!
I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen,
he's been killing people!
STEPHEN
I know.
BRIAN
How do you know?
STEPHEN
I knew when you came looking for the
chemicals. Looking for me.
BRIAN
-- What were they doing there?
STEPHEN
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Grindles sticks his head out the back door.
GRINDLE
We gotta roll, Stevie...
STEPHEN
I'll be there.
GRINDLE
They're waitin' man.
STEPHEN
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Grindle goes back in.
STEPHEN
(to Brian)
Anything else?
BRIAN
What are we going to do about this?
STEPHEN
I'll handle it.
BRIAN
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
STEPHEN
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility.
I'll handle it. Me.
Stephen turns and walks toward the station.
Brian's eyes go to a window just above it. There, watching
him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.
Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as
Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.
BRIAN
Oh, Christ. Stephen...
He starts running for the station.
-- It's too late. Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine
company pulls out and whistles down the street.
The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian
hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks,
PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps
onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.
As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares
at Adcox sitting behind. The glimmer of an understanding...
The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.
A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS
the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID.
The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox,
and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a
stop.
It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt,
piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under
them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise
six blocks away.
He starts running.
Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along
the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically
through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for
number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a
passing captain.
BRIAN
Where are they? Where's 17?
CAPTAIN
On the roof.
Brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four
stories above him, feels the bile of fear in his throat, the
desperation, -- And begins strapping on an air tank.
Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an
extended aerial ladder.
Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black
clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as
the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding
you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.
Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks
for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart,
faces hidden behind helmets and masks.
Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen
near the edge, "17" on their helmets.
BRIAN
Stephen --
The helmets look up. Stephen and Adcox. Facing each other.
Adcox cradles an axe.
STEPHEN
Brian?
Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens
his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table.
A hissing black cloud drifts through. They're the only three
people on earth.
Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.
AXE
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
STEPHEN
-- What the fuck were you thinking,
huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
AXE
They were killing firemen, man. When
Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's
files... They were my friends, I had
to do it. I had to do it for the
department.
BRIAN
Did you do it for Tim?
AXE
(pain, to Stephen)
That was an accident! Jesus Christ,
why did you have to go in there so
fucking early? Why didn't you listen
to me!
Brian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge --
sixty feet up. Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a
massive stream at the side of the building.
AXE
You gotta let me finish --
BRIAN
Just come down, John. Just --
AXE
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking
puke if he saw how you've shit on
his department!
STEPHEN
-- Knock it off!
AXE
(to Stephen)
-- You can't let him turn you against
your friends, man --
BRIAN
-- He killed people --
AXE
-- You know what Swayzak would do to
the department if this got out? --
BRIAN
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
AXE
-- What he would do to your dad's
department? You gotta let me finish
it --
And there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on Stephen's
face.
BRIAN
You're his Lt., Stephen...
(beat)
Are you gonna handle it? Are you
Stephen?
STEPHEN
Shut up!
AXE
...What do you want me to do, Stephen?
Talk to me. What am I supposed to
do?
STEPHEN
(beat)
There's a fire. We've got a job here.
Let's get on with it.
The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's
happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and
Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them.
GRINDLE
Shit... It's going! Clear the roof!
Now!
Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as
Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS
and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.
The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING
steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.
Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole
races for them, SWALLOWING roof.
STEPHEN
Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn
it!
And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one
corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last
instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles --
Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --
-- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior
fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors
below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto
a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,
And falls.
We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.
Brian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an
ambulance.
STEPHEN
(smiles, weak)
You are such a pain in the ass...
As Brian jumps in with him
CUT TO:
A silent, quiet street absolutely empty of traffic. Then
over the crest of Chicago's mightiest thoroughfare, creeps
slowly a fire engine. It's emergency lights are on but not
the siren. This engine isn't in a hurry today.
Behind comes another fire engine. And another. Ten, twenty,
all of them creeping slowly along. And behind the engines
now walk firemen in their dress blues. Hundreds of them.
Walking silently in step behind
TWO COFFINS
Loaded in the rear of Engine 17. Santos drives as Grindle,
Brian, and the men of ladder company 46, walk behind. The
silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed
like dress swords. Average people stop, take their hats off.
Sequence omitted from original script.
Two coffins, lying side by side, draped in the blue and white
of the Chicago flag. A single fire helmet rests atop each
casket.
Brian stands at attention beside Helen. He holds the hand of
Stephen's son Sean, his eyes clouded with tears as a fire
dept. honor guard plays Taps. Jennifer's there, too far away
to touch.
Rimgale, still wearing a head bandage, stands stiffly beside
a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary.
SHADOW
In the Chicago Fire Department the
alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the
company has returned home to quarters.
We will now ring out that code to
welcome home John Adcox and Stephen
McCaffrey...
With a small hammer Rimgale rings out 3-3-5 on the bell.
The honor guard folds the flag covering Stephen's casket and
hands it to Helen, who holds it to her breast as we
DISSOLVE TO:
A sea of blue uniforms drifting across green as the funeral
breaks up. Brian hugs Helen and Sean. Lets them go.
Rimgale's there, resting against his dept. sedan as Brian
walks by, pauses, and leans on it beside him. A beat.
SHADOW
Your brother was a good man.
BRIAN
Yeah.
SHADOW
Another couple of good men get burned
up for their city? Is that how it's
going to read?
(Brian doesn't answer)
You're the only one that knows.
BRIAN
Like it never happened...
Rimgale turns to walk back to his sedan. He pauses. Looks
back to Brian.
SHADOW
Want to help me with something?
Brian walks down the hall. He passes Jennifer's small office.
She's in there, surrounded by packing boxes.
BRIAN
I think your boss is going to need
some spin control.
JENNIFER
I quit two days ago, Brian.
BRIAN
(beat)
What'll you do?
JENNIFER
I don't have the slightest idea...
BRIAN
I'll see ya around, huh?
JENNIFER
It's a small town.
DISSOLVE TO:
And morning breaking across the avenues and up against the
tired brick of firehouse 17.
And the fire engine slips away from us, down the avenue,
into the city as we
