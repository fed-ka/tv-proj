PARTY in progress. Laughter. Mingling. In the corner, CAITLIN
puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil. Samantha shepherds
her home room class past the punchbowl. She is radiant. EARL
surreptitiously nips from a silver flask.
SAMANTHA (V.O.)
3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade.
I have the key, I wear it around my
neck for luck. Except for that, and
my name, all traces of my prior life
are lost.
(beat)
Was I in love ever...? Did someone
look in my eyes, did I say, "Darling,
I'll never forget you...?"
(beat)
Because fuck me, darling, I managed.
ACROSS THE ROOM -- Her daughter CAITLIN hangs with two young
girls. Shows off a plush TEDDY BEAR, says:
CAITLIN
His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named
him for me.
GIRL #1 points, whispers excitedly:
GIRL #1
That's her?
Caitlin nods. Kid #2:
GIRL #2
That's who?
GIRL #1
(excitedly)
Her Mom, she's got amnesia.
GIRL #2
Swear?
CAITLIN
Swear.
GIRL #2
Too weird.
A voice interrupts their reverie:
SAMANTHA
Excuse me.
The girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha is leaning on
the desk behind them. Busted. She smiles amiably:
SAMANTHA
Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to
help Dad with the refreshments.
(leans in, whispers)
Which one's Dad? I forget.
The girls look at her like she's grown a tail.
SAMANTHA
*Kidding*.
CUT TO:
A DOOR KICKED OPEN, WHAM-! Splintered. Lock shattered.
A NUDE COUPLE on the bed. They look up, startled -- as three
men burst through the door. The LEADER: a haggard-looking
man sporting a soup-stain on his tie, whoops, that's the
design, sorry. MITCH HENESSEY, private investigator and con
man extraordinaire. He flashes a phony badge:
YOUNG MAN
POLICE. DON'T MOVE.
MAN ON BED
What the hell is this...?!!
YOUNG MAN
Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're
assuming I won't shoot your sorry
ass, and everyone knows when you
make an assumption, you make an ass
out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant
Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude,
jerkoff, I will see to it you spend
the next ten years in prison getting
ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown
out because my arrest is too violent,
then I will personally HIRE men to
ass-fuck you for ten years. So if
you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead
and mouth off, but meanwhile you're
under arrest for the crime of
prostitution, now shut the fuck up
before I cut out your kneecaps and
use 'em as ashtrays.
(beat)
Officer Donleavy, read him his rights.
Donleavy looks pale, pasty. He stutters a few words. Loses
interest. Wanders away across the room.
MAN ON BED
(a trifle confused)
Please, this is my first, I... I've
never done this before, I'll do
anything...!
YOUNG MAN
Sir, listen to me. I understand you're
not a wealthy man, but in light of
the damage this arrest will cause
you, we might be able to make an
arrangement --
Donleavy plops in a chair. Belches. Grins foolishly. The man
in bed points to him:
MAN IN BED
Is he all right...?
THE REMAINING COP is swaying on his feet. Like a tree in a
hurricane. Donleavy pukes all over the floor. We CUT TO:
THERE'S THE GIRL. The one in bed moments ago. She and Henessey
are dividing a wad of bills.
GIRL
We gotta stop using bums.
MITCH
(lights a smoke)
Forget it. They looked like cops. We
pulled it off, didn't we?
GIRL
It was embarrassing.
MITCH
You want I should hire actors, for
Chrissake? These guys are cheap,
they work for food.
GIRL
Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over
you is that, like, a refund?
MITCH
Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here,
you're so funny. What's this?
He indicates an envelope earmarked for him. Labeled in magic
marker: SAMANTHA CAINE.
TRIN
New case, honest to God chick with
amnesia. You want the job?
Henessey opens the envelope. Extracts a black and white HEAD
SHOT of Samantha, says immediately:
HENESSEY
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
Stares, mesmerized. Trin peers over his shoulder:
TRIN
Wasn't there a lady on TV named
Samantha? Had a magic nose or
something.
HENESSEY
'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick
lived with a faggy guy, then in the
last season it was a different faggy
guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on
the horn to amnesia chick, tell her
yes. Then tell her in 1967 she
promised to give me a blow job. Worth
a try, right?
A tired TV set drones to an audience of one. Let's call him
ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's give him one eye, the other
replaced by a PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on
the chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances at the TV screen.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.)
...So much for the flame-swallowing
Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile,
KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky,
where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle
turned out to celebrate her hubby's
worldwide tour. After one look at
her, I'm thinking Santa got what he
wanted this Christmas.
The happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack
isn't talking or breathing either. He's simply STARING at
the TV screen, jaw slack...
ONE-EYED JACK
Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No
way. SHIIIT!!
He SCREAMS as we CUT TO:
SAMANTHA drives while Earl (the SANTA we saw earlier)
reclines, still drunk.
EARL
You're married what now, five
years...?
He makes a thumb circle. Jabs his finger in and out of it:
EARL
You and Hal, how often you two...?
SAMANTHA
Stick our fingers in out hands and
pull them out again? Every chance we
get. Shut your piehole.
EARL
Don't get all snippy...
SAMANTHA
Earl, do me a favor. Every few words
say "hic" and have bubbles come out
your mouth, okay?
EARL
Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a
drunk man have this much raw talent?
He starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear, she
can't help it, snorts laughter --
THE ADULT DEER appears perfectly framed in the Sunbird's
headlights. Dead ahead. Sam looks up, face etched in sudden
TERROR. *No time to think*. SWERVES, no dice...! BROADSIDES
the animal --
And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and
fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether.
Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through --
But the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING.
Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage. A FLAILING HOOF
takes out Earl. Kills him in less than a second. Collapses
his skull.
Sam rides the wheel, screaming. An antler gouges her chest.
Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits the tree doing
50.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Sam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward
bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood... And then she's
flying. Slow motion, end over end... We lose all SOUND.
Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird
noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high --
Sam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air... Whoomph-!
Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette.
Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu
sarcophagus. Out of sight.
THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene
from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from
the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood.
She stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though
it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's
something wrong about her *eyes*.
En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer,
its flesh scorched and torn -- and KILLS it. Puts it away
with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes
squirming with madness...
The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping
blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN.
A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She
watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat --
With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground.
The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away...
DISSOLVE TO:
Samantha, having survived. Laid up now in an austere hospital
room. Listening to silence. Stares out the window at a sunlit
tree. Head bandaged. Frowns:
SAMANTHA
I want a cigarette, why do I want a
cigarette...?
Outside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides
off the edge of consciousness...
IN THE DREAM: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an
incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring at her reflection --
it's bleeding from a scalp wound.
She probes her head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing but the tiny
RIDGED SCAR she's had for as long as she can remember.
SAMANTHA
What... what do you want...?
The reflection eyes her grimly. Haggard. Tired.
REFLECTION
I want a cigarette.
SAMANTHA
I don't smoke.
REFLECTION
(chuckles)
You used to.
Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to
her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except
Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody
reflection takes a long, satisfying drag.
REFLECTION
Relax, you can drop the act. Nice
and smooth, take another hit. There
you go. See how easy it comes back?
They are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily.
REFLECTION
*I'm* coming back. You know that,
don't you? Name's Charly, by the
way. You're gonna love me.
The reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH.
Back at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION
has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves
toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind.
HAL
Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong
about this.
SAMANTHA
I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are
coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I
know it.
CAITLIN
Daddy, make her stop!
SAMANTHA
Hush. Go to the garage and get me
something, anything. A veggie, go,
man, go! I'm hot to trot.
Hal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the
fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door.
HAL
Tomato.
Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam --
CAITLIN
Tomato.
Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds
to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur.
Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a
mad mumblety-pegger --
HAL
Onion, flying in.
Sam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up.
SAMANTHA
More. Faster.
And it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin
who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and
even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to
lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another,
she giggles, starts throwing them overhand --
CAITLIN
Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.
And now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is
COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up
Caitlin --
Samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last,
lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think:
Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance.
Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to
the wall, KA-CHUK--!
Everyone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal
turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks.
SAMANTHA
Uh... chefs do that.
Underground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces
hum and tick in the sweaty gloom.
A SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him,
what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably
attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in
the eye as the guy blubbers:
MAN
Please, man... I don't know why you
gotta kill me... But use the gun,
not the knife. Please. As a fucking
favor, I'm begging you...
TIMOTHY
It'll be over soon.
MAN
Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the
knife... Shit, I can't handle getting
shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...!
TIMOTHY
Last chance. What do you know about
a town called Santa Claus?
MAN
What is this, *what the fuck is
this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you
can't do this to me. I don't know
ANYTHING.
Timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as
though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied.
TIMOTHY
No. You don't.
(beat)
I can always tell, you know... If
someone's lying to me. A little skill
of mine, something to trot out at
parties.
He slams home the knife. We don't see it, but we FEEL the
impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches
away from Timothy, their eyes lock...
A CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it
from his belt and flips it open:
TIMOTHY
Timothy.
VOICE (O.S.)
Message from Mr. Daedalus.
TIMOTHY
I'm listening.
He shrugs at his captive. Rolls his eyes. The guy's still
dying, still on the KNIFE.
VOICE (O.S.)
He says he's sorry, but he needs you
right away. Something's come up.
TIMOTHY
Nix. I'm just finishing up here.
Then I'm going bunjee jumping.
VOICE (O.S.)
He's aware of your weekend plans,
and he apologizes.
TIMOTHY
All right, what's so fucking
important?
VOICE (O.S.)
Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack...?
Recently escaped from a high-security
prison, as you're aware. But listen
to this: prior to his escape, seems
he saw something on TV that disturbed
him. So much he had to be sedated.
TIMOTHY
I saw it, too. It's called "Empty
Nest." How the fuck is it my business?
VOICE (O.S.)
The man was overheard talking to
himself under sedation.
(beat)
He said Charly Baltimore's alive,
sir.
Timothy is silent.
SUIT
I know it's incredible, sir, but...
if she were alive, I'm thinking she
might be in contact with the old man
in Pennsylvania. Should I --
TIMOTHY
Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus
I'm on my way. Timothy out.
He clicks off, face troubled. Withdraws the knife. Checks
his clothing. Not one speck of blood.
A CARTON OF MARLBORO REDS hits the stack of groceries. HAL
looks at his wife, bewildered.
SAMANTHA
They were on sale.
At the next register over, a duo of Canadians throw looks
her way. Confer in rapid-fire French, subtitled for us:
CANADIAN #1
Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. (Subtitle:
I'd like to fuck her.)
The checker looks up, smiles:
CHECKER
Don't you love hearing people speak
French?
CANADIAN #2
Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour
d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une
femme c'est comme Gumby avec des
seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her
over a chair, women are merely Gumbys
with tits.)
HAL
Beautiful language.
He turns to Samantha -- except Sam isn't there. Her arm shoots
out-! CLAMPS on one of the men. By the throat. Catches him
like a fucking VICE. Her voice a sibilant hiss:
SAMANTHA
*Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils
de pute*.
Subtitle: "Gumby's gonna stretch your neck, motherfucker."
Accent flawless. Eyes like steel. The man will go on to start
a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits.
SLAM CUT TO:
SAMANTHA - ON THE PHONE TO HER SHRINK - INTERCUT
Jubilant, can't contain herself:
SAMANTHA
I speak French.
PSYCHIATRIST
You do.
SAMANTHA
You bet your life, fluent French,
whatever the fuck that means.
(chortles)
Quand j'tais a l'ecole, Jai eu un
professeur qui s'est fabriqu du
dentifrice!
PSYCHIATRIST
You just said when you were in school,
your teacher was made of toothpaste.
SAMANTHA
Right, he was, you got a problem
with that? Pasty Joe, we called him.
Look, the accent's perfect, so piss
off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.
CAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST
CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter-
top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone,
saying:
SAMANTHA
Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas
station... Right. Thank you Mr.
Henessey, I'll see you shortly.
She hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn
around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the
linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes:
HAL
She rode all the way home. She didn't
fall, not once. She didn't cry.
(beat)
You're good. You should work with
kids, you know that?
SAMANTHA
She said her wrist hurt. I didn't
know it was broken, God. I can't
even remember what I said to her...!
Hal takes a breath, composes himself.
HAL
We can still make six o'clock mass,
you coming?
Sam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging
pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers:
SAMANTHA
A private detective's coming by,
he... he's found something.
(beat)
I may have to go away. For a bit.
Now please leave me alone.
HAL
Go away. With a detective. Jesus,
it's the holidays, Sam --
SAMANTHA
Are you deaf? I said leave me alone.
Go to church. Drink blood. Drink
some for me.
They stand in tableau. An electric silence... Broken quite
suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside
the front door. The sweet strains of "God Rest Ye Merry,
Gentlemen" wafts in through the window.
Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are
TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at
each other, what the hell...?
Samantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive
M&M;'s. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS.
Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door.
Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK.
ONE-EYED JACK
Evening Charly. Long time.
He swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass
shatters, M&M;'s everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck,
unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision,
live or *die* --
SHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps
CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers --
CAITLIN
Mommy...!
SAMANTHA
GET OUUTTTTT!!!!
Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from
the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave,
useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip
to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS,
over and over on broken ribs --
JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs.
Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of
the stairs, paralyzed.
SAMANTHA
NO!!!!
Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws
a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M;'s. Goes down. Gun
goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A
storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward
her daughter --
JACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS
three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can
see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter --
flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her
by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...!
She hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum,
slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the
IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--!
A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind.
ONE-EYED JACK
I want my eye back, bitch.
Samantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the
shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf --
Slams it against her head.
ONE-EYED JACK
Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong
with you, *fight* me!
CLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in
the face.
Jack raises his arm for the killing stroke -- Samantha takes
Hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in
his face.
Comes from nowhere. Back foot planted, body twisting, entire
organism focused into the outstretched arm, WHACK-! We have
never seen anyone move this fast. Samantha RECOILS. Startled
by what she's done --
The glass dish is SPLINTERED into his head. It STICKS there.
He topples. Hits the linoleum. She straddles him, breathing
hard. Winded.
The barking dog "Jingle Bells" plays inanely in the
background. Samantha stares. Trembling. Pokes the body.
Nothing. Pokes it again. Still nothing. She leans forward.
Grips the neck and wrenches, CRACK-! Just making sure.
She out of it. In shock. Glaring at her own hands as if
demanding an excuse for their behavior. There is pie filling
on her fingers. She kneels beside the corpse, catatonic.
Stares. Absent-mindedly licks the bloodied cream.
HAL is standing in the doorway. Wide-eyed. He has seen
Samantha break the man's neck. She looks at him, frowns.
SAMANTHA
It took me three seconds. That's...
that's good, huh...?
He stares, dumbstruck. She blinks. *Snaps out of it*.
SAMANTHA
Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.
She gets up. We RUN with her to the front door -- she flings
it open and collides with MITCHELL HENESSEY. Private dick.
Runs right into him.
HENESSEY
Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay,
she's in my car, what the hell is
going on?
Henessey spins, as FOUR POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Vomit up a
bevy of COPS, swarming toward the house. He spins back to
Samantha -- As she collapses to the floor.
FADE OUT:
Pause. FADE IN. Super the legend: ONE WEEK LATER.
ESTABLISHING - SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - MORNING
Early morning quiet. HENESSEY and SAMANTHA are throwing
suitcases into the back of his battered Chrysler.
Sam's looked better. Kneels beside Caitlin, says softly:
SAMANTHA
That man who tried to hurt us...? If
I stay here... other people will
come. I have to leave. Just for a
little while.
Caitlin looks at the floor. Doesn't respond. Samantha reaches
in a cupboard. Produces a box of CANDLES. Lights a match,
touches flame to one of them.
SAMANTHA
I want you to light a candle and
keep it in the kitchen window. And
never, *ever* let it go out, because
as long as it burns...? It means
you're thinking of me. And if I'm
alone... if it's dark and I'm lost...
It's how I'll find my way home.
She touches Caitlin's wrist cast. Pain in her features. She
grabs a marker pen and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it.
SAMANTHA
That's for a portable phone. I keep
it with me, you call me anytime, you
don't worry about the bill. And last
but not least --
She reaches behind her head. Unhooks the KEY, the one she
wears around her neck.
SAMANTHA
For luck.
Slips it over her daughter's head. Looks up at HAL, eyes
brimming. He whispers:
HAL
No matter what you find, I'm not
scared. Not of you. Not ever...
Henessey sings with the radio. Loudly. He's got the lyrics
wrong: "I'm not talking 'bout the linen... And I don't wanna
change your life..."
Samantha endures as much as she can. Speaks up:
SAMANTHA
"Movin' in."
HENESSEY
Hah?
SAMANTHA
It's not linen. The song's not about
linen.
HENESSEY
Whatever. You cold?
SAMANTHA
(shivers)
I'm freezing.
HENESSEY
Turn on the heater. It doesn't work,
but it makes a very annoying noise
which distracts from the cold.
SAMANTHA
I'll pass.
(clears her throat)
So, you're a former cop. Atlanta,
was it...? Stop me if I'm out of
line, but I'm curious. How did you...
well, succeed? I mean, where six
other detectives failed?
HENESSEY
You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my
secretary used her feminine wiles.
She's got two, one wile per side.
Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em
coming around a corner, you got time
to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd
dig her.
(beat)
Ah. Here we are.
An old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete
hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers:
WALRUS MAN
The elder Trelawney rented to her in
'87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself
to dispose of her things. I'faith,
she's welcome to whatsoe'er she
wishes, for ne'er has trod these
walls a lass so easy on the eye,
divil take me if I'm lyin'.
Henessey lights a cigarette, says:
HENESSEY
Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me
Lucky Charms."
ANGUS
"Always after me Lucky Charms."
HENESSEY
Thanks. Just needed to hear that.
Drab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm
implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner.
HENESSEY
See anything you recognize?
SAMANTHA
Yeah, this dirt used to be outside
my window, shut up and let me look.
(sighs)
I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little
on edge.
She pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in
her eye... says softly:
SAMANTHA
I can feel her. Like a ghost.
(beat)
We could walk away, you know. There's
still time, we could just... leave
her dead.
She hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp
breath:
SAMANTHA
Ay-i-yi!
Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest,
the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags:
SAMANTHA
Size four, no way. You know how long
it's been since I could wear a size
four?
(beat)
Can't be mine. Can they...?
She checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...?
Henessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear.
Holds up a small manila envelope.
HENESSEY
Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a
guy.
SAMANTHA
What's in it?
HENESSEY
Another guy's address. Two addresses,
is basically what I'm saying.
Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A
SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the
mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam
looks like she just took a stomach punch.
Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still
be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything.
She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it.
HENESSEY
Anything else in there?
SAMANTHA
Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes.
HENESSEY
Yeah, well take a look at this.
He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*.
Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to
him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO:
NATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid-
seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE
watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself.
Windeman scowls:
NATHAN
Alice, please...?
Alice stares at him. Uncomprehending.
NATHAN
Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.
ALICE
What's wrong with the dog?
NATHAN
It's simple. He's been licking his
asshole for three straight hours. I
submit to you that there's nothing
there worth more than an hour's
attention, and I should think whatever
he's attempting to dislodge is either
gone for good or there to stay.
*Wouldn't you agree*?
Theatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats
feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up:
NATHAN
Hello?
The voice is soft. Controlled:
SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number
from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd
like to speak with you.
NATHAN
Who... who is this?
SAMANTHA
You tell me, Mr. Windeman.
Nathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages:
NATHAN
...Charly...?
SAMANTHA (O.S.)
My full name, please.
NATHAN
God, it really is you...!? Chapter,
they think you're dead, *everyone*
thinks --
SAMANTHA
*My full name*. Please...!
A pause. Then:
NATHAN
You don't know your name.
He chews his lower lip, mind racing. Jesus, no joke, this is
*her*... He fights to control his voice:
NATHAN
Your full name... is Charlene
Elizabeth Baltimore.
A MAN in shirtsleeves flips a switch. Speaks into a headset:
MAN
Signal Daedalus. We just got her,
she made contact. Initiating phone
trace.
NATHAN
Charly, don't talk, just listen: We
have to meet, understand? We have to
meet *right away*.
SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Meet me off I-79. Highmile exit,
Salt & Pepper Lounge. Eleven a.m.
She hangs up. Nathan stares, trembling. Turns to ALICE,
standing in the doorway. Swallows hard, says:
NATHAN
A former student... is in trouble.
She hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room. Stands, alone
in the stillness. Hands to her head, mind churning...
Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. Props her
SUITCASE on the sink and opens it. Flips back the mound of
clothing --
And there it is. The pieces, disassembled, of an M-40 sniper
rifle. Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their
own volition... Hefting them. Gauging their feel. And then,
slowly... terrifyingly...
Knowing how they go together. She SNAPS the barrel in place,
*click*-! The sound breaks her reverie. She drops the thing
like it's alive. Looks down, trembling...
ALSO in the case: a wicked looking HUNTING KNIFE. She picks
it up gingerly. Shiny, brand new. Turns it over in her hand,
fascinated by the play of light off the blade...
Looks up. Her REFLECTION, in the mirror. Staring back. She
frowns -- It frowns. She turns away --
THE REFLECTION DOESN'T. It stays right fucking put, except
now it's *smiling*. Malignant. Deadly. Sam feels something
wrong. Spins back toward the mirror --
Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. Reaches
into Sam's world and SLICES FOR HER THROAT.
Hostage drama, unfolding. The perp's a big ugly meatloaf
with his mitts on a waitress. She's sixteen, she's a baby.
She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun. His finger on the
trigger. From outside, we hear the COPS:
COP VOICE (O.S.)
GIVE YOURSELF UP AT ONCE. LEAVE THE
BUILDING, HANDS ON HEAD. DROP THE
WEAPON, REPEAT, DROP THE WEAPON.
Mr. Shotgun snorts laughter. Does a little dance, yells:
MR. SHOTGUN
I'm the man! I'm the man! I elicit
the explicit!
Henessey swears. Swings wide, when suddenly a HAND clutches
his arm. He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's
eyes have gone dead and cold. She lights a cigarette, shakes
out the match and says:
SAMANTHA
Go up this hill.
HENESSEY
Why?
SAMANTHA
*Drive up the fucking hill*.
Now Henessey shivers. Cranks the wheel as we CUT TO:
Mr. Shotgun dies on his feet. Outgoing matter. Flung.
Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt
hamburger. He drops. Screams. Pandemonium.
Samantha stares straight ahead. Gives a high, brittle laugh.
SAMANTHA
See? Took care of it. Knew I could.
She laughs again. Henessey favors her with a look reserved
for people with major deformities. Suddenly she says:
SAMANTHA
Pull over.
He stops the car. She gets out. Stumbles across the shoulder.
Kneels. Throws up. Henessey watches. Lights a smoke with
trembling hands.
SAMANTHA
Had to, he... he would've killed
her... Had to... Oh God I took him,
such a good shot... I felt proud of
it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I
be proud*...?
(sobs)
I'm scared... I want to go home...
Henessey kneels beside her awkwardly. She clutches his
shoulder. Presses her head to his chest. Cries.
Three stories below the White House proper. THE PRESIDENT is
seated in his robe and slippers. Before him sits a panel of
three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the
CIA; and ANOTHER MAN in his sixties, sporting a distinguished
mane of silver hair. The President addresses him:
PRESIDENT
*Mister Perkins*.
(frowns)
Please, say it again, I'm a little
slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You
lost an operative, a trained
counterassassin, and you just saw
her on TV in a Christmas parade.
The silver-haired man appears unperturbed. And no, by the
way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with
Caitlin's TEDDY BEAR, the one Mom named -- He nods, says:
SILVER-HAIRED MAN
On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks
old, intelligence just caught it.
PRESIDENT
You recruited this woman in the late
seventies?
SILVER-HAIRED MAN
For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of
her father's, you see, and... I took
her in.
PRESIDENT
Well, it looks like she returned the
favor, now doesn't it?
(throws up his hands)
Unbelievable. You people, you dump
this on me, then next week you're
screaming, "Where's our funding?"
Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can
you say health care?
The head of the CIA pipes up:
CIA DIRECTOR
Mr. President, please calm down. The
CIA bears no responsibility for this
problem.
PRESIDENT
Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many
double agents you got on the payroll,
last count...?
CIA DIRECTOR
Sir! That controversy has been
thoroughly dealt with, and if there
still exists a leak, perhaps this...
woman agent of his --
SILVER-HAIRED MAN
If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore
hasn't had classified access since
1987.
(beat)
But thank you, Kent, for trying to
fuck me in the ass.
He directs his baleful gaze at the President. Lights a pipe.
SILVER-HAIRED MAN
I'm afraid rooting out double agents
may have to wait. The primary threat
is the woman. Her specialty is
counterassassination, a horseshit
turn of phrase which implies the
other fellow shot first, but in point
of fact she's a takeout artist of
the first order. Nearly disposed of
our friend the Beard down in Cuba a
few years back. Specializes in long
rifles, accurate to a mile and a
half. Presumed dead; now, after eight
years, back in the field, agenda
unknown. She knows enough to hurt
us. I'm frightened. Understand?
PRESIDENT
Yes, yes. I believe you. Just one
question:
(beat)
*What in pluperfect hell is she doing
in a Christmas parade*???
Henessey is on the phone to his ex-wife. Glowering.
HENESSEY
Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out
eight months, I'm back doing skip
traces, now you got me stealing
fuckin' bicycles?
EX-WIFE (O.S.)
I don't want you around Todd, hear
me? Shrink told me what those men
did to you in prison. This is a
Christian household, my son's not
gonna develop any... tendencies.
Understand?
For a moment her ignorance is so stunning he's speechless.
Then he slams down the phone. Cracks it. Returns to the pumps,
where SAMANTHA leans against his car, still dazed. Looks up
at him, says:
SAMANTHA
I still can't believe it. You're
saying my hands didn't even shake...?
Henessey doesn't look at her. Puts the nozzle back in the
pump. Crosses to the driver side without a word.
SAMANTHA
What's the matter with you?
HENESSEY
You. You're the matter. Look, you
wanna keep going, good luck. I'm
driving back to Ohio. You're free to
come with me.
SAMANTHA
What... what are you telling me?
He gets into the car. Starts the engine. Samantha reacts,
distraught. Leans in, kills the ignition. Pulls him out of
the car.
HENESSEY
Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you
*home*.
She slaps him. HARD. He falls back, stunned.
SAMANTHA
I'll spell it out for you, ready? I
have no future, *I can't go home*.
Until I know what's happening, I'm
in *prison*, you know how that
feels...?
HENESSEY
Yeah, matter of fact. Four years
inside. Marion, Illinois, real
shithole. Get in the car.
SAMANTHA
I'm sorry.
(clears her throat)
Um... what did you...?
HENESSEY
Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and
my partner, we handled a lot of
impounded shit. Fucker hated me,
boy. One weekend, when he was
conveniently gone...? Some bearer
bonds disappeared from his office.
And lo and behold, when the police
responded to an anonymous tip, you'll
never guess what just happened to be
sitting in my closet.
SAMANTHA
The bonds. Your partner put them
there?
HENESSEY
(laughs)
Hell no, I did, I stole the fucking
things.
He serious. Samantha frowns, a little thrown -- Then she
snorts, loses it. They both lean against his Chrysler.
HENESSEY
Now every dollar I hand my kid, he
asks his mother did I steal it.
He smiles ruefully. Spits. A pause, then:
HENESSEY
No more killing.
Samantha's voice is cool and level:
SAMANTHA
No more killing.
She blows her nose.
SAMANTHA
It was a helluva shot, wasn't it..."
DISSOLVES TO:
ESTABLISHING - SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - MORNING
A gunmetal grey sky looms overhead. The aforementioned LOUNGE
is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud-
covered trucks. The kind that get a man laid in these parts.
HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt.
He'll never get any.
Honky-tonk. SAMANTHA and HENESSEY enter, blinking in the
dimness. Around them, drunk mid-day cowboys. Stringy-haired
girls in their ample laps. SAMANTHA consults her watch:
SAMANTHA
Quarter til. Any time now.
They sit at the counter. Henessey flags the bartender. Signals
for a beer. Lights a cigarette, blows smoke:
HENESSEY
Nice crowd.
SAMANTHA
You're just jealous of their
girlfriends.
HENESSEY
Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's
a beaut. While you're doing her doggie-
style you can pop the zits on her
back.
Samantha shoots him a look. ON A TV above the bar, a British-
sounding CNN announcer is saying:
CNN COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
Violence in Northern Ireland continues
today, despite a plea by British
prime minister John Major --
Samantha sits up straight. Draws a sharp breath. He shoots
her a questioning look --
SAMANTHA
I just... got a flash of something,
I...
(blinks)
I hurt my father.
HENESSEY
Whoa. You remember your father?
SAMANTHA
No... that's what's strange.
(shakes her head)
If I saw him on the street, I... I
wouldn't... oh.
She rubs her eyes. Her voice breaks. She's utterly miserable.
Henessey leans in, says softly:
HENESSEY
Ms. Caine, last week at a party I
ran into a girl I knew from college
and we chatted for a few minutes.
And it wasn't til I was driving home
on the freeway that I remembered
that I'd screwed her in the back of
a car once.
(beat)
Everyone forgets.
He pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares.
SAMANTHA
That's it? That's your helpful story?
Jesus Christ!
HENESSEY
No, see, all's I'm saying is you're
not alone.
SAMANTHA
Oh, shut up.
HENESSEY
Fine. I gotta use the head.
He stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette.
The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She
reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her.
She turns...
The assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away.
TIMOTHY
For you. Another in a long line of
bad investments.
SAMANTHA
Excuse me?
TIMOTHY
Just saw the ring on your finger.
He reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says:
TIMOTHY
Do I know you from somewhere...?
Grimaces:
TIMOTHY
Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line,
let's forget I said that.
Still staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION
on her features. She gives him a cursory smile.
SAMANTHA
Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't
know you.
Timothy nods slowly.
TIMOTHY
No, you don't, do you...? I'd know
if you did. I can tell if someone's
lying.
(smiles)
Sorry to bother you.
He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a
very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar,
whispers into a concealed transmitter:
TIMOTHY
Okay, people, I got what I needed.
Wait until she comes out. Then do
them both.
(beat)
Walk soft, we got local law.
He sits back as TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES suddenly enter, doffing
their stetsons. Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of
the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow.
Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door.
SAMANTHA
(sotto)
What are you doing?
HENESSEY
Pork. On your nine.
SAMANTHA
So?
HENESSEY
So you shot a guy in the head
yesterday. We wait outside.
SAMANTHA
It's freezing.
HENESSEY
Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other
people in the head. Just themselves.
During that show with the little
girl who's a robot.
The snapped-in-two hitman announces Nathan's arrival by FLYING
THROUGH THE WINDOW in an explosion of glass. Caroms off a
table and bounces head over heels. Hits, dead.
TIMOTHY swears. Leaps up and bolts for the door, right behind
the SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, as
NATHAN kicks in the afterburners. Squinting, can't see...
WIPERS, squeaking to and fro. Erasing the hitman's blood.
Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose. Nathan steals a
look in the rear view mirror. Gets his first good view of
Samantha. Reacts, stunned:
NATHAN
Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe
what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*.
This is not what she expected to hear.
SAMANTHA
I'm... um, I mean... what?
NATHAN
What in God's hell have you been
*eating*, you look positively bovine!
Hang on.
50 yards down the highway. Beside a parked car, a guy with
an ELEPHANT GUN.
SAMANTHA
Oh, God, no more--!
The big rifle BUCKS concussively. The car window SPLINTERS...!
Does not break.
NATHAN
Bulletproof. Put it in myself.
Almost as an afterthought, he swerves slightly. CRUNCHES the
gunman against the parked car. Shatters him. His SCREAMING
VISAGE goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto
her window...
Scenery whips past. In the backseat, Henessey is trembling;
Samantha comatose. Nathan snaps his fingers sharply:
NATHAN
Charlene, darling --
SAMANTHA
My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.
NATHAN
(exasperated)
Yes, yes, you said that on the phone.
*Must* I point out to you that the
letters in the name SAM CAINE, when
rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your
mind was missing a name, so it simple
invented one that was an anagram of
your current condition.
Samantha reacts, floored.
NATHAN
Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher,
that was your cover! Your memory was
gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT
YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio
housewife business, it's a fantasy,
you *wrote* the bloody thing!
SAMANTHA
It's not a fantasy, *I'm in the
fucking PTA*.
NATHAN
Then quit. You're an assassin for
the United States government.
(beat)
I ought to know, I trained you.
Henessey is so shocked he's LAUGHING:
HENESSEY
Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.
Sam SCREAMS as the side windows COLLAPSE INWARD. Nathan rides
the wheel, swerving.
HENESSEY
*What happened to bulletproof*?
NATHAN
*The side windows were next, I swear*.
BACK WITH TIMOTHY
Watching them go. Oh, well. He tried, right...? Did his best,
tomorrow's another day --
Without missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of
the road. ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a
fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast-
approaching windshield. Kills the driver.
The car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing
juggernaut, immense...!
He vaults the hood without breaking stride. Catches the drive-
side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the
corpse and the car *never stops moving*.
Completes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water...
and then he's stomping the gas. Utterly relentless. Leaving
behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse.
Timothy GUNS IT, eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre --
Hears a SCREECH. Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: POLICE
CRUISER. Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in
behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar.
Nathan fishes a gun from his coat. Hands it to Samantha.
NATHAN
Here, you might as well have one
too.
SAMANTHA
My God. How many do you carry?
NATHAN
Three. One shoulder, one hip, and
one right next to Mr. Wally --
(pats his groin)
Where most patdowns never reveal it,
as an agent is often reluctant to
feel up another man's groin.
Henessey looks out the back windshield, says:
HENESSEY
Got a tail.
Nathan looks, SWEARS. The chase car's gaining on them.
NATHAN
Lucky bastard found the only cool
car in the fucking midwest.
He accelerates into a curve. Rockets past a connecting road,
as, without warning -- ANOTHER COP CAR skids out of the side
road, after him. The other deputy...
TIMOTHY, boxed. Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the
deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's
TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car
careens into a GULLEY --
BAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back
end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares
continuously.
UP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door
opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his
crippled black-and-white.
Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing
as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching
the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS.
They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom
of the gulley.
INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also
very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door.
Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases
it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He
puts a shot through the radio. Silences it.
Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan
and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...
Girl, moving. Walls racing past, shot to PIECES, run run run
into her bedroom and LURCHES to a stop, screaming:
GIRL
*DA*!
Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive.
Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused
to die, simply couldn't, you see... Not until he reached his
daughter.
ANGLE ON BED
Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just
stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his
gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.
BRIGADIER
How much...
He raises the pistol to his head.
BRIGADIER
...did they pay you...?
He fires. On a young girl's dissolve into insanity we FADE
OUT... Sound, echoing away. Blackness, total.
FADE IN:
Waking is slow.
Samantha opens her eyes. Blinks. Hazy, out of focus. Tries
to rub her eyes, can't. Hands. Something's wrong, what the
hell'd she do with her hands...? Ah. They're stretched over
her head. BOUND WITH CORD. Suddenly she's very awake.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The basement of the old converted mill. A drafty, windswept
place full of old, broken timbers. A river runs through it.
A stream, at any rate. The waters are still and frozen now.
Above the stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary
of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis.
SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel. Lashed to its SIDE, affixed
to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship. Now the bad
news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can TURN...
And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath
the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing
only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.
THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her, giving
instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks up at
Samantha. Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry
wave. Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place,
a frightening arrogance. He tosses her his cheeriest wave:
DAEDALUS
Well, good afternoon. If it isn't
the forgetful spy. How you feeling?
SAMANTHA
Not-so fresh.
Samantha struggles against her bonds. No dice. Subsides.
Takes a look around at her predicament. TIMOTHY stands at
the edge of the ice. Watching her intently. Smiles thinly:
SAMANTHA
You... you're... the man from the
bar...?
TIMOTHY
Look at her. She's not faking it,
she doesn't know me from Adam.
Daedalus shakes his head, frowning:
DAEDALUS
It's not that I don't trust my
compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In
fact, I had every confidence that
your amnesia was genuine -- until
you showed up *here*. You follow?
(beat)
Meanwhile, I just got around to
reading the papers, there's the small
matter of an incident upstate. Long
range rifle shot, blew a man out of
his socks.
(coldly)
You can see where I'm coming from.
I'm trying to pull of the biggest
job of my career. I have to know.
How much you really remember... and
who you've told.
SAMANTHA
I didn't tell a soul, I swear.
DAEDALUS
We'll soon know.
He crosses toward a large RED BUTTON. Set into a wooden beam.
Samantha thrashes at the bindings. Looks down at the water
where it intercepts the mammoth wheel. Fighting panic:
SAMANTHA
Is... is this a torture thing...?
DAEDALUS
Torture, yes. The torturing of
beautiful women, albeit politically
incorrect, is an addiction with me.
(beat)
A woman never looks quite so beautiful
as when her face is distended in
pain. Witness the beauty of
childbirth.
SAMANTHA
Please, I'm getting all misty. Look,
untie me, I'll make any face you
want.
DAEDALUS
Let's not, and say we did. Do you
smoke?
SAMANTHA
Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really.
DAEDALUS
Good. You'll last longer. Now hush
yourself, and take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing.
He hits the button. An electric WHINE -- THE BIG WHEEL TURNS.
Feet first into the water. Struggling. Arms stretched above
her head. She plunges below the surface. A new dimension in
PAIN. Frozen, mind-numbing.
She WRITHES against the wheel. It's like a crushing VICE is
ripping her limb from limb. She opens her eyes, briefly.
Discovers she's not alone -- A mere foot from her face, THE
BLOATED CORPSE of the drowned NATHAN. Staring away and away.
Blue with cyanosis.
Meanwhile, back ON THE SURFACE: Daedalus turns to his right-
hand man, who says:
TIMOTHY
We're running on schedule, I just
secured the tanker. We're borrowing
it from Carbide in South Carolina.
Cargo listed as fire retardant.
DAEDALUS
(nods)
Juice up the bird, we head out soon
as I'm done here.
He turns. Hits the red button again. THE WHEEL reverses
itself. Creaks and moans, turning --
SAMANTHA BREAKS THE SURFACE. Gasping for air. Wheezing.
Choking. The FREEZING WIND plasters the nightgown to her.
DAEDALUS
Take all the air you can, that's
right. If you need to vomit, do it
now.
Samantha, face twisted. Coughs. Wheezes. TIMOTHY looks her
in the eye... shakes his head:
TIMOTHY
You don't remember *at all*...? The
greatest night of your life, shit,
drown this ungrateful wench.
He exits. Daedalus, alone with his captive. On her features,
unbridled HATRED. He chuckles:
DAEDALUS
Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity
safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot
you in the head. Nice and quick.
Otherwise, you're in for a long night.
*Who did you talk to*?
SAMANTHA
...Nobody... fuck you...
He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly
as he turns his attention to the red switch.
DAEDALUS
Hate to see you like this, Charly. I
heard you were a helluva spy once.
Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice,
not her own:
SAMANTHA
Watch your back. I'm not done yet.
DAEDALUS
That's a very funny joke. You're an
entertaining woman. Good night.
He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus
walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights
it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads.
UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan,
mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In
a flood. Stark and vivid.
MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR
THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky.
Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals --
There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One
eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the
trunk. Nods.
TIMOTHY
Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your
money will be waiting, and Jack...?
Do yourself a favor, do her and dump
her, I'm serious. Don't get cute,
try to play doctor first. I made
that mistake.
The lid SLAMS SHUT.
BACK UNDER THE WATER
The world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster
and faster --
MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness.
Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA)
is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched.
ONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls
up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He
can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt.
Her eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's
grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE --
Then she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car...
Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots
her. In the head.
She pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes
headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller --
Here. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath.
SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD --
By her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half
frozen.
DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine,
watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is
looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile.
CHARLY
Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let
me go now...? I'll leave you the use
of your legs... Bargain, trust me...
Daedalus struggles to recover his poise.
DAEDALUS
How did you find me? Who knows about
this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?
Charly's eyes bore into his:
CHARLY
I let you touch me, cowboy... I think
I need a bath.
Daedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into
the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time.
UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME
Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN.
Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now
there's RAGE.
It takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist...
But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns
soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking
cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME.
She darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing
CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand
DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS --
Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr.
Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage
inside her. Death in her hands.
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE
The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots
watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing.
The first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He
collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No
hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel.
Incredible.
Doesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS
the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as
ANOTHER ANGLE
Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision
from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a
sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen,
REBORN, from the icy waters.
DAEDALUS
Samantha... Please...!
CHARLY
Who's Samantha?
She shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She
tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches
up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says:
CHARLY
You see in the movies, badguy says,
"Talk to me and I'll let you live."
We're gonna run a variation, it goes
like this: Talk to me...? I'll let
you die.
She fires again.
CHARLY
Where's Henessey...?
The detective lies naked, bound hand and foot. Beaten.
FREEZING. A single ray of LIGHT through a tiny crack.
He hears a SPLINTERING noise, as if a door's been ripped
from its hinges. Pause -- A FUSILLADE of gunfire. Shouts,
cries. A heavy weight SLAMS to the floorboards above him.
Through a crack comes a tiny stream of BLOOD, dribbling onto
him, as --
The door bursts open as PERKINS stalks in, shedding his coat.
His aide -- let's call him HARRY -- looks up nervously.
PERKINS
This can't happen, Harry. The
President's already up at night,
prowling his sock drawer for double
agents, and now we've got a fucking
rogue on our hands.
HARRY
Sir, there's someone in the conference
room to see you.
PERKINS
Oh, for the love of Christ, who can
be so fucking important?
He throws open a door off the passage: THERE'S TIMOTHY.
Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack of
smokes. Perkins reacts, stunned.
TIMOTHY
It's me, your poor black cousin. The
one you can't be seen with.
PERKINS
*You*...! Are you crazy, coming here??
TIMOTHY
(Lights a cigarette)
My boss is dead.
PERKINS
What...?
TIMOTHY
Your rogue bitch just took him out.
Probably went shopping in his weapons
storage too.
He blows smoke. Trains his eyes on the older man. Piercing.
TIMOTHY
We're still on, Perkins. I've got
the tanker, the chemist, all ready
to go... but you gotta contain her,
man. We gotta step on her hard and
fast.
An agent on the SWITCHBOARD calls out:
SWITCHBOARD
You have a call on line three, sir.
PERKINS
Who is it?
SWITCHBOARD
Charly Baltimore, sir.
Perkins stops dead. Lunges for the phone, nearly drops it:
PERKINS
Perkins.
INTERCUT - OUR HEROINE AT PAY PHONE
We only see her mouth. Set in hard, grim lines. She says:
CHARLY
It's cold, I want to come in.
PERKINS
Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell
are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm
going to direct you to a safe house,
get you on a plane --
CHARLY
Can the bullshit, I'm not telling
you where I am. I'll come in for a
full debriefing, but we do it my
way.
PERKINS
Charly, you're being paranoid. It's
not like it used to be, you're eight
years out of date.
CHARLY
Do tell.
PERKINS
Congress won't authorize a dime,
Charly. Chapter's on the way out,
we've been reduced to a records-
keeping agency, we *don't have enough
money to kill you*, understand...?
CHARLY
Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me
dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing
pool to buy bullets. We do things my
way.
PERKINS
Your way, I see. And if I say go to
hell?
CHARLY
From where I stand, it ain't much of
a commute. You'll hear from me.
She clicks off. Perkins darts a look at the techie -- guy
shakes his head, no go on the trace. Perkins swears.
PERKINS
She mustn't threaten our success.
Contain her, whatever it takes. But
be *careful*. If it gets out you're
working for me... we'll both be
grabbing our ankles on the White
House lawn.
ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT
There. Thank you, New Jersey, that'll be all. You can go
now. Um, please.
Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes
creak open, struggle to focus... Hears WATER running. A
shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he
knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what
the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain.
Henessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the
differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her
hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving,
scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby
table, steals it outright.
CHARLY
See? Sit next to the dance floor,
every drink's free. People finish
dancing, they think the waiter lifted
'em.
Henessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says:
HENESSEY
I'm confused. Gimme a minute.
CHARLY
Take two, they're small.
She knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts
uncomfortably, lights a smoke.
HENESSEY
Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're
actually a trained killer, Jesus, I
can't even say it with a straight
face.
(frowns)
So then... Samantha, she...
CHARLY
Never really existed. Like Nathan
said, she was a total fabrication, I
made her up.
HENESSEY
Fabrication. And now she's just...
gone? Forever and ever?
CHARLY
Thank God. Look at my inordinately
large ass, look what she did to me.
Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest.
HENESSEY
Pretty convincing act.
CHARLY
Guess so.
HENESSEY
I mean, her personality, it had to
come from *somewhere* --
CHARLY
Change the subject. Better yet, steal
me another drink.
Henessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He
reaches over and lifts their beers.
HENESSEY
Drink up. What's next?
CHARLY
I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring
us in from the field alive...
HENESSEY
Chapter. Can you trust them?
CHARLY
Not sure. Until I know, you might
wanna stay away from curbs.
He looks at her, confused:
CHARLY
They like to push people in front of
buses.
Didn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by:
SANTA CLAUS
(bad Caribbean accent)
Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the
lambada wit'choo. *Come this way,
everybody*!
He shimmies away. Charly grins at Henessey:
CHARLY
If I could come that way I wouldn't
need to dance the lambada. Follow
me, I need you to do something.
They enter the suite. She drops her purse, sways toward him.
Presses him against the wall, framed there in the doorway.
CHARLY
This is my first date in eight years,
Mitch. Is this a fun date...?
Quite suddenly, Charly leans over and kisses him on the lips.
He reacts, startled. Stares at her.
HENESSEY
Okay, what's going on?
CHARLY
True love, shut the fuck up.
HENESSEY
You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady.
I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked,
and the last time I got blown candy
bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly,
so what's up?
CHARLY
Chemistry. Be quiet.
She nibbles his ear. Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's
holding the picture of HAL and CAITLIN. The one he found
torn in two. He looks her full in the face:
HENESSEY
Chemistry my ass. Know what I think?
I think this is why you'd fuck me.
(beat)
To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any
trace of her.
He pushes her away.
HENESSEY
Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher.
When she comes back, give me a call.
Charly jerks backward. Angry. Henessey heads for the bathroom.
HENESSEY
Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will
ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and
she's under the mistaken impression
that Mommy gives a shit.
Charly snatches up her purse, eyes burning:
CHARLY
I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch.
Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY
ASKED ME.
She storms out. CUT TO:
Charly drives, possessed. Henessey drinks. Hands shaking.
CHARLY
Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that
prick.
She throws a shrieking skid. Henessey clutches for the
dashboard, swearing.
CHARLY
Easy, Spike. I got myself out of
Beirut once, I think I can get us
out of New Jersey.
HENESSEY
Don't be so sure, others have tried.
The entire population, in fact.
(beat)
Look, about me...? I mean, what's
up, you're this hot survival chick,
I'm getting the feeling you don't
need me anymore.
Charly reaches over. Yanks the doorhandle.
CHARLY
Good point.
She kicks him out of the moving car.
Late, very late now. Henessey, driving. Beside him, Charly
reclines, lost in reverie. Features bathed in passing
roadlights. Henessey grinds out a butt:
HENESSEY
Humor me: you're a paid assassin,
then you fall off a cliff. Sink under
the ocean, and when you come out
you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna
tell me what happened?
CHARLY
I fell into a school of fish, they
elected me principal. Shut the fuck
up.
HENESSEY
Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking
maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act.
Maybe you forgot to hate yourself
for eight years, ever think of
that...?
CHARLY
Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope,
seems clear enough to me. Hate myself,
Christ almighty. What are you, my
shrink?
HENESSEY
No, just some loser thought he could
maybe understand, fuck it. I been
there, you know. I'd kill for fucking
amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I
can think is I got reamed in the ass
by three guys. Merry Christmas, son,
here's a ball glove, did you know
Daddy screamed when they carved the
name in his back...? Mary, by the
way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell.
God, I'm tired.
(beat)
I never did one thing right, you
know it, not one fucking thing. Not
even accidental, that takes skill.
He looks over. She's asleep, hasn't heard a word. Face slack,
lips slightly parted. The toughness banished from her
features. In its place, a lingering sadness. CUT TO:
Three GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained
shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly
and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure.
AGENT #1
Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just
to follow it back to the ass it came
from.
AGENT #2
Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast.
A RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says:
VOICE (O.S.)
Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more
pass, let's make sure the house is
secure.
The driver looks over, incredulous.
DRIVER
He's dead. Goddammit, how did that
happen??
BACKSEAT
*Go bulletproof, now*!
The driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that
is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead
guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate
exposed to the world.
BACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE
Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the
street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes
off around the house at a dead run.
Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow
angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up
just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform.
Two seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving,
child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE
has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a
KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney:
TIMOTHY
Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're
about to have 2.4 children.
Freezes her. Petrified.
TIMOTHY
I know where you live. Close your
mouth, you look like a fish. Merry
Christmas.
He exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional.
MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH:
High speed chase, in progress. The driver dogs Henessey,
jockeys for position. Barks into a radio mic:
DRIVER
Target two, acquired! Red Dog in
pursuit, backup requested.
(over his shoulder)
You got him?
BACKSEAT
I got him.
The backseat agent hefts an AK-47 assault rifle.
WITH HENESSEY - DRIVING
Henessey checks the rear view mirror -- just in time to see
a circular portion of glass POP from the chase car's window.
Out comes a gun muzzle.
HENESSEY
Jesus wept.
The guy opens up on full auto. Rakes the Bronco, STRAFES it.
Henessey swerves madly -- no go. Death run. He's not coming
home, not this time.
TIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the
room:
TIMOTHY
It's done, she hooked. All I gotta
do is set the ransom meet.
PERKINS
She mustn't suspect a trap.
TIMOTHY
No way. She thinks I'm acting alone,
remember? Say the word, I'll hand
her to you on a plate.
Perkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at
Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her.
Next to a brown paper bag.
PERKINS
God. We're monsters, aren't we...?
(pause, then:)
Forget Charly. Talk to me about
tonight.
TIMOTHY
The tanker's on its way from
Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One
terrorist on ice, waiting to play
patsy.
(points)
What's in the sack?
Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly.
PERKINS
That...? Something to prove that I'm
not a complete ogre.
He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL.
Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow.
PERKINS
See? The young one will have a doll
to play with on Christmas. Very
popular item. It... well, it pees.
You put water in it and... oh, fuck
you.
Charly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from
each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas
burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS!
*Where it's Christmas all year long*!
HENESSEY
Almost dark now.
CHARLY
Another ten minutes. You want my
Crazy Meal action figure?
HENESSEY
Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing
the right thing? We've got money, we
could negotiate...
CHARLY
*I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God,
I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's
dead weight if she's sedated.
HENESSEY
Not so emotional, I'm getting
embarrassed with these outbursts
here.
CHARLY
Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I
can. This is an extraction, nimrod,
and she's the target, that's how to
play it, the only way to beat this
guy.
HENESSEY
Yeah? How come you know so much about
this fucking guy?
CHARLY
Don't go there, Mitch, you don't
want to know.
HENESSEY
I'm here. Suppose you tell me.
CHARLY
Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises
with this guy. In Paris, back in
1987.
She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in:
CHARLY
I'd been assigned to kill his boss,
remember...? Needed him out of the
way. So I let him seduce me. Had a
steel needle under the pillow, figured
to stick him *en flagrante*, that
means while we were screwing. But he
was too slick. Bashed me in the head,
finished, then threw me in the trunk
of a car. Still think I'm a girl
scout, Mitch...?
The look in her eyes is feral.
CHARLY
It's almost dark. Let's get it done.
As the tanker snorts to a halt, TIMOTHY pulls up, driving a
bright red Jaguar. Gets out as a blue-suit trots up:
BLUE-SUIT
1800 hours. We're still trying to
clean the tanker --
TIMOTHY
(scowls annoyance)
Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and
reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee
jumping after this.
She hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS
EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe
it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights:
She's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty
tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's
managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes
bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor.
Charly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick
wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER.
Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed.
A GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then. Deadly serious:
VOICE (O.S.)
I smell gasoline, you have a little
accident...? I got plenty of matches
up here. Bad way for a kid to go.
Thirty seconds, think it over.
CHARLY stands in place, mind racing... Caitlin's DOLL. Regards
her dully. Plastic smile like it knows a secret. CUT TO:
A MATCH FLARES as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... MR.
PERKINS puffs mightily. Turns and favors CHARLY and HENESSEY
with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator...
TIMOTHY straddles a nearby chair. Smiles and says:
TIMOTHY
Good to have you back again, Chuck.
PERKINS
You know, Colonel, you ought really
to have stayed dead. You don't know
the rules of the game anymore.
CHARLY
No shit. Eight years ago, you send
me to kill Daedalus and this clown.
Now you're working *with* him.
He crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside.
PERKINS
Budget cuts, remember? Congress
blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central
America. Across the board, an
intelligence blackout. We had to
recruit any eyes and ears we could
find, even if it meant going to former
targets.
Pause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers:
CHARLY
Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that*
what this is about...? The foot
soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck
me, you're running a fundraiser!!
Comprehension, dawning. She looks up in disbelief.
CHARLY
You'll get all the money you want at
the next budget hearing, won't you...?
All you need is a major terrorist
incident.
PERKINS
Interesting theory.
CHARLY
Theory, my ass. I think some
terrorists were planning a strike.
Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's
how you knew they were coming...
(eyes widening)
No way. Don't tell me you're gonna
sit there and let them go through
with it, *just to get a budget
increase*.
Perkins shrugs philosophically.
PERKINS
It's not without precedent. 1993,
remember the World Trade Center
bombing...? The CIA had advance
knowledge, don't think they didn't.
Worse, the diplomat who issued the
terrorist's visa was CIA, they
*facilitated* the bombing. Purely to
justify a budget increase. Of course,
they'd no way of knowing the
terrorists would botch the job.
CHARLY
That's not gonna happen this time...?
PERKINS
No. This time, the terrorist event
will come off precisely as planned.
This time the terrorists can't muck
it up... because we've killed them
and taken over.
Charly and Henessey react, startled...
The same CELLAR she occupied earlier. Timothy behind her, he
wrinkles his nose in distaste.
TIMOTHY
Shit, this place is loaded with fumes,
nobody light a fucking match. You
check her for flammables?
GUN GUARD
(shrugs)
Checked her for colon cancer.
Caitlin is sitting in a chair.
Bundled in flannel, clutching her baby doll, the one Perkins
bought for her. She looks up at Charly dully. Sucking her
thumb.
CAITLIN
Mommy...
Charly composes herself.
CHARLY
Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay.
Safe and snug... what comes next,
huh...? What's the next part?
CAITLIN
...bug in a rug... man with white
hair... says the same thing you say...
Charly licks her lips. Easy, Charly, keep cool, she mustn't
die afraid...
CHARLY
We're going to take a nap together,
Cate. You can have your dolly, and
Mommy will be next to you, how's
that? It'll be like bears in winter.
When they get cold, see, they fall
deep, deep asleep...
TIMOTHY
Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough.
He points to the STEEL DOOR of the meat freezer. The guard
opens it onto a gleaming silver CHAMBER. Timothy calmly
adjusts the thermostat. Sub zero. The guard reaches for
Caitlin's doll... Charly snatches it back. Face etched in
disgust.
CHARLY
You're murdering us both, cocksucker,
let the kid have her fucking dolly.
He subsides, unable to meet her gaze. At which point, Timothy
tosses her the WOODEN BOX.
TIMOTHY
Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll
make you a deal, okay? There's a
knife in that box. Now, you and the
kid, you're going to freeze, *but* --
if you kill the kid *by your own
hand*...? I won't kill your husband.
Serious. We're gonna open that door
and you'll both be frozen solid, but
I wanna know that you've cut your
own child's throat.
You don't want to ever be on the receiving end of the LOOK
she gives him... Steps into the freezer, holding Caitlin. As
the door starts to swing shut, she says:
CHARLY
It ain't over, motherfucker. You're
gonna die screaming and I'm gonna
watch. Am I telling the truth...?
She flashes him her most DAZZLING smile -- The whole room
lights up. She can do that. As the door erases her from view,
a chill dances up Timothy's spine... because there was nothing
resembling doubt on her face.
CHARLY crosses with Caitlin to the far corner.
CAITLIN
Mom, it's cold in here-!
CHARLY
Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar
bear, remember?
Moves. Quick. Methodical. Breaks open the BOX: Sure enough,
a hunting knife. Without missing a beat, she crosses to the
STEEL DOOR. Kneels and begins DIGGING at the bottom edge.
CARVING into the brick, what the hell...?
Henessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before
him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS. Pegs one into the
wall with deadly accuracy.
TIMOTHY
Tell me where Charly keeps her money.
She must have mentioned it.
HENESSEY
Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly
called Washington, by morning this
whole place'll be crawling with Feds.
TIMOTHY
We'll be gone by then, Mitch.
HENESSEY
Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying,
there's a couple Feds, they couldn't
sleep, said they might come early.
Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just
watch.
TIMOTHY
Already did, Mitch, someone already
did. Perkins got stuck with a double
agent, someone trusted, highly placed.
HENESSEY
Who?
TIMOTHY
Me.
(chuckles)
Chinks are paying me to bring down
Chapter.
Henessey reacts, startled. Timothy chuckles:
TIMOTHY
Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue
teams within minutes, guess what
they find...?
HENESSEY
The patsy.
TIMOTHY
Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught
with their pants down. See, Mitch, I
dumped in a much faster chemical
catalyst...
(beat)
The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*.
In the center of town, thirty-five
minutes from now.
CHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes.
Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she
digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy.
Lying flat, she appraises her work --
A TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual
penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two
seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently
takes the doll from her, then:
CHARLY
Open.
Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER.
Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels
down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer...
Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against
the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly
above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back:
It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through
the brick -- into the other ROOM.
Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll.
Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to
her. What next..?
She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH --
One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...?
Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down.
CHARLY
Gimme a spark... show me, show me...
Tries again. And again. STRIKING, over and over. Floor RINGS
with the effort --
CHARLY
Come on, come on... do it...!
But in the end, it's just not gonna happen. *Won't work*.
Lets go a GROAN of despair:
CHARLY
All this, just one fucking match,
*Goddamit*...!
She collapses forward. Cradles her head in frustration.
There's a tiny tap in her shoulder.
CAITLIN
Mommy...?
Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted... Caitlin's eyes,
alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST
and brings out a pack of matches.
CAITLIN
Don't cry. I keep these here.
(beat)
For lighting your candle.
Charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift.
The bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it. Under innocent
eyes on Christmas Eve DETONATES, blown sky-high, and she
sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming...
CHARLY
I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you
know how much I love you...?
Caitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face.
CAITLIN
Am I gonna die...?
From a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home. Charly's
eyes, like steel. A harsh whisper:
CHARLY
No, baby, you're not gonna die. They
are.
She strikes a match.
Henessey, straining against his bonds. Sweating.
TIMOTHY
Charly's stash. What's the number of
the locker, Mitch...?
HENESSEY
Fuck you.
TIMOTHY across the room, a good forty feet.
TIMOTHY
Left nut, five bucks I make it.
Smiling, he raises a scalpel. Eyes dead like a rat's.
The flame hovers above the gasoline trail.
CHARLY
When I tell you, scream as loud as
you can, or else your ears'll get
hurt.
A tiny nod. Charly calmly touches fire to the fuel. Cradles
Caitlin to her chest, gently strokes her hair...
CHARLY
Hey, should we buy a dog...?
The flame races across the room. Hits the steel door. And
zip! Vanishes through the NOTCH. A pause...
THE BASEMENT BLOWS SKY-HIGH.
Wooden walls, obliterated. Boards sheared. Atomized. THE
MEAT LOCKER DOOR blows inward like a cannon shot. Holds to
its hinges, buckled like JIFFY POP.
TIMOTHY'S THROW is off target, sticks in Henessey's chair.
Between his legs. Inches. Then the assassin LEAVES HIS FEET,
look of comic surprise -- as the walls behind him disintegrate
in FLAME. Henessey cries out, blinded as
MARKSMAN, riding shotgun. Scans the cliff below: Thick
evergreens. Charly, somewhere among them. He sights down his
rifle, takes careful aim -- BLOWS OUT TIRES on the Jaguar.
Cripples it. The chopper BANKS, heading away.
BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME
In big trouble. MANY HEADLIGHTS, bouncing uphill toward her.
Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't
much better: A 200 FOOT DROP. Straight down. Evergreen trees,
far below. Power lines. Highway.
She hears the PHONE RINGING, then... inside the Jag. Crosses
slowly. Reaches in, lifts the receiver. It's TIMOTHY.
TIMOTHY (V.O.)
I tried to give you a pretty death,
baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked,
now it's ground beef time.
CHARLY
The truck. How long til it blows?
TIMOTHY
(incredulous)
Sweet Loretta, you're another animal
entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees...
Make it ten minutes, give or take.
CHARLY
Then I better hurry.
TIMOTHY
Oh, spare me. You made a big noise
and bought five more minutes on the
planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in
what's left of your face.
He clicks off. Charly drops the receiver. Turns, looks behind:
They're coming for her.
Woods filled with headlights. Backlit FIGURES. Ducking in
and out of the trees, getting closer... The wind blows. Bitter
cold out here in the dark night of the soul. Nothing left.
No hope. No reason.
Caitlin, dead.
The rage explodes in the form of a kick which SHATTERS the
lock on the trunk. *Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle.
At that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, CREAKING...
Revealing all of Timothy's BUNJEE JUMPING EQUIPMENT.
Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark. All alone. ROARING
in her ears. Sort of like being underwater.
TIMOTHY barks orders into a mic:
TIMOTHY
All units converge. Divert local
law, this is a government matter.
Brook no interference, I want the
Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's
the fucking chopper*?
Racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile
ON THE PARADE ROUTE
SANTA CLAUS himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a
rock star and wishing his groupies were legal... when suddenly
he's got company.
CHARLY
I'm the Missus. Drive.
The rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt.
Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as
MR. PERKINS hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny VOICE
issues from his headset mic:
VOICE (O.S.)
...yes, she's with Santa Claus,
correct, er, excuse me, the individual
*playing* Santa, er... they're
pursuing the tanker truck, sir.
Perkins stares straight ahead, speechless.
The door files open and the DRIVER sees CHARLY. Bloody.
Demonic. Wisely leaps out, BOUNCES from view -- Charly snags
his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head. SWINGS UP into
the drivers' seat, double-clutches -- pours on the steam.
Five seconds. She owns the tanker.
BLASTS forward into the lead PANEL TRUCK. Slams the truck
from behind, BULLDOZES it -- Sends it THUNDERING into a park
bench. Glass sprays.
She owns the road. On the seat beside her: an MP-5 machine
gun. She's set. Throws a NINETY DEGREE turn onto a sidestreet.
Donates most of her tires to New York.
Charly's on fire. Senses heightened. Eyes tick back and forth
like a machine. Heading downhill, out of town...
CHARLY
Hang on, Catey.
She hits the brakes. A flash of SPARKS..! A ripping WHINE,
dies away -- The brake pedal is all play. Nothing. She's in
a runaway truck.
CHARLY
*No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!
Barreling onward. A lunging behemoth.
CHARLY
Can't stop, Catey, can't...
CHAIN-LINK FENCE, at road's end. Beyond it, a quarter-mile
plunge. Downhill over rocky terrain --
To St. PETER'S SEMINARY. Looming stone structure. Closed
now. Vast empty PARKING LOT.
Tears on her cheeks. Lights a cigarette. Takes a long drag,
exhales:
CHARLY
Suck my dick, every one of you
bastards...
Blows through the chain-link fence.
SHUDDERS AND LEAPS DOWNHILL. Mud blows skyward. Trees, blasted
to splinters.
CAITLIN
Buffeted inside the UTILITY BOX. Cries out as
IN THE CAB
Charly fights to contain the beast. "Fuck you," slyly retorts
the beast. She BOUNCES and caroms off the sides like a mad
pinball --
THE TRUCK SMASHES DOWN
And all the windows BLOW OUT concussively and the front tires
go with a volcano CRACK-! as the beast goes canting to one
side, ponderous, MASSIVE...
It keels over on its side. Still doing fifty.
TRAVERSES THE PARKING LOT.
Slows itself by TAKING OUT LIGHT POLES, shears them off like
saplings.
Whacks the side of the chapel. IMPACT. Keeps going...
Charly is EJECTED from the cab. Pinwheels through space like
a broken doll, bursts through a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.
The glass ruptures as she catapults through. Hits on her
stomach, bounces. Slides to a stop, rolls over --
FLINGS herself aside just in time, as a towering ST. PETER
SMASHES to earth an inch from her head, showers marble...!
Concussion dies away. Silence. Echoes.
Charly, semi-conscious. Rolls onto her back, gasping. Stares
at the gathered saints. Swallows hard. Sucking it up,
preparing. Rolls to one knee, plants her foot...
She's got to make that truck.
On her feet now. Stumbling forward. One arm hugging her guts.
Cross-eyed, so hard to focus... left foot, right foot, get
it done, bitch, yes it's *supposed* to hurt that much, flings
open the door and she's so brave that for a second we think
she might make it.
Timothy kicks her in the head.
Charly flies back. Hits and SLIDES. Fetches up against a
bannister, WHAM--! Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him.
Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*.
TIMOTHY
Call it four minutes to detonation.
I got a chopper on the way, lots of
time.
He sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE.
Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife.
CHARLY
Oh, honey. Only four inches...?
TIMOTHY
You'll feel me.
He approaches, almost casually. Charly staggers erect. Adopts
a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand.
PERKINS hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset:
VOICE (O.S.)
Point team leader, reporting...
She's... incapacitated the truck...
I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm
dying... Instructions...?
PERKINS
Continue dying. Out.
He leans back. Stares sightlessly. Loosens his tie, hits the
intercom and says:
PERKINS
Anthony, get me the President...
He takes out a bottle of Scotch. CUT TO:
Charly and Timothy. They circle, two pros.
TIMOTHY
You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles
never recovered from C-section, I'll
bet. Am I right?
Never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the
HANDS... The gathered saints look on, neutral.
CHARLY
Please, man... She's only... eight...
she's a beautiful little girl...
His concentration never falters as he says:
TIMOTHY
She's a worthless bitch. I know it
'cause she came out of me.
He LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of
one arm and FLINGS her, up and over...! She SAILS through
space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers
forward. They circle...
TIMOTHY
It's called shock, Charly... Your
body wants to go into shock...
CHARLY
Fuck you, your breathing's lousy...
Charly LAUNCHES herself. Avoids a stab at her throat, eats
that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right
hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her
wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back
GASPING.
Circling again. Charly cannot walk a straight line.
TIMOTHY
Look at you. You're out of your
motherfucking league, dearie.
CLOSE ON CHARLY
She looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red,
and in those eyes we glimpse it; the DEMON, laughing... as
Charly whispers:
CHARLY
...You want a piece...? Take my
shoulder.
He lunges with the knife...! She ducks, trips on purpose and
HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate --
And WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him
in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the
bastard's KNEE, wide open...
Boot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in
agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister --
Grabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--!
Charly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder
and flings it.
Takes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up
and over, flailing...! Drops from sight.
Charly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs
splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God...
There's a hole in her chest.
*Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the CAR.
TIMOTHY
Where are *you* going??
Timothy grabs the stick -- THAT'S WHEN CHARLY BREAKS COVER.
Does a MAD STAGGER across the blacktop. Goes for the GUN.
TIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING in low
and fast --
CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and
falls flat on her back, points it skyward:
CHARLY
Suck on it.
She fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches
to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing.
Head over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on
the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees
Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight,
SHRIEKING--!
CHARLY
Die screaming, motherfucker.
She watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS
now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody
in the moonlight...
HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the
metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen
squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning.
Henessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...!
KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the
car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says:
CAITLIN
Hurry! The truck is a bomb!
HENESSEY
Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a
fucking lightning rod on the roof...?
No, Caitlin, *don't check*.
He PEELS OUT.
CHARLY
Hey... you're bleeding...
HENESSEY
I think that's yours...
CHARLY
Right, sorry...
He inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly.
CAITLIN
*You're a bad driver! Who said you
could drive*?
A MOTHER SITS in the glow of a Winnie the Pooh nightlight.
Next to her sleeping daughter's bed -- back to the very
beginning of the film, it's been a long kiss goodnight.
An elderly FARMER pokes his head in. She doesn't look up.
DOCTOR
Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here.
They'll be right in.
The shadowy figure nods... Remains seated. Stays awhile in
the dark. Keeping vigil. Snow slithers against the glass.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
