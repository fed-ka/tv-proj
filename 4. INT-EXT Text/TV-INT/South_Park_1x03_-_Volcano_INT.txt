                              (Ms. Cartman's voice)
                         Don't get scared up in the mountains, 
                         Cartman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Shut up! I'm not scared of nothing!

                                     STAN
                         Maybe your mom can give me a kiss 
                         too Cartman.

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rmph rm rmph mphr!

               Jimbo Laughs.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ho Ho, that's disgusting!

                                     CARTMAN
                         You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

               Cartman slugs Kenny. The two boys fight in the back seat.

                                     JIMBO
                         That's the spirit, boys! Let's get 
                         that testosterone flowing!!

               Cartman and Kenny pound the shit out of each other.

                                     JIMBO
                         Now boys, boys, I need to get serious 
                         for a minute. I want you to understand 
                         a few basic rules of hunting since 
                         this is your first time.

               The boys listen attentively.

                                     JIMBO
                         First of all, don't ever walk with 
                         your gun unless the safety's on. 
                         Second, don't shoot anything that 
                         looks human, and third never spill 
                         your beer in the bullet chamber.

                                     STAN
                         Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.

                                     JIMBO
                         You what?

                                     NED
                         Oh yeah, that's right, I don't think 
                         8 year old kids drink beer.

                                     KYLE
                         I like chocolate milk!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, we'll be doing plenty of 
                         drinking on this trip. After all, 
                         hunting sober is like fishing sober.
                         It sure will be nice to get out of 
                         the city for a while. Away from 
                         civilization.


               A very average looking GEOLOGIST is sitting at the seismograph 
               and just staring at it.

               For a long time he just sits there and stares at the little 
               needle drawing a straight line.

               Suddenly, the needle starts to move! The Geologist perks up 
               and moves in closer.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         What the heck is this?

               The needle moves frantically. The Geologist grabs the 
               telephone and dials a number.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Yeah, Frank? It's uh, Randy. Uh-huh... 
                         Good. Yeah, listen, the, uh, the 
                         little needle's moving.

               Pause.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Yeah, it's going back and forth really 
                         fast. What does that mean?

               Pause.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Uh-huh... Uh-huh..., let me check...

               The Geologist wheels back in his chair and looks at the peak 
               of Mt. Evanston which is smoking.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Yeah, it's smoking... Uh-huh... Oh 
                         really? Really?

               ZOOM IN on the Geologist.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Oh my God...... A volcano!

               He drinks some coffee and sighs.

               Chef is sitting in the Mayor's office having a meeting.

                                     CHEF
                         But you see, Mr. Mayor, you can't 
                         stop serving Salisbury Steak in our 
                         public schools... What's next? Meat 
                         Loaf?

                                     MAYOR
                         We are quite aware of your concerns, 
                         Chef, but-

               A buzzer on the Mayor's desk sounds.

                                     VOICE
                         Mayor, the Geologist is here to see 
                         you.

                                     MAYOR
                         My Geologist? Now? Tell him the 
                         infection is fine and I don't need 
                         another check up.

                                     VOICE
                         No, Mayor, that's a GYNECOLOGIST. A 
                         GEOLOGIST studies the Earth.

               The Mayor thinks long and hard.

                                     MAYOR
                         Don't you think I know that?! How 
                         dare you insult my intellect! I went 
                         to Princeton for God's sake! You get 
                         out of my office!!

                                     VOICE
                         I'm not in your office Mayor, I'm 
                         talking to you through a speaker.

                                     MAYOR
                         Just send in the Geomotrist!

                         Geologist.

                                     MAYOR
                         YOU ARE FIRED BUDDY!

                                     VOICE
                         Thank you, Mayor. It's been great 
                         working for you.

               Suddenly, the Geologist bursts into the room.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Mayor! We have got A VERY BIG PROBLEM! 
                         Mount Evanston is about to erupt!

                                     MAYOR
                         What does this mean to the town?

               The Geologist takes out another chart. It is very simple.

                                     GEOLOGIST
                         Well this graph shows everything 
                         from normal to bad. Right now, South 
                         Park is here:

               He points with the pointer to 'Totally Screwed'. The Mayor 
               stands up.

                                     MAYOR
                         My God...

                                     CHEF
                         Mayor! Some of the school children 
                         are up camping on that mountain RIGHT 
                         NOW!

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh, oh, this IS Big!
                              (Through intercom)
                         Johnson! Johnson are you there?!

                                     VOICE
                         Uh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. 
                         I'm his replacement, Ted.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ted, we have got a MAJOR crisis here! 
                         I want you to get on the phone, and 
                         call Inside Edition, Rescue 911, oh 
                         and Entertainment tonight. And you 
                         better get my stylist on the phone, 
                         too. Don't worry, things are under 
                         control.

               Chef and the Geologist blink at each other.

                         Harbingers of sorrow, natural 
                         disasters can be the cause of 
                         troubling and undesirable stress; 
                         And a volcano is no exception. But 
                         what should you do if a volcano erupts 
                         near you or your family?
