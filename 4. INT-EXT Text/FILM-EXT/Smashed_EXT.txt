Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
over and sees:
A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
again.
Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and
Freda.
KATE
You okay?
FREDA
(quick)
Yeah. Are you?
KATE
(taken aback)
Um...sure.
7.
FREDA
Good.
(whispers)
Hey, I'm not really okay.
KATE
Oh...
FREDA
My bitch sister just took off and
left me here so she could hook up
with some asshole. Now what am I
supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a
car here.
KATE
I guess I could...
FREDA
You'll give me a ride? Oh my god!
Thank you!
Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.
*
KATE
I was gonna say "call you a cab,"
`cause, you know -- I don't even
know you.
FREDA
It's not far. Please? Pretty
please...?
Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.
CUT TO:

*
The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.
*
Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances
down at the floor and notices a FLASK.
*
FREDA
You know, you shouldn't drink and
drive.
KATE
I wasn't --
FREDA
Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
8.
Kate's speechless.
FREDA (CONT'D)
I'm really thirsty.
KATE
It's, uh...whiskey.
FREDA
Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love
whiskey. You're the real thing,
huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like
me!
Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.
KATE
I don't know. No.
FREDA
Can I smoke in your car?
KATE
(slightly annoyed)
Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you
just roll down the window?
FREDA
Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
Freda takes out a --
-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.
KATE
(in disbelief)
WHOA!
Kate immediately pulls the car over.
KATE (CONT'D)
Not what I thought you meant.
FREDA
Want a hit?
KATE
No, I...is that pot?
FREDA
(as though it's a
ridiculous question)
Of course not! What do I look like?
A stoner?
(MORE)
9.
FREDA (CONT'D)
(beat)
It's crack.
KATE
Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
FREDA
C'mon -- it's good crack.
KATE
I don't, um...I've never smoked
crack.
FREDA
(surprised)
Really? This stuff is the truth --
and it'll sober you up.
KATE
Uh...I think you should go.
FREDA
I'm not getting out in the middle
of nowhere. Do you know what could
happen to me all alone out here at
*
night?
KATE
I don't know -- people might offer
you crack?
FREDA
Seriously? It's not a big deal --
just take a little hit.
Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.
KATE
I said no.
FREDA
One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
you up.
Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
her.
FREDA (CONT'D)
(high-pitched cartoon
voice)
Smoke me!
Kate LAUGHS.
10.
KATE
One puff. Then we are both going
home.
Freda nods. Long beat.
KATE (CONT'D)
Fine.
Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.
FREDA
You've got money, right?

Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --
-- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass
around TWO PIPES.
LATER
Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.
Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're
still smoking crack.
KATE
(mile-a-minute fast)
...'cause I feel like I understand
what it's like to be homeless, ya
know? I mean, if you didn't know
me, if we hadn't connected tonight,
you might think: "There's some
upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
self-congratulatory, insulated,
lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
had to worry about anything." But
that's not true at all! I grew up
poor, man. Single mother.
McDonald's used to have one day a
week where they sold 29 cent
hamburgers, and another day where
they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
mom and me would go there and she'd
get twenty burgers -- that was the
limit, probably set up for folks
just like us -- and then she'd put
`em in the freezer and we'd
microwave `em for dinner throughout
the week.
(MORE)
11.
KATE (CONT'D)
I was kinda overweight until high
school, to be perfectly honest.
Eating used to be my thing. When I
started drinking, though, I kinda
stopped eating so much.
(back on track)
But anyway, the point is: You and
me, we're not so different.
The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're
more concerned with their crack pipe.

Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's
eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused,
then jumps to her feet.

Kate runs through the streets.

We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS

towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --

the camera.

A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING:
"SMASHED"

Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her
hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down
at --
-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.
12.
She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland
*
Park.

Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house.

Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the

PARKING LOT AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
She's about to get out, but then notices...
...the FLASK on the floor.
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Kate chugs what's left in the flask.
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
*
MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly
*
nerdy but not bad looking, watches --
*
-- Kate drink in her car.
*
CHILDREN pass by in the distance.
*
Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he
*
walks away through the parking lot.
*
Kate doesn't notice she's been seen.

Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.
CHARLIE
Maybe you should go to, uh... one
of those meetings. They have `em
over there.
Charlie gestures to a
BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building
where AA meets).
Kate LAUGHS.
KATE
Yeah, right.
CHARLIE
Remember when I was shit-faced and
took that Q & A pamphlet from
there?
KATE
(laughs)
Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to
like every question and at the end
it was like, "If you answered `yes'
to any of these you're an
alcoholic!"
CHARLIE
Yeah...
(nostalgic)
...that was fun, wasn't it?
Kate smiles and nods.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Hey --
Charlie gestures to the street.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
-- look out for that crack!
Kate looks down but sees nothing.
KATE
What crack?
27.
CHARLIE
Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
crack there...
(grins)
...but you must have smoked it last
night.
Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
Kate chases after him.
20
22
Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.
KATE
So much for that.
Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
FURNITURE.
They drunkenly play CROQUET.
*
CHARLIE
Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
KATE
No, it was...I don't know.
Enthusiastic people. A lot of
really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
CHARLIE
Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
sorry it wasn't cool.
Charlie thinks for a moment.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I can't really imagine never
drinking. I guess I don't have to,
though --
(beat)
-- you're the one with the problem.
Kate nods in agreement.
*
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
to have to drink.
KATE
I don't have to drink.
(beat)
I just really like to drink.
*
CHARLIE
(sincere)
Good -- `cause you're my favorite
person to drink with in the whole
damn world.
Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
and then Kate...
34.
...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
grins mischievously.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Oh, no you didn't!
Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
intense.
23
25
Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
robe and slippers).
35.
26
27
Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.
Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.
A bird SQUAWKS.
Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.

*
Kate walks in the front door to see
--
*
-- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An
old record PLAYS on the record player.
KATE
Hey...
CHARLIE
Howdy.
Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.
KATE
How was your day? And what's that
smell?
CHARLIE
Eh -- alright. Couldn't find
oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.
KATE
(cringes)
Charlie! You need to eat.
CHARLIE
What? It's tasty.
(beat)
So...I'm going to see that band
*
from Iceland with the triplets play
*
tonight. Want to come with me and
Owen to check it out?
44.
KATE
Oh, that sounds fun, but...
CHARLIE
C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls
without you.
KATE
I don't know...this guy I work with
-- Mr. Davies --
CHARLIE
The Vice Principal?
KATE
Yeah -- turns out he's sober and
invited me to a meeting.
CHARLIE
(surprised)
Wow, that's...uh, cool.
Charlie goes silent.
KATE
What?
CHARLIE
Nothing -- I just...I didn't think
you really loved the meeting you
went to yesterday. In fact, it
sounded like you hated it. So I'm
kinda surprised you're going back.
KATE
Well...this is a smaller meeting.
It might be different. I dunno -- I
think I want to give it a fair
shot.
Charlie nods.
KATE (CONT'D)
Besides -- I was hammered last
night.
(beat)
Go on and have fun out drinking
with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm
just gonna, you know, try something
*
different...
Charlie pulls Kate close to him.
45.
CHARLIE
I'm here for you, okay? Even though
I drink -- I could slow down if you
need me to.
(forces a smile)
I'm sure I could.

Kate approaches a small church.
Mr. Davies waits outside.

While Kate and Charlie eat dinner, Kate drinks WATER but
focuses on Charlie's glass of WINE and the slow, careful sips
he takes.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:

Kate rides her bicycle hard. It might even be...exercise?
FADE TO BLACK.
MR. DAVIES (V.O.)
How about ninety days?

Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with

Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.

JENNY
*
I'm really proud of you, Kate.
KATE
I kinda can't believe it's been
ninety days.
(beat)
The longest I've gone since high
school without drinking was, like,
a week.
MR. DAVIES
My first three months were such
hell. I think I'm only sober today
because I just never want to go
through that again.
52.
KATE
It's weird -- in after-school
specials the getting-sober part was
only like a minute of the movie and
suddenly...daddy's all okay.
Several people LAUGH.
KATE (CONT'D)
But it's so fucking hard and weird
and suddenly I have all these other
problems now that drinking isn't
the problem.
JENNY
*
Like what?
*
KATE
Everything else. Work, my non-
existent relationship with my
mom...
JENNY
*
When was the last time you saw her?
KATE
(tries to remember)
A year, at least.
JENNY
*
Well...maybe it's time.
KATE
Maybe.
(beat)
And then there's my marriage. I
mean, Charlie's great. Really
great, he's supportive, especially
at first. It's strange, though. I
feel like alcohol was the thing
that connected us and now that I
don't drink we lead these two very
different lives.
(beat)
We haven't slept together in
forever...
(laughs)
I haven't pissed myself in awhile,
though. So that's good.
JENNY
*
It takes time.
Kate gives an exasperated look.
53.
JENNY (CONT'D)
*
(half-stern cheerleader
tone)
Keep working the steps.
(glances at her watch)
Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I
should actually run you home now
and come back. I need to start
locking up.
KATE
I could stick around and help
you...
MR. DAVIES
(to Kate)
I could take you home.
(off Kate's reaction)
If you want.
44

Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house.
MR. DAVIES
My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink --
well, not like us, but as soon as I
got sober I started to change and
she just...didn't.
KATE
I didn't know you were married.
Beat.
MR. DAVIES
Yeah, I was married once --
(laughs)
-- in my other life. But I
shouldn't be talking to you about
this stuff.
KATE
Why?
MR. DAVIES
I don't know...
KATE
Because you're a dude we can't
talk? I don't get that "men stick
with men, women stick with women"
stuff.
54.
MR. DAVIES
Well, if you were sitting where I'm
sitting you'd understand.
KATE
Are you trying to tell me that you
have a crush on me?
MR. DAVIES
What am I, one of your students?
*
Crush?
KATE
Yeah, crush.
MR. DAVIES
(long beat)
I kind of do, yes. I have a crush
on you. I know that's wrong --
you're newly sober and married and
I shouldn't be thinking about you
like that. But yeah, I should put
that out on the table.
(beat)
Honesty.
KATE
It's okay. I think you're a really
good guy.
MR. DAVIES
Oh, great -- good guys are the
nerds that carry the pretty girls'
books.
KATE
Oh, c'mon...
MR. DAVIES
I think you're beautiful.
Kate smiles bashfully.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
And smart, and sexy, and cool...
Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
And I know it's wrong, but -- in
meetings I stare at your lips and
your legs and all I can think about
is fucking your moist pussy.
55.
Kate jumps back, aghast.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
(off Kate's horrified
expression)
Oh, crap! I don't know why I just
said that. I'm really, really
sorry.
KATE
WHAT THE FUCK?
MR. DAVIES
(genuinely sorry)
Oh, that was a bad thing to say,
right?
KATE
YES.
MR. DAVIES
I'm so, so sorry. I'm just
confused, and I don't know how to
talk to women --
KATE
Jesus -- you can't just go around
telling people you want to fuck
their "moist pussy."
(beat)
Who even says that?
MR. DAVIES
I'm really sorry.
Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in
to say --
KATE
I have to go inside my house --
where I live with my husband.
(beat)
Thanks for your creepy version of
honesty.
45

Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --
-- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin
look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as
well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.
CHARLIE
Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed
those guys.
Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(waving to a lawn-gnome)
Hi, Holger!
Kate LAUGHS. Long beat.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
So...we gonna go in?
Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face.
49

Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.
KATE
(unsettled)
I should've brought something.
CHARLIE
You're fine.
KATE
Something, you know? Flowers, or...
CHARLIE
Wine?
KATE
No. Definitely not that.
They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like
she'd be okay if they ran back to the car.
60.
KATE (CONT'D)
(conceding)
Go on...
Charlie KNOCKS.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
S'minute!
KATE
(under her breath)
Oh, God...
The door opens, revealing --
-- ROCHELLE: late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys
an afternoon drink or three.
ROCHELLE
(surprised)
Katie!
Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.
ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
What're you doing here?
KATE
I left you a message, mom.
ROCHELLE
Oh, you know I don't check that
thing.
(notices Charlie; slightly
flirty)
Hello there, young man.
CHARLIE
Hi, Ms. Foster.
ROCHELLE
Well, then...
(beat)
...what a lovely surprise -- you
two came to visit. Hell has frozen
over.
(laughs)
Just kidding. Come inside -- let me
fix you both some drinks.
KATE
Just water for me.
61.
Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie
-- she already seems slightly annoyed.
50
51
Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --
-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the
middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time.
Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.
Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.
KATE
This place shut down a decade ago
and then there was a fire and now
it's basically abandoned.
Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
place.
KATE (CONT'D)
We came here every year the week
before Christmas.
(MORE)
65.
KATE (CONT'D)
And then I worked here in high
school -- selling hot chocolate.
And they had real reindeer, too.
They kept `em over there.
Kate points at the remains of a PEN.
KATE (CONT'D)
My mom worked here when she was
younger. I think everyone who grew
*
up around here worked at Santa's
Village at some point.
Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place.
KATE (CONT'D)
This is what I think of when I
think of Christmas.
(long beat)
Thanks for coming up here with me.
CHARLIE
Of course.
KATE
I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
CHARLIE
(shrugs)
She just can't handle her liquor.
Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a
moment. And then Charlie asks --
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Did you ever hook up with guys when
you worked here?
KATE
Huh?
CHARLIE
You know -- sneak off with a co-
worker and do it against a pine
tree or something?
KATE
Um...no.
66.
CHARLIE
I mean, if I were a teenage boy
working with a stone cold fox like
you I'd totally want to hook up
with you here. Like...in the ginger
bread house.
Charlie puts his arms around Kate.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
You were probably the coolest girl
in town -- and the prettiest. I'm
sure everyone was in love with you.
Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet.

Kate walks to her car.
MR. DAVIES (O.S.)
Kate!
Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she
doesn't reply or slow down.
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
Kate?
KATE
(stops)
What?
MR. DAVIES
Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You
have no idea how much this has been
eating me up.
68.
Long beat.
KATE
What you said to me was really
fucked up.
MR. DAVIES
I know.
KATE
What were you even thinking?
MR. DAVIES
I wasn't -- I was just...I try to
be really honest.
KATE
I get that. But you can't force
your "honesty" on everyone you
know.
Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed.
KATE (CONT'D)
(changing tone)
I'm flattered that you
have...feelings for me. I am. But
I'm married.
MR. DAVIES
I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize
to your husband if you want.
KATE
No -- you don't have to do that. I
didn't even tell him. But...you
can't say that to a girl -- like,
ever.
MR. DAVIES
Okay.
KATE
Seriously. Consider that a rule of
thumb.
(beat)
Someday, you're gonna meet a nice,
available lady -- but if you say
"moist pussy" to her, you will
never, ever, ever get to see that
part of her body!
69.
MR. DAVIES
(even more embarrassed)
Okay.
(beat)
Thank you.
(nods)
I feel like this was a really good
talk.
Kate forces a smile.

Kate follows Jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she

students multiple times.

KATE (CONT'D)

JENNY

Well, you're not normal.

None of us are.
KATE
Everything in life isn't connected

I'm not just talking about
alcoholics.

People are fucking weird. We all
have a lot of shit we carry around
in our heads that doesn't make

At least alcoholics have tools to
work through it.

KATE
"Steps"...
JENNY
*
Yeah, steps -- and talking and
listening and crying...
KATE
I have the crying part covered.
JENNY

I know, right? I think my first
year I cried tears I'd been saving
since I was eight.
(beat)
It's hard to live your
life...honestly. You know?
Kate nods.
JENNY (CONT'D)
*
Any idea what you're gonna do about
your school situation? What you're
gonna say?
Kate shakes her head.

KATE
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about anything.
JENNY
*
Listen...you wanna stay in my guest
*
room tonight? You can watch movies,
get some good sleep...?
KATE
You sure that's okay?
JENNY
*
Yeah, of course. That's why I spent
money on a guest bed -- so people
could sleep in it.

I know it might feel like it, but
really, you don't have to figure
everything out tonight.

Kate! Are you sure you're --

Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in
front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.
CHARLIE
Miss our house?

KATE
Um...yeah. Sometimes.
CHARLIE
(hesitant)
Miss me?
Beat.
KATE
Sometimes.
(long beat)
I've been sober for a year.
CHARLIE
Really?
KATE
Yeah.
Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP,
showing it to Charlie.
CHARLIE
They gave you that?
KATE
Yeah. A couple of days ago.
Tuesday.
CHARLIE
Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's
really...really...just great. I
mean it.
(beat)
Tuesday is the night I got pulled
over.
(laughs)
Parallel lives, huh?
Kate rolls her eyes.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
So -- you dating anyone?
KATE
(taken aback)
Charlie...
CHARLIE
Are you?
Silence.
103.
KATE
No.
Charlie seems relieved.
CHARLIE
Me either. Owen keeps trying to get
me to be his "wing-man" and it's
ridiculous and these girls in bars
are so lame and I just keep
thinking how I wish I was meeting
you in a bar for the first time and
I didn't come with any baggage and
I could buy you a drink and flirt
with you all night and ask for your
number.
(beat)
Wanna go out sometime?
KATE
I don't think it's a good idea.
Charlie nods. Long beat.
CHARLIE
I fucked up, didn't I?
Kate looks down, doesn't speak.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a
beautiful woman who used to love me
and now when I see her she doesn't
even want to look me in the eyes.
KATE
Charlie, please don't do this.
CHARLIE
I miss you. I miss the way you
taste and smell and...I miss things
about you that used to drive me
nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's
music and fake punk-rock from the
90's...
KATE
I don't like shitty 80's music.
(beat)
I like good 80's music.
104.
CHARLIE
...and all I want to do is touch
you one more time to just, remember
-- to make sure it was real.
Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a
slight smile.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(changing course)
Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional
fucking idiot.

77
Kate and Charlie play croquet.
*
106.
They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.
CHARLIE
Have you been playing a lot?
KATE
I haven't played in over a year.
CHARLIE
Then how're you beating me?
KATE
I don't know. Innate talent?
They keep playing.
CHARLIE
I haven't met anyone even vaguely
interesting since we separated.
KATE
Um...stick to the game, okay?
Long beat.
CHARLIE
I've been masturbating like crazy.
KATE
Charlie --
CHARLIE
I miss you.
KATE
Stop it.
CHARLIE
Okay. Fine.
Beat.
KATE
You could've been killed.
CHARLIE
(confused)
What?
KATE
Riding your bike -- drunk.
107.
CHARLIE
But I wasn't.
KATE
But is that really the point?
CHARLIE
What are trying to say?
KATE
(beat)
I worry about you.
CHARLIE
(laughs)
Yeah, I can understand that. I used
to worry about you. But now I know
you're okay.
(beat)
That makes me happy...I mean, it
fucking sucks that you're better
off without me but I'm glad you're
doing well.
No reply from Kate.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Would you move back in if I came to
meetings?
KATE
You should go for yourself, not to
make me happy.
CHARLIE
But, would you?
KATE
I'm not moving back in.
That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.
KATE (CONT'D)
Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
dark soon.
CHARLIE
We can always turn the lights on.
KATE
I don't know...
Beat.
108.
CHARLIE
So, would you at least...let me
take you out on a date?
Kate says nothing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Maybe...?
Kate shakes her head.
Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
(new direction)
Last question: can we just...play
one more game?
Kate doesn't answer.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
It's embarrassing. You've gotta
give me a chance to redeem myself.
(soft)
Please.
Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...
...but she also doesn't say no.
There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
CUT TO BLACK.
