                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. BEACON HILL - MANSION - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT 

      CLOSE ON: A CHINA TEACUP AND SAUCER.  It s wobbling on an 
      unstable surface, we can t tell what...  

      TIGHT ON a MAN'S EYES, TERRIFIED.  A few DROPS of BLOOD SEEP 
      from a gash on his cheek.  

      REVEAL the TEA CUP is balanced on his BOUND KNEES. Duct-taped 
      ankles, knees, wrists, mouth. He FIGHTS the urge to move. A 
      wedding band GLINTS on his left hand.

      SILHOUETTE OF ANOTHER MAN is BACKLIT by an enormous stained 
      glass window. He FORCES a crying WOMAN to take off her 
      nightgown. We can t make out his features but we can tell 
      that he s grinning. He RAISES his hand. He HOLDS a KNIFE. She 
      SCREAMS. It MORPHS into another sound as we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      TWANG! a basketball BANGS into a backyard hoop. Misses.

      EXT. RIZZOLI FAMILY HOME - DAY

      REVEAL DETECTIVE JANE RIZZOLI, 30. She PLAYS B-ball with her 
      brother, FRANKIE JR., 28, a Boston P.D. patrol officer. He 
      has on a BOSTON PD T-shirt. She wears nice sweat pants and a 
      tank top that reads: Scare Yourself Every Day. 

      Jane s face is arresting: a quirky beauty that evolved over 
      time. She s a high-strung Yankee, yet she moves with an 
      athletic grace. She SHOOTS. It goes in. 

                                  JANE
                    Finally.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Still behind by ten.

      She SMILES.

                                  JANE
                    I will beat you someday.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    You beat me at everything. Let me 
                    be better at something. 

      He has a smile on his face, tries to convince them both that 
      he s joking. But there s too much history and hurt truth 
      behind it. Makes her sad. She PASSES the ball to distract 
      him.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 2



      He RUNS down the driveway for a LAY-UP. She DEFENDS. He 
      THROWS an elbow. CRACK!

                                  JANE 
                    Ow!

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Oh, crap --

      Blood FLOWS from her nose. Frankie pulls off his T-shirt, 
      HANDS it to her.

                                    FRANKIE JR. (CONT'D)
                    Oh, man, I m so sorry, Janie. I ll 
                    get ice.

                                  JANE
                      Uh...S okay...

      She WOBBLES away, holding his shirt to her nose.

      INT. RIZZOLI FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

      Jane uses a faded rooster towel to wipe blood from her nose 
      as ANGELA RIZZOLI, 55, enters.   The kitchen, like Angela, 
      was new in the 70 s. Both are held together by pride and hard 
      work. She snatches the towel from Jane, hands her paper ones.

                                  ANGELA
                    On the nice towels? What happened?

      Angela scrubs the towel as Jane stops the bleeding. She MIMES 
      wiping blood over Angela s back. Frankie Jr. LAUGHS. 

                                  ANGELA (CONT'D)
                    What re you two doing back there?

      They laugh like little kids.

                                  FRANK SR. (O.S.)
                    What s so funny?

      FRANK RIZZOLI, SR. 55, and MIKE  MIKEY  RIZZOLI, 32, Jane s 
      oldest brother, CARRY groceries and a cake.

                                  MIKEY
                    Wow, you look great, Sis.

                                  JANE
                    Blood is the new black.

      She pretends to hug him, he BACKS AWAY, WINKS at Frankie Jr.

                                  MIKEY
                    You do that?RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 3



                                  JANE
                    I needed a nose job. Don t worry.

                                  MIKEY
                    You re a screw-up, Dude.

      He CUFFS him playfully, but Frankie Jr. looks STUNG. 

                                  JANE
                    I ran into his elbow. C mon, Mikey.

      Jane s cell rings: POP version of DRAGNET THEME SONG.  She 
      hunts for it. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, someone named Bird Something 
                    keeps calling.

      Jane and Frankie Jr. trade a knowing LOOK.

                                  JANE
                    Detective Crowe? You answered my 
                    phone, Ma? Why didn t you tell me?

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    Rizzoli.

      EXT. BEACON HILL - MANSION - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)

      DET. DARREN CROWE, 30 s, on his cellphone. He has a frat-
      boy s insouciance combined with an aging ballplayer s good 
      looks.  He stands on the lawn of a mansion as CRIME SCENE 
      UNIT (CSU) TECHS and BOSTON P.D. UNIFORMS SWARM in and out of 
      an expensively renovated mansion.

                                  CROWE
                    Bad things on Beacon Hill, and 
                    you re up. 

                                  JANE 
                    Let me talk to Frost.

      ANGLE: DET. BARRY FROST, 28, buff African American cop, PUKES 
      into bushes. Crowe taunts him with a SALUTE. Frost pukes 
      again. 

                                  CROWE
                    He s busy.

                                  JANE
                    On my way.

      Jane hangs up, tosses bloody paper towels into the trash. Her 
      nose has stopped bleeding but Angela hands her an icepack. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 4



                                  ANGELA
                    It won t be attractive if your nose 
                    swells. Never know who you might 
                    run into.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Ma --

      Jane takes the ice, throws Frankie Jr. a grateful look.

                                  JANE
                    I meet so many great guys at work. 
                    Too bad they re all dead. 

      She grabs her stuff, starts to exit. Angela FROWNS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I told you I was on-call --

                                  ANGELA
                    It s Frankie Jr. s birthday!

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Go. It s fine. 
                          (wishes he was going)
                    Murder?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. You ll get there, Frankie.

      She HANDS him a gift.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    If you hate it, gift receipt s 
                    inside.

      She gives him a quick KISS on his cheek. Jane pecks her 
      mother then her father on the cheek --

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I ll call you, Ma. Bye, Pop. See at 
                    the salt mines, Frankie. Your ass 
                    is getting big, Mikey.

      INT. JANE S CAR/EXT. RIZZOLI S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

      Jane gets into her state issue Ford. It s parked next to a 
      van that reads: RIZZOLI & SONS PLUMBING. Boston s Best Since 
      1954.

      JANE S POV: THRU WINDSHIELD INTO KITCHEN

      Angela and Frank laugh and fuss over Mikey and Frankie Jr.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 5



      CLOSE ON: Jane s hands. WE SEE two nasty and identical HEALED 
      RED SCARS on her palms. She RUBS them absently as she stares 
      at her family. SHOVES her car into reverse and takes off.

      INT. JANE S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

      As she drives, Jane reaches for clean clothes from the back 
      seat. She PULLS UP to a stoplight, wriggles out of her pants.  
      A truck driver SMILES. She SMILES back. 

      His smile grows into a LEER. She REACHES UNDER HER SEAT, 
      while she gives him a shy smile. Grabs something and THROWS 
      it on top of her car: police CHEERY LIGHT. LIGHTS and SIRENS 
      through the red stoplight, enjoying his terrified reaction in 
      her rearview mirror.

      INT. DR. ISLE S CAR (MOVING) - SAME

      DR. MAURA ISLES, late 30 s, behind the wheel of an SL-500 
      Mercedes.  Sleek, like her car, in form-fitting black. She s 
      strikingly pale with a slash of red lipstick, blunt-cut raven 
      hair.

      BEEP! Maura SEES a car in her rearview mirror trying to PASS 
      her on the right.  She slows down. Driver FLIES past her. 
      Dirt and sand from the shoulder WHIP up around her car. 

                                  MAURA
                    Go ahead, asshole. I see plenty 
                    like you on cold slabs all day 
                    long.

      INT. MAURA S CAR/EXT. BEACON HILL MANSION - CONTINUOUS

      She pulls the SL-500 into a long driveway, parks next to a 
      coroner s van with black letters: Commonwealth of 
      Massachusetts, Office of the Medical Examiner. TWO MORGUE 
      ATTENDANTS wave from the front seat. She waves back. 

      REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS work the taped-off crime-scene, 
      hovering as close as COPS will let them. She gets out.

      ANGLE ON: REPORTER KITTY VANSEN, 31, TV-pretty as she SPIES 
      Maura. She PUSHES her beleaguered CAMERAMAN toward Maura. He 
      perks up: SCHWING. Dr. Maura Isles may be a cold pathologist, 
      but she s also a smokin  hot woman.

                                  KITTY
                    Go, go. It s Queen of the Dead. Get 
                    her and stay close.

      Maura, with her medical case, deftly moves away from Kitty as 
      Kitty and the cameraman run. Kitty shoves a mic at Maura. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 6



                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Isles -- What can you tell us 
                    about the murders? 

                                  MAURA
                    I ll have a statement for you later 
                    tonight, Kitty.

                                  KITTY
                    C mon, please, something for the 
                      11 o clock? This leads.

      Maura starts up STEPS as Crowe puts out a hand to stop Kitty 
      from going any further. She backs away.

                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Bet if I was a corpse, she d talk 
                    to me.

      Maura enters the mansion. Crowe casually applies chapstick 
      and smooths his Ken-doll hair then turns back to Kitty. 

                                  CROWE
                    I ll give you a soundbite.

      ANGLE ON Jane as she POWERS toward them, steps between Crowe 
      and Kitty, BLOCKING the shot. Cameraman lowers his camera.

                                  JANE 
                    Where s Frost?

                                  CROWE
                    Where else?

      Crowe points at Frost, nearby and partially concealed by 
      bushes. He s stopped puking, but he doesn t look good. 

                                  FROST
                          (calls to her)
                    Bad fish sticks.

      Crowe SNORTS as Frost CROSSES to join Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Least he s not trying to get his 
                    mug on-camera. 

      Jane pulls a small tin of Vick s VapoRub from a pocket, hands 
      it to Frost. He rubs it under his nose. They walk up the 
      front steps. 

      Jane REACHES for the door. She pulls her hand back and rubs 
      her palms together. She catches Frost s concerned look.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    It s going to rain. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 7



                                  FROST
                    Hands hurt?

                                  JANE
                    Not that bad.

      INT. MANSION - NIGHT

      Jane and Frost stand in a marble entry, stare at a vast home. 
      Polished, old wood, cathedral-height ceilings. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Not in South Boston anymore, 
                    Dorothy. 

      DET. VINCE KORSAK, 50 s, doughy in his shirt sleeves and 
      breathing hard, appears from another part of the house. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak?

      Korsak EYES Frost, not happy to see him.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You know my new partner.

                                  FROST
                    Good to see you. Thought you were 
                    on vacation.

                                  KORSAK
                    Cut it short.

      He looks intently at Jane, his old partner. She senses 
      something more than just antipathy toward Frost.

                                  JANE
                    That bad?

                                  DET. KORSAK 
                    Worse.

      INT. BEACON HILL - MANSION - FAMILY ROOM - LATER

      CLOSE ON the body of a MAN: the bound man we saw earlier. No 
      sign of the woman. His throat has been SLIT, and he s seated, 
      propped against a wall under a comet s tail of dried BLOOD. 

      Jane, Frost and Korsak, all gloved, process the crime scene 
      as Maura SLIDES a tongue depressor into the deep neck wound. 
      It goes almost all the way in. Frost turns away.

                                  MAURA
                    Almost 5 centimeters. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 8



                                  FROST
                    If you got this, I can start 
                      processing the rest of the house. 

      Jane nods sympathetically. Frost exits. Korsak smirks.

                                  MAURA
                    Carotid artery and jugular have 
                    been transected. What s odd is how 
                    precise it is - almost surgical. 

                                  JANE
                    You think our perp might have some 
                    medical training?

      Maura nods, looks up and studies Jane s broken nose.

                                  MAURA
                    Hairline fracture of the nasal bone 
                    above the lateral nasal cartilage. 
                    Not disfiguring.

      Korsak looks at the corpse, confused.

                                  KORSAK 
                    Looks pretty disfiguring to me.

                                  JANE
                    Can you pop it out?

      Maura pulls off her gloves. Korsak watches, baffled.

                                  MAURA
                    Can t you do something safe like 
                    yoga? Might hurt a little --

      Maura POPS Jane s nose into place.  An audible CRACK!

                                  JANE
                    Ow! A  little ? 

                                  MAURA
                    Put ice on it for the next 24 hours 
                    so you don t look like Mike Tyson. 

      Jane turns to Korsak.

                                  JANE 
                    Who is he?

                    Dr. Richard Yeager, 36, 
                      pediatrician. Housekeeper found 
                    him. He s a newlywed. Wife Gail is

      Jane SCANS photos of a beautiful bride and groom arranged on 
      a baby grand. She absent-mindedly touches the piano, so 
      familiar with the instrument, she TAPS KEYS like they re an 
      extension of her body. PLAYS a few notes of the haunting 
      Falling Slowly. 

                                  JANE
                    Needs tuning. Nobody plays.

      Jane sees a shot of the bride showing off a big diamond ring.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Diamond was too small so she 
                    whacked him and walked out?

                                  KORSAK
                    No. We got signs of forced entry. 

      Jane looks carefully at Dr. Yeager s body. Her face takes on 
      a haunted look as she finds something. She LIFTS pieces of a 
      broken china cup and saucer from next to the body.

                                  JANE
                      Well-to-do couple. The man bound 
                    and posed. The woman missing. And a 
                    teacup...

      QUICK POP: SCALPEL glints in a man s hand as he DRIVES IT 
      through something to SKEWER it to a dirt floor. It s so quick 
      and so dark, it s hard to tell what the  something  is -- but 
      it looks like a WOMAN S HAND.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Jane squeezes her hands into fists. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Is he out? Is the Surgeon out?

                                  MAURA
                    Oh my God. Korsak, did you know 
                    this?

                                  KORSAK
                    No, no. He s not out. It s his M.O. 
                    that s all. 

                                  MAURA
                    Why didn t you warn us? Warn Jane 
                    at least.

                                  KORSAK
                    I m sorry. I wanted your unbiased 
                      assessment.

                    We put that son of a bitch behind 
                    bars. How is this possible?

                                  KORSAK
                    Listen to me: It s not him, it s 
                    not the Surgeon. I checked with 
                    prison authorities: he s in 
                    lockdown at Souza-Baranowski. 

      Jane reflexively rubs her palms together. 

                                  MAURA
                    Let s make sure.

      Jane nods, DIALS her cell.

                    Warren Hoyt...yes, now. And tell 
                     em I want video confirmation.

      She hangs up, TRADES a LOOK with Maura. Walks to the victim.

      CLOSE ON red circular marks on the corpses s skin. She GASPS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    He s been Tasered. Like Hoyt did...

                    No -- you said it was worse. It is. 
                    We didn t release this detail.

      She turns her face so only Maura can see her fear.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hoyt s trained an Apprentice.

      A MAN in silhouette works a heavy set of barbells as he

      INT. SOUZA-BARONOWSKI PRISON - MAX SECURITY REC ROOM - SAME

      Jane s face. PULL-BACK to REVEAL PRISONERS watching footage 
      of her in a local crime story. 

      FIND WARREN HOYT, 40 s, watching. Good-looking, a guy who 
      might drive a Volvo and listen to talk radio. And then we see 
      his eyes: inhuman evil is embedded there. He SMILES and 
      FINGERS something in his pocket. He BLOCKS TV SCREEN. 

                                  HOYT
                    Hello, Jane. So good to see you.

      A pissed and BURLY Chicano prisoner, MIGUEL, 20 s, PUSHES 
      Hoyt from behind.

                                  MIGUEL
                    Hey, Hoyt, vendejo! Move!

      With sudden, manic intensity, Hoyt pulls a homemade SHIV he 
      had concealed in his pocket. He DRIVES it neatly between the 
      man s ribs. Catches the man as he FALLS FORWARD.

                                  PRISONER (O.S.)
                    Miguel!

                    aortic chamber. I m grateful you 
                      volunteered to help, Miguel. This 
                    will be over in seconds.

      Hoyt LAYS his hands in the STREAM OF BLOOD pumping from the 
      dying man s chest. He has the look of someone at the height 
      of sexual pleasure. PRISONERS YELL as GUARDS RUN in, clubs 
      out. GUARD 1 YANKS Hoyt to his feet.

                                  GUARD 2
                    Back! Everyone get back!

      Hoyt is serene as he s cuffed and led past hardened criminals 
      who step away from the deadliest one in their midst. Hoyt 
      SMILES up at the TV as footage of Jane still plays.

                                  HOYT
                    It s time, Jane.

      EXT. BEACON HILL - MANSION - NIGHT

      Jane and Korsak walk toward a CSU van. The lawn and driveway 
      are still swarming with CSU s, news crews and Cops.

                                  KORSAK
                    I m sorry.

                                  JANE
                    Stop. I m a cop first, Hoyt s 
                    victim a distant second.

      He looks at her, wants to say something. Finally --

                                  KORSAK
                    Hoyt s the reason you don t want to 
                    be partners, isn t he? 

                                  JANE
                    This again? You know why: I m 
                    allergic to cats. And dogs. And all 
                    the other sad, furry creatures you 
                    keep rescuing, Detective Doolittle.

      inside.

      INT. BEACON HILL - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

      Maura MAKES notes as Jane and Korsak set up equipment. As two 
      MORGUE ATTENDANTS try to force Dr. Yeager s rigor-mortis 
      stiffened body into a body bag --

      They TIP the body onto a stretcher. Jane moves to where the 
      body was propped. She bends down, looks out at the room.

      REVERSE ANGLE: coffee table in the center. 

                                  JANE
                    Our perp went to a lot of trouble 
                    with that teacup. He wanted to know 
                    if Yeager moved. Why? What was he 
                    doing? And why force Yeager to 
                    watch? Let s move the table.

      Korsak moves it as FBI SPECIAL AGENT GABRIEL DEAN, 35, 
      enters. GQ-handsome and completely unaware of how hot he is. 
      He BADGES Jane.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Special Agent Gabriel Dean. You 
                    must be Det. Rizzoli.

      He turns solicitously to Maura, admiring her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    And you must be Dr. Maura Isles.

      Maura smiles unexpectedly, removes her latex gloves to shake 
      his hand. The chemistry between them isn t lost on Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    What s the FBI doing here? 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Saw the homicide advisory. And 
                    possible kidnapping. We have an APB 
                    out on Gail Yeager.

                                  JANE
                    So do we. You get a lot of routine 
                      advisories. What makes this one 
                    special?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Hey, we re on the same side.

                                  JANE
                    Are we? You Fed Boys like to show 
                    up to take the bat and ball. I ll

                    Bureau?

      Morgue Attendants carry the body out. As Maura leaves --

                    Come if you like.

      Dean smiles. Jane shoots Maura a look that could kill: thanks 
      a lot. Maura shrugs innocently and exits.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I m just here to observe.

                    table was.

                    This baby is 400 watts. Picks up 
                      everything.

      Jane HITS the lights. The Crimescope makes their faces GLOW 
      GREEN as a PATCH of carpet that was under the table LIGHTS UP 
      a bright white. Jane FLIPS the lights ON. She looks grim. 

                                  JANE
                    Semen. He made her husband watch 
                    while he raped her. Just like Hoyt.

                    Airtight alibi, all right.

      Frost SHOWS Jane video of Hoyt on Frost s cellphone. Korsak 
      SLUMPS against a car, RUBS his sleepless eyes.

                                  JANE
                    Tonight? That s not a coincidence.

      A light RAIN FALLS on them as Jane pulls out car keys.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We can t get in the prison until 
                    7:00. Korsak, go get some sleep.

                                  JANE
                    We need to talk.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                          (closing door)
                    Call my office.

      Jane STOPS the door with her hand. 

                                  JANE
                    We have a killer out there. His 
                    signature is identical to Hoyt s. 

      We can see from the way Dr. O Donnell tries not to stare that 
      she knows how Jane got those scars on her palms. 

      INT. DR. O DONNELL S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Dr. O Donnell sips tea from a Mid-Century Modern set. Jane 
      and Frost don t touch theirs. Her living room is like her: 
      expensive and calculated -- perfect for a Vanity Fair spread. 

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    I m a forensic psychiatrist. My 
                    work advances our understanding of 
                    these troubled men. I m not sure 
                    how I can help you.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 16



                                  JANE
                    You visit him. Could he have 
                    trained some perp he met inside, 
                    someone as deranged as he is?

      Dr. O Donnell gets up, pulls a file from a cabinet, rifles 
      through it and holds up a photo of a second grade boy.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    You can only see the end result. 
                    This is Warren at seven. 

                                  JANE
                    He s called the Surgeon because he 
                    enjoys cutting women and their 
                    partners up with a scalpel. Seven 
                    at last count. I have a hard time 
                    worrying about his sad childhood.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    You think of violent acts as 
                      manifestations of evil. As though 
                    Warren has control over his 
                    behavior. Like many others, he 
                    doesn t know why he kills.

                                  JANE
                    That s why I ll always have a job.

      As she s talking, Jane subtly plays with a few strands of her 
      hair. Not girly, just distracted.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    Did you know hair twirling is often 
                    a sign of sexual frustration?

                                  JANE
                    That right? I always wondered. 
                    Better get on with my night then.

      Jane smiles politely, STANDS. Frost follows her lead.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for your time.

      EXT. SOUZA-BARANOWSKI PRISON - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      Jane and Frost walk up to the main entrance. Jane puts 
      fingers in her hair absently, stops, now aware of her habit.

                                  FROST
                    You sure you want to do this?

      INT. SOUZA-BARANOWSKI PRISON - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

      Jane and Frost face Warren Hoyt. His hands are shackled but 
      he s as comfortable as a man chatting at Starbucks.

                                  HOYT
                    You re different, not like the 
                    others. I feel your anger, absorb 
                    your rage, just by your scent.

      He takes a deep inhale, smiles. She fights to stay steady.

                                  JANE
                    See one. Do one. Teach one. That s 
                    what they taught you in medical 
                    school. Who did you teach, Hoyt?

                                  HOYT
                    I dropped out, Jane. You know that.
                    I like your neck. It s very white. 
                    And your breasts. Very firm.

                                  JANE
                    You think you re Hannibal Lector? 
                    Don t flatter yourself. You think I 
                    can t make your life more miserable  
                    than it is? 

      Hoyt smiles, turns to Frost.

                                  HOYT
                    I like an audience. I prefer it 
                    when they re tied up, but silence 
                    works, too.

                                  JANE
                    Who did you sic on the world? Gimme 
                    me a name.

                                  HOYT 
                    All my life I have been meticulous 
                    about finishing what I start. This 
                    disturbs me. That I haven t 
                    finished what I started with you. 

                                  JANE
                    And you won t, you sick scumbag.

                                  HOYT
                    Very good, Jane. You ve learned how 
                    to irritate me. You know, my mother 
                    smelled of Chanel #5 and mink when 
                    she pinched my skin. She liked to 
                    grab me here -- RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 18



      He lifts his shackled hands to indicate his throat as a GUARD 
      reacts. Hoyt lowers his hands. Guard steps back.

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    Perhaps that s why I m partial to 
                    the throat. Do you dream about me? 
                    I dream about you.

                                  JANE
                    I don t think about you. But I ll 
                    visit every goddamn day if you tell 
                    me who your friend is. Who killed 
                    Dr. Yeager and where s his wife?

      Hoyt MOTIONS for the PRISON GUARD. 

                                  HOYT
                          (like a therapist)
                    I see our time is up.

      He stands, not bothered that his ankles are shackled. Like a 
      caged but still powerful lion, he deftly shuffles to the 
      door. He stops, looks at Jane. A parting volley --

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    You re right -- my friend is out 
                    there. Enjoy him. He ll enjoy you.

      She watches him leave, FIGHTS to maintain her composure. 

                                  JANE
                    Swell.

      Her cell RINGS. She JUMPS. Exhales hard, calmly answers.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                      Rizzoli...we re on the way.

      She hangs up, looks at Frost.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    They found Gail Yeager.

      INT. JANE S CAR/EXT. STONYBROOK PARK - DAWN 

      Jane pulls in, stops. She rubs her jaw, LOOKS through the 
      windshield. Agent Dean STEPS from the woods to join Korsak 
      and Crowe. Frost gets out.

                                  JANE
                    I ll catch up.

      Jane DUMPS out her purse: gum, balled-up tissue, Boston Red 
      Sox water bottle, Vick s VapoRub, a touch-screen Sudoku 
      Puzzle. SEARCHES but can t find what she s looking for.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 19


      Puts her hand between the seats. SMILES as she holds up a 
      tube of old lipstick: Eureka.

      EXT. STONYBROOK RESERVATION - WOODS - DAY

      Jane approaches Dean, Korsak, Crowe and Frost.

                                  CROWE
                    You wearing lipstick, Rizzoli? 

      Jane looks at a shaken MAN with a Labrador.

                                  JANE 
                    Dog find her?

                    Dr. Isles is in the woods with the 
                    body. I ll show you.

      They push through brush as Korsak fawns over the dog. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Who s a good boy, huh?

      CLOSE ON a woman s body, her long blond hair a stiff mat of 
      straw.  She s naked, her abdomen bloated. Maura uses a 
      hypodermic needle to extract fluid from the corpse s eyeball.

                    Nice and clear. 

                                  JANE
                    Damnit. We could ve saved her.

                                  MAURA
                    Don t go there, Jane. She s been 
                    dead at least 48 hours. 

                                  JANE
                    Look at the way the body s laid 
                    out. Why didn t he bury her?

                    Didn t have time.

                                  JANE
                    I don t think so. Means something.

                    You know more about Hoyt than

      INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER S OFFICE - MORGUE - DAY

      BODIES of Dr. Yeager and Gail Yeager are on separate metal 
      tables. Maura WORKS on Gail s body. Korsak has on a large 
      O.R. gown and bouffant paper cap. He EATS a cheese Danish. 
      Jane enters. He offers her one from a box.

                    Uh, bathroom.

      Maura smiles. Korsak nods, a little smug. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Prison was a bust. Hoyt has no

                    I hadn t planned to but I can.

      Maura takes a scraping from Gail Yeager s vagina (we don t 
      see this), puts it on a slide, LOOKS through a microscope.

                                  MAURA (CONT'D)

      Dean s cell rings. He walks out to take the call.

                    It looks ragged, almost like a

                    There s a black band near the root. 

      Korsak hogs the microscope as Frost clears his throat.

                                  MAURA
                    Distal banding and brushlike root 
                    ends are postmortem changes. 
                    Whoever we re looking for had close 
                    contact with a corpse. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Wait -- so our Apprentice had sex 
                    with Gail Yeager after she, uh, 
                    expired. And sex with --
                          (points at hair)
                    -- a different woman who was, uh, 
                    also expired and decaying. 

      He shakes his head, unnerved by this thought. Frost 
      inadvertently GAGS. The two men unexpectedly share a LOOK as 
      their faces register the same thing: Ick. Korsak looks away.

                                  JANE
                    We ve got another victim or our 
                      Apprentice works with dead bodies. 

                                  FROST
                    What about someone in a funeral 
                    home? Gail Yeager buried her mother 
                    two weeks ago.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 23



      As Frost and Jane start to leave, Korsak follows. 

                                  FROST (CONT'D)
                    We got this. 

      Jane TOSSES Korsak an apologetic shrug.

      INT. WHITNEY FUNERAL HOME - DAY

      JOEY VALENTINE, 30 s, is dressed like an artist: cool specs 
      and shirt. Takes his exterior-decorating of the dead very 
      seriously. He looks at a photo of Gail Yeager as Jane and 
      Frost watch him.

                                  JOEY
                    Sure, I remember her. Had to 
                    convince her to let me use Mac Glam 
                    and a curling iron on Mom. She 
                    turned out beautifully. Features 
                    really popped.

      Joey masterfully dusts the dead woman with a blush brush.

                                  JANE
                    You don t have an embalmers  
                    license.

                                  JOEY
                    Haven t gotten around to it.

                                  FROST
                    Because you have a criminal record.

      Joey freezes, holding out the make-up brush.

                                  JOEY
                    You re not gonna tell my boss?

                                  JANE
                    Only if you killed Gail Yeager. 
                    Where were you Wednesday night?

                                  JOEY
                    Here. Look, everybody told me what 
                    a good job I did, how alive Mom 
                    looked, so why would I kill Gail?

      Jane shows him a search warrant.

                                  JANE
                    We ll need to search the premises 
                    and your car.

      Frost starts to exit. Jane hangs back, makes sure he can t 
      hear her. She puts a hand to her healing nose.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 24

      INT. SOUZA-BARANOWSKI PRISON - HOYT S CELL - SAME

      FOOTSTEPS can be heard as GUARDS approach down a long 
      corridor. Hoyt reaches under his thin mattress, pulls out a 
      crumpled tissue. Inside is a BLUE PILL. He dry swallows it, 
      lies back. Guard RAPS on the bars. 

                                  GUARD 2
                    Let s go, Hoyt. You got your one 
                    hour on the yard. 

      They open his cell, but Hoyt clutches his abdomen and MOANS. 
      They PULL him up, try to get him on his feet. But he PITCHES 
      forward, his eyes ROLLING back in his head. He COLLAPSES.

                                  GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
                    He s faking. Be careful.

      Guard 2 KNEES Hoyt in the balls. He doesn t react.

                                  GUARD 1
                    He ain t faking.

      Guard 1 grabs his Walkie-Talkie.

                                  GUARD 2

      Jane and Frost are working. She stands, stretches then 
      studies a Boston map with colored PUSH PINS. 

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt hit here, here and--

                    within Boston city limits.

      A heavy beat as she realizes what Frost means --

                    You should eat something. I ordered 
                    a pizza.

      Frost exits. Jane goes back to work. Doesn t see or hear a 
      MAN silently approach her in the SHADOWS.

      CLOSE ON: MAN S BLACK LEATHER SHOE.

                                  Man (O.S.)
                    Jane.

      Jane STARTLES. REVEAL Man: it s Frankie Jr. dressed for work 
      in his BOSTON PD PATROL OFFICER uniform.

                                  JANE
                    Frankie, you scared me.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Sorry.

      He s miserable. He holds out a graded exam. She looks at it. 
      It s bad. She puts her arm around her bigger little brother.

                                  JANE 
                    You can take it again. You ll pass.

      He LOOKS at her, as close to tears as a strappy, athletic 
      tough guy can get. He SHAKES his head.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Jane, this was the third time. You 
                    took it once. I guess I m not cut 
                    out to be a detective.

      She hands Maura a can. Maura POPS it open, grabs two plastic 
      forks, hands one to Jane. Agent Dean enters. He sniffs, makes 
      a face.

      INT. SOUZA-BARONOWSKI PRISON - HOSPITAL - SURGERY ROOM - DAY

      CLOSE ON SECURITY FOOTAGE: an unconscious Hoyt is prepped for 
      surgery by a DOCTOR and a NURSE. As an ANESTHESIOLOGIST is 
      about to inject him, Hoyt LUNGES up, brandishing a SCALPEL. 
      Within seconds, he s used it TO KILL all three people. 

      PULL BACK: WARDEN, Jane and Dean watch the carnage.

                    He was unconscious. Two doctors 
                    have assured me he was suffering 
                    from appendicitis.

                                  JANE
                    He went to medical school, and you 
                    let him volunteer in the pharmacy. 
                    He could ve faked it.

                                  WARDEN
                    I don t think so --

                    200 milligrams of Decadron would 
                    give him an abnormal white-cell

      Jane turns back to the monitor which has continued to play.

      CLOSE ON: Hoyt as he LOOKS DELIBERATELY INTO THE SECURITY 
      CAMERA. He SMILES as he RAISES his left hand.  Holds a 
      scalpel to it, THEN PRICKS HIS PALM. It trickles BLOOD.

      She grabs the pitcher, carries it to --

      LIVING ROOM

      She waters orchids that float out of Italian pottery. Her 
      apartment is warm and inviting. She checks the deadbolt, 
      moves to a window, lifts a curtain.

      across the street. Frankie Jr. gives her a  you okay  look. 
      She nods, DROPS the curtain. Looks around at her impeccably 
      neat apartment. PULLS out a vacuum, starts to vacuum.

      Jane s interrupted by a loud RAP at her door. She turns off 
      the vacuum, looks out her peephole. Opens the door to AVERY

                    Better than drinking. Sorry. I ll 
                    stop making so much noise.  Night.

      Jane closes the door, looks around at her silent apartment.

      EXT. JANE S APT. BUILDING - LATER

      Jane walks up to the Crown Vic, leans in.

                                  JANE
                    You don t have to follow me.

                    Get a patrol car here. I don t want 
                    Hoyt using his scalpel to turn my 
                    neighbors into crafts  projects.

      EXT. MAURA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      A HAND KNOCKS. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Jane knocking hesitantly. 
      Then harder. The door swings open. Maura answers, as 
      beautiful as ever, in yoga pants and a silk tank top.

                                  JANE
                    Why do you always look like you re 
                    about to do a photo shoot? I m 
                    taking you up on your offer. 

                                  MAURA
                    Good. I m glad you did. 

                                  JANE
                    I brought my security team.

      Jane points across the street. Maura looks out her window.

      ANGLE ON: Frankie Jr. and Frost sit in a car together. They 
      wave. Maura waves back.

      It s as beautiful and tasteful as its owner. Jane RUBS her

                    an escaped serial killer lune is 
                    trying to kill me again? No.

                    What if you just help me kill Hoyt?

      Maura smiles.

      INT. MAURA S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

      Jane fingers the bedspread in a HOUSE BEAUTIFUL room. It 
      looks like the tags have just been removed.  She smiles.

                                  JANE
                    Will it bother you to have a live 
                    person in your house?

                                  MAURA
                    Only a little.

                    doesn t have time for a love life --

      She s interrupted by a KNOCK on the front door. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Or not. God, I m sorry. You were 
                    expecting someone. I m gonna go --

                    He s dropping something off. Stay.

      Maura exits. Jane hears VOICES, cracks open the door. It s 
      Dean.

      ON JANE, like a 7th grade girl who s seen her best friend 
      with the boy she likes. She CLOSES DOOR, lays on the bed. 
      Maura KNOCKS.

                                  JANE
                    Go away. I m asleep.

      Maura walks in, lays on the bed next to Jane.  They both 
      STARE at the ceiling.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Are we having a sleepover or is 
                    this your way of telling me you re 
                    attracted to me?

      They both GIGGLE at this thought.

                                  MAURA
                    I m not seeing him.

                    No, I don t think I would.

      They both laugh. It s quiet for a beat. Then, like little

                    Gail s body, so he needed a 
                      replacement: Karenna Ghent. The 
                    grounds where you leave them become 
                    sacred. Maybe he ll go back.

                                  KORSAK
                    Be kind of stupid.

                                  JANE
                    Let s stake it out. What else do we 
                    have?

                                  KORSAK 
                    What if it s a trap?

                                  JANE
                    It s Hoyt -- we assume it s a trap. 

      EXT. BOSTON P.D. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Frost and Jane walk toward her car. Korsak lags behind, 
      looking sad. Jane stops, walks back to Frost. 

                                  JANE 
                    Korsak s being a baby. You mind 
                    riding alone? 

      He good-naturedly shakes his head,  no.  She tosses KEYS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We ll cover the north end of the 
                    park. You take the South.
                          (to Korsak)
                    Oh, for chrissake, lighten up.

      INT. KORSAK S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

      Korsak drives. He s happy. Jane rides shotgun. She sniffs.

                                  JANE
                    What is that smell?

                                  KORSAK
                          (innocent)
                    What smell?

                                  JANE
                    You know exactly what smell. 
                    There s a cat in here.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 38



      A HUGE tabby cat emerges from between the seats. MEOW.  

                                  KORSAK 
                    It s just Barney Miller.

      Jane turns away from Korsak, PINCHES the septum of her broken 
      nose to trigger a sneeze. It works: she SNEEZES.

                                  KORSAK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you sneezed. 

                                  JANE
                    I told you, I m allergic. It s him 
                    or me.

      Korsak SUDDENLY WRENCHES the wheel, PULLS over and STOPS. He 
      GRABS a cat carrier from the trunk of the car, PUTS Barnie 
      Miller inside. WOOF! Jane LOOKS at the cat. WOOF!

      A DOG BARKS nearby. Korsak MARCHES toward the sound.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak --

      EXT. TWO-LANE ROAD - SHOULDER - NIGHT

      Korsak MAGLIGHTS bushes. Jane follows. His LIGHT HITS a dirty 
      Maltese with a cute face. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Hello, boy. 
                          (checks dog s parts)
                     Scuze me - Girl. What re you doing 
                    by yourself? Where s your collar?

                                  JANE
                    How do you do that? Do you wear a 
                    homing device? 

      INT. KORSAK S CAR (MOVING) - LATER

      Barney Miller HISSES from the carrier at the Maltese, now on 
      Korsak s lap. Jane DRIVES.

                                  KORSAK
                    What should we call her?

                                  JANE
                     P.W.

                                  KORSAK
                    Sort of. I fostered a litter of 
                    German Shepherd pups. Cagney and 
                    Lacey got adopted by this nice 
                    lady. Wanted Crocket and Tubbs to 
                    stay together, but they got good 
                    homes. Still have Kojak. Vince

                                  JANE
                    Okay, okay. We re supposed to be on 
                      a stake-out. 

      INT. KORSAK S CAR / EXT. STONYBROOK RESERVATION - NIGHT

      Jane and Korsak sit in the car, hidden in trees and brush. 
      Barney Miller, in his carrier, is on Korsak s lap.

                                  JANE
                          (to radio)
                    Frost, you see anything?

                                  FROST (V.O.)
                    Negative.

      Jo Friday JUMPS UP and LICKS Korsak s face. He pushes her 
      off. Makes a KISSING SOUND at the cat. Cat HISSES.

                                  JANE
                    Why do we always want the ones who 
                    don t want us? 

      Rizzoli points to Jo Friday, who s waging her tail.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Jo Friday loves you.

                                  JANE
                    Got to be kidding me.

                                  KORSAK
                    You want me to do it here?

                                  JANE
                    I ll cover for you.

      EXT. STONYBROOK RESERVATION - LATER

      Jane waits, irritated. She SCANS for Korsak, sighs.

                                  JANE
                    Later that same day --
                    Korsak?

                                  KORSAK (O.S.)
                    Gimme a minute. It got more 
                      complicated.

                                  JANE
                    T.M.I.

                                  KORSAK (O.S.)
                    Huh?

                                  JANE
                    Too much information.

      She sits down, her gun out. SUDDENLY, there s MOVEMENT in the 
      trees. She s instantly on alert, gun ready --

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak?

      No answer. MORE MOVEMENT. Jane starts to RUN as a FIGURE in 
      head-to-toe black and night goggles SPRINTS away.  Jane 
      CHASES the fleeing figure. Branches SLAP her face. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Freeze! Police. I will shoot you.

                                  MAN
                    Jane, don t.

      The man stops. Removes his night goggles. It s Dean.

                                  JANE
                    What the hell?

                                  AGENT DEAN

                                  JANE
                    Bullshit. I was chasing you!

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You think I m the Apprentice?

      Frost APPEARS from behind, out of breath from running.

                                  FROST
                    Couldn t raise you on the radio.

      Jane is still unsure of Dean.

                                  JANE
                    How did you know we were here? 

      A MOAN interrupts them. Jane MAGLIGHTS the trees, follows the 
      noise. Her light SWEEPS OVER Korsak, BLEEDING from a slash-
      wound to his throat. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Vince!

                                  FROST 
                          (on radio)
                    Officer down! 

      Jane puts pressure on the bleeding wound. Korsak s eyes find 
      hers. He seems to be trying to tell her something.

                                  JANE
                    Shhh. You re gonna be okay. 

      He tries to move, FLICKS his eyes to the trees. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Frost - I think something s over 
                    there.

      Frost SHINES his MAGLIGHT: a naked woman MOVES. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Get another ambulance: it s Karenna 
                    Ghent.

      INT. BOSTON HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Jane paces in a corridor as Maura WALKS up. 

                                  MAURA
                    How s he doing?

                                  JANE
                    Still in surgery. 

                                  MAURA
                    And the victim?

      Dean walks toward them from the other end of the hallway. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Sedated. We re waiting to talk to 
                    her.

                                  JANE
                    I m waiting to talk to her. Far as 
                    I m concerned, you re a suspect. 

      Maura puts a hand on Jane, MOVES her away from Dean.

                                  MAURA
                    Jane, he d be covered with blood if 
                    he d stabbed Korsak. 

                                  JANE
                    Maybe.

      ON DEAN, right behind them.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Oh, come on. Let s get coffee. 
                    Clear this up.

                                  MAURA
                    Okay.

                                  JANE
                    I m gonna go do paperwork.

                    The hell with coffee. Let s go 
                    drink.

      Jane GRINS.

      INT. BAR - NIGHT 

      They split a bottle of nice red wine at a tall table by 
      themselves. Jane pours it into Maura s glass.

                                  JANE
                    First  guy  who broke my heart was 
                    Susan Smart in third grade.

      Maura smiles.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We played every day. Usually at her 
                    house because her parents were 
                    divorced and her mother worked. We 
                    got away with murder. 

                                  MAURA
                    What did you do? 

                                  JANE
                    Tried on her mother s clothes. 
                    Clunked around in her shoes. We had 
                    this game: we d steal eggs and toss 
                    them back and forth. And we baked 
                    mud pies -- I mean, in the oven. 
                    Couldn t get away with that stuff 
                    at my house.

                                  MAURA
                    So what happened, Susan cheated on 
                    you?

                                  JANE
                    How d you know? Threw me over for 
                    Becky Zeppy. I was crushed. 

                                  MAURA 
                    I didn t have girlfriends.

                                  JANE
                    None? You were a Boys  Girl?

                                  MAURA
                    No. I was so weird, I was happy 
                    with books and my chemistry set.

                    I don t think so. 
                          (off Jane s smile)
                    Okay, I loved dissecting dead ones.

                                  JANE
                    You are really weird. 

                                  MAURA
                    Yes, I am. That s why you love me.

      Jane NOTICES TWO MEN, staring at them. Jane thinks they re 
      just staring at Maura.

                                  JANE
                    When did you realize you had power 
                    over men?

                                  MAURA
                    College. What about you?

      Jane looks startled.

                                  JANE
                    I don t.

                                  MAURA
                    How can you be such a good 
                    detective and so dumb? You think 
                    I m bad at the girl stuff --

      Maura POINTS at the men. They WAVE at Jane and Maura.

                                  JANE
                    It s all Susan s fault.

                                  MAURA 
                    Want to stay at my house, just 
                    until this is over? 

      Jane lays down money, grabs her purse. LOOKS at Maura.

                                  JANE
                    What if it s never over? 

      She stares at Maura, stricken. 

      INT. JANE S APT. - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Jane sits on her couch, STARES into space. She holds her 
      handgun. Jo Friday, freshly bathed, is at her feet, dog-
      smiling at her. Jane shows the little dog her gun --

                                  JANE
                    I already have a best friend.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 45



      A NOISE. The dog BARKS. Jane looks through her peephole. 
      UNLOCKS her door, holds up the gun with both hands. Dean 
      stands there. Jane points the gun at his chest.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You can t really believe I m the 
                      Apprentice.

                                  JANE
                    Can if I feel like it.

      Jo Friday jumps happily on Dean. He leans down and pets her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Hey, buddy, what s your name?

                                  JANE
                    Can you visit Jo Friday during 
                    business hours?

      He looks at her until she lowers her gun. Then comes inside.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Why did Hoyt go after you?

                                  JANE
                    Dumb luck. First victim was mine. 
                    In case you hadn t noticed, I m his 
                    favorite type: female.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Oh, I ve noticed.

      A beat between them. Jane BLUSHES. 

                                  JANE
                    You want coffee?

      Without waiting for an answer, Jane moves to --

      KITCHEN

      She FIRES UP an espresso machine. Dean looks around.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You have a really nice place.

                                  JANE
                    You sound surprised.
                          (off his look)
                    You thought I lived in my sterile 
                    little hovel with dead plants and 
                    TV dinners, didn t you?

      He shrugs.  Yeah, he did. Jane hands him the espresso. They 
      TRADE a smile, then walk back into --RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 46



      LIVING ROOM

      There s an upright piano that he hadn t noticed before. 

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    You play?

                                  JANE
                    Mostly I fold laundry on it. My 
                      grandfather thought my mother 
                    married beneath her. Gave me what 
                    she didn t want so I wouldn t make 
                    the same mistake. Which I won t 
                    because I m never getting married.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    What happened to your hands?

      A beat as she decides whether to tell him. Then --

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt is good at setting traps.

      FLASHBACK: A WOMAN SCREAMS as Jane, gun out, FLIES down 
      rickety stairs into a darkened basement. 

      A DEAD MAN and UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN on a cot. Jane RIPS the tape 
      off her mouth as it hits her -- WOMAN didn t scream. She SEES 
      a boombox just as WHAM! - Warren Hoyt SLAMS her to the ground 
      with a PIPE. He stands over her, SKEWERS her hand to the 
      ground with a scalpel. 

      Korsak APPEARS, GUN OUT.  BAM! Hoyt drops.

      BACK TO SCENE:

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I keep taking the bait. Just like 
                    he knows I will. 

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    So Korsak saved you. That s why you 
                    requested a new partner?

                                  JANE
                    No. Look, I m not Hoyt s victim. 
                    I m the one who caught him, helped 
                    save that woman.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Not without a great deal of damage 
                    to you.

                                  JANE

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    That s not what I said. 

      She sits on the couch. Jo Friday sits next to her.

                                  JANE
                    You re not wrong.

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    Why do you feel the need to outdo 
                    every man?

                                  JANE
                    I have to work harder just to be 
                    treated like everybody else.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You re not everybody else. 

      She looks away. He wills her to look at him. She does. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    You think a gun and an attitude 
                    will keep you alive?

                                  JANE
                    Yup. That and two patrol officers 
                    outside.

      He SITS very close to her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I could stay...

      She FREEZES, desperately wanting him to stay. Not sure if 
      that s a good idea.

                                  JANE
                    I can t put you at risk.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Of what?

      She looks at him. He looks at her. RAW SEXUAL ENERGY gyrates 
      between them. She stands, completely unnerved by him.

                                  JANE
                    You have to go, uh, now.

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    Okay. Good-bye, then. 

      She waves good-bye. He walks out. She watches him go.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 48



      INT. BULLPEN - JANE S AREA - DAWN

      She works on her computer. No one else is in yet. Her cell 
      rings the Sci-Fi Mom tone. She just looks at it.

                                  JANE
                    It s 6 a.m., Ma. Give it a rest.

      It stops. Starts again. Jane pretends to answer it.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hello, Mother...You re worried 
                    about me? That s so sweet...no, I m 
                    fine. 

      Maura enters with two cups of coffee. Jane doesn t see her.  

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Why, yes, I am in charge of a big 
                      case...You read about me in The

                    It s so great to finally hear you 
                    say something nice --

      Maura tries to tiptoe away. Jane hears her, FLUSHES RED.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, I feel silly. You re early.

                                  MAURA
                    Sorry. Thought you were talking to 
                    someone.

                                  JANE
                    My fantasy mother. I never once had 
                      a conversation with her when she 
                    wasn t doing something: peeling 
                    potatoes, washing dishes, sweeping, 
                    telling me what to do.

      Maura hands her a latte, sits near her.

                                  MAURA
                    They have a button for  light 
                    foam. 

                                  JANE
                    That is the best news. Can t sleep. 
                    My place has never been cleaner. I 
                    can t stop thinking about...him.

                                  MAURA
                    There d be something wrong with you

      Jane BLUSHES. Then PLAYS POP Version of FUNERAL DIRGE.

                    Nice and upbeat. You tell your mom

                    under my pink canopy bed.

                                  MAURA
                    I always wanted a pink canopy. 

      Jane LOOKS at Maura, SMILES.

                                  JANE 
                    I wanted a horse. You think I 
                    wanted to be a cop because I knew 
                    it would bug my mother?

                                  MAURA
                    No. I think you wanted to be a

                    Okay, I won t.

      Jane starts to dial her phone. STOPS. Looks at Maura.

                                  JANE 
                    Is it too early to call Agent Dean?

                                  JANE
                    Oh. Okay, this is awkward.

      Heavy silence DROPS between them like a drape.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Why did he come to your house the 
                    night I was there?

                                  MAURA
                    He had some questions. About 
                    another case.

                                  JANE
                    I saw him give you an envelope, 
                    with photos. What case?

                                  MAURA
                    It involves national security.

      Jane puts the coffee down, STARES at Maura as though she s 
        reevaluating their entire relationship. 

                                  JANE
                    Are you kidding me?

      Maura looks miserable. Jane picks up her stuff.

                                  MAURA
                    Where are you going?

      Jane says nothing. Just walks away.

      Jane sighs and MARCHES back inside.

      Dean steers her away from the Security Guard, leads her by 
      the arm to the street exit.

      EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - SENATE BUILDING - DAY

      Establishing.

      INT. SENATE BUILDING - SENATOR CONWAY S OFFICE - DAY

      Jane and Dean sit facing SENATOR SAM CONWAY, 50 s. He takes a 
      file from a locked drawer, hands it to Jane. She opens it.

      CLOSE ON: photo of a bearded man in a Shalwar Kammez: a long 
      shirt reaching his knees. He s slumped against the wall, 
      bloody and bound just like Dr. Yeager and Alexander Ghent.

                                  JANE
                    Where is this?

      Senator Conway and Dean trade a look. 

                                    SENATOR CONWAY
                    Kabul, Afghanistan. 

                                  JANE
                    It looks like Hoyt s work.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Operation Enduring Freedom. Four 
                    thousand ground troops, a hundred 
                      casualties a day, fifty of them 
                      civilians.

      Dean hands her a bigger file.  Jane looks at similar crime 
      scenes over and over: dead men. Naked, bloodied women.

                                  JANE
                    A war zone: it s a serial killer s 
                    paradise. Nobody notices if a few 
                    more die. That s why you kept me in 
                    the dark: our killer is a soldier, 
                    isn t he?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Yes. 

                                  JANE
                    He must ve finished his tour. Came 
                    to Boston to meet up with Hoyt. But 
                    Hoyt was behind bars.

                                    SENATOR CONWAY
                    We started investigating the 
                      Afghanistan killings two years ago. 

                                  JANE
                    I don t get it: why didn t the Hoyt 
                    killings ring alarm bells?RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 53



                                  AGENT DEAN
                    They did. We couldn t find a 
                      connection. Until the bulletin for 
                    the Yeager killings came across my 
                    desk.

                                  JANE
                    We have the Apprentice s DNA, his 
                    prints. If he s a soldier, he has 
                    be in a military database. And he s 
                    not. We checked.

      The two men look at each other. Dean sighs.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Have you ever heard of  sheep 
                    dipping ?

      She shakes her head  no. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    It s when the C.I.A. borrows a 
                    soldier for a Black Ops mission. 

                                    SENATOR CONWAY
                    Green Berets were sheep-dipped so 
                    they could secretly train the 
                      Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Their 
                      identities were wiped from all 
                      databases.

                                  JANE
                    So they couldn t be identified as 
                    American military. You think our 
                      Apprentice was a green beret, 
                    working for the C.I.A.?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt was always crazy. But our 
                      Apprentice was an elite soldier. 
                    Maybe he stopped being able to tell 
                    the difference. We train our best 
                    men to be killers, and we re 
                    surprised when they are. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I hate that he s a soldier.

                                  JANE
                    Me, too. Wait, that s the 
                      connection. What if he had other

                    Maybe. Let s go to Ft. Stewart in

      INT. AGENT DEAN S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

      Dean pulls to a stop in front of Jane s hotel. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    If you get hungry, Washington Grill 
                    makes great steaks.

      Jane hesitates: is he asking her out? She doesn t want to 
        misinterpret him. She waits. He doesn t say anything. She 
      gets out, hides her disappointment: back to Jane The Cop. 

                                  JANE 
                    See you in the morning.

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Jane flops on the bed. KNOCK, KNOCK. She straightens up, 
      looks through the peephole: it s Dean. She can t help 
      herself: she SMILES as she opens the door.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I was asking you out, okay?

                                  JANE
                     Out  out? 
                          (off his nod)
                    Didn t want to be presumptuous.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    So?

                                  JANE
                    So, yes. Just gimme a minute.

      He smiles as he leaves her room.

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

      Jane looks beautiful with a little make-up and a fresh shirt. 
      Her cellphone rings: POP version of FUNERAL DIRGE. She 
      answers it.

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)

      Maura is in Jane s apartment while UNIFORMS SWARM. It s 
      destroyed: couch is reduced to knife slits and stuffing. 
      Everything in smashed. 

                                  MAURA
                    I m in your apartment.

                    They got in, Jane. I m just glad 
                    you weren t here.

                                  JANE
                    Is anything missing?

                                  MAURA
                    I can t really tell.

                                  JANE 
                    I ll catch the next plane.

                                  MAURA
                    I have to go to my office. I ll 
                    have a uniform stay until you get

                                  MAURA
                    Be careful.

      Jane HANGS up. Throws clothes and her gun into her suitcase, 
      starts out the door. Dean is there, mid-knock.

                                  JANE 
                    I have to go. He was in my 
                      apartment.

      She hurries past him without a  good-bye.

      INT. TAXI / EXT. JANE S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      A taxi pulls PAST a parked Boston PD patrol car. CORONER S 
      VAN BLOCKS the sidewalk and ENTRANCE to Jane s building.  
      Jane JUMPS out of the cab, grabs her suitcase. She tries to 
      SQUEEZE past the van. Morgue Attendant 1, who was at the 
      first crime scene, stops her.

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    Uh, Detective Rizzoli, can you I.D. 
                    the body before you go in? 

                                  JANE
                    What body?

      Morgue Attendant shrugs, baffled, points to the van.

                                  MORGE ATTENDANT 1
                    Sorry, thought you knew. Doctor 
                    Isles said it s your neighbor, uh -- 

      As he looks through paperwork --

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    It s a young female, 20 s maybe --

                                  JANE
                    Oh god -- Avery? Is it Avery?

      Jane JUMPS into the back of the van. She SHAKES as she UNZIPS 
      the black body bag. INSIDE IS WARREN HOYT. 

                                  HOYT
                    Nice to see you Jane.

      Jane SCREAMS. The Morgue Attendant gets in behind her, locks 
      the doors. Hoyt HOLDS UP a Taser Gun. 

      ZZZZT! He STUNS her. Jane DROPS to the floor, WRITHES in 
      pain. Hoyt climbs into the driver s seat, PULLS AWAY as 
      Morgue Attendant Tasers Jane again. She blacks out as we --

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      INT. CORONER S VAN (MOVING) - DAY

      Jane opens her eyes. She s tightly duct-taped: hands bound in 
      front at her waist. Ankles and knees TAPED. She SQUIRMS like 
      a caught fish. Van VEERS suddenly, PITCHES her into her 
      suitcase. She FIGHTS to move her hands enough to reach it. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 57



      EXT. FOREST - MINUTES LATER 

      Van STOPS. 

      INT. CORONER S VAN (STOPPED) - DAY

      Jane s facedown. She BLINKS as the doors are THROWN OPEN. 
      Hoyt SMILES like he s off to a ballgame. He and The 
      Apprentice drag Jane to the lip of the van. Hoyt lowers his 
      head so he and Jane are nose-to-nose. He RUNS THE SCALPEL 
      along her cheek.

                                  HOYT
                    I am so happy to finish what we 
                    started.

      The SCALPEL BITES into her cheek, draws blood. IN ONE FAST 
      MOVE, she head-butts Hoyt then FLIPS to face him. In her 
      TAPED HANDS, she CLUTCHES the gun from her suitcase. BOOM! 

      He goes down. The Apprentice LUNGES. BOOM! He FALLS. Jane 
      GRABS the scalpel, saws off the duct tape, JUMPS OUT. She 
      stands over Hoyt, raises her gun. He smiles. She FIRES twice.

      ANGLE ON: Hoyt, smiling as he holds out his bloody palms. 

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    We match.

      COP CARS FLY IN. LIGHTS AND SIRENS. The cavalry has arrived. 
      But Jane doesn t need them. Our girl has rescued herself. 
      Maura PULLS right up to Jane, WHEELS SCREECHING. Jumps out.

                                  MAURA
                    Jane!

                    Dean was really worried.

      EXT. FOREST - LATER

      Two EMT s work on Hoyt. Maura, Dean and now Frost and Crowe 
      surround Jane. An EMT wipes Jane s cheek with a pad. 

                                  JANE
                    How did you find me?

                                  MAURA 
                    Actually, I called the FBI when you 
                    didn t show up. Agent Dean was able 
                    to ping your cellphone.

                                  JANE

                    You were right about Ft. Stewart. 

      Dean HOLDS UP a photo of two Army buddies: Hoyt and the 
      Apprentice. 

                                  DEAN
                    His name is John Stark.

      Morgue Attendants ROLL the GURNEY with the BODY BAG past 
      them. Jane STOPS them, STARES at it.

                                  JANE 
                    Hoyt killed that prisoner so the 
                    prison would summon his Apprentice 
                    from the Coroner s Office.

                    He hid under the dead man in the 
                    body bag. Slipped right by us. 

      Jane UNZIPS the body bag then remembers Frost is watching.

                                  JANE 
                    Might want to wait over there.

      But he s rock steady. He LIFTS the dead man s arm for her.

                    68W Health Care Specialists. 
                    They met during training.

      Jane watches EMT s lift Hoyt into the ambulance.

                                  JANE 
                    He s like a cockroach. Should ve 
                    squeezed off a few more rounds.

      A police CAR PULLS next to Jane. Its passenger is Korsak, 
      heavily bandaged.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Get your ass back to the hospital. 

                                  KORSAK
                    I had to make sure you were okay.

                                  JANE
                    I m fine. Go. Now, or I won t walk 
                    Jo Friday. 

      She gives him a faux stern look. He waves as the car pulls 
      away. Dean clears his throat. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I know I said dinner, but what 
                    about breakfast?

      Jane smiles, about to answer, when her cell rings --

                                  JANE
                          (to phone)
                      Rizzoli...
                          (explains to Dean)
                      Dispatcher.

      Jane walks away. STAY ON Dean, watching her protectively. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (to phone)
                    Call Crowe. I m taking the day off.

      Maura and Dean TALK to each other. Jane SEES this. Something 
      HITS her heart hard. She turns back to her phone.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We ll take it. 
                          (hangs up, calls to Frost)
                    We got a homicide in Dorchester.

      Jane and Frost get in Frost s car, pull away. Jane looks 
      back. Maura is walking after the car, calling her name. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 60



                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, brother...Stop the car, Frost.

      Jane gets out, WALKS OVER to Maura, who looks hurt and 
      confused.

                                  MAURA
                    What re you doing? 

                                  JANE
                    Being a petulant baby.

                                  MAURA
                    That s what I thought.

                                  JANE
                    Good, getting better at this girl 
                    stuff.

      Jane LOOKS at Dean in the b.g. Maura FOLLOWS her look.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    This is stupid. He s not worth it.

      A BEAT between them before they both BUST UP, laughing.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, yes he is.

                                  MAURA
                    What do we do now?

                                  JANE
                    Hell if I know. 

                                  MAURA
                    I say on three, we jump in my car 
                    and go get a massage. 

                                  JANE
                    Deal. 1-2-3. Go.

      INT. MAURA S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      They JUMP in, PEEL off like Thelma and Louise. Dean watches 
      them. Now he s confused. They LAUGH like 7th grade girls as 
      they drive away.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
