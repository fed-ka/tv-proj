REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box
atrium of VDI Headquarters.
Designed to inspire awe, it
does.
REED
High open space, exposed structural
elements.
Obviously aimed at first
time visitors to create feelings of...
smallness, inadequacy.
Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.
BEN
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,
what are we doing here?
This guy's
fast-food, strip-mall science --
REED
This wasn't our first stop, in case
you forgot NASA.
And Victor's not
that bad.
He's just a little...
(seeing the statue)
Larger than life.
A helicopter shot through trees.
We soar over timberland,
and find something massive looming on the horizon:
A SPACECRAFT.
A sleek take on a space shuttle.
Modern tech
combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford.
The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch.
WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.
Ben stares up at the craft.
A sneer on his face.
BEN
Can't do it.
I cannot do it.
REED
External SRBs, orbital system engines.
Its just like the shuttles you flew
in --
BEN
No.
I cannot take orders from that
underwear model.
That wingnut washed
out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
Secret wannabes into a flight
simulator.
REED
Youthful high spirits.
They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.
BEN
They crashed it into a wall.
A flight
simulator.
REED
I'm sure he's matured since then.
CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.
PICK UP
Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.
REED (CONT'D)
When have I asked you to do something
you absolutely said you could not do?
BEN
Five times.
REED
I had it at four.
BEN
This makes five.
Leonard leads Victor through the halls.
Victor checks
himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.
LEONARD
Our numbers are through the roof.
The
IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
share.
The bank's five times
oversubscribed --
VICTOR
It's not just the money.
I could make
money in my sleep.
LEONARD
Then what is it?
VICTOR
History, Leonard.
History.
Everything else is conversation...
(a beat)
How's the other matter?
Leonard pulls out a BOX.
Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.
LEONARD
Harry Winston sends his regards.
They hit a set of big doors.
Victor stops and looks into the
reflective, metallic surface on the wall.
He fixes one last
strand of hair.
Perfect. Then he opens the door to...
SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!
WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --
Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.
Victor sits on a
platform, with reporters stretched out below him.
VICTOR
Today we stand on the edge of a new
frontier.
In the furthest depths of
outer space...we will find the secrets
to inner space.
The final key to
unlocking our genetic code lies in a
cosmic storm...
BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.
News
crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture.
Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.
Not yet.
BEN
Isn't that your speech?
REED
He's made a few changes.
BEN
This is your dream, Reed.
You should
be the one up there.
REED
Victor's better at these things.
Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
waiting.
This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiance.
And for the first
time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.
They hug, kissing.
Johnny and Reed watch.
Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead.
Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.
A tender beat.
BEN
I'll be watching over you.
DEBBIE
Just get back soon, or I start looking
for a new groom.
Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.
BEN
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
in for a bigger rock.
DEBBIE
I don't care about rocks, I care about
you.
(to Reed)
You bring him back in one piece, or
you can forget being Best Man.
Reed nods, smiles.
Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.
Ben turns
to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.
BEN
What the hell you smiling at?
Just
keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
those SMBs --
JOHNNY
Actually, the engines are SMEs.
Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant.
Couple generations past your last
ride.
(at the threshold)
I'm not as dumb as you look.
Ben just glares at Reed.
This is going to be a long trip.
As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --
VICTOR ON STAGE
Mid-speech.
Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
give way to a pulsating red cloud...
VICTOR
Think of a world without genetic flaws
-- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
breast cancer...
Ben and Reed hear the speech.
Ben bristles.
BEN
What's wrong with being bald...?
Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.
A true leader.
VICTOR
Darwin discovered evolution.
Now we --
I -- will define it.
Only in America
could...
The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.
VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...a little country boy from Latveria
build one of the biggest companies in
the world, and truly reach the stars.
Now if you'll excuse me, history
awaits...
On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
SHUTTLE on the launch pad.
BOOM!
THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT.
Smoke billows across the pad.
Ready for take off.
Victor walks past the hologram and exits.
His departure
perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.
We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
Earth's atmosphere.
BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
the shuttle fires its thrusters.
The hologram transitions
to...
A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.
The
shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
engines afire.
As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
TO --
THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
Earth.
THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.
Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.
REED (ON RADIO)
Ben, we need you back inside.
Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.
BEN (INTO RADIO)
I ain't done arranging your flowers,
egghead.
REED (ON RADIO)
Ben.
This is serious.
Turn around.
Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.
Ben
turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
station.
Not close, but not far.
That gets Ben's attention.
BEN (INTO RADIO)
Roger that, on my way.
He turns back towards the ship.
BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.
A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
harder to maneuver.
The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.
The exterior air lock door slides open.
In agonizing,
weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside.
The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
stains.
Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.
Ben
hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.
As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
leaving the space station intact.
Power quietly flickers on.
Silence.
Time resumes.
All four pick up exactly where they
left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.
A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest.
In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.
Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.
Reed works
at a laptop computer.
BEN
How long was I out?
REED
Three days.
I was worried about you.
How are you feeling?
BEN
Solid.
Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.
BEN (CONT'D)
How you doing?
Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.
REED
I don't know.
I just keep going over
and over the numbers.
BEN
Reed.
Even you can't compute every
little thing.
REED
I should have done more, run more
tests --
Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.
BEN
It was a freak of nature.
Last I
checked, you don't have a crystal
ball.
Let it go.
Reed considers.
But he can't let it go.
He opens his
computer back up, returning to work.
Ben shakes his head,
looks out at the view.
His eyes catch on something, wheels
turning.
BEN (CONT'D)
You go through something like this,
makes you appreciate having the right
woman in your life.
REED
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
BEN
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.
REED
What?
Come on.
She's got a good
thing with Victor --
BEN
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
your screws?
REED
He's smart, powerful, successful --
BEN
Well maybe you should date him.
Reed looks at Ben, resigned.
REED
Ben.
He'll give her the life she
deserves.
She ended up with the right
guy.
Things worked out for the best.
Reed steps away.
Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.
BEN
Do I have to do everything myself?
The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.
JOHNNY and his
NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear.
Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.
His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out.
Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.
They
look down at a death-defying black diamond run.
JOHNNY
Me like-y.
SEXY NURSE
Stay right.
Left is trouble.
JOHNNY
I though we went over this.
SEXY NURSE
Last one down springs for room
service.
She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.
Johnny drops out
after her, hitting the snow.
He smolders: literally.
The
snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.
He takes off after her and the chase is on:
The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
and out of the trees through deep powder.
Johnny's a speed
freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them.
Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
flies off.
Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.
The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even.
She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...
SEXY NURSE
You're on fire!
JOHNNY
Not this again --
SEXY NURSE
No: You're ON FIRE!
Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm.
His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire.
A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.
Nurse loses concentration, falls.
Johnny races away like a
missile, screaming in exhilaration.
He looks back -- no
nurse.
He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
VEERS to the LEFT.
He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
front of him.
He faces forward and...
SCREEAAMMS!
LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
to catch ground.
FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
towards the rocks below.
He tries to will his body away.
Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.
He is a HUMAN
TORCH!
And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
him some kind of...LIFT.
He maneuvers just over the rocks,
almost making a 90 degree turn.
He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.
But the lift
doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
snowbank.
He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.
He's trapped
under snow and ice.
With all his strength, he tries to move,
NO DICE.
Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
quickly begins to melt.
Johnny is on fire, and within
seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
water.
The nurse races toward the steam.
Scared, panicked.
She
finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
tub, staring at his hands.
His body.
Exhilarated.
JOHNNY
Care to join me?
She smiles and unzips.
The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --
On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about.
He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.
VICTOR
How's the IPO?
LEONARD
Stable.
We're looking at low
twenties.
It's a good number,
considering the fallout from --
VICTOR
Reed's disaster.
You know, I half-
think he did this to me on purpose.
LEONARD
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.
VICTOR
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
cover of the Journal...
(staring into silver tray)
I've got to do something about this
scar.
Make sure they only shoot my
right side.
LEONARD
Actually, uh, people seem to think the
scar "humanizes" you.
VICTOR
And that's a good thing?
Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.
It
glistens in the silver tray.
His eyes are bloodshot,
sleepless.
LEONARD
You know, maybe you should get some
rest --
VICTOR
Later.
First, I've got some
unfinished business.
A deal that
needs closing...
Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.
A beat.
LEONARD
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue?
You could have any woman in the world
but --
VICTOR
That's why.
Because I could have
any other woman... You know, when
they asked Caesar "why England," he
said, "because it's not mine."
Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
bursts of flame.
He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."
JOHNNY
Flame on, flame off.
Flame on, flame
off --
SUE
Johnny.
He does it again.
Flame on, flame off.
SUE (CONT'D)
Stop it.
JOHNNY
Okay, "mom."
Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
banging, moaning and pleading inside.
Johnny smiles.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
Oh, you dawg you.
Better not be my
nurse!
A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance.
CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
trains.
We PUSH IN on the main track, where...
A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.
We hear a cargo DOOR slide
open, then WHUMP!
Big FEET hit the ground.
Someone, or
someTHING barrels into the night.
A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.
SOUND of breaking
glass.
A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.
It's Ben.
CLOSE ON: The dial pad.
Big fingers try to push keys but
they're too large.
Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
and more frustrated.
He manages to press "0" with his pinky.
BEN
Hello, Operator?
Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
modest, working-class home.
His eyes go soft when he sees
Debbie grab the phone.
BEN (CONT'D)
Deb... It's me.
I need you to step
out front.
DEBBIE
Out front?
You home, baby?
I got
a surprise for you.
He blinks hard.
Sad, dark.
BEN
I got a surprise for you too.
Debbie steps out.
There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
door.
She looks out.
The wind blows softly.
Something
shifts in the darkness.
Debbie pulls her robe tighter.
DEBBIE
Ben?
BEN (O.S.)
Don't come any closer for a sec.
This
is gonna be kind of a shock... You
remember when we said "together
forever no matter what"?
DEBBIE
Baby, you're scaring me.
A hanging beat.
And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.
Debbie sees him.
Fear washes over her, not sure what to
think.
He reaches out, a little tentative.
She flinches
back.
DEBBIE
Oh my G-g-g.
What did you...do to
Ben?
BEN
Deb, it's me.
It's still me.
He reaches out.
She recoils.
It's too much for her.
Tears
swell in her eyes.
Covering her mouth, she backs away.
He takes a step closer.
She backs away faster, tripping over
her robe, falling into the street.
A car screeches to a
halt.
Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
back.
DEBBIE
Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!
Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.
Lights flicker on.
Ben knows he
has to go.
He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
he'll see her.
She trembles, terrified.
His eyes go moist.
BEN
I love you, Deb.
With that, he turns away.
The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
falls to the ground.
A tragic tableau.
As more lights go on
around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.
We swoop toward this epic monument.
On a steel girder above
the road, we see...a STATUE.
BEN.
He sits on the edge of
the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
muttering.
BEN
A few days in space, it'll be great,
what's the worst that could happen?
A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
his shoulder.
Ben just glares up at the heavens.
BEN (CONT'D)
Perfect.
Thanks.
He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.
He turns to see...a
distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.
The man drops his
case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.
The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.
He doesn't see Ben
(or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).
BEN (CONT'D)
You think you got trouble?
Take a
good look, pal, how bad could it be?
The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.
Ben steps forward.
BEN (CONT'D)
Okay, easy there, buddy.
Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!
His
arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.
Cars and trucks
SKIM right underfoot.
Ben shakes his head.
BEN (CONT'D)
You had to choose my spot, didn't you?
Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!
The
Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!
He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
hard on the highway!
A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.
They point.
Ben looks up, deer in headlights.
He sees a massive TRUCK
bearing down on the Businessman.
BEN (CONT'D)
This is really not my day.
Ben DROPS to the street.
WHOOMPF!
He lands in front of the
Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.
The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.
The truck SWERVES,
but cannot stop!
Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
scared.
He shuts his eyes, and...
SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!
A football move.
The
truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
the windshield!
It looks like a metal car-compactor.
The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders.
CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!
Windows shatter, fires flicker.
One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.
COPS clamber out.
Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.
They see the action
on the bridge.
Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.
Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
destruction.
He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
in his cab.
Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.
He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.
He tries to grab
the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.
He struggles.
BEN
A little help here?!
You wanna hit
that button, sir?
The driver is too woozy.
Ben can't get to the button.
Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!
COPS round the corner.
They see Ben holding onto the Driver.
They raise their guns.
COP
FREEZE!
PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
DOWN!
Ben looks at the cops.
PEDESTRIANS stare, point.
He
realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
in hand.
At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.
The
whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.
We PUSH
TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...
REED, JOHNNY, SUE.
They look through smoke and mayhem to
see...their first full look at Ben.
Reed stands gutpunched.
JOHNNY
Not even Ben deserves that.
Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.
He lunges
behind a truck.
The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
back.
Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.
He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
walkways overhead.
He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
MOTORISTS.
He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.
Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.
All other
people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
BRIDGE POLICE herd
the crowd away from the accident.
BRIDGE COP
Back!
We're evac-ing the bridge.
Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.
SUE
What now?
Reed...?
What do we do?
MOVE IN ON REED.
A first test of leadership.
But he is not
a leader.
Not yet.
Sue gets closer to him.
SUE (CONT'D)
Ben's out there.
Let's go get him.
BRIDGE COP
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Those cars
are gonna blow sky high, any second.
REED
Look, we've got a friend out there in
trouble.
We need to get to him before --
BRIDGE COP #2
Nobody gets past this point.
A hard beat.
Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.
SUE
What?
REED
(mutters)
We need to get past them.
He motions to her body.
She understands.
She concentrates,
and starts to turn invisible.
BRIDGE COP #1
What the hell is this?
A magic show?
But her clothes don't go invisible.
Beat.
Reed mutters:
REED
Sue.
Your clothes.
Lose them.
SUE
What...?
(realizes)
Oh.
She unbuttons her blouse.
Not thrilled with the idea.
She
wriggles out of her pants.
Down to her skivvies.
She
reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
concentration and becomes visible.
The sight of Sue in her
undies grabs the COPS' attention.
Everyone watches, stunned.
The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
bricks.
Cops are transfixed.
So is Reed.
JOHNNY
This is wrong in so many ways.
REED
You've been working out.
SUE
Shut up.
Sue takes a deep breath.
Closes her eyes.
Focuses.
Nothing
happens.
She's embarrassed and furious.
SUE (CONT'D)
Any more ideas, Reed?
Maybe you
should strip down next, see how it
feels to have fifty people staring --
...and she DISAPPEARS.
Entirely.
Undies float.
Jaws drop.
REED
Uh, Sue?
She stops ranting.
Realizes she's gone invisible.
SUE (INVISIBLE)
Oh.
Well then...
The undies drop.
The cops stare open-mouthed.
They turn to
look at Reed, astonished.
He sheepishly shrugs his
shoulders.
JOHNNY
I'm gonna need serious therapy.
A beat.
She walks away.
The cops watch her, gaping.
By the
time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
disappearing into the clouds of smoke.
A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
angle on the action.
Reed races through wreckage.
He tries to see over a big
TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!
He finally sees...BEN.
Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO!
His face snakes right in front of Ben.
Ben jumps.
BEN
What the --!
REED
Ben.
Are you okay?
BEN
Am I okay?!
You wanna explain that?!
He motions to Reed's neck.
Then to his own body:
BEN (CONT'D)
Or this?!
What the hell am I? 'Cause
I sure ain't Ben anymore.
Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.
Not yet.
SUE (O.S.)
REED!
BEN!
LOOK OUT!
Ben spins, looking for Sue.
He can't see her.
But he does
see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!
BOOOOM!
The first car BLOWS!
BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!
Empty
cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.
The flames are mushrooming!
Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.
His arms
FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.
FLAMES lash out.
A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream.
Johnny LEAPS toward them.
His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
him extra lift.
He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.
He looks
the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.
Sue SCREAMS.
She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).
The
air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.
She looks at them, surprised, confused.
Her invisible fields
SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.
But the flames
hurtle closer.
She fights the pressure.
Blood trickles from
her nose.
Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her...
Sue is dressed again.
Visible.
She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!
She collapses, as the blast
deflects off the street and into...
An oncoming FIRETRUCK!
BOOOOM!
The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.
Brakes scream.
Its tail
slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.
THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
WATER!
FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.
The truck
TEETERS, falling!
Ben wastes no time.
He GRABS onto the
front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!
He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
the concrete, digging grooves into the street.
ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
the bridge.
Their truck SWINGS.
Bits and pieces tumble down
at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.
All deadly now.
The
HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!
Ben SCREAMS!
STRAINING with all his might.
Ben SCREAMS!
His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back.
Another scream.
Another step.
Another.
Another.
Epic,
painful.
He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch.
His footsteps THUD.
With monumental effort, he levels the
truck.
Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
over Ben.
Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.
Ben steps
back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.
Wary
cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...
The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.
The crowd of onlookers
joins in as well.
Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
touched by the reaction.
But Ben seems uncomfortable.
Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.
Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.
Ben steps
toward her, but she stops him with a look.
She places
something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.
Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.
He stoops over
to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.
His big fingers can't grip
it.
He tries in vain.
Hopeless, pathetic.
A beat.
And...
A hand grabs the ring.
It's Reed.
Quiet, close.
REED
I swear to you, I will do everything
in my power until there is not a
breath left in me: you are going to be
Ben again.
Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...
An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.
CLICKCLICKCLICK!
Fifty cameras flash.
The field is full of
press.
Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.
Johnny eats up the attention.
Ben turns, self-conscious.
Reed notices.
The Chief Fireman turns to them.
CHIEF FIREMAN
So which one of you's the leader?
Johnny does not hesitate.
JOHNNY
That'd be me.
CHIEF FIREMAN
No seriously.
A beat.
Sue and Ben turn to Reed.
The Chief hands him a
mic.
CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
You're on, son.
They all want a
statement.
All eyes go on Reed.
He looks out, gulps hard.
A long beat.
REED
Uh, during our recent mission to the
Von Doom space station, we were
exposed to as yet-unidentified
radioactive energy, most likely some
kind of nucleotide compoun--
Nobody came for a science class.
A crush of questions
overwhelms Reed:
VARIOUS REPORTERS
What happened on the bridge?
Does it
hurt to stretch?
Were you really on
fire?
Is it true that one of you can
fly?
JOHNNY
Working on it.
And it's a lot harder --
SUE
We don't know much more than you do,
at this point.
Which is why we will
be going directly to the lab, where we
can diagnose our symptoms and --
REPORTER #2
Symptoms?
So it's like a disease?
Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.
Ben is lost in
thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.
Johnny leaps in.
JOHNNY
Symptoms?
Please.
If having powers
is a disease, then yeah we got it.
And we are gonna blow your minds.
There's a new day dawning.
The day of
the Fantastic Four.
REPORTER #3
That thing doesn't look too fantastic.
The Reporter nods toward Ben.
Ben's fists tighten, the sound
of rocks crushing together.
Reed feels the pain.
REED
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
who's been through a terrible orde--
JOHNNY
What he's trying to say is: every team
needs a mascot...
Reporters laugh.
Ben turns his head away.
Reed burns.
REED
Look, we went up to space to find a
way to understand DNA, to cure
disease, save lives.
Well, now it's
our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
line...
(a beat)
Thank you.
No more questions.
Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.
The press waits a beat,
then surges.
Ben spins, holding up one finger.
A giant.
BEN
Be nice.
The press step back, intimidated.
Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
FACE FREEZES.
It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --
Establishing shot of a historic New York building.
REPORTERS snap pictures.
A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping
in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.
Sue, Reed, and Johnny and
get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,
which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
position.
COPS hold back the surging press.
Ben keeps his head down,
self-conscious.
He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.
JOHNNY
Smile, Ben.
They want to like you.
Give 'em your good side.
Or your less
bad side.
Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.
Stiff, tentative:
BEN
Uh...don't do drugs.
The kids FLINCH.
Ben trudges on.
Johnny smiles bright,
doing hand-signs for F4.
Sue pulls him toward --
The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
cameras.
A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.
Victor emerges, wearing
sunglasses.
This time, the press pay no attention to him.
No cameras flash.
Victor tightens, and enters the building.
A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora.
Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --
Dark.
Lights flicker.
Steam rises through the grates.
A
shadow emerges.
Ben.
He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
classic Brooklyn tavern.
Neon sign.
Music, life inside.
Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
through the door into --
Lights twinkle.
A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs.
Heads turn, whispers flutter.
SUE steps out, joining...
Victor at a prime table.
He pulls out her chair, wearing
gloves.
VICTOR
Thank you for coming out to see me.
She nods, a little self-conscious.
SUE
You said it was urgent.
VICTOR
It is.
There's something we need to
talk about.
Something I need to ask
you...
Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.
SUE
(slow, careful)
Victor, wait, slow down a second.
I
want you to know I appreciate
everything you've done for me, but I
just don't --
VICTOR
Susan.
What are you doing?
He is cold as ice.
If he's hurt, he'll never show it.
VICTOR (CONT'D)
You think I brought you here to talk
about us?
Please.
This is business.
(leaning forward, intense)
I need to know: how close is Reed
to finding to a cure?
She pauses.
Then:
SUE
He's working round the clock.
But the
data needs to be tested, analyzed
before --
VICTOR
Same old Reed.
All analysis, no
action.
Wasn't that the problem with
you two?
She holds tight, keeping cool.
SUE
If these molecules aren't stable, they
could make us worse, maybe even kill
us.
VICTOR
Then why is Reed dragging his feet?
Maybe he likes having his prize
specimen under glass...
(closer, cruel)
It's ironic, isn't it?
You're finally
the perfect woman for him...because
you're his science project.
The words sting.
She can't help but hear some truth in them.
SUE
Please don't make this personal --
VICTOR
Oh, I think you already have.
SUE
Victor, we can't do anything until the
research is ready.
Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.
VICTOR
"We," huh?
Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
that he SPILLS water.
Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.
Victor
gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.
VICTOR (CONT'D)
Don't forget who you work for, Susan.
So get to work.
And do your job.
He walks out.
As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
of his pocket.
He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.
Sue sits embarrassed.
She slowly...disappears.
People gasp.
She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
through the air.
At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --
BUSINESSMAN
I wish my wife would disappear.
The other men laugh, but WHHM!
The man's wine SPILLS into
his LAP!
Sue walks out.
The restaurant is left buzzing.
Lights twinkle.
And we FADE OUT.
A beat.
Then we CRASH
INTO --
The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills
and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the
delight of 20,000 fans.
The Riders spin and flip, performing
aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special guest for you... Johnny
Storm of the Fantastic Four!
JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
crowd.
He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.
He
beelines to RONNIE RENNER.
JOHNNY
Hey, Ronnie Renner!
I'm a big fan.
Ronnie gives a tight nod.
He doesn't like being upstaged by
this circus freak.
The other bikers approach.
KENNY BARTRAM
Heard you like to ride.
Wanna take
her for a spin?
He motions to his BIKE.
Johnny eyes this mean machine.
RONNIE RENNER
Come on, bro.
I'll teach you some
tricks...if you can keep up.
We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --
The Thing rounds the corner.
Sees a crowd of girls lined up
near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the
plates.
Ben slows down, smiles.
Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in
the line.
Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents.
Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.
JOHNNY
(looking around)
Where's my ride?
The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
front of Johnny.
The Valet timidly holds out the keys...
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
What the?!
Is that my --
Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
license plate.
It rattles to the ground, face up.
Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.
Looks up and sees Ben
in the distance, dusting off his hands.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
(shouting: to Ben)
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
(seeing Sue)
What?!
SUE
You gave us names?
What are you, the
"face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Ben marches up.
Hands balled into fists.
BEN
It's about to be a broken face.
REED
This isn't permanent, Johnny.
We need
to be careful until we're normal
again.
JOHNNY
What if some of us don't want to be
"normal" again?
We didn't all turn
into monsters like --
Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.
Stops himself.
Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.
Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
head.
Ben stops.
Turns around more shocked than hurt.
BEN
Did you just --
Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.
This time in the face.
BEN (CONT'D)
Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!
You want
to fly?
Fly.
Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
in the way!
Too late!
WHAMM!
Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.
Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet.
BAM!
Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.
WHOOSH!
He
leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.
The crowd stands stunned.
So do Reed and Sue.
Cameras pop.
Johnny slowly pulls himself up.
The paint on the truck
begins to bubble around his hand.
Beaten, bruised, he
stands.
Heating up.
Both his hands are now flaming fists of
fury.
JOHNNY
Let's see if we can get blood from a
stone.
He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them.
High Noon.
They start to RUN toward each other...
When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
stops them both in their tracks with just a look.
Like a
mom:
SUE
You two need a time-out.
JOHNNY
Blockhead started it!
Ben just stalks off.
The crowd clears, scared.
A PAPARAZZI
snaps a picture.
Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.
Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.
SUE
Damn it, Johnny.
She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.
REED
You need to control yourself and think
before you --
JOHNNY
Act.
Here we go again.
Reed, what if
we got these gifts for a reason?
What
if we have some, you know...like,
calling?
REED
A higher calling like getting girls
and making money?
Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.
JOHNNY
Is there any higher?
Reed looks at him, disgusted.
Johnny waves to the crowd,
hand flaming.
People SHRIEK, snap pictures.
Johnny smiles at
Reed.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
This is who we are Reed.
Accept it.
Or better yet: enjoy it.
Johnny steps into the sea of fans.
Reed stands alone.
Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.
Tries to catch
up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.
SUE
Ben!
Slow down...
Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.
She catches up.
SUE (CONT'D)
He didn't mean it.
You know Johnny.
He's always been a hothead --
BEN
It's not him.
It's them.
(pointing to crowd)
I can't live like this.
SUE
Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works -- analyzing
every little step before he takes
one --
BEN
It's easy for you to be patient.
SUE
No, it's not.
I thought I was done
waiting for Reed... We're all in this
together now, Ben.
He slows down, gets closer, intense.
BEN
Together?
Look at me, Susie.
You got
no idea what I'd give...to be
invisible.
Your nightmare...is my
dream.
She opens her mouth, but has no response.
She doesn't know
his depth of pain.
As he disappears into the alley, we CUT
TO --
Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
mind tossing and turning.
People stare, point.
A LITTLE
GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.
LITTLE GIRL
Mister, Mister!
Please help me!
My
kitty is stuck in a tree.
She gestures to a tree next to Ben.
Looks up.
LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
Please save Miss Lucy.
Ben rolls his eyes.
Looks up.
Considers climbing the tree,
but thinks better of it.
He has another idea...
Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
out of it.
MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!
The cat falls into frame.
At the last instant, Ben sticks
out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.
He hands
the cat to the girl.
Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks.
He just moves on.
Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
SCULPTURE of his bust.
He stops, steps back to take a look.
It's exquisitely
rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
haunting anguish in his eyes.
Ben is amazed, and touched,
but...
BEN
(under breath)
Eyebrows are a little big...
A beat.
He stares at these images of himself.
VOICE (O.S.)
I figured the only way to get you here
was to stick that in the window.
He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.
BEN
How'd you know it was me?
ALICIA
I'm blind, not deaf.
Wanna come in?
He steps toward her.
But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
of the gallery.
Ben pauses, a little insecure.
BEN
I'm not really dressed for a party.
ALICIA
Relax, it's casual.
BEN
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --
Fans swarm JOHNNY.
He signs autographs, poses for pictures.
Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.
A
tinted window rolls down.
Victor's face emerges.
VICTOR
Need a ride, Johnny?
Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.
VICTOR
A few fans.
Hope you don't mind.
JOHNNY
Gotta take care of the fans, right?
He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.
VICTOR
Look, I built my business knowing what
people want.
And right now, the
people want you.
Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.
JOHNNY
And we don't want to let the people
down now, do we?
VICTOR
No we don't.
Which is why we need
to strike while the iron's hot.
I'm talking action figures,
videogames, sponsors --
JOHNNY
Videogames?
You serious?
Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
You talk to Reed and Sue about this?
VICTOR
Johnny.
Let's be honest here.
Ben,
Reed, Sue.
Good people, all.
But
stars?
(shaking his head, a beat)
I don't want to break up the band, but
you're the one they want.
Don't you
think it's time to go solo...?
Victor subtly nods to the models.
They envelop Johnny.
VICTOR (CONT'D)
Take the car for a spin.
Think about
it.
Is this the life you want?
Or
would you rather live in Reed's
lab...?
The car stops.
Victor gets out.
He stands on the pavement.
As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny.
The door shuts, and...
WHHHMMMPF!
The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!
Ben and Alicia step out together.
The crowd quiets, turns.
A few whispers flutter.
Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
her arm into his.
The party goes back to normal.
ALICIA
Look around.
I'll get us drinks.
They always let blind girls cut the
line.
She walks off.
He watches her go.
The way her hair moves.
The lines of her neck.
The light on her skin.
This woman is
the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.
He's falling
hard.
Ben steps through the crowd.
The swanky guests give strained
smiles, polite.
Ben is starting to feel comfortable here.
He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.
A few patrons pass him,
thinking he's just an inanimate statue.
PATRON
I don't know about this one.
It lacks
a certain...realism.
Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.
He overhears two BOHEMIAN
GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
She's always had a thing for runaways
and strays, but this is ridiculous.
BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
I know.
Did she really think these
sculptures would sell?
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
Like anybody would want this thing in
their house.
That girl's a one-woman
charity.
Ben just stands there, frozen.
His eyes dart around the
room, paranoid now.
Aware of people staring, laughing.
He
glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.
Ten
seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.
Now it's damning.
We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
where she left Ben.
She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
him.
But Ben is gone.
She looks disappointed, hearing his
heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance.
THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --
A pitstop in Queens.
Heavy RAIN swims down windows.
BEN
sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight.
Nobody sits within four chairs of him.
He sips coffee in a
metal bowl.
A long beat.
Then...
VICTOR (O.S.)
This seat taken?
Ben turns to see...VICTOR.
BEN
What are you doing here?
VICTOR
I'm worried about you.
BEN
About me?
How sweet.
VICTOR
Come on.
Let me buy you something to
eat.
Looks like you could use the
company.
Ben considers.
A man deeply alone.
A beat.
Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.
A man without a
home.
Without a family.
A hard beat.
HEADLIGHTS slash
across Ben.
He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
LIMO.
LEONARD
Ben!
They need you back at the Baxter
building.
It's...Reed.
Ben considers.
Despite it all, he's a good friend.
And a
good man.
As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
IN --
The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
glow.
Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
the Baxter Building.
The rest of the city lights dim
slightly.
Johnny walks alone.
A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky.
He looks up.
His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
where it's coming from.
He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.
Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.
Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
watch.
He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
get a grip.
His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!
He falls like a
SLINKY, out of control.
Half his body loose, half hard.
He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.
He catches
Reed's face, holds it close.
DOOM
Why the long face?
Doom whips Reed into the night.
As Doom turns, people cower,
horrified by his face.
They clear out, and...
Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
veins.
A monster.
Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
an iron fist, and bounds into the night.
Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
missile streaking closer.
As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
slightly with HIS MOTION!
His eyes narrow, thinking.
He FLAMES ON a HAND.
He waves his flaming hand, and the
MISSILE locks onto the fire!
Johnny darkens, realizing...
JOHNNY
Great.
Heat-seeker.
His mind races.
He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.
SUE
What are you doing --
JOHNNY
Sis.
Let me take care of you for
once.
SUE
But Johnny...you can't fly.
Johnny considers, a half-beat.
He looks out.
Under breath:
JOHNNY
Well then this'll be one hell of a
basejump.
Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
THE EDGE!
He FLAMES ON!
The missile follows his arc.
As he
drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
(under breath)
Come on...come on...come on...
He falls lower, lower.
And...he...BANKS!
SWOOPS UP!
FLYING!
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
FLAME ON.
Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.
BEN
We need to help Reed --
Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.
SUE
Ben, you got what we all wanted.
You need to stay here.
It's too
dangerous.
She heads off.
Ben watches her go, helpless.
Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
turn, gaining on him, bearing down.
Cars slow, stop.
More
people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.
Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
behind him.
He's running out of options, when he spots:
A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.
Thinking fast,
Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge.
VWOOSH!
The flames ignite and spread quickly.
He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
in on him.
Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit --
JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.
As he tumbles
through the air, we CUT BACK TO --
Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.
On the ground,
PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.
Doom and Ben SMASH through
the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.
SMASH!
Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --
CRASH!
Water floods the street.
Doom and Ben land in a
large GARBAGE TRUCK.
The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
from the inside.
Grunts, growls.
CRASH!
The truck suddenly STOPS.
COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
sirens screaming.
And --
BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.
SMASH!
Ben
lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
the WINDSHIELD.
Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
flooding the street around him.
COP CARS converge on Doom.
Doom turns his attention to the cops.
His limbs SPARK with
electricity, ready to fire at the cars.
Ben sees the cops and Doom.
He knows the cops are dead meat.
He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.
BEN
Excuse me, Maam.
Can I borrow your
car?
She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.
OLD LADY
The clutch sticks a little.
BEN
Not gonna be a problem.
Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.
WHMM!
It FLIES
through the air, and WHAM!
Hits hard, knocking Doom back
twenty feet!
As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --
BOOM!
Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!
CRASH!
Windows shatter.
The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
snapping the pole.
Doom steps out, unharmed.
Ben CHARGES toward him.
Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
giant STUN-GUN!
Electric sparks FLY through the air into --
BEN!
The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!
He goes
FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --
WHOOMPF!
Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street!
Water rushes into the crater.
Ben lays there, incapacitated.
On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.
Doom
strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
death-blow.
Currents surge.
Right before he swings down --
VOICE (O.S.)
I can't let you do that.
Simple, strong.
Doom turns to see...REED.
Alone.
Bruised
and battered.
Slowly stepping toward him.
Doom smiles.
DOOM
And you can't stop me.
He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
DOWN!
Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.
Something invisible.
DOOM (CONT'D)
Hello Susan.
She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD.
Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.
It
skids along the street.
Reed helps Ben to his feet.
Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.
DOOM (CONT'D)
What is this?
The pitiful three?
Doom steps toward them, but --
VOICE (O.S.)
Four.
WHOOOSH!
Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.
Johnny takes his place alongside the others.
The four of
them stand as one.
Johnny turns to Thing.
JOHNNY
Had a little relapse, huh?
Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
Welcome back.
They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
and melted, making him look all the more menacing.
DOOM
This is going to be fun.
Electricity starts to course through his body.
He stands at
the foot of the crater Ben made.
He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!
He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.
He
holds tight, ABSORBING the power.
Lights FLICKER and DIM in
buildings around him.
Windows BLOW!
Doom GLOWS, amped up.
He LETS GO of the cables!
The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
control!
PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.
Reed sees the wires
SLASHING through the air.
He makes a move:
Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables.
Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.
The electric charges
surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --
Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
flight.
She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
fighter.
One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
and --
SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!
The pillar
starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang!
They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!
But --
Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
holding it up!
He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
holding the world.
People run out, safe.
ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.
REED
JOHNNY!
SPOT-WELD!
Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
wires back together.
Sparks fly.
The cables start to FUSE.
Doom keeps FIRING.
Sue struggles with her force-fields.
The
impact is too much.
Her nose starts to bleed.
SUE
Can't...hold...on...
Doom smiles.
Reed sees her.
She is about to drop her hands,
vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY!
He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.
Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.
They SLAM into Reed's body,
RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
breaking.
He strains, agonizing.
REED
Johnny.
SUPERNOVA.
JOHNNY
But all these people...
REED
Now.
Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
Johnny GRABS DOOM.
THING
(quiet, smiling)
Flame on, kid.
FLASH!
Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.
Reed
doesn't miss a beat.
He's in total command now.
REED
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
frustration --
SUE
(looking at Doom)
I'm sure I can come up with something.
She concentrates.
She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.
Sue shuts her eyes.
A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
BODY.
A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.
It SWOOPS past a car, which
WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field).
Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.
The light increases, to the
point that it's blinding.
People look away.
Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.
He collapses to the
ground, exhausted, smoking.
Sue exhales and falls to her
knees.
Her force field fades.
The light flickers out.
As
everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.
THUD.
And --
DOOM steps through the smoke.
Unharmed.
His metallic body
GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.
Sue, Ben, Johnny look
devastated.
They can't beat him.
He looks at Reed.
DOOM
Is that the best you can do...?
A
little heat...?
Reed stays perfectly calm.
He shakes his head.
REED
Time for your lesson, Vic.
Chem 101:
what happens when you supercool hot
metal...?
(to Ben)
Ben...
BEN
Got it, teach.
He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.
The water GEYSERS UP!
Ben
kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...
The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!
DOOM
No.
Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
DOOM.
GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
metal.
DOOM screams.
His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE.
The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
obscuring Doom from view.
A beat.
The steam clears to
reveal:
DOOM.
A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
METAL.
Frozen forever.
Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
Fantastic Four -- exhale.
They stand as one, in roiling
smoke.
A beat.
JOHNNY
Damn, I love this job.
Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.
BEN
Job, huh...?
Will they accept their mantle?
Reed shrugs.
REED
Well, we do have the suits...
They give weary smiles.
A team.
Sue gets close to Reed.
SUE
You know, about what we said up there,
I think maybe --
THHM!
He KISSES HER.
His neck extending.
Strong, powerful.
He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.
A new strength in
him.
BEN
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Sue looks at Reed.
A long way from that conference room.
SUE
Hilarious.
As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.
The sun
rises around them.
The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
of a new day.
And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --
A romantic view of the city-scape.
Reed stands with Sue.
REED
I found a broken gasket, from space --
SUE
A gasket?
Reed, we're at a party.
He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
about the size of......a RING.
Sue slows down.
REED
If one of us were to wear it...
She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret.
Reed looks her square in the eye.
Unflinching.
SUE
Reed.
What are you doing?
Reed drops to his knees.
His head stays eye-level, while his
body drops.
Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.
REED
No more thinking, no more variables...
Sue Storm...will you...
(she's gone)
Sue?
Sue?
You there?
Dead silence.
And then...
THE RING DISAPPEARS.
SUE IS WEARING IT.
SUE (V.O.)
Yes.
Reed goes to kiss her.
SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That's my nose, genius... These are my
lips.
Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
hands.
She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.
INSIDE: the party applauds.
Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.
As they go --
BEN
No more cracks about how I look.
JOHNNY
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
(weaving around bodies)
Clear the way, wide load coming
through.
Ben glares, fists clenched.
Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
they hit the balcony.
And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
(their future callsign), over the city skyline.
The crowd
oohs and aahs.
Ben watches, unimpressed.
BEN
Showoff.
People drink, laugh, dance.
We slowly PULL BACK from the
party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --
CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.
He is placed in a wooden
crate.
LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
cell.
As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.
Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
STATICKY.
His eyes narrow.
Could it be...?
And --
SLAM.
The door closes.
We can read the destination through
stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.
And we pull back to reveal
the box is on the deck of:
A FREIGHTER SHIP.
The ship pulls away, steaming into the
horizon, as we...
FADE OUT.
THE END
