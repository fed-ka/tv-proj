      The car stops.

      Danny gets out and hammers his fists on the roof of the car 
      then walks away along a wide grass verge.  

      SHOT: Zoe in the car.  She s weeping, tears down her cheeks.  
      The phone in the car rings.  She answers.

                    Danny!  Dog house!  We ve got to

      away.

      It s dozy.  Mid afternoon, just before the rush hour.  No one

      Zoe and Danny are on the station platform.  Ruth appears,

      SHOT: Seen from the waist down a woman walks along the 
      embankment, on her way to work.  She is well dressed, a smart 
                                                                                              *
      shirt, medium high heels.  A bag dangles.

      THE CAMERA travels with her.  She is passing a tramp huddled 
      in the doorway of disused shop.  He is hooded.  We cannot see 
      his face.  He has a hand out.

      The woman ignores the tramp and passes BUT THE CAMERA STOPS.

      GO CLOSER to the tramp.  We see it is Tom.  He looks 
      terrible.  Stubble.  His eyes flicker and look hunted.  He 
      mutters to himself.

                                  TOM
                    Each man kills the thing he loves.  
                                                                                              *
                    Each man kills the thing he loves.  
                    Each man  ...

      He stands.  He observes people passing, eyes darting to bags 
      and pockets.

      Finally he sees what he wants: a girl in jeans with a bag 
      over her shoulder.

      He walks out into the flow of passing people and in a flash 
      his hand is in her bag and out of it.  He returns to his 
      doorway.  He is staring across the road at the door of a 
      Victorian Gothic church.

      SHOT: in his hand is the mobile phone.

      Tom in his doorway, always looking at the door of the church

      The great Victorian Gothic door and steps.  Grass and trees.  
      Parents and children.  A few street people, drinking.  A 
      relaxed scene.  

      Harry walks out and comes down the steps.

                                  HARRY

      He looks across the street at the church door, his eyes 
      flickering with tension.

      CROSS-FADES from day time to evening to night.  Tom s 
      attention on the church does not waver, even when someone 
      gives him a few pence.

      Then, at night time, A MAN appears in a trench coat, collar 
      turned up, and a Trilby, walking briskly.  

      The man goes up the steps to the church door taking his hat 
      off.

      Tom stands and is crossing the road quickly toward the 
      church.

      A CCTV camera high on a wall pans.

      SECURITY MONITORS:

      The view from the camera outside Thames House; then the 
      foyer, empty; a corridor; an empty office; finally the grid 
      with the team working.

      A car draws up fast.  The door opens.  A body is pushed out 
      from the front passenger seat. The car speeds away.

      A moment, the body lying outside Thames House.

      Tom is sitting on a bench.  He is still dishevelled and 
      bearded, but not quite the tramp he was.  He does, however, 
      have no socks on.  He looks bohemian.

      Christine walks past.

      Ten yards on she stops dead.  She turns round and stares.  He 
      still does not look at her.  She goes back to the bench and

                    When she gets to London... where 
                    are you going to lift her?  I need 
                    details to help you.

                                  TOM
                    Are you ... ?

      A horrible moment for Christine.

                                  CHRISTINE
                    What, wearing a wire?  Want to 
                    strip search me do you?  Out here 
                    in public?  Are you losing it Tom.

                    Christine we can get through this.  
                    Be together again.

                                  CHRISTINE
                    If that s what you want.  And you 
                    wash.

                    Not  ...  for a few days.  

      She stands.

                                  TOM
                    I love you.


      She does not reply and moves off.

                    I do, I do, I do.

      GO TO CHRISTINE: tears are pouring down her face as she walks 
      along.  She pulls at her throat and rips out the wire.  She 
      dumps it in a bin.

                                  CHRISTINE
                    I love you too Tom Quinn.

      She walks away quickly.

      An expensive, Georgian hotel.  An awning.  Shining brass, a 
      big revolving door with DOORMAN.

      The observation van is parked amongst expensive cars just 
      down the street on the opposite side.

      Danny and Zoe leave the van.  We realise they are very well 
      dressed.  Danny is putting the tie on.

      Carmen is getting into a cab. 

8585**

      It is a back street.  Nearby there is a high rise block, an 
      old wall with trees above it and out of control.  The area is 
      run down and so is The New Concord, a derelict looking pub.  
                                                                                              *
      Its walls are off-white and peeling, the windows of the rooms 
      all have thick net curtains pulled, some untidily.  Some are 
      grey with dirt.

      Danny comes into the room.  The Asian family have been living

      Colin - headphones on - is on a chair probing the wall.  He 
                                                                                              ***

                    So did we just save our jobs?

                                  ZOE
                    I think we just saved the service.

                    From the dark forces.  I hope I 
                    don t ever have to go where you ve 
                    been.

                    We lie about people a lot in this 
                    game.  What s really frightening is 
                    when someone lies about you.

                    I don t.

      They smile at each other.

      And the four walk away together.   
                                                                                              *
