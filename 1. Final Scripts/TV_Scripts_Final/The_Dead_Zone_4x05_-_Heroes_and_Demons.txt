                                              TEASER


  11BLACK SCREEN

          We hear a WOMAN'S VOICE, quiet and tinged with sorrow, as
          HER FACE -- beautiful, similarly haunted -- materializes
          from the darkness.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                                (Elvish)
                        "Ethelemm  truanai andass .  E
                          firitana tol-muura e wiisha mella."
                                (translating)
                        Stories are like journeys.  The
                        most difficult step always seems
                        to be the first.

          FADE IN OVER A DISTINCTIVE MUSIC THEME:

  22EXT. DARK WOODS - DAY

          A slight BOY in his early teens, a worn leather rucksack
          over one shoulder, makes his way tentatively through the
          tall trees.  He pauses to peer up at the daylight that is
          all but blocked by the dense foliage.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        It is often in the darkest times,
                        when our strength and will are
                          weakest, that we are challenged
                        to set out on an unfamiliar path. 
                        So it was for young Finn.


  33INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY - POV ANGLE - AN ESCALATOR

          carries us down into the bowels of the station.  Our POV
          (about waist-high to other escalator riders) turns to
          look up at a rectangle of daylight receding from view.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        "Finn the Silent."  As he was
                        known.  A riddle to all who knew
                        him.  And to himself as well.


44POV - CLOSE ON A TICKET VENDING MACHINE

          Five quarters are inserted and one token is dispensed.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TEASER - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 2.


    4CONTINUED:4

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        His journey required him to
                          negotiate strange currencies.

  55INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A TRAIN ROARS INTO THE STATION

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        And to face dangers he could barely
                        have imagined.

          The noise is deafening.  Our POV retreats behind a pillar
          as the roar bleeds into a MORE BESTIAL ROAR coming from --


  66EXT. A CLEFT IN THE SIDE OF A RAVINE - DAY

          Finn covers his ears and ducks behind a rock.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        And though his courage was often
                          tested...


  77INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY - POV ANGLE

          Another subway train roars into the station.  This time
          we peer out from behind the pillar, watch the doors open,
          then tentatively make our way toward them.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ...he found strength to face his
                        fears.


88LOW POV ANGLE - A SIGN SAYS "SOUTH STREET BUS TERMINAL"

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        For never had he traveled so far...


99POV INSERT - A GREYHOUND BUS TIMETABLE

          As our view TILTS part way down a column of cities
          connecting Boston and Bangor, Maine.  Sounds of a bustling
          bus terminal in the b.g.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ...even in the company of those
                        far older and wiser than himself.


  1010INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY - POV THROUGH WINDOW

          We glimpse cars pacing us, highway scenery flying by.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TEASER - 3/9/05 - GOLD 3.


    10CONTINUED:10

          Then our POV PANS to a spiral drawing pad on a tray table
          in front of us.  We hear the scratch of a felt-tip marker
          as we take in several COMIC BOOK-STYLE PANELS, each deftly
          drawn, depicting the scenes we've just seen, including:

          - The beautiful narrator's face emerging from the darkness.

          - Finn making his way through the dark woods, lighting
          his way with a magic amulet that he wears around his neck.

          - A DRAGON roaring from a rocky cave as Finn hides.

          CAMERA pans across the panels as the NARRATOR continues:

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        And on this most important journey
                        he was alone.  His path leading
                        him toward a distant...

          Panning now to that same bus timetable, now propped atop
            a DRAWING that suggests an ANCIENT PARCHMENT MAP.  The
          cities in the time table have been transformed into
            whimsical place names along a treacherous route that winds
          over mountain ranges and rivers. 

            Suddenly, another woman's voice interrupts the scene.

                                        50ISH WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?  Is that your knapsack?

          The sound of drawing pauses; our POV freezes; music and
            narration stop.

                                        50ISH WOMAN (O.S.)
                        I asked if this seat is taken?
                                (beat)
                        Little pain in the ass.

          As she moves off, then MUSIC RESUMES.  CAMERA CONTINUES
          PANNING across the map to a province called BANGORIA, and
          within it to a little hamlet called CLEAVES MILLS.  A
          felt-tip sketches in a nearby river as the narrator also
          continues:

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ...a distant and fabled realm
                        wherein dwelt a man of uncommon
                        power and compassion.          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TEASER - 3/8/05 - GREEN 4.


  1111EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT - POV ANGLE

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ... A grand wizard named Eldgar.

          FOG obscures our view as we make our way up the curving
            driveway.  A door looms, then a small gloved finger reaches
          up into frame up and hits the doorbell. 

          A beat, then the door opens, and our POV looks down,
          focusing on a man's SHOES as they step into frame.

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        Hello there.

          And now, abruptly, camera breaks from the POV to reveal:


          JOHNNY SMITH

          looking down at his visitor:  a small 12-YEAR-OLD BOY
          wearing a bulging knapsack.  The boy's eyes, fixed on the
          flagstones of Johnny's front landing, now dart to the
          house, then to the driveway -- anything but Johnny himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I help you?

          But the boy remains silent.  Off Johnny, puzzled by this
          odd visitor...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF TEASER          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 5.


                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:

  1212EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny continues to eye the silent boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you all right?  It's a heck
                        of a night to be wandering around
                        on your own.  You're not lost,
                        are you?

          Still without looking at Johnny, the boy takes piece of
          GOLD BRAID from a pocket and holds it out to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, if this is some joke your
                        friends put you up to, you knocked
                        on the wrong door.

          But the boy continues to hold out the piece of braid. 
          His glances darting near, but never connecting with Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fine.  Joke's on me, I guess.

          He takes the piece of braid.  WHOOSH! 


  1313VISION:  THE SAME GOLD BRAID

          Only now it's attached to the sleeve of a man's police
          dress uniform.  It's starting to come loose from the
          jacket.  We pull back to reveal the BOY staring at it as
          he stands beside the man (RYAN FALLON, late 40s), who
          looks down at him, sees him staring at his sleeve, and
          shakes his head sadly.  Pulling back more to reveal Johnny
          standing on the boy's other side as he realizes he's --


          AT A FUNERAL SERVICE - INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY (JOHNNY'S
          LIVING ROOM REDRESS)

          A small group of mourners, several more officers in dress
          blues, including a young man (MITCH STANTON, 30ish) who
          puts a comforting hand on Ryan's shoulder.  A priest is
          reciting a prayer near an open coffin (in which we may
          see the profile of the deceased woman:  Ryan's wife IRENE;
          if not, there's a WREATH from the Boston Police Detectives
          Benevolent Association with the name "Irene Fallon"). 
          But the boy's attention remains strangely fixed on that
          piece of fraying gold braid.

          Off Johnny, observing this...          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 6.


  1414RESUME ON JOHNNY

          As he comes out of the vision just long enough to see the
          boy now studying him, as though Johnny's distraction has
          emboldened him.  Then Johnny's plunged back into --


  1515VISION SEQUENCE CONTINUES: EXT. BOSTON STREET - NIGHT

          Two burly FEDERAL AGENTS in DEA wind breakers haul a
          handcuffed Ryan Fallon, now in plain clothes, toward an
          unmarked sedan, passing Johnny, who again notes Stanton,
          also in plain clothes, angrily pacing the feds --

                                        STANTON
                        At least take the goddamn cuffs
                        off!  He's a cop for christsake!


  1616FLASH TO:  INT. COURTROOM - DAY - TIGHT ON A DEFENDANT'S 
          TABLE AS WE SLOWLY DOLLY IN ON --

          Ryan Fallon, who stands staring at us, flanked by his
          lawyer on one side and Johnny on the other, as an O.S.
          Judge bangs a gavel to silence a noisy crowd.  Then -- 

                                        JUDGE (O.S.)
                        You've heard the sentence of this
                        court.  In accordance with that
                          sentence, at a date and time to
                        be determined, you will be taken
                        to a place of execution and put
                        to death by lethal injection. 
                        May God rest your soul.

          Off Johnny...


  1717MATCH, MOVE, MORPH TO:  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ON JOHNNY

          Widening to find him sitting with a dozen people facing a
            curtained window, as the curtain goes up to reveal Fallon
          strapped to a gurney in an execution chamber (this can be
            a redress of police observation room/interrogation room
          set we'll use later).  CAMERA pushes through the window
          to Fallon, just as a Corrections Officer pushes a button,
          sending an anesthetic coursing through an IV into his
          arm, and his eyes close with an expression of resignation.


  1818RAMPING OUT OF JOHNNY'S EYE - PRESENT

          As he comes out of the vision, eyes the piece of braid in
          his hand, then the boy, who's once again avoiding his
          gaze.  Johnny crouches in front of him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 7.


    18CONTINUED:18

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your name?  Why'd you want
                        me to touch this?

          Johnny tries to make eye contact, but the boy keeps looking
          away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You could at least look at me.

          As he grips the boy's arm, the kid reacts, stiffening.


1919A SERIES OF P.O.V. FLASHES (VISION) - NIGHT

          Unlike the previous visions, these have a surreal quality,
          emphasizing physical details and patterns over context
          and narrative, like visual non sequiturs:


          SHADOWS SKITTER ACROSS A GRAFFITI-TAGGED WALL

          And then the various graffitos are isolated, transcribed
          and re-arranged on the wall in alphabetical columns.


2020A BRIGHT SILVER DISK WITH FAINT MARKINGS

          Gleams amidst a handful of similar flattened disks of
          various size, all set against a rectangular bed of dark
          angular stones.  Suddenly, the flattened disks "rise"
          like baking bread, becoming COINS:  quarters, nickels,
          dimes and pennies.  Next the screen splits into two
          columns: on one side, the handful of coins are sorted by
          value and tallied; on the other side, the stones are
          arranged into an abacus-like grid and tallied as well.


  2121RIBBONS OF LIGHT 

          Undulate in serpentine patterns against darkness.


  2222RESUME

          Johnny releases the boy's arm and falls back on his ass
          like he's received a shock.  The boy reacts just as
          violently, scrabbling backwards to a corner of the landing,
          where he begins to moan and rock uncontrollably. 

          Off Johnny's alarm and confusion, TIME CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 8.


  2323INT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

          Calm now, the boy, his jacket off, pokes around in the
          dining room, opening china cabinets and studying the
            contents, then scribbling in his drawing pad.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Thanks for answering my 9-1-1. 
                        How'd you calm him down?

          Pulling back to find him watching with BRUCE from the
          doorway to the kitchen.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've had a little experience with
                          autistic kids.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Autistic?

                                        BRUCE
                        You learn to recognize the signs.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                          Aversion to eye contact.  Being
                          touched.  Obsessive rhythmic
                          movements...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        The rocking movement.

                                        BRUCE
                        Usually there's a language problem.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What language?  He hasn't said a
                        word since he got here.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's extreme.  Autistic kids
                        who can't communicate usually
                        aren't independent enough to be
                        out on their own.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He managed to track me down. 
                        Even seems to know how my visions
                        work.

                                        WALT (O.S.)
                        He did his homework.  Take a look.

            Revealing WALT laying out some of the items from the boy's
          knapsack on the kitchen counter, including a bunch of
          tabloid newspaper clippings.  As Johnny and Bruce come
          over, he indicates one--a Boston Guardian story on Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Boston?

                                        WALT
                        Guess that's where he's from.
                                (holds up a bus ticket)
                        Bus ticket.  One way from South
                          Station.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's circled two stories.

          Johnny and Walt look at the clipping.  Right next to a
          story about Johnny is a headline that reads, "Ex-cop's
          Appeal Denied; Death Sentence Upheld."  Below it is a
          picture of Ryan Fallon in a police uniform.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the guy I saw in my vision.

                                        WALT
                        You sure?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know him?

                                        WALT
                              (a vital distinction)
                        I know of him.  Remember that
                        corruption scandal in the Boston
                        P.D. about five years back?  This
                        guy set it off when he shot and
                        killed an undercover federal agent.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a dirty cop.

                                        BRUCE
                          I didn't think Massachusetts had
                        a death penalty?

                                        WALT
                        He was tried and sentenced in a
                        federal court.  Someone wanted to
                        make an example.  He's due for
                          execution next week.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reading off clipping)
                        "Fallon has a son, Thaddeus,
                        twelve, currently living with
                          relatives."
                                (looks to dining room)
                          Thaddeus.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess he thought you could help
                        his dad.

          Walt can see another Johnny mission in the making.

                                        WALT
                        John.  This is one bucket you
                        might want to think twice before
                        jumping into.  Corruption charges
                        tend to get the rank and file a
                        bit edgy.

          Johnny glances again toward the dining room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can at least take him home. 
                        Someone must be looking for him
                        by now.

                                        WALT
                        I'll radio the office, see if
                        there's a runaway report.

          He exits as Johnny and Bruce cross toward the dining room. 
          Only Thaddeus, as we'll now call him, is gone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where'd he go?

                                        BRUCE
                        He's probably checkin' out the
                        house.

          As they move toward the living room, CUT TO:


  2424INT. SMITH HOUSE - FOYER - A MOMENT LATER

          Bruce and Johnny enter from the living room.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll look upstairs, you check
                        down here.

          He bounds up the stairs.  Johnny starts to walk down the
          long foyer, calling out:

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus?

          Then he turns, notices a door under the stairs that's

    24CONTINUED:24

          partly open, a bit of light spilling out.  He approaches.


          ANGLE ON DOOR

          As Johnny opens it to reveal Thaddeus huddled in a corner
          of the closet-like space, drawing on his pad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There you are.

          He crouches again, this time keeping a little distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See you found my old hidin' place. 
                        I used to hole up here for hours
                          whenever I wanted to be alone. 

          Thaddeus doesn't look up at him, just swaps one colored
          felt tip for another and continues drawing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's "Thaddeus," right?  That
                        gold braid, it was your dad's,
                        wasn't it?
                                (beat)
                        I guess you knew I'd figure that
                        out.

          Still no response.  Johnny sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We'll get in touch with your
                        family.  They'll probably let you
                        stay here tonight.  But tomorrow
                        we've got to get you home.

          Thaddeus seems to nod, or maybe he's just rocking slightly,
          as we push in on his drawing pad, beginning --


2525A COMIC BOOK MONTAGE

          Dynamic macro photography, the kind Ken Burns used to
          make Civil War photographs come alive, turns a series of
          Thaddeus's comic book panels into a little story.

          Once again, the beautiful narrator's face hovers over a
          dramatic "establishing shot" of a tiny horse-drawn cart
          making its way through a snowy mountain pass.

          tall white-robed Wizard, his short, pointy-eared
          Apprentice, and young Finn seated between them.  We might
          note that Finn's companions bear a more than passing
          resemblance to Johnny and Bruce.

          As he fiddles with a NAVIGATION UNIT mounted on the dash. 
          Thaddeus is in back, drawing as he repeatedly hums an ODD
          LITTLE MELODY -- which seems to be getting to Bruce.

                                        BRUCE

                          technology.

          He gets back in the car, handing Bruce a folded map with
            a circled destination.

                        That's where we should be. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Sorry, I was distracted.  That
                        little ditty he keeps humming is
                        about to drive me crazy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now it's his fault you can't
                        operate that thing?  That's
                        desperate, even for you.

                                        BRUCE
                                (glancing back)
                        Doesn't seem to be stopping his
                        art work.

          Johnny has an idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus -- can I see your
                          drawings?

          Thaddeus lets him take the pad.  Johnny studies the
            drawings, which include panels we saw in the montage, as
          well as new scenes involving elves, trolls, dragons, etc.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These are good.  You even made up
                        your own language.

          He indicates a panel that shows Eldgar and his apprentice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "The wizard and his apprentice."

          Bruce glances back at the pad.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you saying that freaky little
                        dude with the pointy ears is me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Remarkably life-like.

                                (grabbing pad)
                        Uh-uh!  No way!  I'm no "elf."

                                        JOHNNY
                          Tolkien's elves were immortal.

                                        BRUCE
                          Immortal, huh?

          Johnny hands Thaddeus his pad.

          Bruce starts the car, grousing to himself.

                        Just never seen no black elf,
                        that's all.

          And they pull out of frame...

            Observing the SUV as it parks down the street.  Bruce,
          Johnny and Thaddeus get out, then cross the street to a
          small house that's seen better days.

          Johnny and Bruce eye the front yard littered with abandoned
          toys and kids' bikes.  Johnny checks the house number
          against a slip of paper.

          Thaddeus's response is to head up the walk, as Johnny and
          Bruce follow.

                        She should be expecting us.

          Sounds of video game mayhem from inside as they approach
          the door.  Thaddeus waits as Johnny rings the bell.  A
          second ring prompts a woman to shout:

                                        CALLIE (O.S.)
                        Jimmy!  Evan!  Somebody get the
                        damn door!

          As Johnny and Bruce exchange looks --


  30A30AINT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          CALLIE FALLON, Ryan's younger sister, an attractive but
          perpetually frazzled single mom in her 30s, crosses to
          the front door, glaring at her oblivious preteen twin
          sons, who are noisily playing a violent video game.

          She opens the door, ushering Johnny and Bruce in.

                                        CALLIE
                        Hi... I'm... Jesus, Thad, you had
                        us going nuts.

          Without so much as a glance, Thaddeus walks past her,
          heading for his room.

                                        CALLIE
                          Thaddeus!  I'm talking to you!
                                (turning back to Bruce
                                and Johnny)
                        I'm sorry you had to drive all
                        the way down here.  House is a

                        some coffee before you head back.

          She turns toward the twins, her voice cutting through the
          video mayhem.

          Callie pours some coffee.

                        My own kids I can barely handle... 
                        But Thad?  Running away like this. 
                        It's just too much.

                                        BRUCE
                        Can't you get him some help?

                                        CALLIE
                        Aides cost money, and I'm the
                        only one paying the bills.  After
                        I heard from you, I called Social
                          Services.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're giving him up?

                                        CALLIE
                        The State has places for kids
                        like him.  Maybe he'd even be
                          happier.

          Johnny and Bruce trade glances.  Callie instantly gets
          defensive, picking up toys and chucking them in a box.

                                        CALLIE
                        You have no idea what it's like. 
                        Dealing with an autistic kid is a

                        He was doing pretty well.  Irene --

                        cut him out.  Can you imagine?

            Actually, Johnny can.

                        That's when he started to shut
                        down.  Then Ryan was arrested and
                        he stopped talking altogether.

                        Ms. Fallon?  It seems to me that
                        it's Thaddeus who's reaching out. 
                        He didn't just run away.  He came
                        looking for me.  For help.

                        It's the case.  I've tried to
                        shield him, but it's always in
                        the papers.  I guess he thinks
                        you're some kind of super hero.

          Lord of the Rings action figures.  Parchment maps of Middle
          Earth, as well as bus and subway routes, on the walls. 
          Thaddeus is slipping the pages of his latest comic into a

          the ball.  WHOOSH!

          Johnny watches from a doorway as Ryan and his wife, IRENE,

                        connecting with him.

                        Like how to be a real father.

          She walks away as Sean considers the baseball, then dumps
          it in the trash as Johnny hears a noise, then looks down
          and sees a YOUNGER THADDEUS (8) huddled in the hallway,
          just out of sight, rocking and quietly moaning.

                        Did Ryan and Thaddeus get along?

          She's a little taken aback.

                                        CALLIE
                        My brother's a cop, from a family
                        of cops.  He couldn't accept having
                        a son with Thad's... limitations.

          Thaddeus is now holding out a small black plastic ball. 
          Johnny takes it, unsure what it is at first -- until he
          turns it around and sees a white-etched manual shift
          pattern.  It's a car's gear shift knob.  WHOOSH! 


  3535INT. VW RABBIT - NIGHT - MATCHING POV ANGLE

          The KNOB now mounted on the stick shift of Irene Fallon's
          ancient VW.  Her hand comes into frame, shifts the lever
          into third, as we tilt up to see her looking at the road
          ahead.  Our POV is that of a child in the passenger seat.

    35CONTINUED:35

          She looks at us and smiles:  an angelic face beaming down,
          framed by a halo of sunlight.  (And by now we may recognize
          her face as that of "Irime," the narrator of Thaddeus's
          comics.  It's his mother's voice that we've been hearing
          as well -- Thaddeus's way of preserving her memory). 
          Then she reaches for the knob again.  Only now it comes
          off in her hand.  She stares at it for a beat, flustered,
          then looks up as an oncoming truck's BRIGHT LIGHTS blind
          her.  She throws her right arm against us as there's a
            sickening CRASH! 


  3636RESUME - INT. THADDEUS'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's from the crash.

                                        CALLIE
                                (creeped out)
                          I didn't know he had that.

          Thaddeus holds up one last item:  A FLATTENED NICKEL. 
          And for a moment he actually meets Johnny's eyes.  Johnny
          takes the squished coin and is again jolted into --


    3737REPRISE:  WEIRD P.O.V. FLASHES

          Again we see the wall of graffiti with the graffitos
          rearranging themselves.


  3838NEXT, THE UNDULATING RIBBONS OF LIGHT. 

          Only now we tilt up to see a wriggling, amoeba-like black
          shape silhouetted against a brighter light. 


    3939FINALLY, WE SEE THE FLATTENED COINS WINKING ON THE BED OF
          STONES --

          As this time a SHADOW falls over them.


  4040RESUME

          Again, Johnny comes out of the vision to find Thaddeus
          humming the ODD MELODY again, almost as if he's trying to
          make a point.  But whatever it is, Johnny doesn't get it.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see that time?

                                        JOHNNY
                        More weird images... like before.

          Callie's patience has run out.  Firmly:

                                        CALLIE
                        I need you both to go now.

          Johnny stands, moves to the door with Bruce.  He takes a
          last look at Thaddeus, but the boy is already drawing a
          new comic, humming the odd little tune as he works.


  4141EXT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Bruce head down the walk.

                                        BRUCE
                        We're not going, are we?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ryan Fallon's life isn't the only
                        one at stake here. 

          They've reached the car.  Johnny turns, almost angry.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know what it feels like to grow
                        up without a father.  If there's
                        any chance I can spare Thaddeus
                        those feelings, I'll take it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay, John.

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Where do we start?

          At which point the VAN we saw earlier zooms up, the side
          door is yanked open, and TWO MEN jump out.

                                        MAN
                        Get in.

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa!  What is this?

          One of the men (DUFFY) pulls up his jacket, reveals the
          butt of a gun and a detective's BADGE on his belt.

                                        DUFFY
                        Now get your ass in the van.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's the charge?

                                        DUFFY
                        How about kidnapping and resisting
                          arrest...

          He shoves Bruce toward the door, as they allow themselves
          to be herded inside.  The two cops jump in after them and
          slam the door shut.  As the van zooms off...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT ONE          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TWO - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 23.

          FADE IN:

  4242INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

          Through one-way glass, we see Johnny and Bruce being
            interrogated by the two cops who picked them up.  On our
          side of the glass, we see the REFLECTIONS of two other
          cops:  Mitch Stanton, a young and likeable plain-clothes
            narcotics detective (think a young David Caruso, tough
          but sensitive), and his older, laconic supervisor, LT.
          DOBBS.  Dobbs smokes.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        Wise use of taxpayer dollars.

                                        STANTON (O.S.)
                        I said I'd look after his family.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        You're taking loyalty too far.

                                        STANTON (O.S.)
                        Man was my partner.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        And he almost took down this
                          division.

          Camera pulls back to reveal the two men.

                                        STANTON
                        It's against the law to smoke
                          indoors.

                                        DOBBS
                        You're a cop.  Arrest me.

          One of the other cops, Duffy, the guy who told Johnny and
          Bruce to get in the van, pokes his head in.

                                        DUFFY
                        They claim the kid came to them,
                        they were just takin' him home.
                                (indicates Johnny)
                        When I uncuffed blondie, he said
                        my wife wasn't coming back.  Claims
                        he gets "visions" off touching
                        things.

                                        STANTON
                        Think he's for real?

                                        DUFFY
                        You met my wife.  Hell, I pray
                        he's for real.

                                        STANTON
                        Let's see.

          Stanton takes out a key chain with some sort of "charm"
          attached -- a squashed, gold-plated bullet.  Off which...


  4343INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

          Stanton enters, Dobbs and Duffy behind him, and immediately
          tosses Johnny the key chain.  WHOOSH! 


  4444INT. DESERTED LOADING DOCK - NIGHT - PAST - VISION

          POV ANGLE of a drug buy going down - a GUY handing a bag
          of drugs to ANOTHER GUY in an SUV.  Pull back to find
          Johnny crouched beside Fallon and Stanton as they observe
          through the gap between a big truck and its cab.

                                        STANTON
                        We should call for back up.

          Fallon gives him a disdainful glance. 

                                        FALLON
                        More than you can handle, rookie?

          Stanton looks pissed, but racks the slide of his gun.


          NEW ANGLE

          Johnny now revealed watching from this angle as Fallon
          and Stanton descend on the two men.  Stanton goes for the
          man who was standing beside the truck and is now walking
          away.  Fallon sticks his gun in the driver's open window.

                                        FALLON & STANTON
                        Police!  Freeze!  [etc.]

          Stanton slams his man against a truck, his eyes briefly
          off Fallon, who yanks open the door of the SUV.

                                        FALLON
                        Get out!

          But as he opens the door, he sees A THIRD MAN reflected
          in the SUV's sideview mirror.  He's just stepped out of a
          loading dock door, aims a cannon-like .357 at Fallon.  As
          Fallon turns, staring into point blank death, a shot rings
          out...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ACT TWO - 6/20/05 - BLUE-2  24A.


    44CONTINUED:44

          ...and the man falls as he fires, a bullet intended for
          Fallon burying itself in side of the SUV.  Fallon and
          Johnny turn to see Stanton's gun smoking, his perp already
          cuffed.  As Stanton and Fallon lock eyes...

          Johnny looks at the squashed bullet, then at Stanton.

                          Fallon's.

          The cops react, as surprised as anyone would be.

                                        STANTON
                        And he's saved mine.  Guess I'm a
                        little over-protective where his
                        kid's concerned.  You're free to
                        go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if we could help?  Your
                          partner, I mean.

                                        DOBBS
                        Ryan Fallon had his day in court.

                                        BRUCE
                        What if we could find new evidence.

                                        DOBBS
                        I got real work to do.

          He gives Stanton a look that says "it's your headache"
          and exits.  Johnny tosses Stanton back his keys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At the trial, Fallon said he was
                        framed.

                                        STANTON
                        You heard what my lieutenant said.

          He starts to usher them out, but Johnny hangs back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you really care about Ryan and
                          Thaddeus, you'll accept my offer. 
                        Either way, we're not going home.

          Stanton eyes Johnny, gauging his determination.  Then:

                                        STANTON
                        Ryan was like a father to me.  I
                        wanted to believe him.  More than
                        I've ever wanted anything.
                                (beat)
                        Just be careful where you poke
                        your nose.  You've seen what
                        happens when you get cocky.

4646A COMIC BOOK MONTAGE - SERIES OF IMAGES

          A "crystal eye" (Thad's variation on a crystal ball, in
          the form of a large jagged crystal) reveals a ragged man
          in a dungeon.  Eldgar/Johnny and Apprentice/Bruce make
          their way through a swamp toward a forbidding fortress. 
          Hellish souls rise out of the water, grasping for them
          with arms of mist -- only to miss the pair as they slip
          past under a spell of invisibility.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                          Eldgar's "crystal eye" revealed
                        the location of Finn's father: 
                        the dreaded Fortress of Maror. 
                        The trio decided to reconnoiter*
                        the fortress, only to be waylaid*
                        by the Kalmathari -- the hungry
                        souls of those already claimed by
                        Maror's dungeons.  Were it not
                        for a quickly cast spell of
                          invisibility, their own souls
                        would have joined their ranks.

          And off a comic book image of the watery demons, howling
          at being denied their prey...


  4747EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - DAY

          Bruce's SUV is directed through a gate.  No swamp demons
          here, just a small crowd of anti-death penalty PROTESTERS
          shouting as they wave their placards at the car.


  4848INT. PRISON MEETING ROOM - DAY

          Ryan Fallon, looking older than in Johnny's earlier
          visions, sits at a small table with a box of legal folders. 
          He's a bitter and cynical man:  a cop schooled by the
          business end of the Justice system.  He stands as a guard
          admits Johnny and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Detective Fallon?  My name's Johnny
                        Smith, this is my... associate,
                        Bruce Lewis.

          Ryan indicates two chairs on the other side of the table.

                                        RYAN
                        My lawyers said I should meet
                        with you.  My question is why?

          Johnny holds out the bullet key chain (sans keys).

                                        JOHNNY
                        A close friend sent us.

          Ryan eyes the key chain, surprised, then takes it.  WHOOSH! 


  4949INT. BAR - NIGHT - VISION

          The same bullet-key chain plops into Mitch Stanton's shot
          glass.  He turns as Ryan slides onto an adjacent stool.

                                        RYAN
                          Consider it a 24-carat thank you.

          Stanton fishes out the key chain, smiles.

                                        STANTON
                        Just doin' my job.

                                        RYAN
                        I got sloppy.  I have a feeling
                        you're gonna keep me on my toes...
                          partner.

                                        STANTON
                          Serious? 

                                        RYAN
                        It's up to you.

          He offers his hand, then pulls Stanton into a hug.  Pull
          back to reveal Johnny watching from another bar stool.

                        I think that hurt the most.  That
                        my partner could think I sold
                        out.

                        Your son came to find me.

          Ryan's taken aback.  This doesn't quite compute for him.

                                        BRUCE
                        All the way to Maine on his own.

                                        RYAN
                        That's impossible... My son is...

                          Autistic.  I know.  He's also
                        your biggest supporter.  Now maybe
                        I can help you, maybe I can't. 
                        The question is:  What have you
                        got to lose?

          A beat, then Ryan nods.

                                        RYAN
                        What do you want from me?

                        I need to hear it in my own way.

          He extends both his hands over the desktop, palms up.

                                        RYAN

                                (to Bruce)
                        He's kidding, right?

          Bruce and Johnny stare back at him.  Ryan eyes Johnny's
          hands for a beat, then grasps them.  WHOOSH!          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ACT TWO - 6/20/05 - BLUE-2  28A.


  5151EXT. RAIL YARD - NIGHT - VISION

          We cut into the middle of a foot chase, with Johnny as
          Ryan Fallon, gun drawn, breathing hard as he pursues a
          man with a briefcase who's about 30 yards ahead of him.

                                        RYAN (V.O.)
                        I got a tip that a dealer I was
                        after was making a sale to a big
                          out-of-town buyer.

    51CONTINUED:51

          Johnny/Ryan runs along a high, cement-walled embankment,
          then swerves as his quarry darts across a tangle of switch
          tracks, heading toward the HEADLIGHT of an approaching
          freight train.

                                        RYAN (V.O.)
                        The dealer didn't show and the
                        buyer took off before I could 
                        I.D. myself.  I gave pursuit...

          The buyer ducks under a flat car, trying to escape, but
          Johnny/Ryan jumps on top of it, then makes a flying tackle. 
          As Johnny/Ryan yanks the man to his feet, gun pointed --

                        That's when the lights went out.

          FADE IN:

          HIS POV LOOKING UP  - A BRIGHT LIGHT COMES INTO FOCUS

          It proves to be a helicopter circling tightly overhead,
          shining a searchlight down.  A paramedic leans into frame,
          along with two hard-faced MEN in wind breakers (the two
          feds seen arresting Fallon in the earlier vision).

                                        AGENT

                        When I came to, I was looking up
                        at medics and some very angry
                        feds.

          FLASH!  A Crime Scene Tech snaps a picture.

                        thanks to three rounds from my
                        service revolver.

                        make it look like self-defense.

                        a key to a bus locker packed full
                        of drug money.

  5959INT. RESTAURANT - A MOMENT LATER

          Kujo's studying the wine list when Stanton slides into
          his booth.  Kujo frowns.  Stanton smiles.

                                        STANTON
                        Your date's taking her time in
                        there, Boris.  Hope she's not
                        doing all your coke.

          Now it's Kujo who smiles.

                                        KUJO
                        I don't engage in illegal
                          activities.  I'm a businessman. 
                        Just ask your ex-partner.

          Stanton tenses.  Clearly no love lost between these two. 
          He nods O.S. and Johnny and Bruce, who've been pretending
          to study a menu by the door, approach.

          But first a THUGGISH BODYGUARD moves from another table
          to intervene.  Kujo waves him off.  To Stanton:

                        If you'd warned me, I would've

          Johnny extends his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister Kujo.  I've heard a lot
                        about you.

                                        KUJO
                        And I've heard nothing about you.

          Kujo eyes his hand, then reluctantly grips it.  WHOOSH! 


  6060EXT. RAIL YARD - OVERLOOK - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny finds himself in the back of a tricked-out
          Navigator, watching a track suit-clad Kujo play a video
          game on a drop down screen while his driver stares out at
          the dark rail yard.  Three gunshots echo in the distance. 
          Kujo puts down the controller, speed dials his cell, then
          listens briefly before hanging up.  To the driver:

                                        KUJO
                        Let's go.

          The driver starts the car.  As the headlights come on,
          they illuminate a high, graffiti-covered wall.  The vision
          FREEZES.  Off Johnny as he leans forward to study that
          wall, making a disturbing connection.  He's seen it before.

          Johnny comes out of the vision, nods to Stanton.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was nice meeting you.  Maybe
                        we'll see each other again.

          They head off.  Kujo looks after them, then eyes Stanton.

                                        KUJO
                        What the hell was that?

          Stanton shrugs, a little confused himself but covering.

                                        STANTON
                        You're more popular than you
                          thought.

          As Kujo turns to look after Johnny and Bruce again, still
          puzzled and now a little uneasy...


  6262EXT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and Bruce come out, hustle toward Bruce's car.

                        He's our guy.  Even if he didn't
                        pull the trigger.

                          "Doesn't get his hands dirty."

          Johnny nods as they reach the car, still disturbed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's something else.

                        Just a minute...


  6363INT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY

          Callie opens the door, not happy to see Johnny and Bruce.

                                        CALLIE
                          I thought you two left town.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to speak to Thaddeus.
                                (off her look)
                        It's important.


  6464INT. THADDEUS'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Thaddeus sits on his bed hugging his knees.  Though he
          doesn't look up when Johnny and Bruce enter, Callie
            anxiously following, we sense he was expecting them.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus, I need you to look at
                        me.

          Thaddeus slowly looks up, but not directly at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there that night.  You
                        saw what happened.

          Thaddeus ducks his head again... or was it a nod?  In any
          case, we sense an admission.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TWO - 3/9/05 - GOLD 35.


    64CONTINUED:64

          Callie's confused and alarmed.

                                        CALLIE
                        What are you saying?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus was a witness.  He knows

          Johnny, Bruce and Callie are gathered around Thaddeus. 
          Johnny is talking to him, gesturing.

                        Eldgar believed the boy himself

          But Thaddeus just continues to hold it out, again humming
          the ODD MELODY.  Johnny takes the shield -- WHOOSH! 


  6969EXT. RAIL YARD - NIGHT - VISION

            Vision-Johnny watches as Younger Thaddeus, now clearly
          revealed as a witness to the scene, scrambles to his
          unconscious father's side.  The DEA agent lies nearby.  
          His father's gold shield has fallen on the ground. 
          Thaddeus picks it up -- just as a bright light sweeps the
          area.  It's a DEA helicopter.  Sirens sound.  Police and
          feds are starting to converge on the scene.  Scared and
            overwhelmed, Thaddeus runs off.


  7070RESUME - INT. THADDEUS'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny eyes the badge in his hand, then looks at Thaddeus,
          who once again turns away.  Johnny turns to Callie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your brother was framed.  But to
                        prove that, I need Thaddeus.

          Off Callie, conflicted...


  7171EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY - ON A HIGH GRAFFITI-COVERED WALL

          Tilting down to find Johnny, Bruce and Thaddeus with Mitch
          Stanton staring up at it.

                                        STANTON
                        I'm not sure what this can tell

                        That makes two of us.

          He reaches out, touches the wall.  We hear a WHOOSH.

                                        BRUCE
                        See anything?

          He takes a step toward the boy, who instinctively retreats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you don't like being
                          touched.  But it's the only way I
                        can be sure what you saw.  I won't
                        hurt you.

          He takes another step; Thaddeus backs against the wall.

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't force it, John.  You'll
                        freak him out.

          Indeed, the boy already looks like a cornered animal, his
          eyes darting wildly.  A beat, then Johnny crouches down,
            addresses the boy more gently.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something you may not know about
                        me.  I lost my father when I was
                          a little boy.  Not a day goes by
                        when I don't think about him, or
                        wish I could bring him back.  But
                        the two of us, working together...
                        we have a chance to bring your
                        father back to you.  I need you
                        to be brave and to trust me, just
                        like you'd trust him.

          A beat, then Thaddeus tentatively makes eye contact and
          slowly extends his hand.  Johnny takes it -- WHOOSH!

    7474SUDDENLY DAY BECOMES NIGHT AND THE WALL RECEDES 50 YARDS
          AS JOHNNY AND THADDEUS REMAIN FROZEN IN THE FOREGROUND

          Johnny stands, still holding Thaddeus's hand as he turns
          to see Younger Thaddeus peering from behind some track
            equipment at the graffiti wall as a man runs by -- the
          DEA agent -- followed by Ryan Fallon.

    74CONTINUED:74

          The scene FREEZES and Johnny turns, sees Kujo's Navigator
          parked in the shadows across the yard, facing the wall.


  7575RESUME - EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY

          Johnny and Thaddeus are still by the wall as Johnny stares
          across the yard.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus was over there, watching. 
                        He saw his dad run past this wall,
                        chasing another man.  Kujo was
                        here too.
                                (to Thaddeus)
                        Did you stay there, Thaddeus, or
                        did you follow them?

          In response, Thaddeus tugs on Johnny's hand, leading him
            toward...


7676A TANGLE OF SWITCH TRACKS

          Thaddeus pauses here, eyes focused on a section of track. 
          Johnny crouches and touches a rail.  WHOOSH! 


  7777DAY BECOMES NIGHT AGAIN

          And Johnny finds himself crouching by the tracks as Younger
          Thaddeus runs into frame, then stops, transfixed by what
          he's seeing, which Johnny now sees too:

          THE SWITCH TRACKS are a web of shifting, reflected light,
          a work of abstract art.  Johnny and Younger Thaddeus look
          up from the tracks and see a dark amoeba-like blob
            wriggling against a bright light.

          Then the image focuses, and Johnny sees it's a
            foreshortened view of Ryan chasing the DEA agent down the
          tracks toward the headlight of an approaching train.


  7878RESUME - EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY

            Thaddeus, who we sense is reliving the events himself,
            anxiously pulls Johnny forward, Bruce and Stanton trailing.


          NEW ANGLE

          As they cross several tracks, then Thaddeus stops short,
          as though reacting to something.  WHOOSH!           DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/8/05 - GREEN 40.


  7979EXT. RAIL YARD - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny, holding Thaddeus's hand, is again watching Younger
          Thaddeus as he reacts to the sound of THREE RAPID GUNSHOTS. 
          The boy now steps out from behind the end of a freight
          car and sees a silhouetted figure, his back to us, holding
          a gun as he stands over the unconscious Ryan Fallon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He saw the killer.


    8080INTERCUT - EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY

          Bruce and Stanton following Johnny and Thaddeus's looks. 
          (Note: in real life, as opposed to the vision, there is
          no freight car here; just an empty section of track.)

                                        STANTON
                        Could you see him?  The killer, I
                        mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (still in the vision)
                        His back's to me.  Wait, he's
                          turning.


  8181IN THE VISION

          The man indeed turns, as if sensing eyes on him.  But
          before we can see his face, both Thaddeus and his younger
          vision-self duck down, scrambling under the freight car.


          UNDER THE FREIGHT CAR - VISION

          Johnny finds himself crouching with both boys, their
            attention now fixed on a scattering of flattened coins,
          now clearly left on the tracks by kids, resting atop the
          angular stones of the rail bed.  But as Younger Thaddeus
          picks up a shiny squished nickel, a man's shadow falls
          over the other coins.  They freeze, and Johnny turns to
          see the killer's legs just a few feet away.

          Suddenly the killer's cell phone rings -- a distinctive
            "melodic" ring tone.  The distraction allows Younger
          Thaddeus to scramble away, ending the vision.


  8282RESUME - EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY

          Johnny stands, releasing Thaddeus's hand.  Stanton and
          Bruce look at him expectantly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We didn't see his face.

    82CONTINUED:82

          Stanton shakes his head, as though irritated he's bought
          into this and yet annoyed it isn't panning out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We heard something.

          He takes out his cell phone, shows it to Thaddeus.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That melody you've been humming,
                        that was the sound of his cell
                        phone.  The sound of the man who
                        hurt your father. 

          In response, Thaddeus hums the tune again.

                                        STANTON
                        A ring tone?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To identify the shooter.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who we know was working for our
                        pal Boris.

                                        STANTON
                        Let's say you find the guy, what
                        are the odds he'd have the same
                        phone?  It was five years ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not saying it's evidence, but
                        it's something.

                                        STANTON
                        None of which is gonna get my
                        lieutenant on board.  It isn't
                        even testimony if the kid can't
                        speak.

          Johnny nods.  This is all painfully clear to him too.

                                        JOHNNY
                          According to Ryan's account,
                          Thaddeus was with him most of
                        that day.

                        We could follow their movements,
                        see where your visions lead us.

                                        STANTON
                        You can't tote Thad along like a
                        police dog.  Besides, if you're
                        right, it could be dangerous.

          A beat, then Johnny nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's right.  We need to take him
                        home.

          He crouches in front of the boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You did good, Thad.

          Off the boy's still distant look...


  8383EXT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY - CLOSE ON A PINK POST-IT

          Stuck to the front door.  Bruce picks it up.

                                        BRUCE
                        Callie took the twins to soccer,
                        said to make Thad lunch. 
                                (takes out his cell)
                        I'll catch up to you guys after I
                        call Susannah.  Better reception
                        out here.


  8484INT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Thaddeus sets his pad and markers on the kitchen table as
          Johnny spies another pink post-it on a pantry door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Follow the pink Post-its.
                                (plucks it, reads)
                        Tomato Soup.  Also one of my
                          personal favorites.

          CLOSE ANGLE as his HAND opens the cabinet door.  We hear
          a WHOOSH as a shelf of identical tomato soup cans is
            revealed.  Then ANOTHER MAN'S HAND GRABS A CAN.

                                        RYAN (O.S.)
                                (to phone)

    84CONTINUED:84

          PULLING BACK to reveal we're in --


  8585INT. THADDEUS'S KITCHEN - DAY - PAST - VISION

          Ryan, a phone receiver cradled on his shoulder, is leaving
            a message as he makes lunch for Younger Thaddeus, who is
          again drawing while Johnny, seated beside him, observes.

                                        RYAN
                        Just got a tip that Kujo's
                        personally brokering a sale
                          tonight.  South Station rail yard. 
                        Hope you get this soon 'cause I
                        can't wait.  Mitch, I finally got
                        the bastard.

          He hangs up, ending the vision.


  8686RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Standing by the cabinet again, soup can in hand.  He looks
          over at Thaddeus, still drawing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He didn't think you'd understand,
                        much less follow him.  D'you take
                        the bus?

          Once again Thaddeus shows no sign he's listening, intent
          on his drawing.  Johnny pours the soup into a pot that's
          been left on the stove.

                                        JOHNNY
                        People keep underestimating you,
                        don't they?  That's gonna be their
                        last mistake.

          He then turns on the gas.  A vision WHOOSH merges with
          the whoosh of the flame as it ignites.  Johnny FREEZES.


          CU ON THADDEUS'S PAD - VISION

          Quick glimpses of various characters and scenes as we
          hear the scratching of his felt tip, the sound exaggerated
          in the still moment.  Then --


          BACK TO JOHNNY'S HAND

          Frozen on the gas knob, as suddenly his perspective rockets



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 44.


    86CONTINUED:86

          into the stove, down a gas line, and then to a GAS METER
          outside of the house, where a man in a gas company uniform --
          whom we recognize as Kujo's THUG from the restaurant --
          is doing something to the gas line.

          Our view rockets back the way it came, as Johnny now
            unfreezes as he turns to Thaddeus.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus! 

          That's as far as he gets before the stove EXPLODES IN A
          MASSIVE FIREBALL, the flash whiting out the screen! 


  8787RESUME - JOHNNY AT THE STOVE

            Realizing it's all been a vision, and yet he's already
          turned on the gas and knows he has barely a second to
          act.  This time he just grabs Thaddeus, who screams as
          Johnny rushes out just as the room EXPLODES behind them!


  8888INT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - JOHNNY

          Is thrown to the floor, dazed, as flames pour out of the
          kitchen doorway.  Thaddeus pulls away from him, takes in
          the flames, then runs toward them, disappearing into the
          smoke that is already engulfing the house.

          Still dazed, Johnny clambers to his feet -- just as Bruce
          rushes in, helps him up.

                                        BRUCE
                        Thaddeus?!

          Johnny looks into the smoke, then rushes into it, Bruce
          following.


  8989INT. THADDEUS'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Thaddeus is wrestling with his boxes of comics, trying to
          save them as smoke pours into the room.  Johnny grabs
          him, causing the boy to scream again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Leave them!  We gotta get out!

          But the boy holds onto the boxes for dear life.  Bruce
          grabs them.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 45.

                        It's okay, I got 'em!

          With Johnny holding onto the screaming Thaddeus, and Bruce
          holding the boxes, they rush out of the room.


  9090EXT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny, Thaddeus and Bruce make it to the lawn just as
          the whole house goes, knocking them all down again, then
          raining cinders around them.  Off Johnny as he looks back
          at the burning house, sirens starting to sound in the
          distance...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  9191EXT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY

          Or what was a house.  Just blackened ruins now, a crew of
          firemen dousing the embers.  All as seen through the
          viewfinder of a NEWS VIDEO CAMERA as we pan across the
          scene, meanwhile hearing:

                                        FEMALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        With less than 24 hours until his
                          scheduled execution, a fire has
                          destroyed Ryan Fallon's former
                        home, now occupied by his sister
                        and her family.

          The viewfinder finds the reporter doing her stand-up.  In
          the background, Callie's twins start jumping around and
          mugging at the camera.

                                        FEMALE REPORTER
                          Fortunately, no one was harmed. 
                        No word on the cause of the blaze,
                        but --

                                        CAMERA MAN (O.S.)
                        Crap!

          He's just caught the twins mooning him (sufficiently out
          of focus, though we get the idea).  As the videocam comes
          off his shoulder, revealing him --

                                        CAMERA MAN
                        Those kids screwed up the take
                        again.

                                        FEMALE REPORTER
                        That's it.  We're out of here.

          They start toward their TRUCK, as the giggling boys scamper
          past them, more excited than dismayed by the whole scene.

          Not so their mom, whom camera finds next on the sidewalk,
          being consoled by NEIGHBORS.  She sees a car pull up, a
          man in a suit get out.

                                        CALLIE
                        The insurance agent.  Finally. 
                        Now I can move to a decent
                          neighborhood.

          Her neighbors react, stung, as camera pulls back again to
          find Johnny, Bruce and Stanton watching a short distance.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 47.

                        She seems to be taking things in
                        stride, considering.

                        Callie always lands on her feet.

          Bruce watches Thaddeus, who's carefully checking through
          his boxes of comics.

                                        BRUCE
                        Least Thad saved his drawings.

                        You should have seen him... he
                        was willing to die to get them
                        out.

                                        STANTON
                        You're lucky you both didn't cook. 
                        You get another vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.

          At which point, Lieutenant Dobbs approaches.

                                        DOBBS
                        Fire Marshal's calling it an
                          accident.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw one of Kujo's thugs messing
                        with the gas line.

                                        DOBBS
                        What you claim to see in your
                        head doesn't interest me.

                                        STANTON
                          Lieutenant, I had my doubts, but
                        what if Kujo is coming for the
                        kid?  If he set Fallon up, that'd
                        be his play.

          Dobbs controls his irritation.

                                        DOBBS
                        Have a uniform babysit the kid
                        for the next 24 hours.  If you
                        want to help Fallon, get me some
                        hard evidence.

          The Fire Marshal signals him.  He moves off.

                                        STANTON
                        He's right.  We're just spinnin'
                        our wheels, and the clock keeps
                          ticking.

          He gets a call on his cell (the ring is NOT the one
          Thaddeus heard), steps away to take it.  Johnny seems to
          consider him for a moment, then takes out his own phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who you calling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy.  He's got political
                          connections.  Maybe he can twist
                        an arm or two. 
                                (re: phone)
                        Damn.  Battery's dead.

          He turns to Stanton, who's just finished his call.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay if borrow yours?

          Stanton hesitates for the briefest of seconds, then hands
          it over with a smile.

                                        STANTON
                        Don't use up my minutes.

          As Johnny takes the phone we may hear a small WHOOSH, but
          then he quickly dials his number, listens.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Johnny Smith.  Is he
                        available?  I see.  No, I'll try
                        back later.

          As he speaks, his gaze falls on Thaddeus, who's
            methodically inventorying and reordering his comics. 
          Johnny hands the phone back to Stanton, moves to the boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus, can I take a look at
                        your drawing pad again?

          Thaddeus hands over his pad.  Johnny opens it, shows it
          to Stanton and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The stories are all based on his
                        life.  See this one?

          He points to an image of the Wizard, holding Finn's hand,
          as they pick their way through a plain of sleeping dragons.

                        That was today, at the train yard. 
                        I was leading Thad past these old
                        freight cars.

                                        BRUCE
                          "Sleeping dragons."

                        What's your point?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's an allegory.  A way Thaddeus
                        records his experience.  And he's
                        been doing it for years, including
                        the night his father was arrested.

                                        BRUCE
                        A kind of "witness testimony."

          Johnny eyes Thaddeus, who's seemingly paying them no mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If we can match the story to the
                        event.  We have to go back to the
                        train yard.

                                        STANTON
                          Dragons?  Comic books?  You guys
                        realize how this sounds?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got a better idea, I'm all
                        ears.

          Off Stanton, far from convinced...


  9292EXT. RAIL YARD - NIGHT

          Dark.  Spooky.  Looking very much as it did in Johnny's
          visions of the original shooting.

          Finding Johnny, Bruce and Stanton standing alongside a
          flatbed rail car.  Pages of Thaddeus's comics are spread
          out, weighted down with stones from the track bed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all right here.  All we had
                        to do was see it.

          Using a flashlight as a pointer, Johnny indicates a drawing
          that shows young Finn slipping out of a tree house.

            A bedroom door cracks open and we see Callie trying to
          separate the fighting twins while a TV blares.  A POLICE
          WOMAN has been dragooned into helping.  The door closes,
          then our POV crosses to a window, pulling aside shades to
          look out to a balcony.

          Johnny's flashlight now illuminating another drawing,

                        In or out, child?  I ain't got
                        all night.

          (Note: while Johnny is describing what happened in the
          past, what we're seeing is the past repeating itself: 
          Thaddeus slipping away and making his way to the rail
          yard in the present.)

          Johnny indicates another drawing:  a view of a forbidding

                        Which brings us right here.

          His flashlight illuminates a final drawing:  A demon with
          a bloody sword standing over an unconscious man.

                                        BRUCE
                        A demon standing over an
                          unconscious guy, who looks a lot
                        like Thad's father.  Swap the
                        bloody sword for a smoking gun
                        and you've got a pretty accurate
                        picture of what he saw.

          Stanton has been looking on impatiently.

                                        STANTON
                        You really think these are going
                        to prove anything?

                        No.  But they could convince a
                        judge that Thaddeus was a witness,
                        that he saw something at odds
                        with the prosecution's version of
                        events.  And that could get Ryan
                          a reprieve.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hook Thaddeus up with a good child
                          psychologist, chances are he may
                        blow this thing wide open.

                        when I told you to.

          Johnny nods.  The picture more than clear now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You set Ryan up.  Killed that
                        agent and planted his gun.

                        Ryan was getting too dangerous. 
                        Just like you two.

          Bruce takes a step to the side.  Stanton swings his gun.

                        I'm not alone.

          And indeed, in a couple of quick cutaways we see:


          KUJO'S TWO THUGS

          Taking up positions about fifty yards away, one armed
          with a handgun, the other with a shotgun.

                        You're not going to kill us here,
                        too many questions.

                        You're right.  But I have other
                        places.  So many other places.

                        The kid can't talk.  And those
                        half-assed drawings are about to
                        disappear.  Problem solved.

                        You said Ryan was like a father
                        to you.

                        Ryan was "Old School."  He didn't
                        get it.

                        We play a sucker's game, while
                        guys like Kujo get rich.  I just
                        decided to take what I deserved.

                                (beat)
                        But you should never have handed
                        me your phone.  I told you: it
                        only takes one touch.

          And as he says this, we begin a quick series of flashbacks
          that fill in a vision we didn't see previously.


  9999EXT. THADDEUS'S HOUSE - DAY

          Post-fire, we see Johnny take Stanton's phone.  WHOOSH! 


  100100INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY - RECENT PAST - VISION

            Stanton's CELL PHONE rings at his desk.  A distinctive
          ring tone but not the ring.  As he picks it up, brings it
          to his ear...

                                        STANTON
                        Hey baby.

          And we MATCH, MOVE, MORPH off the phone to:          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/8/05 - GREEN 54.


  101101EXT. CITY STREET - DAY - ANOTHER PHONE (2004)

          Ringing in Stanton's hand.  Another distinctive ring tone,
          but again not the one.  We reveal he's walking briskly
          along a sidewalk as he answers.

                                        STANTON
                        I'm around the corner.  Order me
                          a Manhattan.

          And again we MATCH, MOVE, MORPH off the phone (and we may
          also do linked 360-degree spins around Stanton and the
          phones in this sequence, really have some fun with it) to -- 


  102102INT. STAKEOUT APARTMENT - DAY - ANOTHER PHONE (2002)

          Rings on a window sill.  Different ring tone but still
          not the one.  Stanton, manning a camera pointed out the
          window, answers. 

                                        STANTON
                        I told you not to call me on this

          This time we FLASH TO:


  103103EXT. RAIL YARD - NIGHT - (2000)

          CLOSE on a pair of shoes as they walk beside a freight
          car, crunching gravel.  They stop.  Then a cell phone
          rings -- the killer's ring tone -- and CAMERA does a
            Tarantinoesque swoop under the freight car to find Younger
          Thaddeus hiding, staring at the coins... then swings back
          out, follows a hand as it brings a classic Motorola flip
          phone up to a man's face.  Stanton's face.

                                        STANTON
                        It's done.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you think, Lieutenant? 
                        Hard enough?

          Stanton reacts as Dobbs steps out from between two freight
          cars, a gun held loosely at his side, a walkie-talkie in
          his other hand.

          Stanton looks around wildly.


          BUT KUJO'S THUGS...

          have already been grabbed by pairs of SWAT officers.


          RESUME

                                        DOBBS
                        It's over, Detective.

          But a noise now causes Stanton to turn -- and see Thaddeus
          standing a few feet away, watching them.  Just like he
          did five years ago, Thaddeus has made his way here out of
          concern for someone he cares about.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus!  No!

          But before the others can react, Stanton rushes over and
          grabs the boy, who screams and wriggles.  His gun to the
          boy's head, Stanton starts backing away.

                                        STANTON
                        Back off!  Everybody!  I'm gonna
                        walk out'a here now!

                                        DOBBS
                        And go where?

                                        STANTON
                        That's my problem. 
                                  (indicating Thad)
                        This is yours.

          Johnny's hand unconsciously touches the side of the
          flatcar.  WHOOSH! 


    105105CAMERA ZOOMS UP TO A DISTANT VANTAGE, RIGHT INTO THE
          SCOPE OF A SNIPER RIFLE, THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE BACK OF
            STANTON'S HEAD

                                        POLICE SNIPER'S VOICE
                                (to radio)
                          Nighthawk One.  I have a green
                        situation.  I repeat, the target
                        is green.

                                        SWAT COMMANDER'S VOICE
                        Take that green light, Nighthawk
                        One.

                                        POLICE SNIPER'S VOICE
                        Green light, out. 

          We hear a CRACK --          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/9/05 - GOLD 56.


  106106ZOOM BACK TO JOHNNY

          As we hear a sickening thud as the steel-jacketed round
          plows through Stanton's head, blood splattering toward
          Johnny before the bullet hits the flatbed near his hand
          with a SPARK.  The vision ends.


    107107RESUME

                                        JOHNNY
                        You won't make it, Detective. 
                        You're gonna die right here. 
                        I've already seen it.  Please. 
                        Let him go.

            Stanton's been around Johnny enough to believe him. 
          Finally, he lowers his gun and releases Thaddeus, who
            scrambles away, then huddles on the ground.

          As Dobbs quickly takes Stanton into custody, and Johnny
          and Bruce move to calm Thaddeus...


  108108EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  109109INT. PRISON MEETING ROOM - DAY

          Not the cell, a larger space.  Johnny and Bruce stand
          outside the doorway with Dobbs.  Through a window, we can
          see Ryan Fallon, in his prison jump suit, talking to Callie
          while Thaddeus draws at a card table.

                                        DOBBS
                        Kujo wasn't so squeaky clean after
                        all.  Stanton's testimony led us
                        to a stash in the burbs.  Enough
                        stuff there to put Boris away for
                        a long time.

                                        BRUCE
                        Ryan?

                          Governor granted his stay.  He
                        won't get out right away, but
                        he'll get out.
                                (beat)
                        Now if I can just keep the word
                          "psychic" out of my paperwork, I
                        may keep my job.

          He starts to walk away, then turns back.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 57.

                        Baiting that confession out of
                        Stanton was pretty gutsy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The real gutsy guy is in there.

          Johnny indicates Thaddeus.

          Dobbs nods and exits.  Johnny and Bruce step into the
          room just as Ryan takes a seat across from the boy.

                                        RYAN
                        Hey Thad.  How you doin', kid?

          Thaddeus keeps drawing, his eyes on his pad, seemingly
          oblivious.  Ryan takes a breath.

                                        RYAN
                        It's okay.  I'm the one who needs
                        to talk.  I'm sorry I never gave
                        you enough credit, didn't see
                        what a really terrific kid you
                        were.  My son.
                                (beat)
                        I won't make that mistake again.
                                (beat)
                        Thad.  I love you.  I truly do.

          Johnny and Bruce share a look, and Ryan lowers his head. 
          But he also knows now that connecting with a child like
          Thaddeus will require patience and time.  So what happens
          next is a shocker.

          The boy reaches out, tentatively and takes his father's
          hand.  Ryan looks up, sees that Thaddeus is pushing
            something across the table toward him with his other hand. 
          His gold shield.

          Ryan reacts, powerfully moved.  As are Johnny and Bruce. 
          Callie and the other kids just watch in stunned silence.

          Ryan puts his fingers on the other side of the badge,

          pushes it gently back toward Thaddeus.

                                        RYAN
                        You keep it.  You deserve it more
                        than I do.

          ON JOHNNY, reacting to this potent father-son moment. 
          And we sense his pain at something long missing from his
          own life.  So does Bruce.  He puts a hand on Johnny's
            shoulder.  Time to go.  But as they start to exit...

                                        RYAN
                        Mister Smith?  Mister Lewis?

          Johnny and Bruce turn to see Ryan standing by the table.

                                        RYAN
                        Thank you.

          But then another small miracle.  Thaddeus gets out of his
          chair, eyes downcast, and takes a few tentative steps
          toward Johnny.  And then he looks up, rushes the rest of
          the way, and wraps his arms around Johnny's waist.

          Both Johnny and Bruce are rocked.  Johnny gently puts a
          hand on the boys head, ruffles his hair.  Off the moment...

          We hear the SOUND of a galloping horse.

          As it gallops across a meadow.  TILT UP to reveal a tall
          rider, who looks very much like Ryan Fallon, with Young
          Finn held in front of him.

          Camera PANS to another comic book panel:  Finn beams up

          Sitting on the floor between the bed and a wall as he
            sketches.  We hear the faint sound of a TV outside, but
          Thaddeus is lost in his own world.  A happier world than
          we found it.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
