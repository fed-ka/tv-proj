-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.
Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower
cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable
sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very
faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts,
we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible
now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the
steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure
and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT
POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.
Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding
a rifle and staring straight out.
The drum cadence has been building slightly.
CUT TO:
A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight
that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into
the distance.
SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.
The drum cadence continues, and we
CUT TO:
and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper
Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a
sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished
silver and brass.
The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds
before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.
As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from
various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game.
Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were
all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same
fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM
that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.
SUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C.
CUT TO:
HIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits.
CUT TO:
It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS
enter and exit and
CUT TO:
A WOMAN
as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.
The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early
30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency
to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her
JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...
JO
I'm requesting... I'm... Captain,
I'd like to request that I be the
attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like
to request that it be myself who is
assigned to represent --
(she stops)
"That it be myself who is assigned
to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's
confidence inspiring.
We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick
building which bears the seal of the
UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS
CUT TO:
THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB
His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE,
and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment
he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread
out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27
Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own
against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.
KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law
School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous
spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life,
passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.
KAFFEE
(calling out to the
team)
Alright, let's get two!
He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right
between his legs.
SECOND BASE
Sorry!
KAFFEE
Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.
Just look the ball into your glove.
He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel
of SHERBY's glove and into center field.
SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
Sorry!
KAFFEE
You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep
your eyes open, your chances of
catching the ball increase by a factor
of ten.
SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath,
walks up behind the backstop.
SPRADLING
Kaffee!
KAFFEE
Let's try it again.
SPRADLING
Kaffee!!
KAFFEE
(turning)
Dave. You seem upset and distraught.
SPRADLING
We were supposed to meet in your
office 15 minutes ago to talk about
the McDermott case. You're stalling
on this thing. Now we got this done
and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee,
I'll hang your boy from a fuckin'
yardarm.
KAFFEE
A yardarm?
(calling out)
Sherby, does the Navy still hang
people from yardarms?
SHERBY
(calling back)
I don't think so, Danny.
KAFFEE
(back to SPRADLING)
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy
hangs people from yardarms anymore.
(back to the field)
Let's go, let's get two!
He goes back to hitting fungoes.
SPRADLING
I'm gonna charge him with possession
and being under the influence while
on duty. Plead guilty and I'll
recommend 30 days in the brig with
loss of rank and pay.
KAFFEE
It was oregano, Dave, it was ten
dollars worth of oregano.
SPRADLING
Yeah, well your client thought it
was marijuana.
KAFFEE
My client's a moron, that's not
against the law.
Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Ow. That had to hurt.
(calling out)
Way to keep your head in the play,
Lester. Walk it off!
SPRADLING
I've got people to answer to just
like you, I'm gonna charge him.
KAFFEE
With what, possession of a condiment?
SPRADLING
Kaffee --
KAFFEE
Dave, I've tried to help you out of
this, but if you ask for tall time,
I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.
SPRADLING
You won't got it.
KAFFEE
I will get it. And if the MTD is
denied, I'll file a motion in liminee
seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling
in advance, and after that I'm gonna
file against pre-trial confinement,
and you're gonna spend an entire
summer going blind on paperwork
because a Signalman Second Class
bought and smoked a dime bag of
oregano.
SPRADLING
B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.
KAFFEE
C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted
duty.
SPRADLING
I don't know why I'm agreeing to
this.
KAFFEE
'Cause you have wisdom beyond your
years. Dave, can you play third base?
SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing
is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8
months. He had a rough time of it.
THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:
-- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.
It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A
SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him
to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get
back up and keep running, and
CUT TO:
-- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being
supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits
the mud every time down and
CUT TO:
-- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his
squad and
CUT TO:
-- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this
time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like
he's gonna pass out.
He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him
down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over
this, we HEAR
SANTIAGO (V.O.)
"...My name is PFC William T.
Santiago. I am a marine stationed at
Marine Barracks, Rifle Security
Company Windward, Second Platoon
Delta. I am writing to inform you of
my problems with my unit here in
Cuba and to ask for your help. I've
fallen out on runs before for several
reasons such as feeling dizzy or
nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen
back about 20 or 30 yards going down
a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant
grabbed me and pushed me down the
hill. Then I saw all black and the
last thing I remember is hitting the
deck. I was brought to the hospital
where I was told I just had heat
exhaustion and was explained to by
the doctor that my body has trouble
with the hot sun and I hyperventilate.
I ask you to help me. Please sir. I
just need to be transferred out of
RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T.
Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."
At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we
CUT TO:
It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An
M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans
and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive
through and we
CUT TO:
Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as
the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the
doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed
officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they
escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.
HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense,
controlled, and utterly professional.
LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's
happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.
DAWSON's his hero.
The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as
we'll be in Oz.
DOWNEY
Hal?
DAWSON doesn't say anything.
DOWNEY
(continuing)
Is this Washington, D.C.?
M.P.
Alright, let's move.
CUT TO:
SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
and KAFFEE's at it again.
KAFFEE
Alright, let's get tough out there!
JO walks up from behind the backstop.
JO
Excuse me.
KAFFEE
You want to suit up? We need all the
help we can get.
JO
No, thank you, I can't throw and
catch things.
KAFFEE
That's okay, neither can they.
JO
I wanted to talk to you about Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey.
KAFFEE
Say again?
JO
Dawson and Downey.
KAFFEE
(beat)
Those names sound like they should
mean something to me, but I'm just
not --
JO
Dawson! Downey! Your clients!
KAFFEE
The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and
Downey.
(beat)
Right.
(pause)
I've done something wrong again,
haven't I?
JO
I was wondering why two guys have
been in a jail cell since this morning
while their lawyer is outside hitting
a ball.
KAFFEE
We need the practice.
JO
That wasn't funny.
KAFFEE
It was a little funny.
JO
Lieutenant, would you feel very
insulted if I recommended to your
supervisor that he assign different
counsel?
KAFFEE
Why?
JO
I don't think you're fit to handle
this defense.
KAFFEE
You don't even know me. Ordinarily
it takes someone hours to discover
I'm not fit to handle a defense.
Jo just stares.
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Oh come on, that was damn funny.
Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of
confidentiality.
JO
I do know you. Daniel AlliStair
Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston
Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel
Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate
and Attorney General, of the United
States, died 1985. You went to Harvard
Law on a Navy scholarship, probably
because that's what your father wanted
you to do, and now you're just
treading water for the three years
you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps,
just kinda layin' low til you can
get out and get a real job. And if
that's the situation, that's fine, I
won't tell anyone. But my feeling is
that if this case is handled in the
same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian
Bazaar manner with which you seem to
handle everything else, something's
gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be
doing my job if I allowed Dawson and
Downey to spend any more time in
prison than absolutely necessary,
because their attorney had pre-
determined the path of least
resistance.
KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.
KAFFEE
Wow.
(beat)
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.
JO
I don't think your clients murdered
anybody.
KAFFEE
What are you basing this on?
JO
There was no intent.
KAFFEE
The doctor's report says that Santiago
died of asphyxiation brought on by
acute lactic acidosis, and that the
nature of the acidosis strongly
suggests poisoning.
(beat)
Now, I don't know what any of that
means, but it sounds pretty bad.
JO
Santiago died at one a.m. At three
the doctor was unable to determine
the cause of death, but two hours
later he said it was poison.
KAFFEE
Oh, now I see what you're saying.
It had to be Professor Plum in the
library with the candlestick.
JO
I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.
KAFFEE
Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania
Avenue. It's a big white house with
pillars in front.
JO
Thank you.
KAFFEE
I don't think you'll have much luck,
though. I was assigned by Division,
remember? Somebody over there thinks
I'm a good lawyer. So while I
appreciate your interest and admire
your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty
much handle things myself.
JO
Do you know what a code red is?
KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.
JO
(continuing)
What a pity.
CUT TO:
THE PARKING LOT - DUSK
It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.
We can see the flag being lowered in the background.
KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts
walking along with him.
JO
Hi there.
KAFFEE
Any luck getting me replaced?
JO
Is there anyone in this command that
you don't either drink or play
softball with?
KAFFEE
Commander --
JO
Listen, I came to make peace. We
started off on the wrong foot. What
do you say? Friends?
KAFFEE
Look, I don't --
JO
By the way, I brought Downey some
comic books he was asking for. The
kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't
know where he is, he doesn't even
know why he's been arrested.
KAFFEE
Commander --
JO
You can call me Joanne.
KAFFEE
Joanne --
JO
or Jo.
KAFFEE
Jo?
JO
Yes.
KAFFEE
Jo, if you ever speak to a client of
mine again without my permission,
I'll have you disbarred. Friends?
JO
I had authorization.
KAFFEE
From where?
JO
Downey's closest living relative,
Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's
side.
KAFFEE
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?
JO
I gave her a call like you asked.
Very nice woman, we talked for about
an hour.
KAFFEE
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.
JO
Perfectly within my province.
KAFFEE
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can
hold the trial there. I can sew the
costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober
can be the judge.
Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.
JO
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.
KAFFEE
And the hits just keep on comin'.
HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.
CUT TO:
KAFFEE IN HIS CAR
He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a
sidewalk newsstand.
He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and
runs up to the newsstand.
As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he
engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand
operator.
KAFFEE
How's it goin', Luther?
LUTHER
Another day, another dollar, captain.
KAFFEE
You gotta play 'em as they lay,
Luther.
LUTHER
What comes around, goes around, you
know what I'm sayin'.
KAFFEE
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
LUTHER
Hey, if you've got your health, you
got everything.
KAFFEE
Love makes the world go round. I'll
see you tomorrow, Luther.
And we
CUT TO:
The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy
Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac.
Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.
A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a
stair unit is brought up.
HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the
passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS,
a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and
SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.
KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in
Kansas anymore.
HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.
HOWARD
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg?
KAFFEE
(shouting)
Yeah.
JO
Commander Galloway.
HOWARD
I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to
escort you to the Windward side of
the base.
JO
Thank you.
HOWARD
I've got some camouflage jackets in
the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll
have to ask you both to put them on.
KAFFEE
Camouflage jackets?
HOWARD
Regulations, sir. We'll be riding
pretty close to the fenceline. The
Cubans see an officer wearing white,
they think it's someone they might
wanna take a shot at.
KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM.
KAFFEE
Good call, Sam.
CUT TO:
Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful
expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of
Guantanamo Bay.
HOWARD
(shouting)
We'll just hop on the ferry and be
over there in no time.
KAFFEE
(shouting)
Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?!
HOWARD
Yes sir, to get to the other side of
the bay.
KAFFEE
Nobody said anything about a boat.
HOWARD
(shouting)
Is there a problem, sir?
KAFFEE
(shouting)
No. No problem. I'm just not that
crazy about boats, that's all.
JO
(shouting)
Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the
Navy for cryin' out loud!
KAFFEE
(shouting)
Nobody likes her very much.
HOWARD
(shouting)
Yes sir.
The jeep drives on and we
CUT TO:
JESSEP, MARKINSON and KENDRICK are standing as the LAWYERS
are led in.
JESSEP
Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown.
KAFFEE
Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm
the attorney for Dawson and Downey.
This is Joanne Galloway, she's
observing and evaluating --
JO
(shaking hands)
Colonel.
JESSEP
Pleased to meet you, Commander.
KAFFEE
Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility
here whatsoever.
JESSEP
I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt.
Kendrick to join us.
MARKINSON
Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of
seeing your father once. I was a
teenager and he spoke at my high
school.
KAFFEE smiles and nods.
JESSEP
Lionel Kaffee?
KAFFEE
Yes sir.
JESSEP
Well what do you know. Son, this
man's dad once made a lot of enemies
down in your neck of the woods.
Jefferson vs. Madison County School
District. The folks down there said
a little black girl couldn't go to
an all white school, Lionel Kaffee
said we'll just see about that. How
the hell is your dad?
KAFFEE
He passed away seven years ago,
colonel.
JESSEP
(pause)
Well... don't I feel like the fuckin,
asshole.
KAFFEE
Not at all, sir.
JESSEP
Well, what can we do for you, Danny.
KAFFEE
Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid.
This is really a formality more than
anything else. The JAG Corps insists
that I interview all the relevant
witnesses.
JO
The JAG Corps can be demanding that
way.
JESSEP smiles.
JESSEP
Jonanthan'll take you out and show
you what you wanna see, then we can
all hook up for lunch, how does that
sound?
KAFFEE
Fine, sir.
CUT TO:
THE FENCELINE - DAY
A SQUAD OF MARINES jogs by as a jeep carrying KENDRICK and
the three LAWYERS cruises down the road.
We FOLLOW the jeep.
KAFFEE
I understand you had a meeting with
your men that afternoon.
KENDRICK
Yes.
KAFFEE
What'd you guys talk about?
KENDRICK
I told the men that there was an
informer among us. And that despite
any desire they might have to seek
retribution, Private Santiago was
not to be harmed in any way.
KAFFEE
What time was that meeting?
KENDRICK
Sixteen-hundred.
KAFFEE turns around and looks at SAM.
SAM
(leaning forward)
Four o'clock.
CUT TO:
As a plane touches down on the runway. It's dusk in Washington
and
CUT TO:
A little one-bedroom. Just the essential furniture, barely
even that.
KAFFEE's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. He's
holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his
favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble
keeping his mind in it. He's holding a baseball bat and
fiddling with it.
The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him.
His white uniform in a pile in the corner. There's a BUZZ at
the door. KAFFEE's not expecting anyone. He goes to the door.
KAFFEE
Who is it?
JO (O.S.)
It's me.
KAFFEE opens the door and JO walks in.
KAFFEE
I've really missed you, Jo. I was
just saying to myself, "It's been
almost three hours since I last saw --
"
JO
Markinson resigned his commission.
KAFFEE
(pause)
When?
JO
This afternoon. Sometime after we
left.
KAFFEE
I'll talk to him in the morning.
JO
I already tried, I can't find him.
KAFFEE
You tried? Joanne, you're coming
dangerously close to the textbook
definition of interfering with a
government investigation.
JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding.
JO
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.
KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read.
JO
(continuing)
Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like
she's known me for years. I suggested
that she might feel more comfortable
if I were directly involved with the
case. She had Louden sign the papers
about an hour ago.
KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then
finally...
KAFFEE
I suppose it's way too much to hope
that you're just making this up to
bother me.
JO
Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a
motion for separation, you're still
lead counsel.
KAFFEE hands her back the file.
KAFFEE
Splendid.
JO
I think Kendrick ordered the Code
Red.
(beat)
So do you.
CUT TO:
KAFFEE sits on a bench in the night. He takes a sip from a
bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag.
CUT TO:
A bright, sunny morning. The BAND is performing for a group
of day campers.
CUT TO:
KAFFEE'S CAR
as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district.
it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting
against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He
hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and
runs to the stand.
KAFFEE
Hey, Luther.
LUTHER
Admiral, how's the big case goin'?
KAFFEE
Nose to the grindstone.
LUTHER
No flies on you.
KAFFEE
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
LUTHER
Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat
lady sings.
KAFFEE
Ain't that the truth. Catch you
tomorrow.
He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger
seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does
-- a hand is slapped over his mouth --
VOICE (O.S.)
It's Matthew Markinson.
-- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin.
Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is
MARKINSON.
KAFFEE
Jesus fucking Christ!!--
MARKINSON
You left the door unlocked.
KAFFEE
Scared the shit outta me.
MARKINSON
Drive.
KAFFEE
Are you aware you're under subpoena?
MARKINSON
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives
of two marines are in your hands. If
there was something I could do about
that, I would, but since I can't,
all I can do is help you. Why don't
you drive, Lieutenant.
KAFFEE begins driving down the street.
KAFFEE
What do you know?
MARKINSON
I know everything.
KAFFEE
Was it a code red?
MARKINSON
Yes.
KAFFEE
Did Kendrick give the order?
MARKINSON
Yes.
KAFFEE
Did you witness it?
MARKINSON
I didn't need to --
KAFFEE
Did you witness it?!
MARKINSON
No.
KAFFEE
Then how do you know?
MARKINSON
I know.
KAFFEE
You know shit.
MARKINSON
He was never gonna be transferred
off the base.
And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of
the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He
turns to Markinson.
MARKINSON
(continuing)
Jessep was going to keep him on the
base. He said he wanted him trained.
KAFFEE
We've got the transfer order. It's
got your signature.
MARKINSON
I know. I signed it the morning you
arrived in Cuba. Six days after
Santiago died.
KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped.
KAFFEE
I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind
of immunity with the prosecutor. In
about four days, you're gonna appear
as a witness for the defense, and
you're gonna tell the court exactly
what you told me. Right now I'm gonna
check you into a motel, and we're
gonna start from the beginning.
MARKINSON
I don't want a deal. And I don't
want immunity.
KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.
MARKINSON
(continuing)
I want you to know, I'm proud neither
of what I've done nor what I'm doing.
KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we
CUT TO:
A SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in
front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside
the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next
to them and KAFFEE jumps out.
AGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE --
AGENT #1
Workin' late, lieutenant?
KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The
door opens and KAFFEE walks into
Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey.
KAFFEE
Private, I want you to tell us one
last time: Why did you go into Private
Santiago's room on the night of August
6th?
DOWNEY
A code red was ordered by my platoon
commander, Lt. Jonathan James
Kendrick.
KAFFEE
Thank you.
(to ROSS)
Your witness.
ROSS
Private, for the week of 2 August,
the switch log has you down at Post
39, is that correct?
DOWNEY
I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that
log pretty good.
ROSS
How far is it from Post 39 to the
Windward barracks?
DOWNEY
It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.
ROSS
About how far by jeep?
DOWNEY
About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.
ROSS
Have you ever had to walk it?
DOWNEY
Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The
Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what
we call the fella who drops us at
our posts and picks us up... also,
'cause he can get girls in New York
City -- the Pick-up Private got a
flat...
At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something
down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at
it:
"Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it
back to KAFFEE.
DOWNEY
(continuing)
...Right at 39. He pulled up and
blam! ...A blowout-with no spare.
The two of us had to double-time it
back to the barracks.
ROSS
And if it's ten or fifteen minutes
by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a
good hour by foot, am I right?
DOWNEY
Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat,
sir.
ROSS
Not bad. Now you say your assault on
Private Santiago was the result of
an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in
your barracks room at 16:20.
KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about
it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.
DOWNEY
Yes sir.
JO. Helpless. Panicked.
ROSS
But you just said that you didn't
make it back to Windward Barracks
until 16:45.
DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked
before.
DOWNEY
Sir?
ROSS
If you didn't make it back to your
barracks until 16:45, then how could
you be in your room at 16:20?
DOWNEY
(pause)
You see sir, there was a flat tire.
ROSS
Private, did you ever actually hear
Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?
KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing
he can do about it. And he knows it.
DOWNEY
(pause)
No, sir.
Jo leaps to her feet.
JO
Please the court, I'd like to request
a recess in order to confer with my
client.
ROSS
Why did you go into Santiago's room?
JO
The witness has rights.
ROSS
The witness has been read his rights,
commander.
DOWNEY
(confused)
Hal?
RANDOLPH
The question will be repeated.
ROSS
Why did you go into Santiago's room?
JO
Your honor --
DOWNEY
Hal?
ROSS
Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do
it?
Everyone is frozen.
ROSS
(continuing)
He did, didn't he? Dawson told you
to give Santiago a code red.
DOWNEY looks at DAWSON.
DOWNEY
Hal?
ROSS
Don't look at him.
DOWNEY
Hal?
DAWSON
Private. Answer the Lieutenant's
question.
The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never
seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this
with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right
thing.
DOWNEY
Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order
by my squad leader, Lance Corporal
Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine
Corps. And I followed it.
ROSS let's it hang. He looks over at KAFFEE. KAFFEE won't
meet his eyes.
JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing
her best not to fall apart.
TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's
CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down
alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window.
KAFFEE
Joanne.
JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with
her.
JO starts walking faster.
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Jo, we look ridiculous.
(to SAM)
Stop the car.
KAFFEE hops out and calls --
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Joanne.
JO keeps walking.
KAFFEE
(continuing)
I apologize. I was angry and... I'm
sorry about what I said.
But JO'S still walking.
KAFFEE
(continuing; calling)
I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand.
She stops. She turns around.
CUT TO:
KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is
practicing on the parade grounds.
JO
What do you say we take the rest of
the day off. Go out someplace. Sam?
Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?
SAM
Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home
and talk to my daughter. I think
she's gotta be bilingual by now.
And SAM heads off toward his car.
JO
So what's next for you?
KAFFEE
Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He
went to the movies on company time.
What about you?
JO
Me? Oh... you know... the usual.
KAFFEE
Just pretty much generally annoying
people?
JO
Yeah.
(pause)
So what do you say? How 'bout a
celebration?
KAFFEE
No. How 'bout a date. A real date.
Dinner. Attractive clothes. The works.
JO
Sounds good.
Who do you think I
should call?
KAFFEE
I'll pick you up at seven.
JO
What are you gonna do now?
KAFFEE
I'm gonna get started on Henry
Williamson.
(beat)
Stand my post for a while.
JO holds out her hand. KAFFEE shakes it. JO kisses him.
JO
Wear matching socks.
Jo splits off toward her building and KAFFEE keeps walking
toward the bleachers as we PULL BACK TO INCLUDE the almost
empty parade grounds and PULL BACK as to show the Washington
Navy Yard and PULL BACK and back and back and
FADE OUT.
