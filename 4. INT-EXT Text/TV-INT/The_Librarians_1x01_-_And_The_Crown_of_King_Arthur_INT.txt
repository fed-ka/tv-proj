      A dozen armed men keep watch. Two of them, ADEL and SAMI,
      work on a BLACK METAL CYLINDER with timers, etc. set inside
      a small DUFFEL. 

                                      BAIRD  (V.O.)
                    We do not know whether it's biologic,
                    chemical, or nuclear. Priority one
                    is retrieval of that package. Do not
                    damage it, or ...

                                                                                BACK TO:


      One ONE SIDE of the warehouse FLASHBANGS go off.  The
      terrorists whirl, begin FIRING as Beta team charges in and
      returns fire. 

      This allows Baird and Alpha to breach the other side, catching
      the terrorists in the crossfire.  Utter chaos breaks out. 
      Terrorists firing semi-autos.  Soldiers ducking, returning
      fire, yelling "TANGO DOWN" as terrorists fall.

      ON BAIRD as she and the Soldier from earlier advance.  A
      TERRORIST steps out with a handgun pointed at the Soldier.
      In one smooth move she pulls the Soldier back and speed-draws
      her side-arm.  The terrorist fires, splintering her helmet --
      she fires, dropping him. 

      Baird pulls off the ruined helmet.  Spots a group including
      Adel and Sami, carrying the DUFFEL, bolt out of the warehouse.  

                                      BAIRD
                    Package in motion! PACKAGE IS IN
                    MOTION!

      She gives chase with soldiers.


      Baird bursts through a side door.  The church is ancient,
      claustrophobic even under vaulted ceilings.  The two
      terrorists are halfway through the pews.  Baird charges in
      with her MP5 up.                                                                                        3.

                                      BAIRD
                    Freeze! Arretez, arretez! L chez vos
                    armes!

      Adel and Sami drop the Duffel.  Their AK's are slung on their
      backs, too awkward to fast draw.  Baird backs them away from
      the bag.  Their hands shift -- they so want to throw down.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    Just slide the weapon to the ground!

                                    ADEL
                    We surrender, lower your gun please --

                                      BAIRD
                    Slide your weapon to the ground!

      The Duffel BEEPS.  Whatever's in there lets out a high-pitched
      BEEP every ten seconds.  Adel and Sami exchange looks.  Before
      Baird can ask -- 

      KNOCK. KNOCK.  KNOCK.

      All three look around.  Now where is that coming from?  

      KNOCK. KNOCK. It's traveling under the floor of the church. 

                                      FLYNN  (O.S.)
                    No, that's not it.  Where's the
                      thirteenth skull?  It's always the
                      thirteenth skull.

      Baird, Adel and Sami look around, confused.  Then a HAMMERING
      sound from near the altar, a GRINDING as a TRAPDOOR opens in
      the floor of the Church.  A hand holding a dessicated SKULL
      pops out like a periscope.

                                      FLYNN  (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Hello?  Ah-hah.

      And up pops FLYNN CARSEN.  Even beyond his spelunking dirt,
      Flynn's not the same.  He's scruffier, his moods wilder.  

      Flynn takes in the Mexican stand-off and waves cheerfully.
      He pulls himself from the trapdoor, crosses to the ALTAR. 

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Don't mind me, you're obviously busy. 
                    I'm just here for the Opal of
                    Samarrah.

      Flynn pries the top off the altar, revealing a steampunk
      DOOR surrounded by STONE KEYS of NUMBERS AND LETTERS.  He
      talks absently as he fiddles with levers and keys.                                                                                        4.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Locked in a safe.  Which makes sense
                    as it is dangerous and valuable. 

                                    SAMI
                      Dangerous?

                                      FLYNN
                    And valuable, it summons demons but
                    doesn't control them, but that's
                      demonologists for you.  Careless and
                      homicidal.  Another common pair.

                                      BAIRD
                    Pair of --

                                      FLYNN
                      Adjectives, travel in pairs, dangerous
                    and valuable, sweet and spicy,
                    careless and homicidal.

                                      BAIRD
                    Whoever you are, stop touching --

      A sudden chunk of GEARS from the ALTAR.  Everyone stumbles
      as the church SHIFTS, dust falls from ancient timbers.

                                      FLYNN
                    Security system.  I think I have
                    about three minutes to disarm this
                    safe, or the church collapses on top
                    of us.
                          (another RUMBLE)
                    Which seems unnecessarily dramatic.

                                      BAIRD
                    Make it stop!

      Flynn doesn't look up from his work.  

                                      FLYNN
                    I would, but this a very complex
                      alphanumeric code based on Latin
                    Bible verses and it would be a lot
                    easier to concentrate if somebody
                    turned off that beeping nuclear bomb!

      Baird looks into the Duffel. A TIMER is running on the side
      of the black cylinder. 

      Everything happens at once.  Adel and Sami swing their rifles
      up.  Baird grabs the Duffel and sprints, running along the
      TOP of the pews, firing blind as they open up on her. 
      Everyone hits the ground, moving from cover to cover.                                                                                         5.

      Over by Flynn, BULLETS tear up the wall and altar.  Too
      distracted to notice, he reaches into the cabinet nearby and
      pulls out an INCENSE SMOKER and some BAPTISMAL OIL. 

      Baird and Flynn keep a running argument over the gunfight.

                                      BAIRD
                    How do I defuse this thing?

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course, Stations of the Cross!

                                      BAIRD
                    For the bomb?

                                      FLYNN
                    No the deathtrap.  The nuclear bomb's
                    much easier.  Black cylinder or round
                    like a soccer ball?

      Sami creeps toward Flynn, Adel rushes Baird.  Baird drags
      the bomb behind a pillar, shooting and yelling as she runs. 

                                      BAIRD
                    Black cylinder! 

                                      FLYNN
                    Pop open the side casing, see that
                    blue wire?

                                      BAIRD
                    Yes!

      She pulls the blue wire.

                                      FLYNN
                    Don't touch that blue wire.

                                      BAIRD
                    Start with "don't"!! START WITH
                    "DON'T"!

      She's moving again, trading fire with Adel.  Flynn waves the
      INCENSE BURNER, creating a thick FOG of smoke around him. 
      ON SAMI as he hesitates, trying to see what Flynn's up to.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course, Luke, so there are eight
                    stations of the Cross --

                                      BAIRD
                    Fourteen!

      Baird moves toward Flynn, trading fire with Adel.                                                                                         6.

                                      FLYNN
                    No, only eight in the Bible. 
                          (off trigger keys)
                    John, fourth Gospel, condemned to
                      execution, Book 19 Verse 16, then
                    carrying the Cross, the Latin numerals
                    four one nine one six one seven -  

      Flynn punches some keys. A PISTON rises from the altar, an
      ancient LOCK releasing within.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Hey, we're 33% less likely to die!

      Baird sees Sami rushing toward Flynn. 

                                      BAIRD
                    On your right!

      Without looking, Flynn SPILLS the baptismal oil all over the
      slick wooden floor.  Sami charges through the thick smoke,
      coughing -- and slips in the oil.  His head hits the floor
      like a sack of hammers.  Out cold.   

      Baird slides in beside Flynn as he continues to type.

                                      FLYNN
                    Simon and the women of Jerusalem,
                    which Gospel is that --

                                      BAIRD
                    That's Luke, the Gospel of Luke.

                                      FLYNN
                    Right. Three two three two six --
                          (as he types)
                    Silver cube, pull it out, that's the
                    primary detonator.

      Adel fires at them.  Baird fires back, pulls out the silver
      cube.  Another one of the ALTAR PISTONS rises, but CRACKS
      appear in the floor.  

                                      BAIRD
                    Still beeping.

                                      FLYNN
                    Bah, the church will collapse before
                    the bomb goes off.  Final disarm is
                    two two five six six.

                                      BAIRD
                    That you or me?                                                                                        7.

                                      FLYNN
                      Improbably, both of us.

      Flynn and Baird speak aloud as they type at the same time.

                                      FLYNN / BAIRD
                    Two two five six SIX.

      A STONE GRINDING ECHO and a long BEEP ... the final PISTON
      rises, and the bomb goes dark.  Then Adel swings around the
      end of the altar, AK-47 up.  

                                      FLYNN
                      Three-one.

                                      BAIRD
                      Three-one?

                                      FLYNN
                    Thirty rounds in an AK-47 magazine,
                    one in the chamber.  He fired thirty-
                    one shots, I never heard him reload.

      Adel pulls the trigger.  CLICK.  Baird hammers him with a
      right cross.  Then, as Baird stands over the fallen terrorist,
      a HISS escapes from the altar.  To her amazement a JEWEL
      rises, supported by black, writhing SMOKE.  The smoke forms
      small DEMONIC FIGURES snapping and screaming.  

      As if this were the sort of thing that happens every day,
      Flynn takes the Jewel and tucks it in his carry-all.  Blows
      the demon-smoke out like a birthday candle.

                                      BAIRD
                    What was ... How did you do ... how
                    did you know all that?

      Flynn grins.

                                      FLYNN
                    I'm the Librarian.

      Baird's SOLDIERS finally arrive.  She waves to them, turns
      back to Flynn ... and he's gone.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      CHARLENE is on the phone, distracted by other business.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Mr. Carsen is on his way back from
                      Minneapolis from a library sciences
                    seminar, but we have many other fine
                      librarians --

                                      SHEIR
                    Flynn Carsen was not in Minneapolis,
                    he was in Paris recovering the Opal
                    of Samarrah.  

      Charlene reacts.

                                      SHEIR (CONT'D)
                    And he's not a Librarian, he's the
                      Librarian. Now let me me talk to
                    him!


      Baird enters her apartment, flips on the lights.  "Stark"
      oversells the place.  Studio apartment, no art, books of
      military history on the shelves.  Furniture's all identical,
      grey, obviously bought at the same time.  QUICK CUTS of -- 

      -- her emptying her bag.  Everything's immediately hung in
      the closet full of other dark, workmanlike clothing.

      -- Baird goes to water a SMALL PLANT, still in its green
      temporary pot.  It's dead.                                                                                          10.

      She brings the plant to the garbage bin, opens the bin to
      reveal it's FULL OF IDENTICAL SMALL DEAD POTTED PLANTS.  

      -- Baird opens the fridge.  Empty but for a bottle of water. 
      Opens the freezer.  Empty.  Closes the freezer.  Opens the
      fridge, as if there might be a magic trick.  Opens the bottle
      of water, sniffs it.  Winces.  How does that go bad?


      Pan across some CANDLES, oh that's nice, getting a little
      relaxed atmosphere together ... 

      ... and never mind, there's her GLOCK 21 on the coffee table,
      and she's banging out PUSH-UPS on the floor next to it.

      A single WHITE ENVELOPE slides under her front door.  Still
      in the push-up, she raises an eyebrow.  Suddenly she's moving,
      gun in hand, crossing unhurried and precise to the door.

      She opens it.  No one.  Frowns, closes the door.

      Baird opens the envelope.  The paper within is also BLANK. 
      Both sides are blank.  

      Suddenly a GOLDEN LIGHT coalesces, inscribing handwriting on
      the paper: "COLONEL EVE BAIRD, YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO
      INTERVIEW FOR A PRESTIGIOUS POSITION --"

      Baird drops the paper to the floor.  What the hell?  She
      kneels, watches the rest of the words fill in: "-- AT THE
        METROPOLITAN PUBLIC LIBRARY." 

                                      BAIRD
                    Library?
                          (realizing)
                      Librarian.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Baird finds CHARLENE'S OFFICE.  Charlene looks up grumpily,
      rifles through her purse for money.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Oh for -- Flynn knows he shouldn't
                    be ordering delivery, this
                      organization is on a tight budget.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        11.

                                      CHARLENE (CONT'D)
                    But no, I'm the only one who cares
                    about the budget.

      Baird presents the white envelope.

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm Colonel Eve Baird, and I received --

      Charlene's jaw drops.  She examines Baird like a prize horse.

                                      CHARLENE
                    You got the white envelope!  I'm
                    Charlene, what are you?  Police,
                    spy, soldier?

                                      BAIRD
                    Last one please stop touching me.

                                      CHARLENE
                    I bet you're his new Guardian!  He'll
                    make a fuss, he hasn't had a Guardian
                    in years, but even he can't argue
                    with a white envelope.
                          (glee)
                    I have so many forms for you to fill
                    out!

      Charlene fills out a clipboard as she leads Baird to the
      BOOKCASE.

                                      BAIRD
                    What's a Guardian?

      Charlene pulls back the BOOK in the BOOKCASE revealing the
      ELEVATOR to the Library within.  She leads Baird inside. 

                                      CHARLENE
                    "What's a Guardian?"  Adorable.


      Baird reacts as the Elevator LURCHES downard.

                                      BAIRD
                    Very ... fast elevator

                                      CHARLENE
                    Name, "Eve Baird" got that,
                      Nationality "British" Married "No"
                    of course, why is that even on there --

      Baird's not paying attention.  The buttons show four floors. 
      She looks up to the floor indicator.  B1, B2, B3, B4, then
      jumping B10 B19 B24 B48 ...                                                                                         12.

                                      BAIRD
                    We're going down.  Very far down.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Oh, those.  That's more of a metaphor
                    than actual floor numbers.

      Judson is suddenly BEHIND them.

                                      JUDSON
                    Almost a meta-floor.

      He does his little laugh, frowns as Baird jumps back.

                                      BAIRD
                    What the hell?!

                                      JUDSON
                    Sounded funnier in my head I guess.

                                      BAIRD
                    Where did you come from?!  You were,
                    I was ... I want some answers NOW. 
                    Why are we leaving the Library?!

                                      JUDSON
                    The Library -- no, no, that's just
                    the entrance.  The real Library is
                    down here, where we keep all the
                    artifacts and magic too dangerous to
                    be left out in the world.

                                      BAIRD
                    There's no such thing as ...

      DING.  The doors open.  They all turn.  Baird's eyes go wide. 


      They walk onto the long walkways through the high-ceiling
      vault.  The Ark, the Nautilus, everything from THE JUDAS
      CHALICE is on display.  It's awe-inspiring.  

                                      BAIRD
                    ... as ... as magic.

                                      JUDSON
                    The Library is an ancient organization
                    dedicated to preserving knowledge,
                    defending the weak, and ensuring
                    magic never falls into the wrong
                    hands.

      Baird spins, soaking it in.  She's a hard-ass, but even she's
      stunned.  The music swells, the "awe" moment.                                                                                         13.

                                      BAIRD
                    Magic's real?  This is real?  

                                      CHARLENE
                    And you got a white envelope, an
                      invitation to the Library, which
                    means we need your expertise.

                                      BAIRD
                    But I don't know anything about
                    artifacts or magic.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Artifacts and magic, pfff, no, you're
                    here for the Librarian.

                                      BAIRD
                    I met someone who said he was a
                      Librarian.

                                      JUDSON
                    Yes, him.  Flynn Carsen.  He is the
                      Librarian.
                          (beat)
                    But I'm afraid he's broken.

      They pull her deeper into the Library.

                                                                                FADE OUT:                                                                                        14.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      The multi-level, cluttered area filled with maps and books. 
      There's a large CARD CATALOGUE in the corner.  By the card
      catalogue is a DRY ERASE BOARD covered with details of SHEIR'S
      DEATH.  Judson, Charlene and Baird walk into the space.

                                      JUDSON
                    Through the centuries, there's always --

      Flynn, SWORD in hand, FLIES backwards and SLIDES across one
      of the tables, scattering books.  He neatly rolls up into
      guard position as EXCALIBUR swoops down to FENCE him.  

                                      FLYNN
                    Really, 'Cal, a Desvio technique
                    against the Molinello Defense?! 
                    You're getting sloppy!

                                      BAIRD
                    -- the Librarian.

      Flynn and Excalibur REACT.  Excalibur crosses to menace Baird.

                                      CHARLENE
                      Excalibur, no!  She's here to help!

      Excalibur retreats to Flynn.  Flynn stalks forward.

                                      FLYNN
                    You.  What are you doing here?
                          (to Judson)
                    What is she doing here?

      Baird produces the white envelope.  Flynn's stunned into
      silence.  He snatches it, studies it as if checking a forgery.

                                      CHARLENE
                    I'll go finish your paperwork, let
                    you two get to know each other.

      Charlene exits.  As she does, Exaclibur floats back to Baird. 
      Baird reaches out to touch it, but Flynn, still examining
      the envelope, SMACKS her hand away.

                                      FLYNN
                    Don't.  Wounds caused by Excalibur
                    don't heal.  Magic. 
                          (to Excalibur)
                    'Cal, go on patrol, I'll meet you.                                                                                        15.

      Excalibur executes a "salute", zips off.  Flynn still won't
      look up from obsessively studying the invitation.

                                      BAIRD
                      Excalibur.  You call Excalibur "Cal".

                                      FLYNN
                    We're friends.  Best friends.

                                      BAIRD
                    You're mad.

                                      FLYNN
                    Maybe.  I didn't used to be, but now
                    I can't say for sure.
                          (to Judson)
                    What is this?

                                      BAIRD
                    Someone from the Library invited me
                    here.  Had to be one of you.

                                      FLYNN
                    No.  Not someone from the Library. 
                    The Library invited you.

      He and Judson make eye contact as he hands back the envelope. 

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    It's a mistake, she's not a Librarian,
                    she's a soldier.  Don't need a
                    soldier, don't need any help.

      Flynn stalks back off to the murder board.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Been doing this ten years, I know
                    what I need.

                                      JUDSON
                          (to Baird)
                    Ten years is almost the record. 
                    Most Librarians are dead by now.  

                                      FLYNN
                    Ten years ago I got a magic envelope,
                    just like the one you received.  

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      Flynn sits on the floor, books FALL around him.  He picks up
      an ENVELOPE.  Opens it, and GOLDEN WORDS appear ...

                                                                                BACK TO:                                                                                        16.


                                      JUDSON
                    But alone for the last five.  The
                    job's too stressful for just one
                    person to bear the burden.  That's
                    why every other Librarian had a
                    Guardian -- 

      Flynn claps Judson's shoulders, grins.  He's manic.

                                      FLYNN
                    I'm not alone!  I have you.  The
                      ever-steady, ever constant Judson.

                                      JUDSON
                    I won't be around forever, Flynn.

                                      FLYNN
                    Of course you will.
                          (whispered, to Baird)
                    He's two thousand years old.

      He crosses back to the board.  Ignores them.

                                      JUDSON
                    Maybe she's here to help you with
                    your murder.  You don't seem to be
                    solving it.

      Judson nods, enouraging her to move forward.  Baird crosses
      next to Flynn.  He glances at her, annoyed.

                                      BAIRD
                    I started in the police, before I
                    went into the Army.  Victim?

      Flynn stares ahead.  Not answering.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    That's fine, I can read, they do
                    teach soldiers to read.  "Professor
                    Jonas Sheir."  Professor of
                      Archeology, five PhD's, five's showing
                    off a bit, eh?  Place of death?  

                                      FLYNN
                          (reluctant)
                    Died on the stairs outside, on his
                    phone, insisting he had to meet me. 
                      Apparently had something he wanted
                    to show me, but that art print's all
                      I recovered from his files.                                                                                        17.

                                      BAIRD
                    I don't know that painting.

                                      FLYNN
                    Neither do I, which is vexing.  Oh,
                    I like that, haven't used that word,
                    in a while.  Vex.  Vexing.

                                      BAIRD
                    ... He came here to show you
                      something.  Here.  To your secret
                    Library. 

                                      FLYNN
                    The Library is very old and in certain
                    circles, archeologists, occultists,
                    there are rumors about its existence. 
                    I suppose Professor Sheir would've
                    heard them, but to deduce the
                    Library's real, never mind here --
                    smart man.

                                      BAIRD
                    Don't suppose you dropped one of
                    your little glowing envelopes by
                    mistake?

                                      FLYNN
                          (pause)
                    Not dropped.  Sent.  He was smart. 
                    Smart enough to be sent an envelope.

      Flynn suddenly bolts from the room.  Baird moves to follow.

                                      JUDSON
                    I think you'll make a fine Guardian.

                                      BAIRD
                    He doesn't seem to want one of those.

      Baird runs after Flynn.  Judson smiles sadly.  He checks an
      ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH.  Something in the dials does not make
      him happy ...


      Baird arrives as Flynn's tossing books off Charlene's shelves.
      Charlene's livid.

                                      FLYNN
                    How could you not know?  How could
                    Judson not know?!                                                                                        18.

                                      CHARLENE
                    We track thousands of possible
                      Librarians, we only assemble the
                    full list when there's a vacancy. 
                    Vacancies only occur on the death of
                    the current Librarian and you're not
                    dead.  Yet.

                                      BAIRD
                    Last vacancy was ten years ago, you
                    got an envelope --

                                      FLYNN
                    A lot of people got envelopes.  Only
                    one Librarian's chosen, but a lot of
                    smart people show up.  

      He SLAMS open a LEDGER.  Runs his finger down it.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Professor Jonas Sheir.  He was here,
                    he signed in the day I became the
                      Librarian.

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      Flynn passing the crowd in the hallway for his first meeting. 
      (NOTE: THIS IS NEW FOOTAGE).  As he nods to people in the
      line we SPOT Professor Sheir in the crowd, signing the ledger.

                                                                                  BACK TO

                    The day I became Librarian instead
                    of him.  What's the "C" next to his
                    name?

                                      CHARLENE
                      "Candidate".  In case of your death,
                    he's on the list of top Candidates
                    to replace you.
                          (off Flynn)
                    Nothing personal.

                    Dr. Abraham Thomas, physicist, has
                    an "C" next to his name --

      Baird's already got data up on her phone.                                                                                        19.

                    Dr. Abraham Thomas died in a car
                    accident last week.

                    Far Shariad, "C", Tehran University --

      Baird comes around, searching names as she reads ahead.

                                      BAIRD
                    Plane crash.  Professor Megan Mostow,
                    "C" died in an elevator accident,
                    these two "C"'s died of unknown
                    causes. 

                                      FLYNN
                    Everyone who could replace me is
                    dead.  Someone's killing the
                      Librarians.

                                      BAIRD
                    These three "Candidates" don't pop
                    death notices. 

                                      CHARLENE
                    They didn't sign in.   These three
                    never came for the interview.

                                      BAIRD
                    So they dropped to the bottom of the
                    kill list.  They could still be alive.

                                      FLYNN
                    First Candidate's contact address is
                    here in New York. 

      Flynn's got the names in his notebook, he's already moving.

                                      BAIRD
                    Where are you going?

                                      FLYNN
                    To save the last of the Librarians! 
                    Nice meeting you!

                                      BAIRD
                    "Nice meeting" -- Who do you think -- 
                          (to Charlene)
                    Who does he think he is?

      Baird races out after him.


      A COFFEE SHOP's to the side.  The young woman COFFEE SERVER,
      is sweetly serving hot chocolate to a crying little boy.

      BEHIND HER Flynn and Baird enter, Flynn checking his small
      notebook.  They cross to the NURSE behind the desk.

                                      FLYNN
                    Really, really work better alone.

                                      BAIRD
                    Why did every Librarian before you
                    have a partner?  Seems like a sound
                      operational structure.

                                      FLYNN
                    Tried it, didn't work.

                                      BAIRD
                    What happened?

      He turns on her, hard.  Spits it out.

                                      FLYNN
                    They left or died.  Dead or gone,
                    dead or gone.  Sometimes both.  
                          (glib again)
                    Now how do I find Cassandra Kapoor?

      Before they can proceed, an AMBULANCE CREW bursts in with an
      UNCONSCIOUS YOUNG WOMAN.  A DOCTOR shines LIGHT in her eyes,
      the NURSES check her out.

                    -- consider cortisone --

      As they try to roll the gurney away, the Coffee Server sticks
      her foot out, locking a wheel.  Everyone suddenly goes quiet.                                                                                         21.

                    It's not meningitis, it's psittacosis. 
                    The symptoms of psittacosis and
                      meaningococcus are similar, including
                    the sensitivity to light, but you're
                    ignoring the other factors.  The
                    other factors.

      That little repetition was odd.  Like she was swallowing it. 

                                      COFFEE SERVER (CONT'D)
                    That necklace has parrot feathers
                    she picked up off the ground --

                                      DOCTOR
                    She could've bought that.  Move.

                    It's homemade, the feathers are fading --

      At that we drop into her GIFT.  

      The room is SHIMMERING and all around her images, facts,
      equations scrawl into midair, multicolored, some strobing. 
      It's a total sensory overload.  As she speaks, the relvant,
      focused information grows BRIGHTER and LARGER and zips to
      directly in front of her.

                      nanometers -- 

      The Coffee Server's clenching her fist so hard her nails are
      cutting her palm. 

                                      FLYNN
                    No, she's right, 914 species of bird
                    native to North America, none of
                    them match that plumage color.  That's
                    an African parrot feather.

      Bair checks the PHOTOS on the Patient's phone.  Finds one of
      her AT THE ZOO.

                    Parrot Fever.  Let's go!

      The medical team moves off.  The Coffee Server stumbles into
      her COFFEE SHOP, Flynn and Baird behind her.                                                                                        22.

      The COFFEE SERVER slides down into a sitting position, eyes
      closed.  Flynn kneels by her.  Her Gift is still going strong,
      she's bombarded by images, numbers, notes ...

      Cassandra slows.  Opens her eyes.  Her Gift clears.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Sorry.  It'll stop in a second.  Oh,
                    I smell peanuts this time, not bad.

      Flynn squints, computing.

                    I was going to be cross with you for
                    assuming I don't know what a
                      synesthete is, but I don't know
                    actually know what a synesthete is.                                                                                        23.

                    No, I'm the Librarian.  Get your
                    coat.

                    If somebody's hunting these people,
                    you're risking their lives by not
                    accepting my help.  You cannot do
                    this alone.

      He considers Baird.  He's not happy about this, but ... he
      grudgingly rips off one of the pages, hands it to her.

                                      FLYNN
                    If I can't get rid of you, I might
                    as well make use of you.  We'll each
                    take one.  Be ready for anything.

      Russian museum Guards.                                                                                          24.

      EZEKIEL JONES (30's, quirky tech nomad) examines a GLASS
      CASE under which sits a JEWELED STATUE.  Ezekiel takes
      snapshots with his SMARTPHONE -- and subtly flips to a new
      set of icons on his phone. "WIFI CAMERAS" comes up, as does
      "VOICE ACTIVATION". 

                                      EZEKIEL
                          (whispered)
                    Wi-fi network access. 


      Bored Guards don't notice one of their computer screens
      tracking icons opening, files being highlighter.


      ON THE PHONE video files come up, slide into a photo editing
      software.  Ezekiel picks endpoints, drops the clip into a
      buffer.  Chooses "PLAY ON LOOP" then "SEND".


      The VIDEO FEED flickers as Ezekiel's room begins to LOOP.


      Ezekiel checks the patrolling Guards.  He snaps some photos,
      muttering to the phone with a frozen smile.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Access Alarms. Trigger Zone 3.

      ALARMS sound in the distance.  GUARDS run past the gallery
      room entrance.

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    Trigger Zone 5.

      More alarms.  The Guards and patrons run from this room. 
      The other Guards run in the opposite direction.  Chaos.

      Ezekiel, now alone, pulls off his belt.  He wraps it around
      the case where the glass meets the wood.  He takes out a
      PEN.  Where he touches the pen to the belt, SPARKS fly and
      the glass MELTS.

      He's too intent to see a GUARD sneaking up behind him.  But
      instead of accosting the thief, the Guard DROPS a BLADE from
      his sleeve.  He's about to gut Ezekiel -- 

      -- and Flynn COLD-COCKS him.  Ezekiel turns, sees the Guard.

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    Why does that Guard have a dagger?                                                                                        25.

                                      FLYNN
                    He's not a Guard.  He's here to kill
                    you, if you're Ezekiel Jones.

      Ezekiel turns back to work.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    I'm assuming you're not here to kill
                    me.  So if you watch my back for
                    fifteen more seconds, I'll give you
                    ten percent of the take.
                          (beat)
                    Wait, don't I know you?

                    Cairo?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Yes!  You were that crazy professor
                    who wanted the Gold Scarab at the
                    Cairo Museum!

                                      FLYNN
                      Librarian, not professor.  Flynn

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Hah, I stole that scarab right out
                    of the main display.

                                      FLYNN
                    I know, I was the one who had to
                    destroy the vengeful mummy.  This
                    will go horribly wrong, by the way.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Oh, are these jewels cursed too? 
                      Booga-booga.

                                      FLYNN
                    You looped the video.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Good, you're smart enough to be my
                    sidekick.  I'll call you "Kid Crime",
                    you can wear a cape and green shorts.

                                      FLYNN
                    Burning through the glass to avoid
                    the motion detectors.  Clever.
                          (beat)
                    Burning through the glass, in a room
                    with infrared detectors.                                                                                        26.

      A new ALARM sounds.  As Guards approach:

                                      EZEKIEL
                    My escape route's cut off.

                                      FLYNN
                    Mine's not.


      Flynn and Ezekiel drop into TUNNELS.  Above them Guards SHOUT.

                                      FLYNN
                    Royal Families do love their tunnels.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    What do you want?

                                      FLYNN
                    Come to New York, I'll tell you about
                    the people trying to kill you.

      Ezekiel sets off down the tunnel.  Flynn follows.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    "Kid Crime".  Not your sidekick.
                    You're my sidekick.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      The bar is loud with laughter, country music and ass-slapping.
      CURTIS STONE, late-30's, drinks with his buddies.  He's a
      working man just off his shift, handsome in a rough way. 
      His buddies AMOS and BRAD take turns losing to him at pool.

                                    AMOS
                    You on the pipeline Saturday?

                                      STONE
                    Yep, double shift, but Sunday after
                    church we'll go to Zeke's junkyard
                    find ourselves a '68 gearbox.  Tellin'
                    ya, he's got one ...

      They (ands everybody in the bar) stare as a stunning woman,
      LAMIA, walks in.  Tall, exotic ethnic mix, athletic.  She's
      wearing a top revealing at least one tattooed arm, a LONG
      LEATHER COAT slung over the other arm.                                                                                          27.

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    Dammmmn.

                                    AMOS
                    Weren't you just talkin' about church?

                                      STONE
                    Church shuts down if there's no sin
                    to forgive.  I'm just keeping the
                    Reverend in business.

                                    BRAD
                    Unh-huh.  You watch this, Curtis
                    Stone.  You watch the master.

      Brad crosses to the bar.  Stone and Amos chuckle, Stone
      sinking another ball.  

                                    AMOS
                    How's your daddy?

                                      STONE
                    Too sick to work, too stubborn to
                    die.

      For the first time he misses a shot.  Amos is too giddy at
      his opportunity to notice the quick look that darted across
      Stone's face.  Stone buries it as Brad returns.

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    So when's the date?  Who's best man,
                    me or Amos?

                                    BRAD
                    I think she's kinda crazy.

                                      STONE
                    'Cause she won't leave with you?
                    Half our damn high school must've
                    been insane then.

                                    BRAD
                    I mean, she won't even let you buy
                    her a drink unless you can explain
                    that weird tattoo.

      The guys nod, chatter about "crazy tourist girls".  But Stone
      throws Lamia a speculative look as he drains his beer.


      Stone sits next to Lamia.  He smiles, she smiles back.

                                      STONE
                    How about we get to know each other?                                                                                        28.

                                      LAMIA
                    I have very high standards.

                                      STONE
                    Well, hell, I'm so picky I won't
                    even talk to myself.  Nice tattoo.

                                      LAMIA
                    Tell me what it means, and I'll let
                    you buy me that drink.

                                      STONE
                          (squinting)
                    That looks like some kinda foreign
                    words there, I-talian or something.

      She turns away, bored.  Stone continues, his voice dropped
      low.  He doesn't want anybody else hearing:

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    Sanguine hebetantur aestu solvuntur,
                    et ubique Sola innocentia faciet --
                    "The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
                    and everywhere the ceremony of
                    innocence is drowned." That's Yeats,
                    the Second Coming, his poem about
                    the Apocalypse.

      Her eyes light up.  His finger traces the SERPENT tattoo. 

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    This is Quetzocoatl, Toltec
                      interpretation from the 12th Century --
                    that's their God of the Apocalypse,
                    and this snake biting its own tail,
                    most guys would think that's
                      Ouroborous, the Greek snake of
                    infinity --

                                      LAMIA
                    But you're not most guys.

                                      STONE
                    -- but yours is 10th century Norse
                      Jormungard, the Midgard Serpent who
                      represents, again, the apocalypse.
                          (grins)
                    What kinda girl walks around with
                    the end of the world on her arm?

                                      LAMIA
                    My name is "Lamia."
                          (beat)
                    And you must be Curtis Stone.                                                                                        29.

      Stone reacts she KICKS him away, reaches under her long coat
      for her KATANA.  Stone's struggling to his feet as she gets
      the blade half-cleared -- and STOPS as a HAND snags Lamia's
      wrist.  She turns to find Baird standing beside her.

                                      BAIRD
                    Sorry.  No.

      Baird HEADBUTTS Lamia.  Lamia staggers back, her sword
      skittering across the floor as Baird crosses to Stone's side. 
      He's already up in a bar-fighting stance.

                                      STONE
                    What the hell's going on?

                                      BAIRD
                    She's going to kill you.

      Baird draws her Glock.  But FROM OFF a small BOLO lashes out
      and SNAGS Baird's gun, snatching it away. 

      BANG WIDE to reveal several of the BAR PATRONS closing in,
      fists up and exotic KNIVES in their hands.  People are now
      officially freaking out, the bar panicking.

                                      STONE
                    And who the hell are they?

                                      BAIRD
                    Ninjas, possibly.

                                      STONE
                    In Oklahoma?

                                      BAIRD
                    That's what I said.

      Lamia charges Baird.  Baird doges the sword, grabs TWO BOTTLES
      from the speed rack.  Stick fighting against the sword,
      CLANGING like GLASS BELLS.

      The Assassins lunge at Stone.  He ducks, grabs a BAR STOOL,
      clobbers one, spins, traps another's hands, rolls onto the
      pool table.  He FIRES two cue balls at two Assassins, dropping
      them.  He switches to a pool cue, batting his opponents away.

      Baird and Stone are backed up against the front window.

                                      BAIRD (CONT'D)
                    Not bad for an amateur.

                                      STONE
                      Sweetheart, nothing amateur about my
                      barfightin'.                                                                                        30.


      Lamia and the Assassins advance.

                    But I do know the value of a tactical
                    retreat.


      Stone drives. Baird calls up a FILE on her phone.

                                      STONE
                    Mind explaining what that was about,

                    down.  But for the last twenty years
                    under a pseudonym you've been secretly
                    writing literature on European and

                    while working for an oil company
                    located five miles from the town
                    where you grew up.  Y'all.

      Stone just stares out the window.

      FADE IN:


      Stone, Ezekiel and Cassandra all wait in Charlene's office.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    -- with a cowboy and a coffee girl?

                                      STONE
                    You might want to apologize to the
                    little lady.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    "Little lady" is not actually an
                      improvement over "coffee girl."

      Flynn and Baird cross through.  Without a word, Flynn OPENS
      the BOOKCASE.  The Candidates REACT as he steps through.  

                                      BAIRD
                    We'll explain on the way down.

                      Hoooollllyyyy ...

                                      STONE
                    Magic's real.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes.

                                      STONE
                    Ark of the Covenant, Holy Grail.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes and yes.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Bigfoot and Dracula.                                                                                        32.

                                      FLYNN
                    Yes and no.  Yes, Bigfoot.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    So vampires aren't real. 

                                      FLYNN
                    Vampires are real, but Dracula's
                    not.  Anymore.  Because I killed
                    him.  Is this not helping?
                          (to Baird)
                    I don't feel like this is helping.


      As they enter Excalibur arrives to check them out.  The
      Candidates REACT.

                                      BAIRD
                    Don't worry, it's just Excalibur.

                                      FLYNN
                    "Just Excalibur."  You're getting
                    very comfortable.

      Flynn sorts through papers, the impatient professor who
      loathes having students in his office.

                                      STONE
                    If magic's real, why don't we see it
                    all the time?

      Flynn, sighs -- really, do I have time for this? -- takes a
      GLOBE from his desk.  He spins it, Harlem-Globetrotter style,
      then TOSSES it into the air.  It EXPANDS into a see-through
      GLOBE OF THE WORLD, crisscrossed by a NETWORK OF LINES.

                                      FLYNN
                    The world was once covered with magic. 
                    It travelled through this network of
                    power called ley lines, geo-magnetic
                    lines of force focused by rare
                    minerals in the earth.  Over the
                    centuries magic was drained off to
                    make powerful artifacts --

      As he talks, the power network throws off SPARKS, each spark
      leading to a hologrpahic image of an ITEM OF POWER.  The
      SPHINX, the ARK OF THE COVENANT, the HOLY GRAIL, STONEHENGE,
      EXCALIBUR.  As it does, the glowing network FADES.

      Excalibur zips up a bit, pokes at its hologram.                                                                                        33.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                          (to Excalibur)
                    Yeah, that's you, buddy.
                          (back to the group)
                    -- and faded as cities and technology
                    were built over the ley lines.

      BLACK STAINS appear on the GLOBE, greaking the circuits,
      even more of the POWER FADES, until it's just isolated SPOTS.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    Not much magic left.  My job is to
                    make sure what remains doesn't fall
                    into the wrong hands.

      The hologram collapses and the Globe lands in Flynn's hand.  

                                      BAIRD
                    Ten years ago, you all received an
                    envelope inviting you to apply for a
                    position here, in this secret Library. 
                    But you never came.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Ten years ago?  I was in the hospital --

                                      FLYNN
                    -- because of your tumor.

      Pause.  Everyone looks from Cassandra to Flynn.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    How'd you know?

                                      FLYNN
                      Synesthetes never have all five senses
                    involved.  You're experiencing full
                    on hallucinations, almost seizures,
                      indicating a frontal lobe anomaly,
                      Oligodendroglioma.  How big is it?

      Cassandra taps her right temple.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    About the size of a grape.  Which I
                    really wish they hadn't told me,
                    because I used to like grapes.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Damn, are you ...

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not yet.  Someday, and a lot sooner
                    than I'd like, but not yet.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        34.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    But I lived long enough to learn
                    magic is real.  And that's pretty
                    cool.

      She grins at Flynn.  There's a connection there, but he shuts
      it down, blows through it.  He's not ready.

                                      FLYNN
                    Stone, why didn't you come?

                                      STONE
                    Already had a job.  Family business.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    I just threw mine out.
                          (off them)
                    It was obviously a mistake.  I steal
                    stuff, been stealing stuff since I
                    was a kid.  I'm not going to get
                    invited to work at a Library. 

      Ezekiel crosses to a FULL LENGTH MIRROR. 

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    Hell, I still think this could be a
                    con.  Yeah.  Magic's real.
                          (to mirror)
                    "Mirror mirror on the wall, who's
                    the fairest of them all?" 

      Judson STEPS THROUGH the mirror.

                                      JUDSON
                    I always rather liked Angie
                      Dickinson. 

      Ezekiel takes Cassandra's bag, hyperventilates into it. 

                                      FLYNN
                    Stone -- the cowboy one -- said the
                    woman who tried to kill him had a
                    snake tattoo.

                                      JUDSON
                    The Serpent Brotherhood.  
                          (to the others)
                    An ancient cult that wants to bring
                    magic back to the entire world.  One
                    of our oldest enemies.

                                      STONE
                    So these Serpent Brotherhood ninjas
                    are the fellas want us dead.                                                                                        35.

                                      FLYNN
                    Ninjas?  No, the Brotherhood uses
                      Assassins.  Who said ninjas?  In
                    Oklahoma?  That would be ridiculous.

      Baird side-eyes him, plows on.

                                      BAIRD
                    But why now?  What did Professor
                    Sheir find that pushed the Serpent
                      Brotherhood to kill him, then murder
                    their way down the list?

      Stone's staring at the murder board.

                                      STONE
                    Got something to do with this
                      painting,"The Crown of King Arthur"?

      A SMASH startles them. Judson's grabbed the table for support. 
      Concerned, Flynn crosses to him. 

                                      FLYNN
                    Judson?  Judson, what's wrong?

                                      JUDSON
                    The Crown of King Arthur.  Crafted
                    by Merlin to give Arthur control
                    over the magic he needed to build
                    Camelot.  An incredibly powerful
                    artifact.  Lost for centuries. 

                                      BAIRD
                    If the Serpent Brotherhood wants to
                    bring back magic, they'd need that
                    Crown.
                          (beat)
                    I can't believe I just said that
                    with a straight face.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Why is bringing magic back bad?
                          (off them)
                    What part of "magic is cool" are we
                    unclear on?  

                                      FLYNN
                    The part where nations at war drown
                    each other with tidal waves of blood,
                    or rain diseased frogs from the sky,
                    or use mind control slugs or flying
                    serpents.  Magic, properly used, can
                    be good.  But a world of wild magic? 
                    Suffering and chaos.                                                                                         36.

      Flynn's shrugging into his jacket, pulling on his bag. 
      Leaving the rest of them behind, obviously.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    If the Serpent Brotherhood wants
                    that Crown I need to get to it first. 
                    The painting's a clue, I'll start
                    there.

                                      STONE
                    This painting's called "The Crown of
                    King Arthur." Very minor piece,
                    unknown artist, I don't even remember
                    what museum --

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Munich Museum of History and Art.  I
                    cased it for a heist last month,
                    memorized the inventory. 

                                      CASSANDRA
                    There's a flight to Munich --
                          (thinking)
                    -- three flights to Munich out of
                    JFK at 6:00, 7:15 and 10:45.

                                      BAIRD
                    ... Oh my God, there's four of you.

                                      FLYNN
                    There's one of me.  I'm the Librarian. 
                    They're specialists.  
                          (off Stone)
                    He's only history and art --
                          (off Cassandra)
                    She's only sciences and maths --
                          (off Ezekiel)
                    -- and he, I don't even know why
                    he's here.  We don't need a thief. 
                    No, they're staying here.  Tucked
                    away, nice and safe.  I work alone.

                                      JUDSON
                    This is an ancient secret Library,
                    not a motel.  I don't want them
                    touching the artifacts.  Take them
                    with you.

                                      FLYNN
                    No.

      Flynn and Judson stare down for a second.                                                                                        37.

                                      BAIRD
                    You know what?  I got an envelope. 
                    The Library invited me to this party,
                    and I'm taking them Munich.  Maybe
                    we'll see you there.
                          (close, to Flynn)
                    Do try to keep up.

      Baird leads them out, excited.  Flynn turns back to Judson.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hey, you're okay, right?  Because,
                    I've gotten pretty used to you.  The
                    enigmatic clues, the little white
                    lies, sending me on suicide missions
                    without telling me ...

                                      JUDSON
                    It is a very good relationship.  For
                    me, anyway.

      Flynn swallows a smile.  Tries to speak, but eventually just
      pats Judson on the shoulder and exits.

      Judson's Pocket Watch DINGS.  He checks it, nods.  Then he
      pulls from one of the book piles an ANCIENT TOME.  When he
      opens it, the language is unreadable -- until he passes his
      hand over it and it TURNS to ENGLISH. 

      The chapter heading reads: "THE CROWN OF KING ARTHUR -- and
      the PROPHECY OF THE LIBRARIAN."  

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Centuries old, open spaces and winding staircases.  Flynn
      and the others fast-walk along an upper walkway of the museum,
      looking down on the main floor.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Why are we looking for an old painting
                    of a British King in a German Museum?

                    Arthurian legends started in Wales

                    You are one weird cowboy.

      They arrive at the painting.  With the painting now full
      size, they can make out the details.  BARBARIANS fight more
      formally attired KNIGHTS, one Knight holding the Crown aloft.

                                      FLYNN
                    Hello.  What can you tell us?

      Baird glimpses over the balcony.  Double-takes.  LAMIA and
      four of her ASSASSINS in plainclothes enter the museum.

      ON LAMIA

                                      LAMIA
                    Split up.  Find the painting.

                    Flynn.  Flynn.

      Flynn's studying the painting.  Baird silently sets off.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    "Crown of King Arthur", artist
                    unknown, painted 1146 installed as
                    one of the original works in this
                    museum in 1546. 

                                      FLYNN
                    Look at the swords of the knights. 
                    Roman short swords.

                                      STONE
                    Arthur has the equipment of a Roman
                      Legionnaire.  If the painter had
                    firsthand knowledge of the Crown,
                    this confirms the Roman hypothesis. 
                    Arthur wasn't Celtic, but Roman. 

      Stone's too excited to cover.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Very.  Weird.  Cowboy.                                                                                        39.

                                      FLYNN
                    Theory is, when the Roman Empire
                    fell, some Romans Legions stationed
                    in Britain stayed and tried to
                    preserve what they'd built.  

                                      STONE
                    Camelot as a city, armored warriors,
                    it all fits.  Arthur was Roman. 
                    Only one problem.
                          (beat)
                    The painting's fake.


      Two Assassins enter an ELEVATOR.  Baird's inside, reading a
      MUSEUM PAMPHLET.  As the door CLOSES we see her CRUSH the
      throat of one man and KICK OUT the knee of the other.


                                      STONE
                    That blue's made from a dye called
                    carmine, discovered in the 1500's. 
                    Painting can't be as early as 1100's.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Also odd, it can't be moved.  This
                    frame's anchored into the beam. 
                    You'd have to demolish this wall to
                    move it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    One zero one one zero one zero --

      She points to MARKS in the frame.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    That frame you can't move, it's got
                    a binary code engraved into it.

      The Candidates ARGUE over who's discovery is more important.  

                                      FLYNN
                    Oh.  Oh no.  Baird, they're your -- 
                          (beat)
                    Where did she go?


      Lamia and two Assassins split up.  As soon as Lamia is gone,
      Baird comes around the corner.  The Assassins and Baird lock
      eyes.  She heads for an EXIT and they pursue, walking fast
      so they don't spook anyone else.                                                                                        40.


      The Candidates are still arguing.  Flynn rubs his forhead.

                                      FLYNN
                    Enough.  It's like listening to the
                    inside of my own head, but louder.
                          (to Stone)
                    We have a fake painting.  Why is it
                    fake?  Because it's meant as a
                    message, not art.  A message about
                    the Crown.
                          (to Ezekiel)
                    It's in a frame that can't be moved. 
                    That means the frame's location in
                    the museum is important.
                          (to Cassandra)
                    And that frame has as code in it

                                      CASSANDRA
                      A coordinate code, leading you to
                    ... somewhere.  But it requires a
                    key.  A reference point.

                                      FLYNN
                    A fixed point in space.
                          (she nods)
                    Like a painting that can't be moved.

      Beat.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The entire Museum's the key.  The
                      dimensions, the floors and rooms of
                    the museum relative to this painting
                    are the key to the code.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Leading where?

                                      FLYNN
                    Let's find out.


      WIDE to show as Flynn leads the Candidates in one direction,
      on the floor just below them Baird leads the Assassins in
      another, crossing directly beneath.


      Lamia finds the painting.  She turns to talk to her Assassins --
      wait, where are they?


      Lamia scans the woods below. Her cell rings. 

                                      LAMIA
                    Sir?

      INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH


      The team watches proudly as Flynn places the Crown onto a
      display.  Judson and Charlene stand off to one side.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Not bad for your first --

                                      FLYNN
                    Only.

                                      CHARLENE
                    -- time out.

                    What did Flynn do on his first time?

                                      FLYNN
                      I recovered the Spear of Destiny and
                    stopped extra-dimensional pyramid
                    energy from destroying the world.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (beat)
                    It is a very nice crown.

                    Now you're just patronizing me.

      Stone peers at the Crown.

                    There's an inscription on the inside.

                          (they turn)
                    I'm sure it's a Prophecy regarding
                    the Crown's final fate.

                                      FLYNN
                    My Latin/Gaelic hybrid's a bit rusty -

                                      STONE
                    I've got it.

      Stone scribbles it into a notebook he pulls right out of
      Flynn's vest.   Baird interrupts Flynn's objection.                                                                                        53.

                    Part of being a leader is letting
                    them run a bit.

                                      FLYNN
                    Leader?  I'm not -- I can't -- Let's
                    go figure out how to send all of you
                    home.

      Flynn leads them out.  Judson and Charlene gaze at the Crown.

                                      CHARLENE
                    I think Colonel Baird's sticking
                    around.  Although if she thinks she's
                    getting the same benefits package
                    she did in the Army --

                                      JUDSON
                    Charlene, you should go home early
                    tonight. 
                          (over her)
                    I want you to go home early tonight.
                    I want you to take time off.  I don't
                    think I let you know how much I
                      appreciate you.  All the work you've
                    done, the help you've been with Flynn. 
                    So please, take the night off.

      Charlene's touched, but doesn't quite know how to handle it.

                                      CHARLENE
                    Thank you, Judson.

                                      JUDSON
                    No, thank you, Charlene.  For
                      everything.

      She leaves,  Alone, Judson stares at the Crown.  Sighs. 
      Checks his Pocket Watch one last time.


      The group is gathered around the central area.  Stone's
      scrawling a mix of Latin and Gaelic on Flynn's whiteboard.

                                      BAIRD
                    So what next?

                                      FLYNN
                    You're looking at me?  I don't know
                    what I'm doing next, never mind you
                    people.
                          (to Stone)
                    They're transposing consonants, that's
                      "sepulcher" there.                                                                                        54.

                    You folks are a riot and all, but I
                    gotta head back to my job.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    You're job?  Digging.  Actually
                    digging holes.

                          (to Flynn)
                    After you got this job, I bet there
                    were plenty of times you wanted to
                    quit.  Maybe for family.  Maybe for
                    a woman.

                                      FLYNN
                    It was difficult to find somebody
                    who could understand this life.

      A quick glimpse between Flynn and Baird.  They look away.
      Stone returns to the translation.

                                      STONE
                    But you had a responsibility.  That's
                    what I got, responsibilities. 

                                      EZEKIEL
                    And a man has to have dreams.  "but
                    a man's reach should exceed his grasp,
                    Or what's a heaven for?" That's why
                    I reach for the impossible. 

                                      BAIRD
                    You mean other people's stuff.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    Hey, it's great you love digging
                    holes.  I have one talent in this
                    whole world, that's stealing.  I'm
                    not proud it's the only thing I'm
                    good at, but I'm damn proud I'm good
                    at it.  I'm great at it.

      Flynn reads Stone's translation.

                                      FLYNN

                    "When the Crown finds its final
                    resting place in the sepulcher of
                    Learning ..."

                    The Library, here?                                                                                        55.


                                      FLYNN
                    I think so.  "... Knowledge will
                    fall" no, that's not right, what
                    will fall?

                                      STONE
                          (muttered)
                    Bearer, bringer, carrier ...

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Flynn, how did you become the
                      Librarian? 

                                      FLYNN
                    The previous Librarian died. 

                                      CASSANDRA
                    So if we're the last Candidates,
                    does one of us become Librarian if
                    you die?

      They all stop, lost in the moment. POP TO EACH as they all
      consider that possibility.

                                      BAIRD
                    If it's Ezekiel, I'm going to shoot
                    him and hope someone better pops up.

      A BUZZ sounds.  Flynn crosses to the LARGE MIRROR.

                                      FLYNN
                    Perimeter alarm. 
                          (examining mirror)
                    I know we installed some security
                    after the last break-in.

      Flynn touches a point on the mirror and a SECURITY CAMERA
      VIEW of Charlene's office shimmers into view.  LAMIA and her
      ASSASSINS, in street clothes, enter Charlene's office.

      INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH


                                      LAMIA
                    Secure the exits, and kill the woman
                    who guards the door.

                                      ASSASSIN
                    There's no one here, Lamia.

                                      LAMIA
                    Odd, she's always ...
                          (then)
                    With me.                                                                                        56.

      They approach the Bookshelf.


                                      BAIRD
                    How long will it take to get past
                    the Bookcase?

                                      FLYNN
                    They can't.  It's not just a secret
                    door, it's an actual magical portal. 
                    They can't open it unless --


      Lamia grins as she pulls the Book, and the entrance OPENS.


                                      FLYNN
                    -- unless somebody disables the
                    security from in here! 

      They watch as Lamia leads the killers into the Library proper. 
      Flynn's already moving.

                                      FLYNN (CONT'D)
                    The Crown.  
                          (to Baird)
                    Split up, find Judson. I'll get the
                    Crown.

                                      BAIRD
                    I'm with you.

                                      FLYNN
                    No, save Judson!  I've got my own
                    backup.

      He WHISTLES.  Excalibur SNAPS into Flynn's hand.

                                      BAIRD
                    Can't argue with that.  Let's go.


      Stone searches among HIGH STACKS of books. 

                                      STONE
                    Mr. Judson!  Hello!

      He rounds a corner to find Ezekiel.

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    You following me?                                                                                        57.

                                      EZEKIEL
                    This place isn't exactly well-mapped,
                    and I heard your voice --

      Suddenly Stone SLAMS into Ezekiel, pining him to the stacks.

                                      EZEKIEL (CONT'D)
                    HEY!

                                      STONE
                    How'd they disable the Library's
                    security?
                          (no answer)
                    We got one person good at openin'
                    locks, and like you say, you're damn
                    good at it.  How'd Lamia get in here?

                                      EZEKIEL
                    I'm a thief not a traitor!  It's
                    probably you!  You carry a grudge
                    because you didn't get this job, got
                    stuck in your dead-end --

      Stone suddenly lets him go.

                                      STONE
                    Carrying, carrier ... of knowledge.
                          (then)
                    We have to find Flynn.   Now. 

      Stone sets off running, Ezekiel trailing.


      Flynn arrives, skids to a halt. The Crown is already gone.
      Before he can react, Lamia steps into view holding Cassandra's
      arm behind her back, her sword out.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Mr. Carsen.

                                      FLYNN
                      Cassandra, it's going to be okay.

      Flynn drops into a ready stance with Excalibur. It SINGS a
      high tone, a BLUE GLOW radiating along the blade.  Lamia
      tightens her grip on her own sword, grins ...


      Stone and Ezekiel hurtle throgh the stacks.

                                      STONE
                    The Prophecy.

                                      STONE (CONT'D)
                    "When the Crown is in the place of
                    knowledge - this Library - the bearer
                    of knowledge shall fall." 

                                      EZEKIEL
                    English, please.

                                      STONE
                    When the Crown is in the Library,
                    the Librarian, Flynn, will die.

      They round the next corner ... and find themselves face to
      face with five ASSASSINS.


                                      FLYNN
                    Lamia.  She's no threat, she's not a
                      Librarian.  Let her go, I'll let you
                    walk out of here with the Crown

                                      LAMIA
                      A tempting offer.  But one that has
                    already been made, and accepted.

      Cassandra reveals her hand.  She's holding the Crown.  

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'm so sorry, Mr. Carsen.  They
                    promised they can cure me.  That
                    only magic can cure me.

      Cassandra hands Lamis the crown.  Lamia dons it.  There's a
      FLASH of light, her eyes GLOW for a second, then it's gone. 

                                      FLYNN
                    They're the Serpent Brotherhood,
                      Cassandra.  Serpents lie.

      Flynn LUNGES with Excalibur.  He and Lamia exchange blows,
      blazingly fast.  

      Two ASSASSINS rush in to flank him, but Flynn expertly parries
      from either side, punching one away and kicking the other
      clean into the display.  He then parries Lamia again without
      missing a beat.

                                      LAMIA
                    I was hoping for the rematch.

                                      FLYNN
                    I brought a sword this time.                                                                                        59.

                                      LAMIA
                    Merlin forged this Crown so Arthur
                    could control his weapons of power. 
                    And the greatest of his weapons?

      Flynn swings again, but Lamia steps back and rises a hand.
      To Flynn's shock, Excalibur freezes in mid-air.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                    The magic sword Excalibur.

      She gestures.  Excalibur SNAPS from Flynn's grasp. It pivots
      and points at Flynn.

                                      FLYNN
                    'Cal, no.
                          (firm)
                      Excalibur, come here.

      Flynn reaches out.  To Lamia's shock, Excalibur pivots, handle
      drifting toward Flynn.  She reaches out, a battle of wills,
      Excalibur CRACKLING with energy between them.

                                      LAMIA
                    You're powerful.  More powerful than
                    they've told you.
                          (beat)
                    But not that powerful.

      With a flick of the wrist she SPINS Excalibur around, with a
      PUSH she sends the sword rocketing forward.  It STABS Flynn
      deeply in the side, then SNAPS back to Lamia's hands.

      Flynn collapses.  Cassandra starts forward but Lamia pulls
      her away.  She nods to the Assassins rising to their feet.

                                      LAMIA (CONT'D)
                          (off Excalibur)
                    Tell Galeas we have the Key.  We
                    shall open the Lock, and magic shall
                    return.  But first, kill him.

      She disappears into the stacks.  Flynn tries to rise but
      he's bleeding too badly.  He rolls onto his back, staring
      upward as the two Assassins raise their swords.  

      They step forward to strike ...

                                                                                FADE OUT:

      END OF PART ONE
