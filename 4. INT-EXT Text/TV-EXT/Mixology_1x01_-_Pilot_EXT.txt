      Tom s DAD throws his suitcase into his Trans Am and SQUEALS 
      away from Tom s home. On the stoop, 8 YEAR OLD TOM happily 
      waves, oblivious that his dad s clearly leaving forever. 
      Tom s MOM sits next to him, smoking quietly--


      THREE YEAR OLD MAYA toddles through her family s dilapidated 
      row house, crying about her broken PRINCESS ARIEL doll. She 
      reaches her father, who takes the mermaid and furiously whips 
      it against the wall, SHATTERING it! Maya silences--


      16 YEAR OLD MAYA, now a tomboy with a ridiculous mullet, 
      plays streetball with a bunch of TOUGH GUYS on a rundown 
      basketball court. She shoves, throws elbows...and sinks every 
      shot. Nearby, a TALL MAN watches her, impressed--                                                                                  15.



      ...she exits the bar and heads straight for Dan or Don as he 
      leans against the building, drunkenly texting, a sloppy, 
      untucked, dishevelled mess. She hands him the water. 

                                  DAN OR DON
                    Oh, thanks.
                          (drinks)
                    Your sister okay?

                                  JANEY
                          (no)
                    She really liked that clutch.

      The man frowns, right... Then he extends his hand.

                                  DAN OR DON 
                    Ron. 

                                  JANEY
                          (shaking his hand)
                    Jane. Janey. 

                                  RON 
                    I m really drunk Janey.

                                  JANEY
                    Yeah, no, I noticed.

      They LAUGH together... He glances over... She looks angelic 
      under the streetlight... Then he asks her the question men 
      have been asking women at bars since time immemorial: 

                                  RON

      She cocks her brow, intrigued... And, as Adele swells, we 

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
