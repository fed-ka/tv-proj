WADE WHITEHOUSE, driving, sits beside JILL, his daughter,
ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask.
WADE
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I
couldn't help it it's too late to go
trick-or-treating now. I couldn't
help it I had to stop at Penny's for
the costume. And you were hungry,
remember.
JILL
Who's fault is it then if it's not
yours? You're the one in charge,
Daddy.
WADE
(shakes cigarette
from pack)
Yeah.
JILL
Look. Those kids are still trick-or-
treating. They're still out.
Wade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette.
WADE
Those are the Hoyts.
JILL
I don't care. They're out.
WADE
Can't you see... look out there.
Nobody's got their porch lights on
anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt
kids are just out to get in trouble.
See, they put shaving cream all over
that mailbox there. They chopped
down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little
bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Wade grimaces, holds his jaw. The Fairlane swerves around
broken pumpkins under a caution light.
JILL
Why do they do that?
WADE
Do what?
JILL
You know.
WADE
Break stuff?
JILL
Yeah. It's stupid.
WADE
I guess they're stupid.
JILL
Did you do that when you were a kid?
WADE
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really
mean. Me and my pals, me and my
brothers. It was kind of funny then.
Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows.
Stuff like that.
JILL
Was it funny?
WADE
To us it was.
JILL
But it's not funny now.
WADE
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I
gotta listen to all the complaints
people make. I'm not a kid anymore.
You change.
JILL
I bet you did lots of bad things.
WADE
What are you talking about?
JILL
I just think you used to be bad.
WADE
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir.
Where do you get this stuff? From
your mother?
JILL
No. She doesn't talk about you
anymore.
Wade looks at her, wanting to lift her mask, see her face.
CUT TO:
Clowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit
room. Parents watch from the walls as GORDON LARIVIERE, a
beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat-top, announces the
costume contest. Wade nods to various townspeople.
LARIVIERE
We're looking for the funniest
costume! And the scariest! And the
most imaginative! And the best costume
of all!
WADE
(nudges Jill)
Got here just in time. Go ahead.
Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a
prize.
Jill steps forward, retreats. Wade looks at her flaxen hair,
her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume. His
heart aches he loves her so.
WADE
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you
still know.
JILL
I don't want to.
WADE
Why? Why not? You know these kids
from when you went to school here.
It hasn't been that long.
JILL
It's not that.
WADE
What then?
JILL
It's stupid.
WADE
It's fun.
JILL
(voice breaking)
I want to go home.
(Wade kneels down)
I don't like it here.
WADE
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't
mess this up anymore than it's already
been messed up. Join the other kids.
Do that and before you know it you'll
be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Wade inches her toward the circle of children. Gordon spots
them:
LARIVIERE
Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that
Jill? Come and join us.
Jill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children. A former
classmate calls her name. Wade, relieved, watches, then steps
outside for a smoke.
CUT TO:
On stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy
godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in
his mother's grip -- a hard loser.
Wade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the
losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall
leading to the restrooms.
Jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny,
forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her
before she had found a friend.
WADE
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight
of you. I had to step outside for a
smoke. You find anybody you know
here? There must be some kids you
used to know from school. You want
to go tomorrow? See your old teachers?
Be more fun than hanging out with me
all day.
JILL
No.
WADE
No what?
JILL
(lifts mask atop head)
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I
don't want to go to school here
tomorrow. I want to go home.
WADE
You are home. There are lots of kids
you still know here.
JILL
I don't want to be here. Don't worry,
I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want
to go home.
WADE
(sighs)
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what.
Tomorrow morning, you still want to
go home, I'll drive you down. I'll
get off work or something.
JILL
(pause)
I called Mommy.
WADE
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
JILL
Yes.
WADE
Jesus, why?
JILL
I... because I want to go home. She
said she'd come and get me.
WADE
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn
half hour drive each way. Why didn't
you talk to me about it first?
JILL
See, I knew you'd be mad.
WADE
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd
you tell her, for Christ sake?
JILL
I told her I wanted to come home.
Daddy, don't be mad at me.
WADE
Well, I guess I am. I planned this,
I planned all this, you know. I mean,
it's sort of pathetic, but I planned
it. You shouldn't have called your
mother.
(takes her arm)
C'mon, we're gonna call her before
she leaves.
CUT TO:
Jack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives
past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge. Jack
lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie
leans forward to hear the music.
JACK
Got a job first thing in the morning,
first day of season. Saturday I'll
hunt for myself. Twombley something. -
Er --
WADE
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official
from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
JACK
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a
full-blown asshole. Pay's good,
though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee
a kill, of course. Which I can do.
There's some monster bucks hiding
out up there.
WADE
How'd you get the job?
JACK
Gordon, he's always got some angle
working. He wants to keep Twombley
happy, I'm his boy.
Wade grimaces as he passes the joint back.
HETTIE
What's wrong with you?
WADE
Toothache.
(to Jack)
You should get close to him. Make
yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.
JACK
Like you and Gordon?
WADE
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get
along without me.
JACK
(laughs)
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you
quit him.
WADE
(laughs)
Right!
A car flashes past.
JACK
Bastard's got his high beams on.
WADE
(watching)
Shit.
HETTIE
What?
WADE
My ex-wife Lillian and her husband.
That was them in the Audi that just
passed us.
JACK
Audi's a good car.
HETTIE
What's she up here for?
WADE
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me
and Jill had a little argument. Jack,
I got to get back, get back to town.
Move this thing, will you? See if
you can get back to the Town Hall
before they get there, okay?
JACK
Piece of fucking cake.
Jack brakes, wheels the 4x4 around, heads back to town.
CUT TO:
6:40. A clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock.
Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy
teeth, shuts off the music. He looks out the window, grunts:
"Shit!" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch,
dials.
Wade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner
smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely
cleans up.
WADE
(on phone)
Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin?
(fumbles for cigarette)
Look, I was wondering, with the snow
and all, if you got school today?
(lights cigarette)
How the hell do I know? You're the
principal. All I'm supposed to do is
direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30.
(listens)
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just
now saw it was snowing, that's all.
My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow
all day. If I don't get over to
LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck
with the grader. I was just hoping
you'd have called school off.
(beat)
You check the weather bureau?
(acquiesces)
Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a
bit.
(hangs up)
CUT TO:
Wade, puffing a cigarette, passes ELAINE'S (LaRiviere
secretary) desk, her large red "No Smoking" sign, eases into
an office modum chair. He unzips his jacket, slaps his cap
against his thigh, spraying drops of melted snow.
Gordon LaRiviere, speaking on the phone past a glass
partition, calls to Wade:
LARIVIERE
Told you the snow was coming down.
Take the grader.
WADE
Where's the plow?
LARIVIERE
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting
with Evan Twombley.
WADE
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
LARIVIERE
(hangs up)
Huh?
WADE
At the school crossing. In his BMW.
Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna
bust his ass.
LARIVIERE
Don't go playing policeman.
WADE
What am I -- a security guard? You
hired me, you and your Selectman
friends.
LARIVIERE
You don't want the extra police pay?
WADE
I'm not saying that.
LARIVIERE
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's.
Don't let Lillian get to you. She
didn't belong here. That's why she
left.
WADE
Fuck you.
LARIVIERE
That's what I love about a small
town. You know everybody.
Wade exits toward the blue grader.
CUT TO:
Jimmy joins Wade at the bar, calls for a beer. Frankie LaCoy
bullshits with two long-haired locals at a nearby table;
their conversation drifts in and out. Country music plays
through a broken juke box speaker. Wade touches his tooth,
grimaces.
JIMMY
How's it goin?
WADE
Cold. How you think?
JIMMY
Sorry about that. Why's it every
year, come first snow, you get stuck
with the grader?
WADE
School. Traffic crossing.
(lights cigarette)
I gotta quit these things.
JIMMY
What we doing after? Wells?
(Wade nods)
Don't work too fast. Business the
way it is, Gordon's probably looking
to lay me off earlier than usual
this year. He's got too much money
as it is. Why's it always the little
guy that gets kicked in the butt in
hard times?
Wade shrugs. LaCoy's conversation has caught his ear. He
turns to watch.
LACOY
...That was no pisser. I'll tell you
who was a pisser. Glen Whitehouse.
There was a real pisser. He was mean
normal, but when he drank it was
like he burst on fire. Canadian Club.
Always drank CC. One Christmas there's
this cord of wood out back he forgot
about and he decides to have his two
boys stack it. Except it's been out
back two months and it's snowed and
rained and froze so now the wood's
all iced in. He takes the boys. He
was drunk, of course.
Wade's face as the story comes to life:
CUT TO:
LaCoy roars with laughter.
LONG-HAIRED LOCAL
(puzzled)
So what happened?
LACOY
Beats me. That's all I heard. Wade
would know more about it.
(calls)
Wade! We were just talking about
your Old Man. "What are you, a
quitter!"
Wade grabs his keys, walks over. Jimmy follows.
WADE
Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better
to do than sit around and tell
stories. Pity is, some college student
will come some day and believe this
shit cause you're the only one dumb
enough to talk to him. Take care.
Wade and Jimmy head out.
CUT TO:
The flashback continues: Glen Whitehouse pushes his sons
inside. Sally steps from sight. Out back, the firewood lies
frozen amid futile shovel marks.
POP
That was some job.
ROLFE
We'll work at it everyday, promise.
POP
I think we made the point.
WADE
(mumbles)
You just needed a drink.
Pop, swigging Canadian Club, turns:
POP
What was that?
(no answer)
You got something to say, say it!
Say it!
WADE
(soft)
Nothing.
POP
You no-good pup!
Rolfe runs from the room screaming, "Mom!"
CUT TO:
Wade, eating lunch at the counter, talks with Nick Wickham:
WADE
It don't look right.
NICK
What?
WADE
The sign. It looks like it's spelled
wrong or something.
NICK
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people
like you that keep this fucking town
from prospering. Whatever somebody
does to improve things around here,
you gotta find fault with it.
WADE
I'm not finding fault. It's a good
idea, good for you, good for the
town. Real modern too.
NICK
This town sucks.
WADE
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's
something wrong with "Home Made
Cooking", that's all. The sign's
fine. What it says is wrong.
Margie Fogg heads over, sits:
MARGIE
Who needs it? Everybody who comes
here has been coming for years so
what they need a sign for?
Nick goes back to work.
MARGIE
You okay?
WADE
Yeah.
MARGIE
I'm sorry about what I said.
WADE
Said what?
MARGIE
About you and Jill and needing a
third person. She went back to
Lillian?
WADE
Forget it.
MARGIE
(touches his arm)
I'm sorry.
WADE
I'm going to start one of those
custody suits. I don't give a fucking
shit. You know?
Wade's eyes well up.
MARGIE
You don't mean that.
WADE
Yeah. I mean that.
MARGIE
(arm around his
shoulders)
No you don't. You're pissed, that's
all. You ought to cool off for a few
days then have a long talk with
Lillian. You know? Work it out with
her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's
not out to get you.
WADE
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been
trying to nail me to a cross since
the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me
a fucking lawyer from Concord and
get this thing, this divorce thing,
rearranged. I've been thinking about
it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or
something. Nobody owns nobody,
especially not kids. And I pay her.
NICK
(calls)
Marg!
WADE
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can
cart Jill off and leave me alone
like this. I'm more than pissed,
Margie. I'm a whole lot more than
pissed. I been that plenty and I
know the difference. This is
different.
NICK
Marg! You got orders!
Wade and Margie stand. She wants to kiss him.
MARGIE
Call me.
WADE
(genuine)
Tonight. Let's get together.
MARGIE
Okay.
Wade meets Nick halfway to the door.
NICK
You talked to Jack?
WADE
Not since last night. He took a guy
hunting.
NICK
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!
That's what it sounds like. Not on
purpose. I assume accidental.
WADE
(shocked)
Jack?
NICK
The other guy.
WADE
Where... how'd you hear that?
NICK
CB. Little while ago. One of the
boys on the way in picked up Jack on
the CB calling for state troopers. I
figured you'd know what really
happened. The fucking guy kill
himself? This Twombley, who the fuck
is he, anyhow?
WADE
No, I... I've been out on the grader
all morning. Twombley's summer people.
Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's.
It was his idea for Jack to take him
hunting.
(suddenly engaged)
I gotta go.
Margie steps over as Wade exits.
NICK
He don't care for you.
MARGIE
Stop being jealous.
CUT TO:
Gordon and Wade drive up the same road Jack took Twombley.
Wade fiddles with the CB. No use: static.
LARIVIERE
Fuck. Turn it off.
(Wade does)
All you heard was there was some
kinda accident?
WADE
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not
Jack. He's okay, I assume.
LARIVIERE
Fuck. You don't know how bad or
anything?
WADE
You mean Twombley?
LARIVIERE
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out
that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
LaRiviere grunts disapproval as Wade slips the butt out his
window.
WADE
He more than likely just shot himself
in the foot or something. That's
what usually happens.
LARIVIERE
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
WADE
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer
hunting instead of freezing my ass
on that fucking grader.
LARIVIERE
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he
can't drive the grader worth shit.
WADE
Like hell.
Ahead, they see flashing lights and cars. A white emergency
vehicle passes, jolting the pickup.
LARIVIERE
(frightened)
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I
bet that was Twombley.
WADE
You want me to follow them to
Littleton?
LARIVIERE
Let's get to the top and talk to
Jack first. He'll know what happened.
He fucking better. If this coulda
been avoided, I'll put that kid's
ass in a sling.
CUT TO:
Late. Wade Whitehouse, lying in bed with an icepack on his
cheek, talks on the phone:
WADE
Rolfe.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Wade?
WADE
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling
cause -- has there been anything on
TV in Boston about a hunting accident
with a guy named Twombley, Evan
Twombley?
ROLFE (O.S.)
There was something. It happened up
your way.
WADE
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was
with him. Maybe you do too. Jack
Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with
me. He's my best friend.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Wade, it's late. I know you're
probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed
reading. We got different habits.
WADE
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm
calling because I need you to listen.
You're supposed to be a smart guy.
You're a professor. I got this theory.
Jack says he didn't see Twombley
shot but he did.
CUT TO:
WADE
It'll come out Jack lied and the
kid'll get hung for it.
ROLFE (O.S.)
He was scheduled to testify for a
committee investigating organized
crime in New England and the
construction business.
WADE
Who?
ROLFE (O.S.)
Twombley.
WADE
No shit.
ROLFE (O.S.)
You think Jack shot him?
WADE
Well, it was an accident.
ROLFE (O.S.)
They were out deer hunting, right?
Jack probably heard the gun go off,
then came back and found the body.
CUT TO:
Wade shifts the phone from ear to ear:
WADE
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Huh?
WADE
The night before the shooting.
ROLFE (O.S.)
How was she?
WADE
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to
visit for the weekend for Halloween.
She wanted to go home.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Who?
WADE
Jill. I was thinking of getting a
lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
ROLFE (O.S.)
What happened?
WADE
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer.
You know, 'cause of Jill.
CUT TO:
ROLFE (O.S.)
Don't think about it. You're
exhausted.
WADE
Yeah, I guess.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Get some sleep.
WADE
I get to feeling like a whipped dog
some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm
going to bite back. I swear it.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Haven't you already done a bit of
that?
WADE
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've
growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Sound of GUNSHOT.
CUT TO:
Wade and Margie, post-coital:
MARGIE
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.
More than most. But he'll be okay in
a few weeks.
WADE
There's something funny about that
shooting. There's lots funny about
it, actually.
MARGIE
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last
night and got in a fight with Hettie.
He drove off without her...
WADE
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't
happen the way Jack says it did.
MARGIE
...Jack's turned into one of those
men who are permanently angry. He
used to be a sweet kid, but it's
like, when he found out he couldn't
play ball anymore, he changed. Now
he's like everyone else.
WADE
I've been wondering if maybe Jack
shot Twombley, instead of Twombley
shooting himself. I've been wondering
maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
MARGIE
Wade! How can you even think such a
thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that,
shoot Twombley on purpose?
CUT TO:
WADE
Money.
MARGIE
Jack doesn't need money.
WADE
Everybody needs money. Except guys
like Twombley and that sonofabitch
son-in-law of his. People like that.
MARGIE
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides,
who would pay him?
WADE
Lots of people. Guy like Evan
Twombley, Boston union official,
probably got lots of people want to
see him dead. The Government's been
investigating his links with the
Mafia.
MARGIE
(laughs)
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
WADE
No, I just know Jack's lying about
what happened. He just seemed -- I
know that kid, what he's like inside.
He's a lot like I was at his age.
MARGIE
You wouldn't have done anything like
that, shot someone for money.
WADE
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd
given me half a damned excuse -- I
was pretty fucked up, you know.
MARGIE
(smiles)
But not now.
Wade sits on the edge of the bed, sighs. Lapses into thought.
Margie caresses his back, kisses it. He winces.
MARGIE
When you gonna get that tooth fixed?
Wade looks at her, brushes the hair off her face:
WADE
I can see what you looked like as a
kid.
MARGIE
You knew me as a kid.
WADE
Yeah, but never what you looked like.
Not really. Never really studied
your face, like now. I was never
able to see you as a kid when you
were a kid until now, this way.
MARGIE
What way?
WADE
After making love. I like it. It's
nice to see that in a grown-up person.
MARGIE
It's nice.
Wade walks naked to the kitchen, returns with two beers, one
for Marg. He gets in bed. She, thinking, sips:
MARGIE
Don't you think, do you still think
it's a good idea to press this custody
thing -- just now?
WADE
I'm her father -- supposed to be,
but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am.
It may be the only thing in my life
I've been so clear about wanting.
Even if it takes a big fight.
MARGIE
Then... I guess you have to.
WADE
(silence)
There's another thing I've been
thinking about. I don't know how you
feel about the idea, Margie, because
we've never talked about it. But
I've been thinking lately, I've been
thinking we should get married
sometime. You and me.
MARGIE
(uncertain)
Oh, Wade.
WADE
I've been thinking about it, that's
all.
MARGIE
You've been married twice --
WADE
It was to the same woman. I was just
a kid...
(Marg looks)
It's not like a marriage proposal or
anything, just a thought. Something
for you and me to talk about and
think about. You know?
MARGIE
Alright. I'll think about it.
WADE
Good.
He kisses her. His jaw winces in pain.
CUT TO:
THE FLASHBACK CONTINUES:
Glen Whitehouse, plastered, yells at Wade, age 13:
POP
I've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God,
have I got sons! Wade? Rolfe?
Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you
love your Pop? Of course you do!
Wade, frightened, retreats as Sally enters in her housecoat.
SALLY
Glen, stop --
POP
Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a
Goddamned good person! Capital G.
You are so much better than I am, I
who am no good at all, you who are a
truly good person, like a fucking
saint! Beyond fucking com-pare.
Glen reaches for the Canadian Club; Sally tries to block his
hand. Glen pulls his arm from hers, clipping her cheek with
the bottle.
Sally gasps, grabs her cheek.
Wade pushes between them, protecting his mother.
POP
My big boy bursting out of the seams
of his jeans!
Pop clenches his fist. Wade vainly looks Rolfe's direction
for help.
SALLY
Don't!
POP
You little prick!
Pop's fist comes crashing down. Wade raises his arms to
protect himself. Wade's arm bone CRACKS with the blow. Wade
grimaces in pain.
SALLY
Glen, stop!
CUT TO:
Wade, washed and changed, drives; Marg sits beside him. They
head north. Deer rifles echo from the woods.
MARGIE
Did you tell them?
(no answer)
That we were coming?
WADE
Don't you think it's proper for a
fella to introduce his girl to his
parents?
MARGIE
I know your parents.
WADE
I just want to pick up my divorce
papers. For the lawyer. It won't
take long.
CUT TO:
WADE
Pop, Pop, you okay?
Glen shuffles toward the stove; they follow. He starts a
fire.
WADE
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the
cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
POP
Sleeping.
WADE
You remember Margie Fogg?
POP
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like
some coffee?
WADE
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen
you in town for a while.
POP
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping.
You want me to get her?
WADE
Yeah.
Pop goes to the bedroom.
WADE
(to Marg)
Jesus. Nothing's changed around here.
Pop returns.
WADE
Where's Ma?
POP
She's coming.
MARGIE
Have you been heating the house? Not
just with the stove.
POP
There's a furnace.
MARGIE
You're not using it today?
POP
It's broke I guess. There's an
electric in the bedroom.
MARGIE
Maybe Wade should take a look at it.
Your pipes'll freeze.
(Pop nods)
Wade, would you do that?
Wade, concerned, pushes open the BEDROOM door:
WADE
Ma? It's Wade. Can I come in?
He steps inside. On the bed, Sally Whitehouse, wrapped in
blankets, lies dead. He walks over, beside the small electric
heater, touches her forehead. Her skin is chalk white.
WADE
Oh, Lord.
Margie steps into the doorway. Pop joins:
POP
Coffee's perked.
MARGIE
When did she die?
POP
Is...? She's dead then?
WADE
Yeah.
POP
I checked on her. She had the electric
heater. Cold don't bother her as
much as me. Which is why I give her
the heater.
WADE
(kneels over mother)
Is there something wrong with the
phone?
POP
In the living room.
WADE
Why didn't you call and have the
furnace fixed?
POP
Wade. I thought she was alright.
Till this morning she was.
Pop goes to the dresser, pours himself Canadian Club. Wade
opens his mother's mouth, attempts respiration.
POP
It makes me sad.
MARGIE
Can --?
POP
(sits)
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of
me. I shoulda froze.
CUT TO:
Friends and relatives gather in the living room: Wade, Rolfe,
Glen, LaRiviere, Margie, an aging couple, REVEREND DOUGHTY,
30, thin, wearing glasses and an avocado-green suit.
WADE
(finishing a beer)
Shouldn't we get this show on the
road, now that Rolfe's here?
No one moves. LaRiviere checks his watch. Wade shrugs:
WADE
Pointless to stand around in church
with nothing to do, I guess.
ROLFE
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing
her?
Margie's face tells Rolfe he's touched on a sensitive subject.
MARGIE
They'll be at the church and the
cemetery.
Wade opens the frig, takes out another beer:
WADE
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
ROLFE
No thanks. I don't drink.
WADE
Yeah. I forgot.
LARIVIERE
How you holding up, Wade?
WADE
I'm fine, fine.
LARIVIERE
You Rolfe?
(Rolfe nods)
I remember you from high school.
You're a teacher now? Harvard?
ROLFE
B.U.
LARIVIERE
I haven't seen you around. I don't
suppose there's much reason for you
to come this way.
Rev. Doughty calls for Glen Whitehouse, who has been sitting,
silent, drinking, to join the others:
REV. DOUGHTY
Come, Glen, join us. Let's kneel for
a moment of prayer before the service.
Wade? Rolfe?
ROLFE
Well...
Wade, expressionless, looks at Rolfe. Rolfe, embarrassed,
trying to do the right thing, helps his father kneel beside
Rev. Doughty. The others join the circle.
WADE
This is nuts.
MARGIE
(reproving)
Wade.
REV. DOUGHTY
Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts,
we come to Thee to beseech Thy
blessings and commend to You the
soul of our beloved wife and mother,
Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You
and walk with You --
Pop mutters something. Wade, Rolfe and Marg exchange glances.
He mutters louder:
POP
...goddamned hair on her head.
He rises over LaRiviere, turns, exclaims:
POP
Not a one of you is worth a goddamned
hair on that good woman's head!
Doughty freezes.
WADE
Pop! Don't do this now, Pop.
Pop knocks back a drink as the others stand.
LARIVIERE
Maybe I'll head on over to the church.
REV. DOUGHTY
This is a difficult time.
Gordon and the couple file out. Doughty, Glen, Rolfe, Wade
and Margie remain.
WADE
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
POP
(raising fists)
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no
big deal. Tell me how a single one
of you is worth a single hair on
that woman's head.
REV. DOUGHTY
Give up this demon.
POP
Go fuck yourself!
Wade, eyes blazing, squares off. Son to father.
ROLFE
Wade, just leave it.
POP
(mocking)
Listen to your little brother. 'Wade,
just leave it.' Candy-asses. All of
you. That's what I've got for
children. Candyasses. 'Wade, just
leave it.' Praise the Lord! 'Just
leave it!'
Wade stiffens. Pop cocks his fist. Marg, screaming, jumps
between them as Pop swings.
The old man bounces blows off Margie's arms and shoulders.
Wade pushes Marg aside, grabs his father in a bear hug and
walks him backwards, flat against the wall. Wade releases
him. Pop, frail, collapses to the floor. Wade kneels over
him:
WADE
If you ever touch her again, I'll
kill you. I swear it.
CUT TO:
Shafts of light filter through the ramshackle structure. A
snow drift nearly buries Glen's red truck. Wade and Rolfe
break away the packed snow.
ROLFE
What about Margie?
WADE
What about her?
ROLFE
Well, do you still plan to get
married?
WADE
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job
and stay out here with Pop. We can't
leave him alone here, he'll set the
damn place on fire. With Jill here a
lot, it'll be good to have Margie
around. Things are going to change
in that department, by the way. I
got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm
gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's
gonna break loose, but it's worth
it.
They finish clearing the snow. Wade gets in the truck, starts
the engine. Rolfe waits for Wade.
WADE
I want to let the gas run out. I
don't want the bastard driving drunk,
and he's always drunk now. After,
we'll hide the keys.
ROLFE
Anything new about the shooting?
Twombley?
WADE
(reluctant)
I guess it was an accident, like
everybody thinks.
ROLFE
Want to know what I think happened?
Wade opens the glove compartment, finds a bottle of Canadian
Club. He unscrews the cap.
WADE
Find them everywhere.
(swigs)
ROLFE
I think your first response to the
Twombley shooting was the correct
one.
WADE
Which is?
ROLFE
That it wasn't an accident.
WADE
Then who shot him?
ROLFE
Well, your friend, I think. Jack
Hewitt.
WADE
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
ROLFE
Money.
WADE
Who'd pay him that kind of money?
Not the mob. They got their own guys.
Specialists.
ROLFE
(agreeing)
They wouldn't deal with a guy like
Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley
is suddenly dead?
WADE
(swigs)
I don't know. You tell me.
ROLFE
Okay. It's likely there are people
in the union who don't want Twombley
to testify. They probably include
his son-in-law who's vice-president
and will probably be the next
president. I read that in the papers.
What's his name, Mel Gordon?
WADE
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told
you about. I did, didn't I?
ROLFE
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware
of illegal union loans or whatever,
starts nosing around cause of the
investigation and finds out. Finds
out his son-in-law is involved.
WADE
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a
professional hit. That'd make the
feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
ROLFE
A hunting accident is perfect.
WADE
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody
in the woods, you say it was an
accident, you get fined fifty bucks
and your hunting license lifted.
Jack's probably saying the guy shot
himself cause he ain't got his deer
yet and don't want his license pulled.
The truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys.
WADE
It's too neat. Things ain't that
neat. It makes me mad. That somebody
can pay to kill somebody, his own
father-in-law, and not be punished
for it. Don't that piss you off?
ROLFE
Not particularly.
WADE
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you
care what's right?
ROLFE
I care about what happened. The truth.
I'm a student of history, remember?
The sun is down. Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board.
ROLFE
I was thinking about that story you
told me, about Pop and chopping the
firewood out of the ice and after.
WADE
Yeah.
ROLFE
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't
think it happened.
WADE
Of course it happened. Why would I
lie about it?
ROLFE
It may have happened, but not the
way you said.
WADE
You think I wouldn't remember a thing
like that?
ROLFE
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I
heard about it. When I heard about
it, it was about Elbourne.
WADE
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam
to ask him.
ROLFE
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the
doctor and told him you fell from
the hay loft.
WADE
(laughs)
Well, I never heard that one.
ROLFE
I remember clearly cause when I heard
I became real careful around Pop. I
was a careful child and I became a
careful adult, but at least I wasn't
afflicted by that man's violence.
WADE
(laughs again)
That's what you think.
Rolfe looks out: the cobalt sky has turned black.
ROLFE
I gotta head back. It's a long drive.
They walk toward the house.
CUT TO:
J. BATTLE HAND, 60, sits in a wheel chair behind his desk.
Wade, uncomfortable in work clothes, tries not to show it.
WADE
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed
with everything she said. I wanted
her to like me. I just want to be a
good father.
HAND
It would help if you were married,
if there was someone at home while
you work.
WADE
I plan to. Soon.
HAND
How soon?
WADE
This spring.
HAND
Good. It would help if there were
some drug or alcohol abuse on the
part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems
upsetting to the child.
WADE
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
HAND
No, not exactly. I'll look at the
divorce decree, see if we can get it
redrawn. Interview your daughter.
Jill, right?
WADE
Yes.
HAND
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You
can mail it.
WADE
Jesus. How much... how much will the
whole thing cost?
HAND
Hard to say. If we go for custody,
depositions, psychiatric evaluations,
it could drag on. Ten or twelve
thousand dollars. She could win on
appeal. If we just want to get the
visitation rights redrawn, assuming
they're unduly restrictive, it
wouldn't be more than twenty-five
hundred.
WADE
Oh.
HAND
(sensing situation)
You might be better off legally as
well as financially to just go for
the --
WADE
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing
was just my getting back at her. I'm
not as dumb as I look. Whatever you
say. I love my daughter.
(Hand nods)
I'll send you the five hundred.
Wade stands; Hand motors to the door. Wade puts his fingers
in his mouth. His tooth throbs.
CUT TO:
Wade and Gordon speak. LaRiviere is relaxed, open: a "new
Gordon."
WADE
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch
is going out again.
LARIVIERE
You ever think of getting a new car,
Wade?
WADE
On what you pay me?
LARIVIERE
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have
him pick up Wade's car, fix the
clutch.
ELAINE (O.S.)
What!
LARIVIERE
(to Wade)
Use the pickup. I'll bill it to the
town. You're the town police officer
and the town police officer should
have a decent car. You want a new
car or not?
WADE
What do I have to do for it?
LARIVIERE
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking.
You don't get enough appreciation
around here and it's time we changed
things a little.
WADE
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
LARIVIERE
So?
WADE
He say anything about the summons I
tried to give him? Sonofabitch
wouldn't accept it.
LARIVIERE
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out
right after the man's father-in-law
shot himself. Let it go. Call it a
favor to me.
WADE
You? Why?
LARIVIERE
Mel's doing some business with me.
It's nice to do favors for people
you do business with. He was in a
hurry. No big deal.
WADE
That was before Twombley was shot.
Before he knew.
LARIVIERE
What's the difference? Take my truck,
take a rest -- stop worrying about
Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to
do with your old man's place -- he
going to stay there?
WADE
(takes out cigarette)
Want to buy?
LARIVIERE
Don't light that in here. I'm
allergic.
WADE
I won't. You interested?
LARIVIERE
Maybe.
WADE
You and Mel Gordon?
LARIVIERE
Could be.
WADE
(voice rising)
Always count on old Wade for a good
screwing. Why should I always pay
more, sell cheap? Why should you
guys make all the money. You and Mel
and Jack. Right's right.
Wade pulls out Bic, lights cigarette.
LARIVIERE
(waving arms)
Out! Out!
Wade smiles, exits.
CUT TO:
Wade enters the empty diner. His clothes frozen.
NICK
Your father's in back, Wade. Marg
had to babysit him. She moved in
with you, huh?
(looking closer)
What happened?
Wade goes to the kitchen. Glen Whitehouse, washing dishes
with Margie, looks up:
POP
Ah, the prodigal son.
NICK
About fucking time.
POP
Look, got me a new job, second cook
and bottle washer!
MARGIE
What happened?
WADE
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I
got waylaid. Sorry.
POP
The fuck you got waylaid. You follow
your prick around like it was your
nose.
NICK
(enters)
Can it, Whitehouse.
(to Wade)
Get him out of here. It was funny at
first, but I'm tired.
MARGIE
There's clothes in the back.
Wade's old man talks as he dresses:
POP
Let's go home? What home is that?
Your home? My home? Let's have a
talk about that. You're fucking sly,
Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't
make any excuses for you anymore!
You gotta deal with me! No more sugar
tit, asshole.
Wade, redressed, enters:
WADE
Pop, for Christ's sake!
POP
You think you can take me now? Come
on, try.
Margie and Nick guide pere et fils to MARG'S CAR. Nick speaks
to her:
NICK
Marg, get out of this. Fast.
MARGIE
I can't.
Marg drives off.
CUT TO:
Wade leans close to his father, his breath on his:
WADE
I wish you would die.
Pop spits directly into Wade's face, raises his arm. Wade
catches it, twists it. Margie shrieks:
MARGIE
Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!
They do, glaring as they approach the farmhouse.
CUT TO:
Wade looks in the bedroom, sees Margie sleeping, goes to the
bathroom.
He peers, stands before the sink, washes his hands slowly.
Drying his hands, he looks into the mirror, startled by the
image of his own face.
A phone conversation plays over:
WADE (O.S.)
No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and
there he was, only it was me. But it
was like I had never seen myself
before. It was a stranger's face.
Hard to explain. You fly on automatic
pilot, like I was doing all night,
and you disappear.
CUT TO:
Wade sits alone in the darkened room, speaking on the phone.
His cigarette glows.
WADE
Then you accidentally see your body,
or your face, or whatever, and you
don't know who the hell it belongs
to. Strange. It's the business with
the old man, I know, and how
incredibly pissed I was at him, and
also chasing Jack Hewitt like that,
and the Goddamned truck going through
the ice, not to mention Margie's
being so upset -- one thing on top
of another.
ROLFE (O.S.)
Wade, are you alright?
WADE
But you gotta hear this. You won't
believe it. Mel Gordon had come by
to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in
his office.
CUT TO:
Wade's theory expanded: Jack and Gordon argue in the office.
An extension of Scene 55. Like Wade's other theories, in
black-and-white:
LARIVIERE
He's on to us!
JACK
Shit! What are we gonna do?
LARIVIERE
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta
talk to Mel.
JACK
You can't buy Wade off.
LARIVIERE
We bought you.
JACK
That was me.
CUT TO:
They step into Alma's living room/office. She's been keeping
the town secrets for as long as anyone can remember.
WADE
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
ALMA
Been putting my files into it. You
take sugar and milk?
WADE
No. Black.
They sit by her desk at the bay window. She studies him.
ALMA
Are you alright, Wade?
WADE
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned
tooth, I got a few things bugging
me, like everybody else. But I'm
okay.
ALMA
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't
mean to pry. I'm sorry about your
mother. It was a nice funeral.
WADE
Alma, I think there's some dirty
business going on in this town.
ALMA
Always has been.
WADE
This is maybe worse than you and I
are used to.
(beat)
What I'm talking about, I'm talking
about murder. Among other things.
ALMA
Who?
WADE
Evan Twombley, the union boss who
got shot. Somebody murdered him.
ALMA
Who?
WADE
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work
with?
CUT TO:
Wade finishes:
WADE
...if Jack told the truth, he could
be free by the time he's my age.
ALMA
Sometimes things are simpler than
you think. Let me ask you a question.
WADE
You don't believe me?
ALMA
(crosses to her desk)
About Jack? No. Have you checked out
the tax bill on your father's farm
lately?
WADE
I know he's due for the last two
years. I was thinking of paying it
when the insurance comes in.
ALMA
Has anybody offered to buy it?
WADE
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Alma punches her computer. Dozens of items flash up.
ALMA
This is all the real estate
transactions in this town the last
year. Most of it unused land. Most
of it for little more than the back
taxes owed.
She punches again: only three items.
ALMA
This is from three years ago. Some
difference, huh?
WADE
(looking)
What is the Northcountry Development
Association?
ALMA
I went down to Concord to check it
out. The president is Mel Gordon.
The vice-president and treasurer is
Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are
buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000
this year. I believe that's out of
LaRiviere's league.
WADE
Twombley involved?
ALMA
No.
WADE
He musta found out. They had to get
rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
ALMA
All the figures show is that Gordon
LaRiviere is going to be a very rich
man using his position as Selectman.
In a year or two, you won't recognize
this town.
CUT TO:
Wade storms in, shouting. Jack and Jimmy choose donuts by
the file cabinet. LaRiviere's behind his desk. Wade's tooth
makes it hard for him to talk without pain:
WADE
You sneaky sonofabitch! I've got
your number now, Gordon! All these
years I actually thought you were a
decent man.
(pounds fists on desk)
Can you believe that?
Jack, combative, looks at Wade. Gordon stands before Jack
can speak:
LARIVIERE
Wade, you're done.
(extends hand)
Let me have the shop keys.
WADE
(to Jack and Jimmy)
You two, don't you get it? He's using
you. You're his slaves.
(soft)
Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see
that?
LARIVIERE
The key, Wade.
WADE
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the
key that's kept me locked to you all
these years. I give it to you with
pleasure.
(passes key)
Now I'm free. See how easy it is,
Jack? All you got to do is give back
what the man gave you, and you're
free of him.
(turns to leave)
I've got to call my brother.
Wade's phone conversation plays OVER as he goes to Margie's
car.
WADE (O.S.)
I know what it means. I'm just running
out of ways to use it.
ROLFE (O.S.)
For what?
CUT TO:
Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking
into the receiver. Margie looks up from the KITCHEN table,
an old newspaper in front of her.
WADE
What do you mean, you can't take me
today? I told you --
The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams
the phone down.
MARGIE
What on earth is happening to you?
Why are you acting this way?
WADE
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I
can't even think anymore because of
it.
MARGIE
I heard you talking. You got fired
this morning, didn't you?
WADE
Look, that's temporary, believe me.
There's so much shit gonna hit the
fan the next few days, my getting
fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't
matter a bit.
Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes.
WADE
I'll get another job. People are
going to need me. After this is over,
they'll make me into a Goddamned
hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll
deliver. I'll be the best father who
ever lived. You need me, even Pop,
for Christ's sake, he needs me. This
town needs me. Maybe now they think
they can send me howling into a corner
like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll
be different soon.
Margie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks,
taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she
thinks: just the same.
Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives
off.
Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop
turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume.
Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours
himself a drink.
WADE
Leave the bottle out!
Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to
the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer,
goes toward the bathroom.
In the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a
bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank.
He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his
mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse
locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes
and pulls.
He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from
his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He
takes another bite of whisky.
Rolfe's voice plays over:
ROLFE (V.O.)
You will say I should have known
terrible things were about to happen,
and perhaps I should have. But even
so, what could I have done by then?
Wade never went inside. He lived
almost wholly out there on his skin,
with no interior space to retreat
to, even in a crisis.
Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING
ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks.
Wade exits through the KITCHEN, snatching his coat.
CUT TO:
The Ford heads north.
WADE
(winking)
How about a Big Mac?
JILL
Mommy won't let me eat fast food.
You know that. It's bad for you.
WADE
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big
Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your
favorite. What do you say?
JILL
No.
WADE
What do you want, then?
JILL
Nothing.
WADE
You can't have nothing, Jill. We
need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
JILL
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
WADE
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge
today, though.
JILL
Okay. So we'll get what you want.
What do you want?
They stop for a light. Silence.
WADE
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait
till we get home. Maybe we'll stop
by Wickham's for a hamburger when we
get to Lawford. That suit you? You
always like Wickham's.
JILL
(looking ahead)
Okay.
WADE
Fine.
Pause. Wade looks over at Jill and realizes she is crying.
WADE
Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's
the matter, honey?
She shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs.
WADE
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
JILL
(regains composure)
What are you sorry for?
WADE
I don't know. For the food business.
I guess. I just thought, you know,
we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like
we used to.
JILL
I want to go home.
WADE
(quick)
You can't.
Jill looks away. Wade pulls a six-pack from under the seat,
pulls off a beer, takes a swig.
JILL
(quiet)
That's illegal, you know.
WADE
I know.
JILL
You're a policeman.
WADE
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing
anymore.
JILL
Oh.
CUT TO:
Wade and Jill enter Wickham's, crowded with out-of-state
hunters at the end of the deer season.
WADE
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled
sandwich?
NICK
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich,
you dub.
Wade, flaring, reaches across the counter and grabs Nick by
the shirtfront! Nick's arm knocks over a cup of coffee.
The diner goes silent. Hunters look up. Jill's face is white;
she starts to cry.
Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends
down, comforting her. He wipes her nose with a napkin.
WADE
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing
happened.
JILL
I want to go home.
WADE
(rigid)
Okay, let's go home, then.
They head for the door. Nick eases over:
NICK
(delicate)
Wade, I got a message for you.
(Wade turns)
Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you.
Wants you to clear your stuff out of
his office in Town Hall.
WADE
His office. You mean my old office.
NICK
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
WADE
He got his deer yet?
NICK
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the
mountain. I'd stay away from him if
I were you. He's real pissed.
Wade takes Jill's hand, exits.
CUT TO:
Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office
belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the
ground. He gathers up his rifles.
Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his
head. He drops to his knees, the guns scatter. He looks up
with child's fear and guilt at his father.
Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a
colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone.
Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. He grabs it
by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion
arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's
head. A cold hard CRACK of bone.
Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies
back like a stuffed dummy. He collapses beside the empty
C.C. bottle.
Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's
inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.
WADE
I know you now. I love you too.
Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud
CLICK. The gun's empty.
WADE
(smiles)
Joke. You scared me.
He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses
his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray
hair.
Pop's eyes are clouded. Blood suddenly drips from his ear to
the ground.
Wade rests the rifle against the truck. He bends over, slips
his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. He carries
Pop over to the workbench, lays him out.
Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp. He
unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body.
Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it
for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse.
Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud
of yellow flame. The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot
up the old weathered wall.
Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards.
CUT TO:
Camera glides from room to room, glimpsing details, fragments
of former times, as if this were an historical site or
memorial. The walls resonate: lives were molded here.
ROLFE (V.O.)
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed
in business. The Parker Mountain Ski
Resort is now advertised all across
the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at
the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a
snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham
runs the new Burger King. Margie
Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her
mother; Lillian and Jill went with
Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.
Out a window, workers gather charred timbers from the barn,
throw them on a truck.
ROLFE (V.O.)
We want to believe Wade died, died
that same November, froze to death
on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot
understand how a man, a normal man,
a man like you and me, could do such
a terrible thing. Unless the police
happen to arrest a vagrant who turns
out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe
he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will
have turned himself into one of those
faceless fellows working at the video
store and lives in a town-house
apartment at the edge of town until
his mailman recognizes him from the
picture at the post office -- unless
that happens, there will be no more
mention of him and his friend Jack
Hewitt and our father. The story
will be over. Except that I continue.
