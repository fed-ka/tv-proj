      FADE IN:

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY (D/1)11

      The California sun shines.  Palm trees sway with a light 
      breeze.  Convertibles cruise past with their tops down.  
      Tourists snap photos and local hipsters buzz by.  It appears 
      to be another glorious day, hooray for Hollywood, until...

      ...we PAN along THE WALK OF FAME -- find LISBON and JANE 
      reaching a taped off crime scene.  An EARLY MORNING CROWD 
      beginning to gather.  TV NEWS CREW setting up.  Lisbon and 
      Jane make their way through to...

      EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS22

      ...where, toward the back of the lot, FELIX HANSON (40's) is 
      on the ground, dead.  CSI creep about, collecting evidence.  
      UNIs keep onlookers at bay as LISBON and JANE find RIGSBY and 
      VAN PELT bagging the victim's wallet, taking notes... 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Victim is Felix Hanson, forty-
                    seven.  Took three bullets to the 
                    chest.  No weapon found.  The 
                    coroner estimates the shooting  *
                    occurred between midnight and three 
                    am. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why's this ours boss?  Looks like a 
                    mugging to me.  Hollywood Homicide 
                    could handle it.  

      Jane kneels beside the victim.  Leans in close.  Gets a good 
      look.

                                  LISBON
                    The brass called it.  Hanson's 
                      super-rich, and he was a  
                      California State Rep the last six 
                    years. 

                                  JANE
                    A golfing buddy of the AG.

                                  LISBON
                    Correct, but not quite fair.

                                  JANE
                      Statehouse cronies deserve justice 
                    too.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     2.

      CONTINUED:22

                                  LISBON
                    Hanson was a good guy.  He ran a 
                    long crusade against the drug 
                    trade.  He kicked butt and named 
                    names and made a lot of enemies.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Wait, I know this guy.  He's semi-
                    famous.  He's the super rich guy 
                    that married Felicia Scott.  
                    She left movies to be with him.

                                  LISBON
                    Felicia Scott?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hot actress.  You know her.  She's 
                    been in loads of stuff.  Hot. 

                                  LISBON
                          (can't place her)
                    Okay.  My point, if this was drug 
                    trade related, the AG will approve 
                    whatever resources it takes to 
                    close.  Anybody hear the shots, see 
                    what happened?

                                  RIGSBY 
                    No one's come forward so far.  But 
                    Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin 
                    over there were with Hanson when 
                    the first officer arrived on scene.  

      JANE'S POV: CHO talking with good, but not great 
      impersonations of MARILYN MONROE and CHARLIE CHAPLIN several 
      feet away. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT'D)
                    Does he have kids?

      Lisbon looks at her notebook.

                                  LISBON
                      A daughter, sixteen. 

      Jane gives the FORENSICS TECH a friendly smile.  

                                  JANE
                    Hello.  Any car keys on him?

                                  CSI MAN
                    Nope.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     3.

      CONTINUED: (2)22

                                  JANE 
                    How about a valet ticket?

                                  CSI MAN
                    Nope.

                                  JANE
                    Hmmm.  Nobody walks in LA.

      Jane looks around to Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe, both 
      grumpy and tired.

      NEW ANGLE 

      On Cho and Charlie and Marilyn.  Jane comes over and studies 
      them intently. 

                                  CHO
                    And where were you going when you 
                    found the victim?

                                    CHARLIE CHAPLIN
                          (Russian accent)
                    I don't speak.

                                  CHO
                    In the movies, no.  Here in the 
                    real world, you speak.  You just 
                    did.  

                                    CHARLIE CHAPLIN
                    The other police already asked us 
                    this stuff.  I'm say nothing more. 
                    Five hours we are here. 

      Marilyn sounds nothing like Marilyn.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    For the umpteenth time, I was going 
                    home from work.  Victor was walking 
                    me to my car.

                                  CHO
                    What is your work?

                                    MARILYN MONROE 
                    I'm Marilyn.

                                  CHO 
                    How is that your work?

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    I stand on the street and people 
                    take photos of me and give me tips. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     4.

      CONTINUED: (3)22

                                  CHO
                    Why?

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    I don't know.  Where are you from? 
                    What are you staring at?

      This last to Jane.

                                  JANE
                    You.  What's your real name?

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    Norma Jean Baker.

                                  JANE
                    Your real real name.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    Yolanda Quinn.

                                  JANE
                    Yolanda, you don't actually look 
                    very much like Marilyn Monroe at 
                    all, so you do this work because 
                    you feel some deep connection with 
                    her.  Yes? 

                                    MARILYN MONROE 
                      I guess...

      Jane fixes her attention.

                                  JANE 
                    She was a lonesome soul, wasn't 
                    she?  Poor woman.  Longing for 
                      affection.  For attention, 
                    approval. 

      She shrugs...

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (hypnotically)
                    And she got it.  She came out here 
                    and she worked and struggled and 
                    she got it.  That love and respect 
                    that she longed for.  And you can 
                    too.  You will.  You will if you do 
                    the right thing now.  

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    What thing?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     5.

      CONTINUED: (4)22

                                  JANE
                    Give me the valet ticket, Yolanda.  
                    The one you stole off the dead man.

      Yolanda looks jolted, guilty.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    I haven't got any valet ticket.

                                  JANE
                    Then tell Charlie to give me the 
                    valet ticket.

      Beat.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    Give it to him.

      Charlie's disgusted.

                                    CHARLIE CHAPLIN
                    Ach, sonofabitch.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                          (firmly)
                    Give it.

      Charlie produces the valet ticket.  Jane takes it.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks.  

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    Can we go now?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  I'll keep the cops at bay, 
                    you guys run.

                                    MARILYN MONROE
                    Huh?

                                  CHO
                    Jane...

                                  JANE
                    Run. 

      Marilyn and Charlie hustle away...

                                  CHO

      Jane puts his fists up.

                    At your dinner with Hanson last 
                    night, both your credit cards were

                    No.  We left soon after.  We were 
                    having a good time, but I wanted to

      Gabriel holds up a SCRIPT.

                                    GABRIEL
                    The movie I'm directing, "A Dozen 
                    Roses."  Felix financed the 
                    picture.  That's why we had dinner 
                    last night, we were celebrating his 
                    first foray as a film producer.

                    I loved him.  Loved him. So many 
                    people in this town are phonies.   
                    Felix Hanson was real. Felix, he 
                    didn't like something, he'd say so.

                                  JANE
                    What, in particular, did he not

                                    GABRIEL
                    Nothing.  I'm saying, in general, 
                    he was real, like that. 

                                  LISBON
                    How much has he invested?

                    Yup.  Brave man.  But he's doing it 
                    for Felicia, of course.  Not just 
                    for the potential profits.

                    Didn't see anyone.  I parked down 
                    the street.  We shook hands and 
                    said goodbye.

                    No.  I like guns, but I'm afraid of 
                    blowing my own head off.            THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     10.

      High ceilings, white, cozy, shabby chic slash relaxed beach

      Lisbon sits with Hanson's wife, FELICIA SCOTT (40's) and 
      their daughter, SYDNEY HANSON (16).  

      Jane wanders around the room, handling several FRAMED FAMILY

      Many of these photos are of Felix with his daughter, Sydney.

      These two women could not be more different.  Sydney, pretty, 
      but a goth/bohemian saddy, hides behind her straggly hair and 
      baggy clothes, while Felicia is a beauty who glows with great 
      purpose and will.  But what they do share is how shocked and

                    anymore.  Not for ages. 

                                  LISBON
                    We found --

                    Not his looks.

                    Oh really? *

                                  JANE *
                    Really.  He's not your type. *

                                  FELICIA *
                    What is my type? *

      Jane affects sizing her up. *

      Bang on the money.  Felicia covers with an imperious glare. *

                                  FELICIA *
                    Not even close.   *

                                  JANE *
                    No, that was a bull's-eye.  So what  *
                    did you like about Felix? *

                                  FELICIA *
                    His voice, his self assurance. *
                    Why are these questions relevant? *

                                  JANE *
                    Oh, no reason.  Just curious.
                    We found a bag of marijuana and 
                    various prescription drugs in your 
                    husband's car.

      Felicia turns to Jane, stunned to hear this.

                                    FELICIA
                    What?  That's absurd.

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                    FELICIA
                    My husband didn't use drugs. 
                    Period.  Someone must have planted 
                    them. 

      Felicia studiously avoids looking to Sydney, so Lisbon and 
      Jane look to her.

                                  SYDNEY
                    I'm straight edge.  Have been for 
                    years.

                                  LISBON
                    Do you know anyone by the name of 
                    Freddie Ross? *

                                    FELICIA
                    No.  Who is that?

      A BEEPING SOUND interrupts them.  Everyone checks their cell 
      phone. 

                                  SYDNEY
                    It's mine.

      Sydney reaches for her purse.  Rummages through...  

      A PHOTO falls out of an address book.  Jane picks it up off 
      the floor.  

      It's a picture of Sydney and a very handsome TEENAGED BOY.  
      Jane stares at it.  Takes note.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     14.

      CONTINUED: (3)88

      But Sydney SWIPES it from his hand, shoves it back in her 
      purse, hiding it from Felicia, who remains oblivious.

      Sydney gives him a pleading look.  Jane lets her off the hook 
      and doesn't ask about the photo.  Sydney finds her cell, 
      reads the text.

                                  SYDNEY (CONT D)
                    Gabriel's assistant.  He wants us 
                    to report to set for rehearsals.

      Felicia sighs, not happy about this.

                                    FELICIA
                    Tell him we'll be there on time.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm sure they'll understand if you 
                    didn't work today.  

                                    FELICIA
                    I would love to back out of the 
                    whole project. With Felix gone, 
                    there's no point.  But the 
                    insurance company is holding me to 
                    my contract.  They won't even cover 
                    any delays.  I don't want to end up 
                    in court.

                                  JANE
                          (to Sydney)
                    Are you working on the film also?

      Sydney gets awkward.  Shrugs her shoulders.  Avoids eye 
      contact.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Kind of.

                                    FELICIA
                    We gave her a small speaking role. 
                    As one of my daughters.  Isn't that 
                    cute?

                                  JANE
                    You want to be an actor?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Whatever.  Not anymore.

                    I know it's hard now, but 
                      eventually you might be glad you 
                    were a part of something so 
                    important to your father.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Hah. 

                                  JANE
                    Hah.  He didn't think the movie was 
                      important?

                                  SYDNEY
                    He thought Gabriel had screwed up 
                    the script.  He wanted to back out 
                    of the film.  

                                    FELICIA
                    You're such a drama queen. 
                    He wasn't happy with the script, 
                    but that's why he met with Gabriel 
                    last night.  To talk it through. 
                    He wasn't backing out.  He might 
                    have threatened to back out, to get 
                    the changes he wanted.  That's how 
                    it works.

      Rigsby and Cho stand in front of an apartment door.  Cho

                      Supposedly this guy's also an

      throws the laundry, hampering them just enough to let him get

      Ready to shoot now.  The production assistant, MARCUS KLEIN 
      (20's), escorts Lisbon and Jane through the set.  They duck 
      under and step over heavy equipment, the crew mill about, 
      setting up, eating breakfast, on their cell phones, Extras 
      everywhere, a hive of activity.  Lisbon is ON HER CELL with

      A pompous high octane talent agent.  He's exasperated, makes

      Mitch has stopped them in front of VIDEO VILLAGE.  

      To the left is a large TRAILER from which POUNDING MUSIC 
      emanates.  On the door, a SIGN that READS: GABRIEL FANNING.

                    That's unfortunate, but hey...

      Jane steps forward abruptly, making Mitch flinch slightly.  
      But Jane smiles sympathetically.

                                  JANE
                      I understand, Mitch.  Gabriel is 
                    your top client.  Can't lose him. 
                    You have no choice.  He says jump, 
                    you jump.  Bullied at school, were 
                    you?

      Mitch is thrown off balance by this.

                                  MITCH 
                    I was not actually.

                                  JANE
                    Sure you were.  Even after all 
                    these years, you still lie awake at 
                    night sometimes, thinking of all 
                    the ways you could wreak revenge on 
                    your tormentors.  

      Mitch says nothing, a palpable hit. *

                                  JANE (CONT D) *
                    And now out of fear and avarice, 
                    you let this man Fanning bully you 
                    the same way.  Same way.  Get a 
                    life, Mitch.

                                  LISBON
                    Or get arrested.

      Mitch takes a beat, steps aside.  Jane and Lisbon step up to 
      the trailer door.

      Felicia is in character -- as ROSE, the hip, wry, witty, 
      radiantly beautiful owner of a hip wry witty New York City  
      flower shop.  Felicia is ever more alive under CAMERA LIGHTS, 
      fully engaged and in her element.  She's arranging a flower 
      display outside her store and talking on the phone... 

      We start IN CLOSE and PULL BACK as the scene progresses so 
      that we see the camera crew and the ADs sending extras across 
      the set.  Jane is seated behind Gabriel in Video Village.

      Gabriel silently cues the entrance of a handsome young actor, 
      (20's) playing ROWAN, a preppy rich guy.  Rose doesn't notice 
      him at first and keeps talking on the phone.

                    Love can be cruel, but it's the 
                    only thing we have in -- Hello?  
                    Hello?  Oh.

      This last as she notices Rowan.

                    Hello, Rowan.

                                  ROWAN
                    Good morning, Mrs. Atkins.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I'm sorry, Daisy's not here right 
                    now.

                                  ROWAN
                    Actually, it's you that I wanted to 
                    speak with.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Oh?

                                  ROWAN
                    What you said just now?  About 
                    love?  

        Impetuously, he takes her in his arms and kisses her.      
      She pulls away after a beat, and slaps him, hard.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Cut!  Lovely.  Great.  Let's go 
                    again.  Geoff baby, don't flinch 
                    before she throws the slap.  You 
                    don't know it's coming.  

      Rowan's real voice is estuary English...

                                  ROWAN
                    She's taking a right old wallop at 
                    me.  It hurts.

                                    FELICIA
                          (defensive)
                    Excuse me for being emotional 
                    today. 
                          (to Gabriel)
                    I'm sorry, but it feels like the  *
                    scene's still playing very flat.     *

                    Your father isn't going to lock you

                    Your parents forbade you seeing

                    We needed some cash, so I took a 
                    few things from the house.

                                  JANE

      Jane and Lisbon exchange a glance.

                    So your parents stopped you from

                    Phone records say he's been calling

      Sydney frowns, busted.  Or that's what it looks like to the 
      untrained eye.

                    That's that's, not, I don't know.

      INT. HANSON RESIDENCE. LIVING ROOM - DAY (D/3)2525

      Lisbon and Jane are at the house with Felicia.  Jane peruses 
      the room, listens as Felicia talks with Lisbon.  

                                    FELICIA
                    Brandon's not a bad kid or 
                    anything, but he's way too old and 
                    way too wild for Sydney.  She uh, 
                    she stole some items from the house 
                    to give to him.  Silly girl. 

                                  LISBON
                    She said she stole a gun, amongst 
                    other things.

                                    FELICIA
                    Yes.  It was just some old army 
                    thing Felix liked to keep around. 

                                  LISBON
                    What caliber?

                                    FELICIA
                      Forty-five I believe.

                                  LISBON
                    You didn't report the theft?

                    And set the police on Sydney?  No.  
                    No.  It was a foolish girl's 
                    mistake. 

                                  LISBON 
                    Your husband was killed with a 
                      forty-five.

      Felicia takes a beat to process the horrible thought...

                                    FELICIA 
                    It must be a coincidence.  She and 
                    Brandon would never... No.  
                    She's a good girl.  Her heart is 
                    broken.  They fought a lot, sure, 
                    but she loved her father.  And he 
                    loved her, despite everything.    

                                  JANE
                    And Brandon?  

                                    FELICIA
                    He's just a mixed up kid.  There's 
                    no malice in him. 

                                  JANE
                    You knew those drugs in Felix's car 
                    were Sydney's all along, didn't 
                    you?

                                    FELICIA
                    Yes.  She's already been through so 
                    much, I couldn't put her through 
                    anymore.  Felix found the drugs a 
                    few days ago.  It broke his heart.  
                    Because she had promised she'd 
                    stopped.  He kept hold of the drugs 
                    while we debated what to do.  
                    Whether to have Brandon arrested.

                                  JANE
                    Now that Felix is gone, what are 
                    you going to do?

                                    FELICIA
                    Forgive her.  Show her love.  Show 
                    her that we all make mistakes.  But 
                    we have the power to give ourselves 
                    a second chance.  She deserves 
                    that.  We all do.

                    No.  I won't believe it.  I refuse.      
                    I must see Sydney.  When can she

                    That's okay.  There's always leeway

                    When I'm super-rich, this is where 
                    I'll live.  You can't beat the

      RIGSBY'S POV:  A dark, shadowy FIGURE moves toward the Hanson 
      house.

                    The eagle has landed.

      Cho folds a page to mark his place before looking up...

                                  RIGSBY (CONT'D)
                    There...

      He points to the shadowy figure as he slips onto the Hanson's 
      property.

                    Crap.  He's in already.  He must 
                    have a key.

      They get out of the van in a hurry and run across the street. 

2828INT. HANSON RESIDENCE - NIGHT 

      BRANDON FULTON -- for it is he -- comes through an exterior 
      side door, and creeps through the darkened house.  He's 
      dressed in hip bad-boy clothes and has an air of attractive 
      menace about him.  He has A FORTY-FIVE AUTOMATIC in his hand. 

      From the shadows, BLAAAM!  A stab of flame as a gun is fired 
      at Brandon!  And again, BLAAAM!  

      Brandon dives for cover.  Or was he hit?  Felicia emerges 
      from the shadows with the SMOKING GUN held in two hands, 
      quivering in fear.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     40.

      Rigsby and Cho rush in, stop dead.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ma'am, drop the gun.  Drop the gun.

      Felicia drops it like it's hot.  Rigsby swiftly gathers it 
      up.  

                                    FELICIA
                    Oh my God, is he dead?  Did I kill 
                    him?  Oh my God.  When I saw he had 
                    a gun.  I just panicked.  Tell me 
                    he's alright. 

      Cho checks on Brandon lying on the floor behind a couch...  
      He's writhing and moaning incoherently in shock and pain and 
      he's got BLOOD all over him from a wound to his side.   

      The gun he was carrying -- a heavy old forty-five automatic -- 
      lies on the floor.  Cho picks it up.

                                  CHO

      Sydney enters, terrified.  Felicia is hyperventilating so she 
      can't talk. 

                                  SYDNEY
                    What happened?

      INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY (D/4)2929

      Lisbon and Jane speak with a fearful and expectant Felicia as 
      she's measured for a costume...

                                  LISBON
                    No guarantees, but as of now, 
                    there's going to be no charges 
                    pressed against you for shooting 
                    Brandon.  

                                    FELICIA
                    Oh thank goodness.  But is he going 
                    to be alright?

                                  LISBON
                    He'll be fine.

                                    FELICIA
                    That's a relief anyway.  I mean, 
                    I feel terrible, but what was he 
                    thinking, sneaking into our house 
                    with a gun?  What does he say he 
                    was doing?  

                                  LISBON
                    He's still recovering from surgery.  
                    We'll talk with him as soon as we 
                    can.  

                                  JANE
                    The gun he was carrying is the gun 
                    that was used to kill your husband.  
                    It's the gun that Sydney stole from 
                    you.

      Felicia takes a dramatic beat.

                                    FELICIA
                    Oh my God.  But that means...    

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Sydney may be an accessory to 
                    murder.

                    Brandon?  What were you planning on

                    I was visiting my girlfriend.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We didn't shoot you.

                    Yeah okay, that's a plan.  But 
                    here's your problem, Brandon.  
                    The gun you were carrying last 
                    night was the same gun that was 
                    used to kill Felix Hanson. 
                    The gun that Sydney stole for you.  
                    That puts both of you in a world of 
                    trouble.

                                    BRANDON

                    Did she know that you were going to

                                    BRANDON
                    I didn't.

                                  CHO

                    I think I know what happened here, 
                    Sydney.  I wonder if you know also.

                                  SYDNEY
                          (subdued)
                    Uh yeah.  Apparently, my boyfriend 
                    shot my dad and then my stepmom 
                    shot my boyfriend.  My life is like 
                    a sick joke.

                                  JANE
                    So now tell me, Sydney.  Why would 
                    Brandon shoot your dad unless you 
                    wanted him too?  Unless you asked 
                    him to do it?

                                  SYDNEY
                    I didn't ask him to do anything.  

                                  JANE
                    Look at me and say that again.

      Sydney looks him in the eye.

                                  SYDNEY
                    I didn't ask him to do anything.  
                    I loved my father.  I did.  I do.

                                  JANE 
                    Alright.  But so why did Brandon do 
                    it?

                                  SYDNEY
                    I don't know.  That's what I want 
                    to ask him.

                                  JANE 
                    Maybe someone else made him do it.  

                                  SYDNEY 
                    Who? 

                                  JANE
                    You tell me.

      Jane walks across the room, joins Lisbon.  Sits in silence, 
      thinking.

      Gabriel addresses the attentive CREW.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Listen up.  As you know, Felicia 
                    and Sydney have been living through 
                      a terrible tragedy.  They're 
                      incredibly brave and strong women, 
                    and they want to get back to work.  
                    Back to normal.  So let's be as 
                    normal as possible, but respectful 
                    of their grief, okay?     

      The crew all nod and murmur, OKAY, UH HUH, etc.   

      We find Jane and Lisbon, hanging at the Video Village.

      Felicia and Sydney walk onto the set to smiles and nods of 
        appreciation from the crew.

                                    GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                    Before we roll, let's try running  
                    all the way through for fun, shall 
                    we, girls?  Don't worry too much 
                    about staying on page, just go with 
                    your instinct and see what happens. 

                                    FELICIA
                    Let's do it.

      Sydney nods.  Gabriel walks back to Video Village, whispers 
      to the AD...

        Felicia/Rose arranges flowers outside her store, a phone to 
      her ear.  Script pages are close to hand.  

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Daisy my love, where are you?

                    I'm right here, Mom.

      Sydney, as Daisy, comes down the busy street, looking like a 
      million dollars.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Wow, look at you.  You look, good.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Thank you.  What were you calling 
                    me about?

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Just making sure you were coming.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Why is it so important I be here?

      Felicica/Rose takes a beat. 

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did a naughty thing.  Rowan's 
                    coming here to meet you.  I called 
                    and pretended I was you.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Oh no.  You didn't.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did.  I'm sorry, bunny.

      Sydney's speaking for herself now.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Why would you do that?  Why play 
                    games with me?  You already seduced 
                    him away from me.  

      That's not the line.  But Felicia runs with it. (NB Rowan is 
      waiting for his cue and becomes ever more confused as the 
      scene progresses.) 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     49.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did not!  How can you say that?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Stop acting.  It's over.  I know 
                    what you did.  I know who you are.  
                    You've always hated me.  You 
                    seduced Brandon and lied to him and 
                    made him kill my father.

      Horrified, Felicia drops the acting.  The Crew and the Extras 
      are all frozen, staring. 

                                    FELICIA
                    You're mad!  Gabe really, what 
                    the...

      Felicia tries to walk away, but Sydney takes her by the wrist 
      and won't let go.  She's full of fire.

                                  SYDNEY
                          (growling)
                    You're not going anywhere!

                                    FELICIA
                    Gabe!  Cut!  She's gone mad.  

      On Jane, Lisbon and Gabriel and all in the Video Village, 
      transfixed, still.

                                  SYDNEY
                    I'll let you go.  After you tell me 
                    it's not true.  Tell me I'm wrong.  
                    Tell them.     

      Felicia looks around at a sea of faces all staring at her, 
      waiting. 

                                    FELICIA
                    She's mad.  It's not, it's not 
                    true.

      Sydney lets her go.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Liar!

      Felicia's in her natural element, and as Jane expected, the 
      presence of LIGHTS and an audience compels her to stay and 
      defend herself...

                    what Brandon's been saying, but 
                    whatever it is, it's nonsense.  
                    And it's upsetting.  And unfair.

                    I'm sorry, I don't buy it.  You're

                    "this is ridiculous"...

      Felicia begins to suspect she's having a nightmare.

                                    FELICIA 
                    I, this, I'm not, what?  I don't

                                  JANE
                    It's easy to understand.  You told 
                    Brandon that Felix was abusing you.  
                    Persuaded Brandon to kill Felix.  
                    And when you feared he'd confess to 
                    the police, you lured him to your 
                    house, planning to kill him as 
                    well.  But now Sydney sees the 
                    truth, and she knows you're a 
                    conniving murderous bitch.  

      Felicia tries to slap him.  But he catches her wrist.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)

      FLASHBACK

      INT. HANSON RESIDENCE - NIGHT (N/0)3535 *

      MOS. Felicia comes storming downstairs in a rage and a silky 
      negligee, clutching a script, followed by an apologetic but 
      firm FELIX HANSON.  

                                    FELICIA (V.O.)
                    He changed his mind over script 
                    issues, he said.  Like hell. 
                    He didn't want me out there, being 
                      successful, having other men look 
                    at me and want me. It made him feel 
                    insecure.  I gave up my life to be 
                    with him.  This is my life!  And he 
                    wouldn't let me have it back.

      Felicia throws the script at him and then starts on household 
      objects, so he retreats out the front door.

                    He was suffocating me.  I was 
                      imprisoned by his ego.  It was a 
                    form of abuse.

      Brandon enters.  He just stopped by to see if Sydney was 
      around, but she's not.  He's about to go, but Felicia smiles 
      like a cat and beckons him to come sit with her.  Dazzled, 
      Brandon does what he's told. 

                                    FELICIA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Brandon came along at a weak 
                    moment.  He, he forced himself on 
                    me, and I let him.  It went from 
                    there.  It just made sense.

      Brandon is mesmerized by this famous sex symbol purring at 
      him.  She puts a hand on his leg, leans forward and whispers 
      in his ear.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD PARKING LOT - NIGHT (N/0)3737 *

      Brandon leads Felix off the boulevard and down the alley.  

                                    BRANDON
                    She's in the car...

                                    FELICIA (V.O.)
                    He told Felix that Sydney was in 
                    trouble.  And Felix came right 
                    along.

      Brandon takes the gun out then takes several steps before 
      summoning the nerve to turn and shoot Hanson three times.  
      Then he runs off. 

      END FLASHBACK

3838INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Felicia is now in plain clothes, her hair pulled back, a 
      prisoner, talking to Jane.

                                    FELICIA
                          (rueful, defeated)
                    He did love that daughter of his.  
                    I must give him that.  If only he 
                    could have accepted me for who I 
                    am.  If only he had respected my 
                    needs.  This would never have 
                    happened.

                                  JANE
                    Men are beasts.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     53.

                                    FELICIA
                    Would you do me a favor, Patrick?

                                  JANE
                    I might.

                                    FELICIA
                    Tell Sydney that I'm sorry.  I see 
                    now on reflection that I wasn't as 
                    good a stepmother to her as I might 
                    have been.  And I'm sorry for that.  
                    Though I did try.  I hope and pray 
                    she doesn't become bitter.  I hope 
                    she finds happiness in her life...

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS3939

      Sydney with Lisbon, watching Felicia.

                                    FELICIA
                    Because happiness is hard to find.  
                    Once you find it, you better hang 
                    on tight.  Or you might lose it. 

                                  JANE
                    True.

      Looking blindly through the one-way glass, Jane seems to look 
      directly to camera... Lisbon and Sydney leave the room.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
