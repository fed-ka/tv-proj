A COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation.
All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing.
Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.
To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers
and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and
soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.
CLOSER ON THE COUPLE
He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly
handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first
glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war
against time has been the undisputed victor.
Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders
strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are
touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging
disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself.
Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright.
Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her
and, if the past prevails, so many will come after.
She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking --
WILLS
-- and I could have waited to tell
you, but I wanted to leave no room
for misunderstanding.
WOMAN
Well, you certainly didn't.
Still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area
of the park--
WOMAN
No, I see how you could feel this
way. Of course I do. It's human. But
what I don't get is why you'd want
to announce it so quickly. I mean,
we just met. Feelings change. You
don't even know me.
WILLS
Yes, I do.
She is amused by his confidence --
WOMAN
Oh, really?
WILLS
The minute I laid eyes on you. It's
the saddest thing about getting older.
You know people so quickly. I even
knew you'd end up hating me.
WOMAN
Well, you're wrong. I don't.
WILLS
(with a weary smile)
Give it time.
She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops.
She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns
and looks, squinting into the sun.
He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO
DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs --
most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual-
bohemian look to them.
Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair,
willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an
eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright,
her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --
CHARLOTTE
-- and for weeks I sat by her bed
and cried. I told her I loved her
and I begged her not to leave me.
All I could think about was what I'd
lose if she died. And then one
night... she was in really bad pain...
I stopped thinking about myself for
a second and I thought about her.
(fighting tears)
I stopped crying. I said goodbye.
And in less than an hour Ella was
gone.
The woman whispers in Wills' ear --
WOMAN
It's so sad.
But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen
interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.
CHARLOTTE
I really think it's possible to hold
a person back... cry them back...
from dying. That's what I did to
Ella and I'll never do it to anyone
else again.
(softly)
I hope no one ever does it to me.
She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear
runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away.
The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --
WOMAN
So what do you know about her?
He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But
his answer is nonchalant --
WILLS
That she's just a kid.
He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away.
He steals one last look back.
Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills.
Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them.
Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --
OLD MAN
I met Ella at City College in 1938...
Wills slowly turns and walks away.
MUSIC AND TITLES IN:
A SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS ascends the steps to the bustling
street.
FIND CHARLOTTE amid the swarm, struggling with a load of
BOXES and SHOPPING BAGS, carrying an antique, wood-and-wire
DRESSMAKER'S MANNEQUIN.
She wears a peasant dress with a cycle jacket, a backpack,
and another eccentric hat.
Charlotte makes her way down the leaf-strewn pathway. Wheeling
the mannequin by the neck, she passes NYU STUDENTS smoking,
laughing, and chatting on their way to class.
Charlotte hauls the mannequin down the block. A YOUNG MAN
offers her assistance, but she politely and firmly refuses.
Charlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone
street, over the curb, and up to the stoop of a charming but
slightly dilapidated BROWNSTONE.
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides
to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT.
Its facade is windowless. Only a small brass plaque on the
grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM.
Wills and ERIKO, 30's, Japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge
from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door.
A gentle breeze tickles a white lace curtain. A PHONE RINGS.
A cold autumn rain falls. The Irish doorman, MICHAEL, 60's,
melancholy, stoop-shouldered, smokes a cigarette, looking up
at the unburdening sky.
A LIMOUSINE pulls up. The passenger window glides down --
DRIVER
Mikey! How ya doin'?
DOORMAN
A bit early, aren't you?
DRIVER
Hey, in this soup, better safe than
sorry, you know what I mean?
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS approach. Michael looks. The driver looks,
too.
It's Charlotte, dressed in tattered jeans, a light rain coat,
and sneakers, dashing at breakneck speed down the street,
carrying something in a GARBAGE BAG.
CHARLOTTE
KEANE!
She runs right past Michael --
Charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast. Wills
sits across from her, watching and worrying.
CHARLOTTE
Didn't anyone ever teach you that
it's bad manners to stare at a girl
when she's eating like a pig?
Wills chuckles, then his smile fades and he clears his throat.
WILLS
Listen --
CHARLOTTE
Uh-oh. Here it comes.
WILLS
That's right, because, look, I could
put this off, but I genuinely like
you. So I want to be clear... right
now... from the start, so there's no
chance for misunderstanding later.
CHARLOTTE
Okay.
WILLS
What I want to say you is.... well...
that all I can offer you is this...
what we have right now... nothing
more substantial... just this...
until it ends.
She looks at him. Lowers her fork. He adds almost reluctantly --
WILLS
The truth is, we have no future
together.
CHARLOTTE
I know. I'm dying.
Wills' face reddens slightly. He shifts uneasily in his chair.
A suggestion of a smile plays along his features --
WILLS
What... what do you mean?
CHARLOTTE
What I said. Nobody thought I'd even
last this long.
Wills stares at her blankly, not knowing what to think or
say.
CHARLOTTE
I could have put off telling you,
but I genuinely like you, so I wanted
to be clear... you know, right from
the start.
Olivia enters, takes her orange juice glass and leaves a
full one.
CHARLOTTE
Thanks, Olivia!
Charlotte gulps down the juice. Wills watches, his mind
reeling.
Wearing her tattered jeans from the night before, Charlotte
sits on the couch doing the New York Times crossword. Wills
emerges, walking slowly, pensively, as though in a trance.
Charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin --
CHARLOTTE
A real charmer, isn't he?
Wills doesn't react. He keeps walking toward her. Unsettled,
she holds up the puzzle.
CHARLOTTE
How are you on Cambodian money units?
Wills keeps advancing.
CHARLOTTE
Are you okay, old man? You look kinda
woozy.
(jokingly calling out)
Is there a doctor in the house?
Ignoring her, Wills sits down, takes her in his arms, and
embraces her. At first she resists, but slowly she surrenders
and hugs him back.
The threesome, in high spirits, bangs open a fire door.
Shannon is beside herself, frantically half-screaming --
SHANNON
I don't believe it! I don't believe
it!
SIMON
I think what Miss Harris is trying
to say, is that you've strained her
credulity.
CHARLOTTE
Really? Better put some ice on that.
Shannon lifts a hand to high-five her --
SHANNON
Girlfriend, you are so incredibly
cool!
SIMON
So I've been told.
Simon high-fives her instead. The girls laugh.
SHANNON
Okay, now tell us everything! Don't
leave anything out!
FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear --
JOHN'S VOICE
Okay, then what happened?
Wills stands stiffly at the door, holding a bouquet of
flowers. He stares at his own reflection in the porthole
window. He straightens his hair, tugs at the collar of his
cashmere jacket.
Footsteps approach. The door opens and there's Dolores, bleary-
eyed and disheveled. She smiles sourly --
DOLLY
Well, well.
Charlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the
hand.
WILLS
What do you mean, you knew?
CHARLOTTE
I did! I just didn't think it would
take so long!
WILLS
Two days is long?
CHARLOTTE
It is when you're sitting by the
phone. You wanna know how I knew?
WILLS
You're psychic?
CHARLOTTE
I am, but no -- it's because of my
birthday wish.
WILLS
But we hadn't even been introduced
yet.
CHARLOTTE
I know, but I wished that whatever
happened... you know, with my
illness... I'd go out with a bang.
Nothing heavy. No violins. No
melodrama. Just fun. A total
adventure!
Charlotte jumps off the curb.
WILLS
CAREFUL!
He yanks her back just as a TAXI, horn blaring, SPEEDS PAST,
nearly hitting her.
For a moment, they both stand there, hearts pounding,
breathing hard. Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins --
CHARLOTTE
Wow, it's getting exciting already.
Under a perfect blue sky, the park swarms with autumn
celebrants. Charlotte and Wills move together down a walkway.
Half-joyously and half comically, Charlotte addresses the
heavens with grand theatricality --
CHARLOTTE
"Lord, I do fear
Thou'st made the world too beautiful
this year!
My soul is all but out of me, -- let
fall
No burning leaf; prithee, let no
bird call!"
WILLS
We could go to a museum.
CHARLOTTE
No, that would be a thing! I don't
want to do any thing today. I want
to do no thing all day.
WILLS
Nothing at all?
CHARLOTTE
Uh-huh. No thing at all.
WILLS
So a movie is out.
CHARLOTTE
Way out!
WILLS
Ice cream at the Plaza? High tea at
the Palace?
CHARLOTTE
Both out.
WILLS
What about shopping?
She considers for a few moments --
CHARLOTTE
Possible.
WILLS
It's not a thing?
CHARLOTTE
Only when I have money.
The sidewalk swarms with pedestrians. Wills and Charlotte
emerge empty-handed from the revolving door of a department
store --
WILLS
But all I gave you was champagne.
That's not a proper birthday present.
CHARLOTTE
I agree, and I promise I'll let you
give me something else, but not today.
WILLS
When?
CHARLOTTE
Soon. But I'm warning you, it's not
going to be anything material.
WILLS
Why not?
(then solemnly)
Oh, I see... because you're sick.
Because --
CHARLOTTE
That's right, but we're not gonna
talk about that.
WILLS
How come?
CHARLOTTE
Because it's my rule.
WILLS
Any particular reason?
CHARLOTTE
Yeah, because everybody always wants
to talk about miracles, or about
some genius quack-doctor, or their
friend's friend who went into
remission eating nothing but sunflower
seeds. It's boring and pointless.
WILLS
Are you sure? I mean, there are
specialists who --
CHARLOTTE
Don't start, okay?
(abruptly)
Now what I would enjoy is taking you
shopping. For clothes. I'm serious.
It's quality not quantity, you know.
Dusk falls on the park. Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy,
carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze.
She smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN
COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating.
A cardboard ghost hangs on the door. A Jack-o'-lantern grins
in the window. A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing.
A TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan.
The town car is stopped at the curb, motor running, lights
on.
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI CAB breaks free and
glides to the curb in front of Elysium.
Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a
little too loudly. Wills seems stiff and tentative, a shadow
of his former self.
John walks quickly down the block, still hauling Wills --
JOHN
Last time I checked I was your best
friend!
WILLS
So?
JOHN
So after the party, no thank you! I
call you three times -- no call back!
And for six days you don't even eat
at your own god damn restaurant!
What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I
was ready to call the morgue!
WILLS
Relax, I'm alive.
JOHN
Well, you sure don't look it!
John walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to
keep up --
JOHN
I'll tell you why it's my concern!
Because I had a god damn swimming
pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon
tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi!
And I gave it up for you, brother!
Back to a life of concrete and dirt
and sirens just so you could get
your shit together!
John, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his
ears --
JOHN
On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'!
Not on my green chair! Tell me it
wasn't on the green chair.
Wills winces.
JOHN
Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean
that?
John walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious
Wills --
WILLS
Look, it doesn't matter that she's
sick -- she's still a kid and there's
no way we should be together. It's
unhealthy... it's... it's
inappropriate...
JOHN
(with disgust)
What the hell is that? Some sorta
shrink talk?
WILLS
Look, if she were just fun... just
some sort of diversion... maybe I
could justify it. But the worst part
is that it's becoming more. Much
more. It's embarrassing how much I
like her. She gets to me. She affects
me...
He stops and leans back against a building. He looks around,
avoiding eye contact with John, as tears rise into his eyes.
WILLS
And she's gonna be gone and... I'm
not sure I can... I mean... I already
think about her all the time...
(fighting tears)
Her smile kills me... and the
thought... that it'll be gone...
forever... that I'll never see her
again... I don't know... I can't --
I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny.
It's too much. I'd rather have it be
over... over now. I'll start missing
her now.
Wills is still unable to look at him. John speaks softly --
JOHN
Buddy, I hate to break it to you,
but in the real world... where I
live... there're only two kindsa
love stories. Boy loses girl and
girl loses boy. That's all there is.
Somebody always gets left behind.
You try to avoid that, you'll end up
an old man toastin' yourself with
egg nog in the mirror on Christmas
Eve. You'll end up dying in your own
arms.
Wills lifts his frightened eyes. John pats him on the cheek.
Wills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the glass
lobby. He is distracted and terribly anxious. She looks as
though she expects, at the very least, a kiss --
PATTY
Thank you so much. I had such a great
time.
WILLS
Good. I'm... I'm glad.
PATTY
Didn't you?
WILLS
Patty, I... I want to be honest with
you... right now, from the start...
so there's no room for
misunderstanding. I didn't have a
good time, but it's nothing personal.
I just split up with someone and
rather than admit to myself how much
I miss her, I asked you out instead.
And it's unfair. If I feel sad I
should just feel sad and not try to
use you... and your body... as some
sort of painkiller, right?
(beat)
Anyway, I think you're a warm and
engaging woman and I wish you all
the best.
Relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes
her hand. Patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her.
The doorman Michael, smoking a cigarette, sees Wills walk
up, his expression pensive.
MICHAEL
Mr. Keane --
WILLS
Good night, Michael.
MICHAEL
You've got a visitor.
Wills stops and turns --
WILLS
Who?
MICHAEL
She's been waitin' almost an hour.
In the lobby.
(off Wills' look)
A little surprise for ya.
He winks. Wills realizes that it's Charlotte. It must be. He
smiles and hurries inside.
THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN SLOWLY from a view of the sun rising
in the EASTERN SKY to a TAXI gliding over to the curb in
front of...
CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- DAWN
Charlotte, looking tired and a little pale, pays the driver
and emerges from the taxi. She makes her way up the steps.
Wills and Charlotte, collars turned up against the brisk
wind, walk together. Charlotte wears a backpack. Wills tries
desperately to appear casual --
WILLS
No, honestly, I think I have a right
to know.
CHARLOTTE
And I honestly think I have a right
not to tell you.
WILLS
You're being unreasonable.
CHARLOTTE
You're being nosy.
They move down a winding walkway beneath barren trees --
WILLS
You know, in this day and age it's
not so outrageous a request. I mean,
I don't know this kid. I don't know
where he's been.
CHARLOTTE
(laughing incredulously)
You're worried about where he's been?
Give me a break!
Wills watches as Charlotte laces up her figure skates --
WILLS
It requires balance and I have lousy
balance, okay?
CHARLOTTE
Oh, come on, what's the worst that
can happen?
(beat)
Well, I guess you could break a hip.
WILLS
Look, I'm not in a sporting mood!
CHARLOTTE
How come?
WILLS
I'm jealous, okay?! Is that what you
want to hear? Are you satisfied now?
She burst out laughing --
CHARLOTTE
Not even close!
Wills paces the bleachers, furious, while Charlotte skates
nearby --
WILLS
All I want is a simple answer and
you're torturing me! And I resent
it! It's cruel and juvenile! And I --
CHARLOTTE
(exploding)
HEY!
Her anger startles him. She skates over quickly and skids to
an abrupt stop --
CHARLOTTE
It's not! It's adult! It's revenge!
And if you think it's bad not knowing
what I did -- well, it's even worse
knowing exactly what you did!
She turns and skates away.
Wills sits on the bleachers, miserably brooding, while
Charlotte gracefully glides by, laughing and chatting with
THREE YOUNG MALE SKATERS whom she's just met.
They walk together in silence. Wills is sullen. Finally,
Charlotte takes his hand and speaks gently but firmly --
CHARLOTTE
Do me a favor, okay? Never ask me
again what happened with Eric. Just
accept the fact that you'll never,
ever know. And if that hurts, then
think about it next time you want to
cheat on somebody.
Wills reflects.
The building is brightly illuminated against the night sky.
Wills emerges from Charlotte's brownstone, hails a cab, then
decides against it.
Head down, eyes desolate, Wills walks uptown. The roaring
traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the
great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him.
He can think only of Charlotte.
Wills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold
night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red.
The darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze. Shadows
descend from the trees and towering rocks. AN OLD MAN sits
on a bench, reading a newspaper. A NANNY pushes a baby
carriage past.
Wills and Charlotte walk together, bundled up again the cold.
Charlotte walks backward, her breath shooting out into the
cold air like smoke --
CHARLOTTE
You never talk about my mother.
(beat)
Talk about her.
WILLS
What do you want to know?
CHARLOTTE
Everything. All I remember is that
she smelled like vanilla, loved to
read to me, and was really good at
cutting up fruit. I couldn't believe
she didn't cut her fingers off.
WILLS
Well, I remember a little more than
that. Let's see... she was blonde...
about your height --
CHARLOTTE
I've seen pictures, dummy.
WILLS
Oh, okay. She... always ate her ice
cream with a fork -- how's that?
CHARLOTTE
Much better.
WILLS
And she wrote great letters, but
couldn't spell at all.
CHARLOTTE
Neither can I.
WILLS
She was a McGovern Democrat but also
an incredible snob. She loved
blueberries. She had the world's
worst backhand. Her favorite singer
was Stephen Stills.
CHARLOTTE
Who?
WILLS
Never mind. She was afraid of sharks.
And, considering the times, she was
pretty square. She only tried drugs
once -- a lifeguard gave her a hash
brownie and she threw it up all over
him.
Charlotte laughs.
WILLS
And she laughed just like that. And
she bit her fingernails. And she
couldn't tell a joke.
(beat)
In short, she was a unique.
Charlotte smiles happily.
Wills and Charlotte lean down on the railing, watching the
water purl and eddy around Randall's Island.
CHARLOTTE
Did you know she was in love with
you?
WILLS
She told me.
CHARLOTTE
Were you in love with her?
WILLS
Yes.
CHARLOTTE
Why? Because she was the only girl
in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep
with you?
WILLS
That's how she got my attention;
it's not why I fell in love with
her.
(beat)
I fell in love with her because she
charmed me senseless day and night
for an entire summer.
CHARLOTTE
Then why did you screw her best friend
on Labor Day?
Wills looks at her darkly. She smiles and shrugs --
CHARLOTTE
It's just a question.
Wills sighs and looks away, reflecting --
WILLS
I have no idea. The summer was over.
Your mom was going back to Smith. I
was moving down here to work on Wall
Street. It was our last day together.
She was crying. She told me, for the
first time, that she loved me. I
said I loved her, too. I promised to
call and visit. A few hours later I
was in a cabana with Millie.
(beat)
When Millie told me she was pregnant
and that she wanted to marry me, I
escaped to L.A... and I never saw
her or your mom again.
CHARLOTTE
(wryly)
Well done.
WILLS
I think it's part of the reason I
never came back.
CHARLOTTE
But why're you like that? What is
it? I mean, you weren't born that
way.
WILLS
I might as well have been. For as
long as I can remember, I've always
run off at the first sign of a woman
wanting anything from me... relying
on me in any way.
She considers for a moment --
CHARLOTTE
But I want everything from you, Wills.
I rely on you in every way.
WILLS
I know.
CHARLOTTE
So the only reason you don't dump me
is because I'm sick? Because you
know that it's all going to be over,
anyway?
WILLS
Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way.
(beat)
It feels as though I'm not afraid
anymore.
She looks at him and smiles. He puts an arm around her and
draws her close.
On the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols.
All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along.
Wills and Charlotte get out of the cab. His arm around her,
Wills pulls her into the crowd. They join the carol. Wills
sings well. Charlotte is tone deaf.
In between lines of the song, she calls out --
CHARLOTTE
I didn't know you could sing!
WILLS
I didn't know you couldn't!
She laughs and continues to sing.
THE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause. THE CHOIRMASTER steps
forward to a microphone --
CHOIRMASTER
Well, you all know what time it is!
CHARLOTTE
(confused to Wills)
No, I don't. Do you?
He grins. The choirmaster nods at someone in the distance.
Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count
down. The crowd joins in --
CHOIRMASTER AND CROWD
TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE,
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE!
At that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees
of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON
SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle.
The crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns.
Charlotte's eyes are filled with happy wonder.
CHOIRMASTER
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
As another carol begins, Wills wraps his arms around Charlotte
and kisses her. He pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes,
and whispers with passionate sincerity --
WILLS
I love you, Charlotte.
For an instant, her eyes flare as though she were surprised.
Then her eyes fill with tears. She tries to speak but she is
choked by a sob.
She buries her face in his chest and cries. Wills smiles
with warm, almost paternal, indulgence. He strokes her hair.
She hugs him as though she'll never let go.
A TOWN CAR is parked out front. Michael, the doorman, chats
with the driver.
LISA (V.O.)
His name's Tom Grandy. Harvard
undergrad. Columbia Medical School.
He's at the Cleveland Clinic. I know,
I know. But don't laugh. It's one of
the best in the world.
Wills exits the building and gets into the car.
The town car speeds down the expressway.
LISA (V.O.)
He did his residency at the Brigham
in Boston... his cardiac surgery
training at Cleveland.
Wills walks quickly through the terminal.
LISA (V.O.)
He was so good they kept him on and
within three years he was chief of
the program.
Wills gets out of a taxi and heads inside --
LISA (V.O.)
He travels a lot. Spends lots of
time lecturing. I got you an
appointment tomorrow at twelve-thirty.
Don't be late. He only has fifteen
minutes.
Charlotte, lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing an oxygen
mask, is rushed into a waiting ambulance. Wills, beside
himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping
in with her.
The ambulance rushes, light flashing, sirens wailing,
downtown.
Grandy is rushed into a MEDICAL HELICOPTER.
Grandy's helicopter speeds toward the City.
The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out.
MUSIC OUT:
A COUPLE walks down the same walkway. They are deep in subdued
conversation. All around them spring is in full glory. Melted
snow. Trees exploding with green. Birds singing.
The man is Wills Keane, but he has markedly changed. His
dress is not so impeccable, his hair has gone grey at the
temples. His face, though still beautiful, has gracefully
turned the corner into middle age.
Walking at his side is his daughter, Lisa, now well along in
her pregnancy --
LISA
Actually, to be honest, Peter's more
than a little freaked. I mean, how
could he not be? He's twenty-six.
His first child. A baby girl, no
less. Nothing really prepares you
for it.
WILLS
I guess not.
LISA
He said it's the first time since we
got married that he's actually
realized what marriage is. That it's
forever. That he can't just pick up
and run away to Nepal or something
if we have a fight. That he's part
of the cycle of things now. That
he's gonna die some day. That it's
the next generation's turn to take
the stage.
Wills and Lisa walk together in silence, enjoying the perfect
afternoon. Then Lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder --
LISA
So what about you, Mr. Keane? You
ready to be a grandpa?
Wills looks over at the spot where he first saw Charlotte.
He smiles with wistful confidence then, a little awkwardly,
puts his arm around his daughter.
She is surprised at first. But then slowly, trustingly, she
rests her head on his shoulder.
And they walk.
