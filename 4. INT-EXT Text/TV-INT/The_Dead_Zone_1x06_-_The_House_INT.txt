          As Johnny enters, moves into the living room and begins
          to thumb through the mail, typical collection junk mail,
          some catalogues, bills, and a manilla envelope from a
            lawyer...  Johnny reacts to that one and opens it...


          CLOSE - ON THE DOCUMENTS

          A cover letter from a law office briefly states that these
            documents have been in their possession for several years
          and are forwarding them for Johnny's files.  We don't
          have to read that... but as Johnny flips through them, we
          can see the papers are related to his mother's estate,
            including her signed will.


          JOHNNY - CLOSE

          as Johnny touches the will, suddenly the silence is
          interrupted by the CREAK of a wood floor... Behind him,
          we see - but he doesn't - the legs of a child in short
          pants crossing the foyer shrouded in shadows.  Johnny
          reacts, turns too late to see anything...


          MOVING WITH HIM

          as he moves into the hallway... listens... nothing...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Hello...?

          He hears a footstep and turns too late to see anything,
          but out of the corner of his eye --


          ANGLE - THE STAIRWAY

          One of the shadows barely moves before it disappears into
          the darkness going up the stairs... Johnny reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, gang.  Fun's over.  Not in
                        my house, okay?

          Begins to climb the stairs...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    6.

          TOP OF THE STAIRS

          he pauses...


          P.O.V. - DOWN A LONG UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 

          Barely a glimpse of a shadow disappearing into the master
          bedroom...


          JOHNNY

          moves down the long hallway...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not fooling around now.

          ...reaches the master bedroom.



          Vera Smith's old bedroom - not a room that Johnny goes in
          often - curtains are drawn; it's dark, gloomy... he moves
          inside, looks around...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you're in here...

          He walks through the dark room... moves to the bathroom
          door which is closed... he opens it slowly... the door
          creaks as he does... he switches on the light and enters...



          Tiled with antique porcelain fixtures - all sparkling
          white.  Johnny looks around curiously at the empty room
          and is about to leave when he hears a gurgle from...


          THE DRAIN IN THE TUB

          The gurgle continues as...


          JOHNNY

          leans down to look at

          THE DRAIN

          as a trickle of blood backs up into the tub...


          JOHNNY

          reacts as...


          THE TRICKLE BECOMES A FLOOD

          Blood filling the tub... and faster, punctuated intercuts
          with --


          JOHNNY - CLOSE-UPS -  FREEZE FRAMES

          reacting with horror as...


          THE TUB OVERFLOWS

          and blood spills all over the white tiled floor and...


          JOHNNY

          recoils back into the bedroom trying to escape....


          THE RIVER OF BLOOD

          coming toward him from the bathroom door... but as it
          reaches...


          JOHNNY

          it disappears as the vision ends and...


          NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY

            reacts... looks back into the bathroom which is as clean
          and white as it was before.  On his reaction...

          FADE IN:


          Purdy strolling with Dana eating a Good Humor bar on a
          stick... he acknowledges students as they walk... 

                                        DANA
                        He's keeping a low profile, stays
                        home a lot...

                                        PURDY
                        Is he seeing anyone?

                                        DANA
                        One date.  If you ask me, I think
                        he still has an eye for the
                          sheriff's wife.

                                        PURDY
                                  (concerned)
                        Oh, we don't want that.  We need
                        to find Johnny a good god-fearing
                        woman.

          A pair of comely co-eds pass by and smile at Purdy... he
          gives them a warm nod...

                                        DANA
                        Why, we might even find one right
                        here on the university campus.

                                        PURDY
                        I just want him to be happy. 
                        Loving another man's wife will
                        lead to nothing but trouble.

                        and over...

                                        PURDY
                        I'm happy to hear you're still
                        reading it.
                                (beat, casual)
                        God has spoken to me about Johnny,
                        Dana.

                                (grins)
                        He told me the world needs a little
                        Johnny Smith right now.  If Johnny
                          inspires faith and a belief in a
                        greater power, God would welcome
                        it.

                                        DANA
                        You make him sound like a prophet.

                                        PURDY
                        No, Dana, you do.  You and all
                        the other reporters.

                        My editor is increasingly
                        skeptical.

                                        PURDY
                        There will always be skeptics. 
                        Can Johnny do what people think
                        he can do?  Who knows?  The
                          important thing now is to put the
                        story of Johnny Smith in the proper
                          context.  In difficult times,
                        people need something or someone
                        to believe in.  Why not Johnny
                        Smith?

                                        DANA
                                (getting his drift)
                        The son of one of the founders of
                        the Faith Heritage Alliance.

                                (takes the last bite
                                of his ice cream)
                        Mention that in your next story,
                        won't you?  Attendance is down
                        seven percent this year.

          He nods hi to another co-ed.  



          The dark quiet emptiness makes it unsettling.  As Johnny
          enters, he pauses as he hears the sound of A WOMAN
            CRYING... inconsolable weeping... it's coming from upstairs
          again... 



          as Johnny reaches the top of the stairs and the sound of
          the sobbing is closer... and once again, it's coming from
          the master bedroom...

          JOHNNY

          moves to the door which is closed.  Johnny slowly opens
          it.


  1414HIS POV - THE ROOM

          is empty and the crying has stopped but the window is
          open and the draft makes the curtains blow lightly,
            eerily... a rocking chair by the window slowly eases back
          and forth in the breeze... there's a photograph of Vera
          and five-year-old Johnny on the nightstand...


          JOHNNY

          enters the room cautiously, turns on the light... shuts
          the window... wondering who left it open... we move with
          him to...


          ANGLE TO THE BATHROOM

          which has a bathtub filling with blood...


            A REVERSE ANGLE PAST JOHNNY AS HE REACTS TO THE TUB

          to include the open door to the hall... we catch a shocking
          glimpse of a shadowy figure of an old woman as she moves
          past the door in the hall behind him... (Later, we will
            recognize her as MRS. RUNYON, 56, the housekeeper who
          died of cancer a few years ago.)  Johnny never sees her.

          We hear A WINDOW BREAKING downstairs... Johnny reacts...

          The bathroom is normal again.

          He hears the sound of RUNNING FEET outside... he frowns,
          moves quickly out of the room...


          DOWN THE STAIRS - JOHNNY

          moves quickly to investigate the broken glass... sees a
          small window broken with a rock inside on the floor with
          the glass... looks out the broken window to see the kids
          scrambling for cover... bolts out --          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT ONE - 4/11/02 - WHITE  14.



          Johnny enters... but his movement toward the stairs is
          halted when he catches two dark figures moving through
          the shadows of the living room... he reacts... moves
          quickly into the living room and sees....


          THE FIGURES

          moving away toward the other door... pausing to glance
          back in his direction... and their faces are illuminated
          for an instant by moonlight from a window... and it's the
            damnedest thing you've ever seen because it sure as hell
          looks like Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe... and then
          they move out of view and disappear into the shadows...


          JOHNNY

          reacts with appropriate confusion... but his attention is
          promptly drawn to an eerie sound coming from upstairs...
          a young boy singing...

                                        BOY'S VOICE
                        "This little light of mine... I'm
                        gonna let it shine... this little
                        light of mine... I'm gonna let it
                          shine..."

          He moves back to the staircase, looks up toward the voice.

                        light shine."



          VERA, age 31, is sitting, brushing the hair of FIVE YEAR
          OLD JOHNNY who is wearing short pants, singing "Let It
          Shine" (they are the same pair in the photograph on the
            nightstand)...

                                        FIVE YEAR OLD
                        "On Monday, he gave me the gift
                        of love; On Tuesday, peace came
                        from above..."

          Move to find adult Johnny entering at the door watching...
          Vera joins the child for the next few lines (using as
          much of the song as necessary to support the action)...

                                        VERA & FIVE YEAR OLD
                        On Wednesday told me to have a
                        little more faith; On Thursday,
                        gave me a little more grace.

          Johnny moves inside slowly and kneels down and looks at
          the boy who doesn't see or acknowledge his presence...

                                        VERA & FIVE YEAR OLD
                        On Friday, told me to watch and
                        pray; On Saturday told me just
                        what to say.  On Sunday, gave
                        power divine; Just to let my little
                        light shine...

          As Johnny reaches out to touch the boy that he once was,
          the mother and child vanish, the last line of the song
          drifting off into echoes... as we stay on Johnny as he
          reacts to the creaking of...

          ...that moves back and forth, back and forth, as it faces

          But Johnny is already on the move into Walt's office before
          Roscoe can finish... closes the door behind him.  Roscoe
          never had the chance to call Walt, so he thinks and then
          dials an outside number...

                                                                  INTERCUTTING WITH:



          A dark deserted room, a long time since anyone used it...
          dusty, drop cloths, packing boxes...

                                        BRUCE
                        It's been awhile since anyone had
                        a party in this room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's Mary Poppins, Lawrence of
                        Arabia, James Bond... and Elvis
                        and Marilyn doing a cha-cha, I
                        wasn't crazy...

                                        BRUCE
                        No, but I say we get out of this
                          house...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't leave yet.



          Matching their movement...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        There's gotta be a reason I'm
                        seeing this...

                                        BRUCE
                        Why do white people always stay
                        in the house?

          He moves to Marilyn and Elvis who are doing the cha-cha
          on the dance floor... they don't acknowledge Johnny...
          but Johnny gets a close look at Marilyn Monroe...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It isn't Marilyn Monroe.  It's my
                        mother.
                                (looking at Elvis)
                        And father.  They're so young.

          The song ends... and everyone laughs, party walla... and
          some clap... Johnny's dad, HERBERT (29) holds on to his
          wife...

                                        HERBERT
                        Wait... before we put on another
                          record... we have an
                          announcement...

          Bruce moves beside the bar, standing, without realizing
          it beside a man who is dressed as Zorro... with a black
          cape and a handkerchief mask and the typical hat... we'll
          come to realize this is a YOUNG GENE PURDY...

                                        HERBERT
                        We're going to have a baby.

          Everyone cheers.  Rush to congratulate them, slap him on
          the back, hugs and so forth... young Vera's cheeks turn
          rosy, blushing...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (repeating for Bruce)
                        We're going to have a baby.  My
                        mom's pregnant!  With me.



                                        BRUCE
                                (dry)
                          Congratulate the happy couple for
                        me.



          Purdy, next to Bruce, is clearly heartsick at the news...
          hides his reaction as everyone else moves to the couple. 
          Johnny notices (and recognizes him because he's known
          Purdy all his life)...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Zorro doesn't seem very happy for
                        them.  It's Purdy.  Right beside
                        you.

          Bruce looks the wrong way at the bar... as though to

                        How ya doin', Reverend?

          Someone pops some champagne and in mid-spritz, time seems
          to stand still... the action freezes, Johnny moves slowly
          through the still-life people to Purdy who is clearly
          bitter in this moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was before he was a Reverend. 
                        But not before he loved my mother. 
                        When I was growing up, I used to
                        hate it when he came around...
                        there was always mom and dad...
                        and this other guy...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, you mean, like Walt 'n Sarah
                        'n you.

          That cuts through Johnny like a knife because it's true...



          looking at Johnny's continued reaction...

                                        BRUCE
                        He loved her his whole life.  But
                        you still think he killed her.

          It challenges Johnny's assumptions... suddenly, he's not
          so sure... his eyes fill with uncertainty... looks back
          at --



          The action jump starts.  Purdy tries to compensate for
          his bitterness... he's already a little drunk... fills
          his glass with more champagne... puts on a brave face...

                                        PURDY
                          A toast!  A toast!

          As the crowd quiets...

                                        JOHNNY
                        She never married him.  Even after
                        dad died.  And I know he asked
                        her more than once.

                          Maybe... she rejected him once
                        too often.

          But he's not sure.  Could this man who loved his mother
          actually be driven to kill her some day?  It's all part
          of the mystery for Johnny.

          Voices cheer, 'hear, hear'... classes clink... and Purdy's
          eyes barely betray his sadness...

          And Johnny's cell phone rings in the present... ending*
          the vision and we're back in...



          Johnny answers the cell phone on his belt...*

                          I tracked down Art Paulson, the
                        ex-sheriff for you.  He said he
                        was at your house about noon. 
                        Didn't see anything suspicious.

                        You believe him?

                        Why wouldn't I believe him?  Unless
                        you've come up with some kind of
                          evidence...

                        No.  But I did find out that Elvis
                        and Marilyn were my parents.

                        want you hanging around my house? 
                        Look, there was one thing, I know
                        what you're gonna say, but it

                        I'd known Mrs. Runyon for years. 
                        We needed help.  She needed a
                        job.  Are you accusing me of
                        something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for stopping by, Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        'Gene', please.  Aren't we past
                          formalities after all this time?

          Johnny grins pleasantly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's hard to break a habit.  After
                        all, I was brought up to call you
                          'Reverend'.

          And we begin a remarkable ballet that will take us through
          this sequence - as the people Johnny and we have seen in


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT FOUR - 4/11/02 - WHITE  41.

          the house during his visions, move about the present day
          action.  For musical theater fans, it may remind of the
            showgirls of the past that haunt the stage of Stephen
          Sondheim's Follies.  Johnny and we see them; obviously
          Purdy does not.

          Our camera is moving, fluid throughout and we pick up
          glimpses of them as the camera moves by them... or they
          move in and out of shadows...  Here, the five year old
          Johnny in short pants plays on the floor with a toy of
          the era... 

                                        PURDY
                        Well, it seemed more appropriate
                        when you were five.  And the
                          alternative would have been, augh,
                        'Uncle Gene'...

          Johnny laughs casually, nods as they walk into the living
          room...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I get you something?

                                        PURDY
                        No, I'm fine...

                                        JOHNNY
                        A soft drink?  A glass of
                        champagne?  

          Vera as Mariyn Monroe laughs and drinks champagne in the
            background...

                                        PURDY
                        I'm fine, thank you. 

          They sit.  Purdy on a couch.  Johnny takes a chair across
          the room a few feet, sits on the footrest.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I asked you to come over because
                        I still have questions about mom...

                                        PURDY
                        If there's anything I can do to
                        put your mind at ease...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I appreciate that, Gene.  Maybe
                        there is.
                                (beat)
                        It's interesting.

                        Living in a house where you and
                        your family have lived for what? -
                        fifty years?

                                        PURDY
                                (nods)
                        Your mom and dad bought this house
                        in the sixties.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        You walk in your own footsteps...
                        and theirs... and most of the
                        time never stop to think about
                        it.  But they were right here in
                        this room...

          Another Vera, the one who brushed little Johnny's hair,
          moves by...

                          halls... sleeping in these beds...
                        dancing at parties...

                                        PURDY
                        There were some wonderful times
                        in this house.  Your dad was such
                        a good friend...

          Elvis moves by...

                        It's not easy to remember him
                          sometimes...

                                        PURDY
                        You were still a little boy when
                        he passed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In a way, I almost feel a part of
                        him is still here, with me.  Not
                        in a literal sense, of course. 
                        But a trace of him.  A molecule. 
                        I can see him sometimes.  I can
                        see Mom too...

                        about your... abilities.  At an
                          appropriate time, I'd... I'd love
                        to explore the spiritual meaning

          Johnny is on his feet, Purdy rises uncertainly, follows
          him...


  5151MOVING WITH THEM UP THE STAIRS

          From upstairs, the sound of a woman crying... the five
          year old, runs by them up the stairs...

                                        FIVE YEAR OLD
                        "This little light of mine... I'm
                        gonna let it shine... This little
                        light of mine..."

                                (to Purdy)
                        This'll just take a sec.



          The old housekeeper rushes past them in the hallway... as
          Johnny leads the way to...



          As they enter.  Johnny turns on the lights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is where I've been seeing
                        those visions I talked to you
                          about... 

          Vera brushes five-year-old Johnny's hair...

                        Johnny, you never had a chance to
                        mourn her passing.  This may be
                        your mind's way of...

                        But one of the images in this
                        room that I find the most confusing
                        is the one of... you... Gene...

                        With blood on your hands.

          Purdy's eyes narrow.  This is his first direct exposure
          to Johnny's powers... there's a long beat...

                                        PURDY

5454A VISION BEGINS - SAME ROOM FIVE YEARS AGO - PURDY

          Blood on his hands as we saw in the earlier flash... then
          after a long beat of this...

                        Does anyone else know about this?

                        Nossir.  I called you right after
                        I found her... 

          And finding Johnny standing there, forcing himself to
          watch... Purdy is kneeling by the bloody bathtub, the
          figure of Vera's nude body is suggested but blocked by
          Purdy and the housekeeper... Purdy bows his head and says
          a quiet prayer for Vera... Johnny sees a bloody razor
          blade on the side of the tub.

          rises, moves back into the room, there are tears in his
          eyes... moves to the phone... dials...

                        This is Gene Purdy.  I need a
                        hearse out at Vera Smith's house. 
                        She died in her sleep last night. 
                        The housekeeper found her this
                          morning.  ...Yes, she's to be
                        taken to our mortuary and cremated
                          immediately.  No, I'll contact
                        the Sheriff's office, thank-you.

          Purdy collects himself and turns to Mrs. Runyon.

                          couldn't.  She spent almost every
                        day in this room, crying, sitting
                        in her rocking chair... staring
                        out the window...

          Johnny turns and sees an older, tortured Vera Smith sitting
          in the rocking chair looking out the window...

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        They told her you'd never recover.   
                        She'd lost her only son.  And her
                        faith in God.

          Johnny moves closer to examine the mournful eyes of his
            mother...

                                        PURDY
                        I made the choice to protect her
                        name and her legacy. 

          Johnny looks to him...

                                        PURDY
                        And yours, Johnny.



          Moments later... in the foreground, Dana is interviewing
          Mr. Davis in the living room... family pictures are
            scattered about.  They react as the front door opens and
          Johnny and Lindsay enter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry to bother you at a time
                        like this... but I have to talk
                        to Mrs. Davis...

          And Mr. Davis doesn't want the weirdo next door anywhere
          near his wife...

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        She's not seeing anyone...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir, it's very important.

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        Look, I don't want to be rude...
                        I'm sure you're a very nice man
                        but I don't want you here, okay...

          Dana sees the urgency in Johnny's face... isn't sure what's
            happening but wants to be supportive...

                                        DANA
                        Mr. Davis, I know how it must
                        seem but I've seen Johnny do some
                        remarkable things...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT FOUR - 4/11/02 - WHITE  50.


    64CONTINUED:64

                                        MR. DAVIS
                                (losing patience)
                          Remarkable.  Our son is gone. 
                        Can you bring him back to life?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's your wife I'm concerned about. 
                        Her life, sir.

          Davis reacts. 

                                        LINDSAY
                        Dad.  Let him.

          Davis looks at his daughter...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Please.

          And against his better judgment, he leads the way
          upstairs...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Lindsay)
                        Stay here.

          Johnny looks to Dana who acknowledges she'll watch the
          girl, puts a comforting hand on her shoulder...



          As Mr. Davis enters with Johnny... Mrs. Davis is sitting
          by the window... depressed and detached... her eyes are
          cried out... she's sullen, angry at life itself... she
          turns and sees Johnny entering... 

                                        MRS. DAVIS
                                (dull, to Johnny)
                        Please.  Go away.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Davis, I've seen you at the
                          window...

                                        MRS. DAVIS
                        Leave us alone!

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        This isn't a good...
                                (idea)

          But Johnny has seated himself opposite the woman...

                        Maybe Lindsay has told you... I
                        sense things sometimes... I sensed
                          something about you, tonight...

          Her eyes connect with his... he puts his hand on hers...

          in her hand... 


  6767RESUME

          Mrs. Davis looks at him.  She knows he knows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Davis, the pain you feel...
                        I can't say it will go away soon...
                        but I'm sure if your son could
                        speak to you now, he would want
                        you to know...

          Moving as we did in Johnny's house - to find the image of
            Lindsay's brother in his uniform and he speaks in unison
          with Johnny this one line:

                                        JOHNNY & BROTHER
                        ...that you are loved and needed
                        in this house.

          That's all and then Johnny finishes...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        This house could never recover if
                        you were to do harm to yourself.

          She begins to cry.  Her husband rushes over and embraces
          her.  The image of the brother is gone.

                                        MR. DAVIS
                                (to Johnny)
                        You're upsetting her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Davis...

                                        MR. DAVIS
                          ...Just, just please leave...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT FOUR - 4/22/02 - Pink  51A.

                        ... You were going to do it,
                        weren't you...

          And she just looks at him as tears flow and finally she
          nods... she looks to her husband, desperate for help. 
          Shocked, he holds her as she cries in his arms...

                        We'll get help.  We'll get through
                        this.
                                (to Johnny, awkwardly)
                        I need to take her to the hospital.
                          I wonder if... I know that I have
                        no right to ask after the way
                        I... but...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (understands)
                        I'll look after Lindsay while
                        you're gone.

          Davis nods in appreciation.
