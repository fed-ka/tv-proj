      BOONE S eye snaps open -- watching SAYID.  From a distance...

      SAYID

      Carrying a box, approching SHANNON.  She is in her bathing 
      suit reading the well-thumbed, passed-around copy of 
       Watership Down .

      Shannon looks up and sees Sayid, approaching.  She s not 
      unhappy to see him.

                                  SAYID
                    I brought you a present.

                                    SHANNON
                    Did someone open a mall on the 
                    island?

                                  SAYID
                    For helping me with the 
                      translations... Sorry, I didn t 
                    have a chance to get it gift 
                    wrapped.

      He hands her the box.  She smiles, curiosity piqued, and 
      lifts the lid to reveal the box holds a beautiful pair of 
      designer shoes.*

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I found these in a pile of things *
                    rescued from the wreckage and have *
                    no use for them personally.

      Shannon is amused.

                                  SHANNON
                    They re actually my size.  Well, 
                    half a size off, but I think this 
                    place is actually making my feet 
                    swell.

                                  SAYID
                    Another mysterious force on the 
                    island revealed.

      BACK TO BOONE

      Watching Sayid sit with her.  They are smiling and joking and  *
      are even a bit flirtatious.  Sayid is taking the longer  *
      approach of getting into Shannon s life through friendship. *

      None of which pleases Boone.

                                  HURLEY
                    Yo, Boone.

      He s pulled from his reverie as HURLEY walks up.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Question for ya, dude.

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah?

                                  HURLEY
                    You and Locke are goin  out every 
                    day and hunting boar, right?

                                  BOONE
                    What about it?

                                  HURLEY
                    It s cool, except... how come 
                    you re not comin  back with any?

      Hurley is not happy about this.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    We haven t had any fresh pork on 
                    the plate in a week, dude.

                                  BOONE
                    It s not like they re domesticated 
                    animals.

                                  HURLEY
                    Maybe you re not trying hard *
                    enough.*

      Boone just wants to be done with this discussion.*

                                  BOONE
                    We re hunting, all right?

      Hurley regards him dubiously.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     3.

                                  HURLEY
                    Right on.  I hope so, because 
                    people need food.  You know, solid 
                    food.  This isn t a game, man.

      OFF BOONE:


      Boone and NICOLE, 20, a cute California rich girl have just 
      finished playing tennis.  They are walking from the court up 
      toward the clubhouse.

                        BOONENICOLE
    I can t believe you ran down 
      that last ball.  Then hit if 
      for a winner.Lucky shot...

                                  BOONE
                          (grins)
                    Yeah!  I wish it was luck.

      Playful banter.  Boone has his arm around her.  Obviously, 
      Nicole and Boone are in a relationship.

      Boone s cellphone RINGS.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, hello?

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                    Boone, it s me.

      Instantly his demeanor changes.  He separates from Nicole, 
      without even realizing it.

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon?

      He HASN T HEARD from her in a while.

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                    Yeah.  Hey...

      And there s SOMETHING BAD in her voice.  Boone KNOWS HER and 
      SENSES it INSTANTLY --

                                  BOONE
                    What s the matter?

      Nicole completely vanishes from Boone s radar.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     4.

                          (finally; in a smaller 
                            voice)
                    Things aren t so good.

                                  BOONE
                    Where are you?

      Nicole wants to know what this is all about.

                                  NICOLE
                    Who is it?

                                  BOONE
                          (cups phone)
                    It s my sister.

      Clearly a higher priority, as in  stay out of it. 

      MOVING CLOSER ON BOONE we HEAR THE BLEED of Shannon s side of 
      the conversation -- getting heated now -- like the Nicole 
      Brown Simpson 911 call.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                      Shannon...?

      Someone s in her apartment; she SLAMS the BATHROOM DOOR.  We 
      hear SHOUTING (A MAN in the b.g.), BITS and PIECES of 
      CONVERSATION.  And now Shannon saying --

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                          (off phone to someone)
                    Just -- stay out of here!  Get 
                    away from me!

                                  BOONE
                    What s going on?!

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                    I can t talk right now.

                                  BOONE
                    All right -- Hang on -- I ll come 
                    get you.  Just tell me where you 
                    are.

                                    SHANNON
                          (long pause)
                    Sydney.

                                  BOONE

      Sayid walks across the beach when suddenly BOONE CROSSES HIS 
      PATH -- and this is no coincidental meeting.

                                  BOONE
                    Stay away from my sister.

      Sayid gives Boone the once over, completely unintimidated by 
      this  lifeguard  boy.

                                  SAYID
                          (deadly smile)
                    For a moment you seemed to be 
                    giving me an order.

                        BOONESAYID
      It s a friendly suggestion ---- A suggestion, huh?

      And if I were you, I d -- And if I don t?
      listen. --

      The men are up in each other s personal spaces by now.  This 
      could go someplace -- but before it can escalate further --

                                  LOCKE (O.S.)
                    Boone!

      Boone TURNS -- on the call of THAT VOICE --

      LOCKE

      Standing on the edge of the jungle, carrying a supply pack.  
      He sees exactly what s going on.  Defuses it with a lie --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    I found fresh tracks up by the 
                    stream.

      Boone starts moving away -- pulled by Locke -- but he holds 
      Sayid s look.

                                  BOONE
                    I ll see you later.

                                  SAYID
                    You know where to find me.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     6.

      Boone breaks it off, strides over to meet Locke and walks 
      away WITH HIM into the jungle.

      OFF Sayid, concern growing about Locke s influence.


      From a HIGH ANGLE we watch Boone and Locke trekking through 
      the jungle.  Sweating.  Obviously hiking for a while.

      CLOSER NOW --

                                  LOCKE
                    You need to put aside your 
                      differences with Sayid.

                                  BOONE
                    He s hitting on Shannon.

                                  LOCKE
                    We don t want to make an enemy of 
                    him.  We re gonna want him on our 
                    side.  He s very competent.

      Boone reacts.  Who even knew there were sides?  Boone isn t 
      sure where ANY OF THIS IS GOING -- asks --

                                  BOONE
                    John... people are talking... what 
                    we re doing out here every day.  
                      Especially since we never come back 
                    with anything...

                                  LOCKE
                    You mean boar.

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah.

      The jungle is REALLY DARK AND MYSTERIOUS now.  And we re 
      getting that deja vu feeling.  We ve been here before.

                                  LOCKE
                    No lack of fruit and fish to go 
                    around.

      Locke slows to a stop and looks all around.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    What we re doing here... is far 
                    more important.

      Locke begins to pull some brush and fronds off that are 
      acting as camouflage covering the archaeological dig he and 
      Boone began in episode 109 --

      OVER THEIR BACKS WE CRANE UP TO REVEAL

      Their progress in just a few days.  The jungle undergrowth 
      and dirt are all gone and what we see there freaks us out 
      because it is --

    A HATCH

      Six feet across, rectangular, made of metal and buried in the 
      jungle floor.  Looks like stainless steel with a heavy hinge 
      on one side and thick rivets all the way around it.

      The hatch is slightly raised/concave.  About one-third of the 
    way down the hatch there is a very thick, clouded STEEL-
      FRAMED GLASS WINDOW.  The rest of the hatch is smooth.  No 
      latch.  No obvious way to open it.

      Trippy?  Strange?  SCARY?  Fuck yes.  What the hell is this 
      thing?  Why is it buried there in the jungle ground?  Who put 
      it there?  And when?  All very good questions.

      The very questions that Locke and Boone have been pondering 
      for the last few days.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Right now this is our priority.

      FADE IN:


      JACK walks the path from the NEW BEACH toward the caves.  As 
      he walks, Hurley catches up with him.

                                  HURLEY
                    So... Jack.

                                  JACK
                    So... Hurley.

                                  HURLEY
                      Something... kinda important I been 
                    meaning to ask ya about...
                          (clearly embarrassed)*
                    Anything I tell you... it s *
                      Doctor/Patient stuff -- *
                      confidential right?*

      Jack just looks at Hurley.  Of course. *

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Okay -- Thing is?  I haven t really *
                    been feeling too great...

                                  JACK
                    What s the matter?

                                  HURLEY
                    It s sort of like... my stomach?  
                    I ve got some major... digestive 
                      problems...

      Jack nods, falling into DIAGNOSTIC MODE.  Throughout the 
      following, Hurley keeps PICKING LEAVES.  Feeling their 
      textures, keeping some, discarding others.

                                  JACK
                    What have you been eating?

                                  HURLEY
                    Just some bananas... mangos... 
                    papayas... guavas... passion 
                    fruit... coconut...
                          (thinks)
                    ...and some of those weird star 
                    fruit from up on the hill.  Someone

                    But lemme tell ya... they lied.

                                  JACK
                    It might help if you had some more 
                    protein in your diet.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude... What can I do?  There s no 
                    boar.  No boar, no protein.

                                  JACK
                    You can eat fish.  Jin s catching a 
                    lot of  em.

                                  HURLEY
                    No way.  That guy has it in for me.

      Jack gives Hurley a look.  Laughs good-naturedly.

                                  JACK
                    C mon, Hurley --

                                  HURLEY
                    I m not kidding.  He offered me 
                    something to eat right after we -- 
                    you know -- got here.  The thing 
                    with the spikes.

                                  JACK
                    Sea urchin.

                                  HURLEY
                    Yeah, sea urchin.  I turn him down 
                    and it s like I soiled his family 
                    honor or something.  He hasn t 
                    looked me in the eye since.  Guy 
                    holds some kinda serious grudge.

      Hurley STOPS.  Suddenly panicky.  Fiddles with the pile of 
      leaves in his hand -- which Jack notices for the first time --

                                  JACK
                    You re not eating those, are 
                    you...?

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude.  These are not for eating.

      The change of expression completely overtakes Hurley s face.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"     (YELLOW)       11/9/04         10.

      And with that, Hurley runs off into the bushes.  As Hurley 
      scurries off to do his business, now Jack gets what the 
      leaves are for.  Jack continues on down the path.


      KATE is bending down gathering something from the jungle, 
      putting it into a towel bag.

      Jack SEES HER as he walks along the jungle path.  He stops to 
      watch her.

      She moves along, collecting more stuff.  He follows, keeps 
      watching her.  Moving in tandem -- until --

                                  KATE
                          (without ever looking up)
                    I see you there, y know.

      Jack plays it off.  They are tentative at first.  Seeing 
      where they stand with each other.

                                  JACK
                    I wasn t hiding.

      He moves closer to her, still curious.  What s she up to?

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I just didn t want to disturb you 
                    from doing... whatever it is you re 
                    doing...

                                  KATE
                    It s not like it s a secret.

                                  JACK
                    Hard to tell with you.

      Kate shoots Jack a sour look -- Jack decides maybe today s 
      not the day for this and gives in.  He moves over to her.  
      This woman is magnetic to him -- despite their issues.  He 
      sees what she s holding.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Oh, gross little greyish yellow *
                    things.*

                                  KATE
                    Passion fruit seeds.

                                  JACK
                    What are those for?



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (BLUE)        11/5/04         11.

                                  KATE
                    I ll show you... if you wanna see.

      Kate smiles, and heads deeper into the jungle.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                          (simply, no innuendo)
                    Follow me...

      Intrigued now, Jack walks after her...


      Jack follows Kate through the jungle --

                                  JACK
                    Please tell me you found a coffee 
                    bar.

                                  KATE
                    Not quite.

      Into an OPEN CLEARING where they find --

    A GARDEN.  Nothing s growing yet, but seeds are being 
      planted, by SUN, in neatly arranged rows.  Sun looks up, sees 
      Jack and smiles modestly.

      And although it s just a start, we are struck - along with 
      Jack - that this garden, this GROWING OF FOOD, is a symbol of 
      the castaways taking another step in CULTURE BUILDING.

                                  JACK
                    Wow...
                          (to Kate)
                    When did you do this?

                                  KATE
                    I didn t.  It s all Sun.  I 
                    wandered into this place yesterday 
                    when I was out picking fruit.

                                  JACK
                          (over to Sun)
                    This is beautiful.  It s great.

                                  KATE*
                    She s got herbs and some lowgrowing *
                    stuff over here.  And she s... *
                    starting a grove over there...*

      Sun gives Jack a little smile and nod of appreciation, 
      pretending she doesn t get the words but gets the intent.  Of 
      course, LOST s loyal followers know otherwise.

      He wanders around looking at the rows.

                                  JACK
                    This is smart.  With the boar *
                    running out, we re gonna need all *
                    the food we can get.

                                  KATE
                    Maybe it s not running out.

                                  JACK
                    What do you mean?

                                  KATE
                    Maybe Locke s just decided not to 
                    catch  em for us anymore.

      Jack throws her a look -- is she kidding?

                                  JACK
                    Why would he do that?

                                  KATE
                          (shrugs)
                    Lotta mouths to feed.  If the 
                    boar s thinning out, why should he 
                    feed everyone else at his own 
                    expense.

      Jack shakes his head, smiles.  She must be kidding.

                                  JACK
                    You ve got yourself some trust 
                    issues there, don t you, Kate?

      She smiles back --

                                  KATE
                    Yup.  And in a few weeks, I ll have 
                    trust issues and lettuce.

      And with that, Kate kneels down and gets to plantin .  And as 
      we LINGER on Jack -- thinking about what she said -- his 
      smile compromised by seeds of DOUBT...


      Locke and Boone have cleared the area around the hatch.  The 
      rectangular hatch is SURROUNDED and ENCASED IN --

                                  BOONE
                    I think it s cement.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     13.

      Boone is fixated and fascinated, walks around staring at the  *
      hatch from various angles.*

      Locke sits nearby, completely FOCUSED on the hatch as he goes  *
      about mixing a FUNKY DARK PASTE in a WOOD BOWL, mashing in  *
      some jungle herbs.  Boone takes notice -- *

                                  BOONE (CONT D)*
                    What is that?*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Hmmm?*

                                  BOONE*
                    In the bowl?  What is that stuff?*

                                  LOCKE
                    It s for later.

      That s all he s getting.  So Boone settles down next to  *
      Locke.  Locke continues to stare at the hatch.  Finally,  *
      after a few beats --*

                                  BOONE
                    So... not to be difficult or 
                    anything but... we ve been coming 
                    out here for two days and... just 
                    staring at this thing.  I don t get *
                    what we re supposed to be doing.

                                  LOCKE*
                    Ludovico Buonaratti.*

                    What?*

                                  LOCKE*
                      Michelangelo s father.  He was a *

                      understanding of the divinity in *
                    his son.  So he beat him.  No child *
                    of his was going to use his hands *
                    for a living.*
                          (beat)*
                    So Michelangelo learned not to use *
                    his hands.*

      On Boone, wondering where this is going.  PUSHING IN on Locke  *
      as he continues --*

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)*
                    Years later, a visiting prince came *
                    into Michelangelo s studio to find *
                    the Master staring at a single *
                    eighteen foot block of marble.  The *
                    rumors he had heard were true -- *
                    that Michelangelo had come in every *
                    day for the past four months, *
                    stared at the marble, then gone *
                    home for supper.  So the prince *
                    asked him the obvious --  What are *
                    you doing?   And Michelangelo *
                    turned around.  Looked at him.  And *
                    whispered --*
                          (flawless Italian)*
                    Sto Lavorando.*
                          (smiles; then)*
                     I m working. *

      Locke finally takes his attention off the hatch, turns to  *
      Boone, smiles --*

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)*
                    Three years later that marble block *
                    was the statue of David.*

      Boone s like HUH, what the fuck?!  A long beat.  Then:

                                  BOONE
                    ...you re not... we re not gonna 
                    stare at this thing for four 
                    months, are we?
                          (then)
                    How are we gonna open it?

      Locke looks at Boone like he s finally getting the point.

                                  LOCKE
                    That s what we need to figure out.  
                    That s why we re sitting here.

      Locke walks over and SQUATS DOWN next to the HATCH.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                      Because... how do you open a hatch 
                    that has no handle.  No latch.  No 
                      discernible way of opening it?

      Boone takes in THAT conundrum.

                                  BOONE
                    Maybe we should just knock.

      It takes a long beat... but Locke finally turns to Boone and 
      smiles at him.  And off BOONE, we CUT TO:


      JIN carries his fishing gear across the ocean side lava 
      rocks, turns back -- what the hell?  SEES Hurley scrambling

                     Cause of that sea urchin thing.

      Hurley takes a moment to catch his breath, Jin waiting 
        impatiently.

      Locke and Boone pack up their shit, start humping it down 
      their secret trail back to the camp.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    They aren t going to keep believing 
                    we re out here hunting if we never 
                    come back with anything.

                                  LOCKE
                    They re not ready.

                                  BOONE
                    But -- I mean -- why not?

                                  LOCKE
                    Because they won t understand it.

                                  BOONE
                    ...I m not sure I understand it.

                                  LOCKE
                    That s the problem.

      Boone finally gets to the heart of the matter for him.

                                  BOONE
                    Look, at least I need to say 
                    something to Shannon.

                                  LOCKE
                    Why?

                        BOONELOCKE
      What do you mean  why?

                                                  so much?

      Boone stops.  Kind of... OFFENDED by this.

                                  BOONE
                    You don t... She s not always...
                          (a bitch)
                    You don t know her, man.*

    A beat.  Then Locke shrugs, nonchalant --

                                  LOCKE
                    Fair enough.

                                  BOONE
                    She s been asking me what we re 
                    doing out here.  I can t keep lying 
                    to her.

                    You can t keep lying to her?  Or 
                    you can t stand the way she makes 
                    you feel because you re lying to

                                  BOONE
                          (beat, the fuck?)
                    Both.  Whatever.  Look, she can 
                    keep a secret.

                                  LOCKE
                    You re sure?

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah, for sure--

                                  LOCKE
                    No, I mean are you sure you want to 
                    do this?

                                  BOONE
                    I need to get her off my back.  She 
                    keeps bugging me about this -- 
                    about you -- about this whole 
                    thing.

      Boone looks over at him, awaiting his verdict.

                                  LOCKE
                          (finally)
                    You sure you ve thought through the 
                      ramifications...?

                                  BOONE
                          (beat, confused)
                    Yeah.

                                  LOCKE
                    Then so be it.

      And with that, Locke flips one of his knives into his hand 
      and uses the BUTT END to viciously SLAM BOONE in the HEAD.

      Boone drops, folding to the ground.  Locke stands over him 
      with a look on his face that says he has a plan for this 
      young man.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:


                                  END OF ACT ONE

                                        ACT TWO


      Boone s eyes SNAP open --

      -- he tries to shake the miasma of confusion and pain from 
      his head -- but he is still stunned from Locke s blow -- and 
      as he tries to figure out what just happened --

      -- PULL OUT TO REVEAL Boone: tied to a tree -- in a strange 
      configuration of ropes strung around its trunk and branches.

                                  BOONE
                    What th--?

      Boone scans the clearing -- finds what he is looking for:

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Locke!  LOCKE!

      ANGLE ON LOCKE -- sitting on a stump.  Not answering -- not 
      even turning.  Holding the paste he was mixing earlier.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    What is this?  What are you--

      But Locke just stares.  It is beyond creepy.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    -- hey!  D you hear me?  Look at 
                    me!  Hey, you untie my right now!

      Locke slowly turns to look at Boone, then:

                                  LOCKE
                    Or what?

      Locke holds Boone s eyeline, unbending.  Boone has no answer, 
      so he breaks the stare -- his desperation growing:

                                  BOONE
                    Look, I promise -- I swear --

      But Locke says nothing.  Boone s desperation grows.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    I won t tell anyone about that -- 
                    hatch thing -- okay?

      Locke s tone is warm and tender -- a teacher, not a 
      tormentor:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     21.
      (CONT'D):1212


                                  LOCKE
                    I m doing this, Boone, because it s *
                    time for you to let go of some *
                    things.  Because it s what s best *
                    for you.  And I promise --*
                          (beat)*
                    You re gonna thank me for this *
                    later.

      And the look on Boone s face says what we re all thinking: 
      Holy shit!  This guy is fucking nuts!

                                  BOONE
                    Hey, you know what...?  I don t 
                    think this is best for me.

      Locke steps up to Boone, starts spreading the paste over the 
      raw spot on Boone s head where Locke conked him.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    What is that stuff? -- What are you 
                    doing?!

                                  LOCKE
                    An open wound out here?  Without 
                      treatment, it s gonna get infected.

      As if a fucking infection is Boone s problem right now.

                                  BOONE
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about, man?  You re not leaving me 
                    out here?!

                                  LOCKE
                    Whether you stay is up to you.*

      Locke steps back.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    The camp is four miles due west.

                                  BOONE*
                    What -- West?  Which way is west?!?*

      Locke just shakes his head -- EXACTLY.  And after a beat, he  *
      turns.  And walks away.*

      Boone strains against his ropes --*





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"    (GOLDENROD)     12/9/04         22.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Hey!  HEY!!
                          (no response; Locke just 
                            keeps walking)
                    Locke!

      Locke turns back -- holding a knife -- Holy Shit! -- and 
      suddenly -- ZZZZZIP -- THWOCK!  He THROWS THE KNIFE -- right 
      toward Boone -- who clenches his eyes shut as the knife 
      buries itself into the tree inches from his bound feet!

                                  LOCKE
                    You ll be able to cut yourself 
                    free.  Once you have the proper 
                      motivation.

      And with that Locke vanishes into the jungle.

      Boone tries to free himself from Locke s rope contraption.  
      If Boone lowers his right arm toward the KNIFE -- the ropes 
      pull his left arm up BEHIND his back -- the way a cop or 
      bouncer would grab you to control you.

      And that s Boone s exact situation.  Because as he reaches 
      down for the knife with his right hand, his left arm is 
      PULLED UP BEHIND HIS BACK by THE ROPES causing him 
        excruciating fucking PAIN.

                                  BOONE
                    Agghhh!!

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      Sayid makes a NOTATION on the map.  Furrows his brow.  Looks  *
      BACK the way he came.  Checks the map again.  Whatever it is  *
      he s doing, it s not making sense to him.  And that s when -- *

      HE HEARS A SOUND.  RUSTLING.*

      Sayid WHIPS AROUND -- Already getting up -- old training  *

      Sayid SMILES -- charmed by Locke s honesty.  Locke notices  *

      THE SUN is high and beating down in shafts of light through 
      the thick jungle.

      Boone has been tied to his tree for a while now.  He is 
      tired, sweating, and totally freaked out about his horrible 
        predicament.

      He gathers his strength for another attempt.  He reaches 
      down, and the ropes wrench his other arm up behind him, and, 
      by the way, he s still WAY SHORT of grabbing the damn knife.  
      Unable to take the pain, Boone stops -- Breathes hard -- 
      SHOUTS OUT in wild FRUSTRATION...

                                  BOONE
                      HEEEEEELP!!!

      Bryan has been working on a boat.  He comes off the deck onto  *
      the docks to see --*

      Boone, who approaches him, affecting a toughness he doesn t  *
      truly possess.

                                  BOONE
                    Bryan.  We need to talk.

      Bryan looks up at Boone like he s never seen him before.

                                  BRYAN
                    And you are?...

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon s brother.  Boone.

                                  BRYAN
                    Oh, right...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     26.
      (CONT'D):1515


      Bryan turns and gives him a small opening where he s willing 
      to listen.

                                  BOONE
                    I won t waste your time.  Or mine.  
                    I want you to break up with my *
                    sister.

                                  BRYAN
                          (you ve gotta be fucking *
                            kidding me)*
                    What?...

                                  BOONE
                    I want you to end it.  Now.  Today.*

      Bryan can t believe this -- he scoffs -- feeling NO THREAT 
      here.

                                  BRYAN
                    Bugger off, mate.

      But Boone wasn t expecting this to be easy.  Which is why he  *
      takes out his CHECKBOOK --*

                                  BOONE
                    What you don t understand, Bryan, 
                    is that you ll be the third guy 
                    I ve paid to leave.
                          (beat)
                    You go to her house when she s not *
                    there, you get all your stuff, and 
                    you never have contact with her 
                    again.  Understood?

                                  BRYAN
                    You flew all the way over here... *
                    to bribe me?  I mean really-- What 
                    are you doing?!  Shannon s a grown *
                    woman --

                                  BOONE
                          (unfazed)
                    And I m going to give you twenty 
                    five thousand U.S. dollars.

      This number gives Bryan pause.  Then --*

                                  BRYAN
                    I love her.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     27.

                                  BOONE
                    How much?

      Bryan takes a long beat -- and maybe he does kinda love 
      Shannon but obviously his love s not running THAT deep.

                                  BRYAN
                    My love for her...?
                          (beat)
                    Worth closer to fifty thousand.

      Boone looks at him.  Accepting the fact that this is how much 
      the  exchange  will cost him...


      CLOSE ON Boone.  His eyes are closed.  He s resting his chin 
      against his breastbone, letting the pain drain out of him -- 
      wondering how the fuck he is going to get out of this.

      That s when he hears something...

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEE!

      Oh my God!  Is that Shannon?!  His head snaps back up.   *
      SHOUTS --*

                                  BOONE
                    Who is that?!

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                          (far away)

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon!

      And Boone realizes Shannon is out here too!  But NOT CLOSE BY 
      because her voice is dampened by the THICK JUNGLE.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                          (yells to her)

      And then we HEAR A HORRIBLE SOUND.

        MMMMMMMRRRRRRROOOOOOWWWWWR!

      THE UNMISTAKABLE ROAR of THE MONSTER.  Yeah.  It s out here 
      too.

                                      ACT THREE


      Boone STRAINS against the ropes.

                                  BOONE
                    Hang on, Shannon, I m coming!

      CLOSE ON BOONE -- his face beaded with sweat -- lined by the 
      effort -- teeth clenched -- his sister calling out for him --

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                    BOONE!  HELP ME!

      Boone struggles, trying to find a way out that doesn t 
      involve Locke s rope trap using the strength of one of his 
      arms to rip the other off --

      -- but there s little time to think -- because from the 
      deepest recesses of the jungle, the sound keeps getting 
      louder --

        MMMMRRRRRROOOOOOWWWWWWRRR!

      The monster --

                                  SHANNON (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    IT S GETTING CLOSER --

      Galvanized by his sister s distress, Boone reaches once more 
      for the knife.  Finding the motivation Locke was talking 
      about, he stretches down with his right arm causing his left 
      arm to be HORRIBLY WRENCHED BEHIND HIS BACK.

      Boone YELLS OUT IN PAIN but keeps going now...

                                  BOONE
                    Eeeggghhhwwhhh!

      Forcing himself down, further and further, straining against 
      the SEARING PAIN -- until finally he GRABS THE KNIFE, pulls 
      it out of the tree below him.

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    Agghhh!!

      He cuts himself free.  Takes off running, following Shannon s 
      cries.


      Boone races off across the jungle.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     30.

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon!
                          (and again)
                    Shannon!!

      Calling out her name -- and heedless of the MONSTER S ROAR 
      coming from the jungle NEAR HIM.  Shit!  He s not even sure 
      how close.

      CRASHING OUT through the BRUSH he finds Shannon, also tied to 
    a tree.

                      SHANNONBOONE
      Boone -- thank God --
      -- Get me out of here --I m working on it -- he -- 
      please --how did --

      Boone starts CUTTING Shannon s bonds with the knife -- we re 
      HANDHELD CAMERA here -- urgent, terrifying --

            MMMMMMRRRRRROOOOOOOOWWWRRRRRR!

                                    SHANNON
                    Oh my god --

      SWISH PAN from the JUNGLE back to our people: the monster s 
      close.  And coming closer.

                      SHANNONBOONE
      Hurry, Boone!  Please...Almost... done -- There!  
                                                  Let s go!

      And the rope unravels as she s cut free.


      Boone and Shannon are running as fast as their legs will 
      carry them -- pushing -- pushing -- on a MAD DASH through the 
      jungle.  The monster ROARING, tress SHAKING behind them as 
      they make their way to --


      -- the two MOVE VERY FAST.  Shannon can actually run.  But 
      something is becoming clearer with each passing second --

      -- even running fast, there s no outrunning this thing.

      Boone looks around frantically, assessing his options, SEES --

    A BANYAN TREE -- Massive.  Boone gets an idea.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (BLUE)        11/5/04         31.

                                  BOONE
                    C mon!

      He PULLS SHANNON with him toward the BASE OF THE TREE.

                                  SHANNON
                    What are you doing?

      No time to argue.  The ROAR has become a THUNDERING DRONE -- 
      it s everywhere around them, thick and ominous --

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    We have to run!

      Boone grabs her --

                                  BOONE
                    Shut up!  In here.

      And he pulls her with him into a HOLLOW in the BANYAN TREE.  
      There is just enough room inside the colossal trunk to 
      protect them.


                                  SAYID*

                    Okay.  Sun s gonna set over there, *

                    North...*

      Based on this logic (and it is sound), Jack POINTS off in the  *
      appropriate direction.*

                                  SAYID
                    Correct.  That is where North 
                    should be...

      Sayid produces the COMPASS.  Holds it up next to Jack s 
      upraised ARM --

      CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE -- Sayid now raises his OWN ARM to match 
      its direction -- about TWENTY FIVE DEGREES OFF Jack s guess-
      timation --

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Yet that is North.

                                  JACK
                    What re you saying, Sayid?

                                  JACK
                    Where d you get it?  The compass?

                                  SAYID
                    Locke gave it to me this afternoon.

                                  JACK
                    Locke?  Where d you see him?*

                                  SAYID
                    About a mile East of here -- *

                          (beat; then)*
                    At least I think it s East.*

      Sayid cracks a smile -- but that wasn t necessarily a joke.   *
      And OFF JACK, wheels turning --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"     (SALMON)       12/13/04        34B.




      Jack walks along the beach -- finds Locke -- sitting by the 
      shore staring out at the ocean.  Jack approaches him.

                                  JACK*
                    Any ships?*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     36.

                                  LOCKE*
                    Not yet.  But I m patient.*

                                  JACK*

      Jack sits beside him.  A few beats.  Then -- *

                    Been awhile since you and I talked, *

                    So are you.*

      Locke chuckles.  Touche.*

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    Where s Boone?*

                    Yeah?  You two have been attached *
                    to the hip all week.*

      Jack doesn t need to finish the sentence. *

                                  LOCKE*
                    Well let me check my hip, then.*
                          (he does)*
                    Nope.  No Boone.*

      Jack smiles -- but he doesn t really smile.  He s no dummy,  *
      and although he doesn t know what we know, he still feels  *
        something... something just OFF.*

                                  JACK
                    How s the hunting going?

                                  LOCKE
                    The boar are learning out tactics.  *
                    I fear they re migrating outside *
                    our valley.  They re smart animals.  *

      And Locke turns to Jack, flashes a grin which to him might be  *
       jokey,  but to us is FUCKING CREEPSTOWN --*

                                  LOCKE*
                    The most dangerous predator of all.*

      And OFF JACK --*


      Jin walks through a pool of water -- snaring yet another fish 
      in a makeshift net.  Satisfied, he turns around -- and the 
      look on his face makes patently clear what he thinks about --

      HURLEY -- a few meters away, trying to emulate Jin by making 
    a net from his outer shirt -- but having little success --

                                  HURLEY
                    Dammit!

      Jin is not about to help Hurley.  He walks out of the pool -- 
      looking Hurley up and down as he passes him -- and drops his 
      catch on the beach a safe distance away.

      Jin comes back to the tide pool --

                                  JIN
                          (In Korean)
                    Don t eat my fish!

      It doesn t take a U.N. translator to figure that one out.

                                  HURLEY
                    Hey, you know what?  You win, okay?  
                    You happy now?  Keep your damn 
                    fish.  I m outta h--




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     38.

      -- but as Hurley has turned to go, he s stepped on something  
      -- a sea urchin -- the spine penetrating right up through his 
      thin rubber shoes.

      Hurley CRIES OUT in pain -- hopping to the shore and plopping 
      down to the ground in a rather ungraceful manner --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    OW!  Damnit!  Awgh!  God, that-- 
                    DAMNIT!

      Jin watches -- now he has no choice but to help --

                                  JIN
                    What did you do?

                                  HURLEY
                    I stepped on one of those damn 
                    friggin  URCHINS!

      Jin looks down at Hurley s foot as Hurley frantically pulls 
      out the stuck needles --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    No?  You understand infection?  
                    Gangrene?  AMPUTATION?
                          (off Jin s look)
                    Oh -- hell -- look man -- you gotta 
                    do something -- you don t want to *
                    give me fish, that s fine, but --
                          (doesn t want to say it)
                    -- You gotta pee on my foot -- OK?*
                          (then)
                    I saw it on TV -- it ll stop the 
                    venom -- you gotta --

                                  JIN
                    Just pull out the spines -- pull 
                    them out --

      The two men are now pantomiming vastly different things.  
      Hurley finally gets Jin s attention by agitatedly pointing 
      between his foot and Jin s crotch -- and that s when Jin 
      finally understands what Hurley is getting at --

                      HURLEYJIN
      Would you JUST do it?  I m No -- you idiot -- that isn t 
      gonna lose my foot if you going to do anything!  That s 
      don t!  PEE ON IT, MAN!for jellyfish stings!

      -- Jin finally says his first words of English on the island 
      to emphatically get his point across --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (PINK)        11/8/04         39.

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    No.  No.  No.

      Okay, it ain t gonna get him a 750 on the SAT, but it does 
      make the point loud and clear.

      Hurley wears a miserable expression as Jin begins to help him 
      pull the spines out of his foot.  Hurley MOANS in pain.


      Kate and Sun are planting seeds.  They can t communicate, 
      except through the experience --

                                  KATE
                    Well this is nice.  Just us girls.

      Sun just looks at her, smiles -- in a sweet but awkward way --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Can you believe we ve been here 
                    over three weeks?*
                          (off Sun s look; they keep 
                            working)
                    I was heading for Bali.  I... 
                    travel a lot.  I was looking 
                    forward to spending some time 
                    exploring the island.
                          (beat)
                    But I ended up on a plane to LA 
                    instead.
                          (beat...)
                    Guess this falls into the category 
                    of be careful what you wish for.

      Sun is planting, gives a small,  I ll say  smile under her 
      hat.  Kate immediately locks her eyes onto Sun.  A long beat.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    ...you understood me...

      Sun s smile vanishes.  Kate keeps her eyes right on Sun.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    -- you did, didn t you?... You just 
                      understood what I said.

      Under this pressure and scrutiny Sun is unable to hide her 
      fear.  Kate s amazed -- says quietly:

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    You speak English?



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     40.
      (CONT'D):2626


      Sun looks at Kate and the expression on her face tells us all  *
      -- and Kate -- that she s busted.

                                  SUN*
                    Please.  Don t tell anyone.*


      Hurley is nursing his swollen foot.  Calls out --*

                                    HURLEY*
                    You sure you don t speak English?

      He watches Jin picking urchins out of the tide pool.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                     Cause there s a rumor that you do.*

      Jin doesn t react.  After a beat of nothing for Jin --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Your wife is hot.

      Jin stares over at him blankly.  Now Jin approaches having 
      opened an URCHIN for Hurley to eat.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    I get it, this is some kind of 
                    payback  cause I wouldn t eat 
                    urchin that other time, right?

      And Jin smiles, pushing the urchin at Hurley.  In KOREAN -- *

                                  JIN*
                    Here.  Please.

      Hurley realizes that this is his chance to make an apology --

                                  HURLEY
                    I eat this... you give me fish... 
                    right?

      Jin s expression changes not at all.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Fine.

      Hurley stares at the fucking orange mucus ball, trying to get 
      pumped up.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     41.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Over the lips and past the gums, 
                    yada, yada -- oh god! --

      And Hurley takes the urchin, closes his eyes and pops it down 
      his throat.

      Jin stares at Hurley, a big smile on his face.  And Hurley 
      does his best attempt at a smile back.  It s a great moment 
      of cross-cultural reconciliation...

      Until Hurley s face blanches.  He bends at the waist -- and 
      VOMITS UP the sea urchin.  Really WRETCHES.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Ohhhhh.

      OFF Jin, cringing, this is not a pretty sight.


      Dark, scary -- light pours through the vines in shafts -- 
      Boone looks up, trying to spot the sun through the foliage, 
      hoping they are going the right way.

                                    SHANNON

      We weren t doing --

      Boone turns and fires back on Shannon --

                                  BOONE
                    You know who  this guy  is?  He s 
                    the one person here who has a real

                                                  -- It means he s smart.

                    He tied us up, Boone!*

      Despite her anger, it s hard to argue with Shannon.  Pretty  *
      much anything she wants from him, she gets.  Several beats,  *
      pass.  Then --*

                    Why?*

                                  BOONE*
                    We found something.*

                                  SHANNON*
                    What?*

      Another beat as he contemplates the plunge.  Then -- *

                                  BOONE
                    While we were out looking for *
                    Claire... we found this... this 
                    piece of metal.  Buried in the 
                    jungle.  We ve been excavating it --*

                                  SHANNON
                    A piece of metal?

                                  BOONE
                    A hatch.  Buried in the dirt.*

                                  SHANNON
                      ...like... like a door?*

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah.  That s what a hatch is, 
                    Shannon--



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     43.

                                  SHANNON
                    Where does it go?

      Shannon s a little creeped out.

                                  BOONE
                    I don t know.*
                          (beat)
                    I told him I wanted to tell you.  
                    That s when he did this--

      -- but suddenly: MMMMMRRRRRRRROOOOOOOWWWWWWWR!

      The monster s back.  And it s FUCKING CLOSE this time!*

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                    -- go!

      And they run -- but this time there s no outrunning it and no 
      place to hide.

      Shannon trails Boone slightly -- and we re TRACKING WITH HER 
      FAST in TIGHT PROFILE -- and we SHAKILY TILT TO HER LEGS AS 
      SHE RUNS AND SUDDENLY THOSE LONG LEGS ARE LIFTED OFF THE 
      GROUND AS SHE S APPARENTLY GRABBED BY THE THING AND SHE 
      SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.  We don t see any more of the thing 
      than when it ripped the pilot from the plane s cockpit.

      But it has her -- pulls her away through the thick brush.

      Boone turns back in horror -- stumbling back, looking up in 
      SHEER HORROR -- YELLING as his sister s SCREAMS ARE HEARD --

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                      SHANNON!!!

                                  SHANNON
                    OH GOD!  OH GOD!  NO!

      -- and he s on the floor of the jungle -- eyes wide, red, 
      wet, as his sister s voice is SILENCED -- and he s just 
      there, in shock -- as the BEAST LUMBERS OFF -- something we 
      don t see -- but we re TIGHT ON BOONE S HORRIFIED FACE --  *
      then WIDE, departing -- WIDENING -- on Boone, alone, alone...  *
      alone...

                                  BOONE
                      Shannon!!*

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Kate and Sun are alone on the path, standing, talking 
      quietly:

                                  KATE
                    Does anybody else know?

                                  SUN
                    Only Michael.

                                  KATE
                    But not your husband.

      Sun takes this in.

                                  SUN
                    Please...

      As in -- you mustn t, mustn t tell --

                                  KATE
                    Don t worry, I can keep a secret.

      Sun gives her a small smile.  Sun volunteers more --

                                  SUN
                    I took English lessons in Korea.
                          (then; guiltily)
                    He doesn t know.  It s... 
                      complicated.

      Kate listens to this, realizing there s a lot more to Sun 
      than has yet been revealed.

                                  KATE
                    Why don t you tell him now?

                                  SUN
                          (shaking her head)
                    I can t.

                                  KATE
                    Why?

      That s the question and we re back to it again.

                                  SUN
                    Because I love him.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     45.
      (CONT'D):2929


                                  KATE
                    I don t understand.

      Sun looks over at Kate and then puts it in terms Kate can 
      understand.

                                  SUN
                    Have you never lied to a man you ve 
                    loved...?

      OFF KATE.  Okay, that resonates.*


      And speaking of men that Kate has lied to, JACK taps a single  *
      TABLET out of a pill bottle into the hand of CHARLIE -- *

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Cheers.*

      PULL BACK to find the two beside tonight s SIGNAL FIRE.   *
      Charlie dry swallows the pill and -- he returns to carefully  *
      building the log cabin of fire. *

                                  JACK*
                    Give you a hand?*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Love one.*

      Jack squats down.  Helps assemble the firewood as they talk -- *

                                  JACK*
                    Haven t seen you around the caves *
                    lately.*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Yeah.  Needed a change of scenery.*

      Charlie looks up -- and there s something different about  *
      him.  That twinkle temporarily dulled from his eye.  And Jack  *
      is very aware of this.  Serious, concerned --*

                                  JACK*
                    How you doing, Charlie?*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    How am I doing with week two of *
                    heroin withdrawal or how am I doing *
                    with Claire being abducted by the *
                    freak who tried to kill me?*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     46.
      (CONT'D):A30A30


      Well, that about says it, doesn t it?  But Jack deflects with  *
      skilled bedside manner --*

                                  JACK*
                    I gave you the aspirin for the *
                    heroin withdrawal.*

      And this gets a genuine SMILE out of Charlie.  Warms him up a  *
      bit.  The two continue to build as Jack s attention is drawn  *
      back towards*

      THE BEACH*

      Where Locke still sits off in the distance, looking out at  *
      the water.  His back to us in that old familiar posture -- *

      And it s patently clear.  Jack very much has Locke on the *
      brain right now.*

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    What do you think his story is?*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Who?  Locke?*

      Jack nods.*

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    That man s a freak of nature.  Very *
                    disturbed.  Quite likely murdered *
                    all his mates at the Post Office *
                    that day his mum forgot to put a *
                    cookie in his lunch tin.  That was *
                    my first impression, anyway.*
                          (beat)*
                    But then he saved my life.*

      This certainly piques Jack s interest.  But --*

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Another story for another time.*

                                  JACK*
                    You trust him?*

      Charlie s SURPRISED that Jack would even ask such a thing -- *

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Trust him?  No offense, friend... *
                    but if there was one person on this *
                    island I d put my absolute faith in *
                    to save us all, it d be John Locke.*



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     47.
      (CONT'D): (2)A30A30


      And Charlie fucking MEANS it.*

      And as Jack again looks off in the distance at Locke... *


      Boone prowls the jungle like a mad man -- truly: this guy may 
      be losing his mind:

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon?!

      Hoping against hope that Shannon could have survived what he 
      saw -- knowing that it s probably impossible but following 
      the path anyway... CLOSE ON Boone s ragged expression as he 
      calls again --

                                  BOONE (CONT D)
                          (even more frantic)
                    SHANNON?!



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST     "Hearts and Minds"      (GREEN)       12/1/04         48B.




      Boone follows a trail of BLOOD DROPS and SMEARS through the 
      tangle of jungle, fearing the worst.  Tears flow from his 
      eyes.

      Finally he finds what he was hoping he wouldn t --

      SHANNON

      Covered in BLOOD -- lying in a shallow pool of crimson water.  
      Her limbs are splayed in an unnatural arrangement -- broken 
      and useless.

                                  BOONE
                    -- oh God...

      Boone pulls her out -- holds her close -- trying to restore 
      her dignity -- and discovers Shannon is still breathing -- 
      barely -- holding onto the last remnants of life.

                                  SHANNON
                    Boone...?

      Her torso IS STITCHED with a ROW of GIANT, DEEP, BLEEDING 
      PUNCTURE WOUNDS.  From what?  Claws?  Teeth?  Whatever put 
      them there, it s fucking huge.

                                  BOONE
                    I m here.

      Because as Boone strokes her hair -- Shannon s eyes open, 
      slowly, languidly -- the life draining from them -- and 
      Boone s eyes are WET, he s in shock --

                                    SHANNON
                    I knew you d come for me... you 
                    always come for me...

      Boone holds her, wipes the blood from her face.

                                  BOONE
                          (not believing this 
                            himself)
                    I m gonna get you back to camp.  *
                    You re gonna be fine.  Jack s gonna 
                    take care of you...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "Hearts and Minds"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    11/3/04     53.

      Shannon looks up INTO HIS FACE wanting to believe it -- that 
      her brother will manage to pull her through.

                                  SHANNON
                    Help me, Boone...

      But there is nothing he can do.  Shannon dies in his arms.

      Boone, staggers back into camp -- his eyes hollow -- haunted  
      -- and as he listlessly knocks aside vines and bushes, making 
      his way toward the valley.*
