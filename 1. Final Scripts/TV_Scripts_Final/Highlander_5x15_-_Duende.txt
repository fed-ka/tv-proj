      FADE IN:


14011401INT. DANCE STUDIO - SPAIN - 1971 - DAY

      A dark room.  The staccato beat of Flamenco fills the air. 
      A MAN'S VOICE is lifting, soaring in the sad, rough growl
      of the Flamenco canto.  Then --

      The camera moves to A SPOTLIGHT on the floor, centering on
      a pair of women's FLAMENCO SHOES, as slowly, dramatically,
      one heel lifts -- then SLAMS DOWN like a sudden pistol-
      shot.  The other heel follows, as a FLAMENCO GUITAR bites
      into the mix.  With increasing speed, the heels beat a
      staccato tattoo on the floor.  As the tempo increases we
      see --

      YOUNG ANNA HIDALGO

      The dancer, 22 and very beautiful, caught up in the
      smoldering passion of the dance with a handsome dark-haired
      dancer named RAFAEL.  The sexual tension between the two
      dancers is palpable as the music and dance interweave as
      tightly as two lovers' bodies.  In the background, the
      Singer and Guitarist wail.  Around them, several DANCERS
      from the Troupe look on.  And among these stands --

      OTAVIO CONSONE

      Elegant, with a hard, aristocratic bearing, he stands aloof,
      set apart by a paternal, controlling air.  This is his
      Troupe, and he watches Anna with an appraising look, liking
      what he sees.

      He steps toward her, moving with a dancer's lithe grace,
      CLAPPING as he urges her on.

                                            CONSONE
                          Passion, Anna... let me see your
                          passion!  Let me feel it!

      Anna responds to his urging, increasing the intensity. 
      There is sweat on her lip, her eyes are closing in a near-
      trance.

                                            CONSONE
                        That's it... that's it.
                              (almost to himself)
                        Duende.

1401CONTINUED:1401

      With a final flourish, Anna comes to an abrupt stop,
      exhausted, the dance over.  Consone takes her hand, turns
      to the others.

                                            CONSONE
                        You see?  This is how you dance the
                        Baile Grande.
                            (to Anna)
                        Magnifico.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                              (shyly)
                        Thank you, Senor Consone.

      She lowers her eyes, flattered by his praise, and starts
      to turn away -- but Consone pulls her back, smiling.

                                            CONSONE
                        Stay... I have a surprise for you.

      Anna has no idea what he means.  She looks puzzled as
      Consone, still holding her hand, turns them to face the
      rest of the troupe.

                                            CONSONE
                        My people, tonight, I invite you to
                        share the most joyous moment of my
                        life.

      He takes a dramatic pause.

                                            CONSONE
                        The moment Anna Hidalgo consents to
                        be my bride.

      There's a BEAT of silence -- then several Dancers applaud. 
      Anna can only stare, dismayed and dumbfounded, as Consone
      beams.

                                            CONSONE
                        Anna?
                              (beat)
                        Have you nothing to say to me?

      She throws a panicked look at Rafael, who looks equally
      dismayed.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        Senor Consone... Otavio... I
                          couldn't... I'm...

      Consone smiles indulgently.

                                            CONSONE
                        The shy bride.  You'll get over it
                        soon enough, I promise.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               3.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96



1401CONTINUED: (2)1401

      The rest of the Troupe laugh.

                                            CONSONE
                        And my life will be spent making you
                        happy.

      He raises her hand to kiss it tenderly -- but Anna pulls
      it away, blurts it out --

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        No, you don't understand.  I'm already
                          engaged!

      The room falls deathly silent.  Consone stares, his smile
      frozen in place, not believing his ears.  Anna quails before
      his look, forces herself to continue.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        To Rafael.

      Consone throws a hard look at Rafael.

                                            CONSONE
                          Impossible!

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        I'm carrying his child.

      Consone goes white.  Several of the women gasp, cross
      themselves.  A cold veil drops over Consone's eyes.  With
      growing anger, he grabs her arm.

                                            CONSONE
                              (exploding)
                        Puto!  Whore!

      He spits out the insult like snake venom, and slaps her. 
      As he moves to slap her again, Rafael charges in and grabs
      Consone's arm.

                                            RAFAEL
                        Leave her!

      Consone turns, pulls a short poignard, and as Rafael runs
      at him -- coolly drives it into him.  There are screams,
      gasps of horror as Rafael falls.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        NO! 

      She starts toward Rafael, but Consone grabs her hair and
      pulls her close.

                                            CONSONE
                        As long as you live, remember this...

                        That was only the first cut.

      She struggles, a hand reaches his face, scratching him
      badly.  Consone shoves her away, and she falls over Rafael's
      body, sobbing.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                          Rafael... RAFAEL!

      Consone sweeps out, his dancers parting before his cold
      rage like the sea.  As he reaches the door, he pauses.

      CLOSE - CONSONE

      He puts a hand to his face where Anna scratched him.  As
      he takes his hand away -- we see the scratches are HEALED. 
      Consone scowls and slams out the door.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


14021402INT. CLUB HIDALGO - PARIS - THE PRESENT - NIGHT

      On the floor, highlighted by a spotlight, beautiful young
      dancer LUISA HIDALGO, Anna's 24-year old daughter, dances
      the Flamenco.  (Please note: the same actress plays Luisa
      and Young Anna.) The GUITAR strums, her heels flash --
      she's fiery and captivating.  Off to the side, two other
      FEMALE DANCERS clap in time.  The mood is bright and lively.

      MACLEOD AND RICHIE

      Are seated at a front row table, enjoying the show.  Richie
      is mesmerized by Luisa -- he hasn't heard what MacLeod is
      saying.

                                            RICHIE
                              (distracted)
                        It's a what?

                                            MACLEOD
                        The dance.  It's called a soleares.

      The Audience starts to clap as the accompaniment becomes
      more insistent and the pace builds.

                                            MACLEOD
                        She's telling how her lover left... 
                        How she can't live without him.

      Richie gives him a look.

                                            RICHIE
                        What part are you watching?

      He turns back to Luisa, looking smitten.

                                            RICHIE
                        Man, she is beautiful.

      MacLeod gives him a knowing look.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Better put your eyes back in your
                        head, Romeo.
                              (pointing)
                        That's Anna... her mother.

      In the wings, Anna Hidalgo.  47, mature, full-bodied.  Her
      life has been a struggle and it shows.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               6.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96

      She's the dance-master of the troupe.  She watches Luisa
      with the proud, critical eye of a teacher and mother.

                                            MACTEOD
                            (a smile)
                        So behave yourself.

      With a final stamp of feet, Luisa finishes.  Richie and
      MacLeod join in the applause.

                                            MACLEOD & RICHIE
                        Bravo!  BRAVO!

      MacLeod's eyes go to Richie, who is clearly having a great
      time.  He speaks as they applaud.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's been a while since we just hung
                        out together.

                                            RICHIE
                              (warmly)
                        Like old times.
                              (beat)
                        Thanks for inviting me up.

      Anna basks in the crowd's admiration for a moment, then
      steps out.  She's pleasant, working the crowd.

                                            ANNA
                        You've been a good audience, but to
                        merely watch Flamenco isn't to know
                        its spirit.  For that...
                            (a smile)
                        You must dance.

      Her gaze falls on Richie.

                                            ANNA
                        You, young man.
                            (off Richie's
                              hesitation)
                        Come, I'm not asking you to bullfight.

      The audience laughs.  Richie squirms under the attention.

                                            RICHIE
                        I'd love to, really, but --
                              (beat)
                        Too many left feet.

      The audience laughs.

                                            ANNA
                        I see.  Then perhaps your friend?

      She smiles at MacLeod.  MacLeod opens his mouth to object,
      but Richie beats him to the draw.

                          Absolutely.  He'd love to.
                          Wouldn't you, Mac?

      The audience starts to clap rhythmically, urging him on,
      and Richie joins in.

                          Finally, a man with courage.

      MacLeod can't refuse.  He moves onto the stage and takes
      his position with Luisa.  Richie settles back, looking
      smug.  Finally, MacLeod out of his element.

      ANGLE - THE STAGE

      MacLeod stands beside Luisa as she takes her stance.

                                            LUISA
                        The feet, so.  The arms like so.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Like this?

      He arches gracefully into the tensed, dramatic stance of a
      seasoned flamenco dancer.  Luisa smiles.

                                            LUISA
                        Exactly like that.

      A FLOURISH of guitar.  A hush falls, their eyes lock
        dramatically -- an electric current seems to surge between
      them.

      Luisa begins to move.  MacLeod follows, matching her moves. 
      Luisa becomes more serious, begins to challenge him, and
      MacLeod responds, improvising.

      ANGLE - RICHIE

      At the table, shaking his head.  He throws up his hands. 
      How the hell does the guy do it?

                                            RICHIE
                        Of course... of course.

      RESUME - MACLEOD AND LUISA

      as they dance, a study in grace and tension.

                                            LUISA
                        I think you've done this before.

14031403INT. SPANISH NIGHTCLUB - MADRID - 1851 - NIGHT

      MACLEOD'S BOOTED FEET

      Tap out the zapateado of the Flamenco.

      A GYPSY DANCER performs Flamenco beside MacLeod.  His shirt
      is open, barely covering his chest which is glistening
      with perspiration.  It is a dance of seduction and passion,
      the Gypsy Dancer turning her back on her partner
      flirtatiously, pretending to reject him, then drawn back
      in by the passion of his dance.

      The audience, a mixed group of Gypsies and Spanish ARISTOS,
      loves it.  Among them is DON DIEGO DE GLORIA.

      In the corner of the room sits Don Diego's daughter,
      THERESA, 22.  She is wearing a hooded cape.  She is with
      her DUENNA, who clearly is uncomfortable.

                                            DUENNA
                        We shouldn't be here.  It's not
                        proper.

      Theresa is progressive for the times.  She is clearly a
      woman of her own mind.

                                            THERESA
                        You can leave any time you want,
                          Tialita.
                            (re MacLeod)
                        Isn't he magnificent?

      The old Duenna can only nod in agreement.

      MACLEOD

      Finally captures his dancing partner in a dazzling finale
      to the number.

      THE PATRONS OF THE CLUB

      clap and throw coins.

      MACLEOD

      Bows acknowledgment to the Guitarist who accompanied the
      dance, then directs applause toward the Gypsy Dancer,
      modestly stepping off the dance floor.

      As the Gypsy Dancer and her Guitarist gather up their
      earnings, MacLeod moves to Don Diego's table.

                                            DON DIEGO
                        Bravo, Senor MacLeod.
                            (to Consone)
                        Tell me, Senor Consone, is your
                        student as talented with the sword
                        as he is with the dance?

                                            MACLEOD
                        You flatter me, Don Diego.

                                            DON DIEGO
                        That was as finely danced as anything
                        I have seen.  Where did a gentleman
                        learn to dance like a gypsy?

                                            CONSONE
                            (with a wink at MacLeod)
                        Perhaps he was a gypsy in another
                        life.

      ANGLE - THE DUENNA AND THERESA

                                            DUENNA
                          Quickly!  We have to leave before
                        Your father sees us.

      But Theresa is already gone, moving toward MacLeod.

      Theresa arrives with her Duenna close behind.

                                            THERESA
                        You were wonderful.

                            (to Theresa)
                        And you shouldn't be here.

                        I told her, Senor.

      MacLeod charms the Duenna.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (with a bow)
                        Ah, Tialita, the inspiration of a
                          beautiful woman brings out the
                          Flamenco in Any man.

      This last, with a sly wink in Theresa's direction.  She
      returns his smile warmly.  Her Duenna reacts with a flutter.

                        It isn't a proper dance for an
                          unmarried girl to see.

      MacLeod smoothly shifts his attention to the Duenna, the
      look between him and Theresa concealed as he turns to flirt
      with the old woman.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So true, Senora.  The passion of the
                          Flamenco can only be appreciated by
                        one who has known the passion of
                        life.
                              (striking a pose)
                        I dance to her -- the woman of
                          experience!

      The Duenna blushes, giggles like a schoolgirl -- then
      hastily raises her fan, trying to regain her stiff dignity.

                                            DUENNA
                        Senor MacLeod.  Such talk is indecent!

      But she's clearly flattered.  Don Diego laughs along;
      Consone leans over and puts in his two pesos.  He speaks
      to the Duenna but looks at Theresa.

                                            CONSONE
                        Talk of love is never indecent,
                          Tialita.  Surely you are not too old
                        to remember what it was to be young.

      Clearly, it's coming back to her.  MacLeod bows to the
      Duenna.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Perhaps you'll let me see you home,
                        Senora?

                                            DUENNA
                        People will talk!

                                            MACLEOD
                        Then we should have a chaperone.

      He looks at Theresa.

                                            THERESA
                              (suppressing a laugh)
                        Of course... Only to protect your
                          reputation, Tialita.

      Consone looks at MacLeod, his expression unreadable.96514  "Duende"               11.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96




14041404EXT. WALLED GARDEN - MADRID - 1851

      MacLeod and Theresa walk arm-in-arm in the moonlit garden,
      the Duenna now walking behind them, chaperoning.

                                            THERESA
                            (with a smile)
                        I think it's fifty years since a man
                        turned my Tialita's head.
                              (gently chiding)
                        Be careful you do not break her heart. 
                          A gentleman of Spain does not speak
                        to a woman of love unless he has
                        serious intentions.

                        Neither does a gentleman of Scotland.

      He plucks a rose from the garden and offers it to her. 
      She takes it and they continue walking.

                                            THERESA
                        All my life I have been accused by
                        my teachers of being forward and
                        outspoken.  Of having too many
                          opinions for a young woman.
                              (beat)
                        Do you think that I am too forward

                        No.

      Theresa looks at her Duenna.  The look says volumes.  The
      Duenna stops for a moment and turns away to look at the
      night, giving the couple what privacy they are allowed.

                                            THERESA
                        Good.  Then it won't shock you when
                        I tell you that I love you and have
                        been in love with you from the very
                        first moment I met you.

      MacLeod reacts, then touches her face gently.

                        One day, just one, something he screws
                        up.  Is it so much to ask?

                                            MACLEOD
                        If you want to learn, Anna could
                        arrange some lessons.

                          I thought Luisa was the dancer.

      MacLeod pauses a beat, a slight shadow passing over his
      face.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Luisa's good.  Anna was the best.

      As they round a corner they see --

      ANNA AND LUISA by the stage door, in the midst of a heated
      argument.

                        It's not my fault you can't dance
                          anymore.

      Anna, stung by the remark, slaps her daughter across the
      face.  They stand motionless, frozen in the moment.  Anna's
      emotion carries her to a brief moment in her past.


14061406EXT. BOULEVARD ST. GERMAINE - PARIS - 1986 - DAY

      We see almost surreal FLASHES of Anna dressed in a beautiful
      long, red coat as she crosses the boulevard

      That bears down on her, the driver unseen.

      a flash of Anna in the street, frozen by the oncoming

      Raises her hand to ward off the oncoming vehicle.

      Stop as they get the BUZZ.  MacLeod can't see through the

                        Luisa!  LUISA!

      MacLeod steps up to her and takes her arm.

                                            MACLEOD

      Anna takes a deep breath, controls herself.

                        I'll be all right.

      She nods, forces a smile she doesn't feel.

                        Good night, Duncan.

      Drawing up her dignity, she moves away, leaning on her
      cane as she walks.  MacLeod turns to look in the direction
      of the disappearing limo.


14081408INT. LIMO - NIGHT - SIMULTANEOUS

      Luisa settles into the wide seat, obviously upset over the
      confrontation with her mother.

                                            LUISA
                        I love her, but she makes me crazy.
                              (beat)
                        She treats me like I'm still a kid. 
                        Like I need a chaperone or something.

      A hand offers a glass of champagne.  She turns and we see
      her date is OTAVIO CONSONE.  Consone is elegant, dressed
      in hip, expensive clothes, a glass of just-poured champagne
      in each hand.  She takes the champagne.  He smiles to her.

                                            CONSONE
                        I'm your chaperone.

      He smiles disarmingly, glancing through the rear window at
      MacLeod, adopting a tone of studied casualness.

      He leans toward her, smiling, and kisses her.


14091409EXT. BARGE - DAY

      MacLeod and Richie are working on the deck of the barge. 
      Richie senses MacLeod's distraction.

                        Mac, he might be a nice guy.  Just

      Richie tries to lighten MacLeod's mood.

                        So, how'd you learn to dance like
                        that?

      MacLeod gives Anna a cup of tea.  Richie listens nearby.

                        She's 24.  Maybe she just needs some
                        space.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Anna, I know all the things you want
                        for her, but you can't make her dance.

                                            ANNA
                        Maybe she's right.  Maybe I am trying
                        to live my life through her.

      MacLeod takes Anna's hand gently.

                        Do you know anything about the man

      The limo is stopped on the quai.  Leaning casually against
      it -- Consone.  He is plucking, one by one, the petals of
      a FLOWER he holds in his hand.

      MacLeod approaches, and it's clear that he hates Consone
      deeply.  Consone flexes a gloved hand with an elegant
      flourish, and plucks out the last three petals.

                        Is that ferocious look really meant

                        course.

      He runs his eyes over the barge with disapproval.

                                            CONSONE
                          I thought you had hopes of becoming

                        The true Duende is rare.  It happens
                        when the dancer is beyond being tired. 
                        So exhausted they can't think, but
                        they can't stop either.
                            (far off)
                        The spirit of the dance enters you. 
                        For a moment, time stops, pain
                          stops... your body seems to move by
                        itself.
                              (smiles)
                        It's then that the dance can be truly
                          perfect.

      She glances through the window, and freezes as she sees

      POV PUSHES IN TIGHT on Consone.

      As she reacts: it's the face of the man who killed Rafael
      20 years before.

      Horrified, mesmerized, she grabs her cane and hurries for

14131413EXT. QUAI - MOMENTS LATER

      Consone faces MacLeod.

                                            CONSONE
                          I haven't come here to fight, MacLeod. 
                        I'm here to offer you a simple choice.
                              (beat)
                        Stay away from the Hidalgos -- or
                        die.

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        You.

      Anna moves toward him, all the hate and pain rushing back.

                                            ANNA
                        The police stopped searching, but I
                        have found you.

      She throws herself at him, trying to strike him with her
      hands, her cane.

                                            ANNA
                          Monster!  Diablo!  You killed him!
                        You killed my Rafael!

      Consone catches her hand, stopping the cane.

                                            CONSONE
                        There is a limit to my patience,
                          MacLeod.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Anna, no!

      He tries to pull her back, but she's hysterical.  Luisa
      hurries from the Limo.

                                            LUISA
                        Mama, stop it!  What are you doing!

      Anna freezes at the sight of Luisa.

                                            ANNA
                        Him...?  You're with him!?

      She pulls away from MacLeod and SLAPS Luisa across the
      face.

                                            ANNA
                        He killed Rafael!  He killed your
                        father!

      Luisa's hand goes to her stinging face, her eyes well with
      tears.

                                            LUISA
                        Are you crazy, Mama?!  That was twenty-
                        five years ago!  Look at him.  Think,
                        Mama.  How can it be the same man?

      Anna falters as it hits her.

                                            ANNA
                        But he looks exactly like... I
                        thought...
                              (faltering)
                        I'm sorry....

      She reaches for Luisa, but Luisa flinches away.

                                            LUISA
                        Don't!  Don't touch me!  Just stay
                        out of my life!

      Holding her face, she turns and runs to the limo.  Anna
      takes a faltering step after her.

                                            ANNA
                        Luisa, come back!  I'm sorry!

      But Luisa gets in and slams the door.  MacLeod holds Anna.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Richie... take Anna home.

      Richie gently pulls the shell-shocked Anna away.  As she
      moves, she keeps looking back at Consone.

      Consone turns to MacLeod, composes a look of sympathy.

                                            CONSONE
                        Maybe therapy would help.

                                            MACLEOD
                        See you... soon.

                        Wrong choice.

      He adjusts a glove, slips into the limo and slams the door. 
      The limo pulls silently away.  MacLeod watches it go.  And
      OFF his look --

      FADE IN:


14141414INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY

      An open, gracious room with a Spanish theme.  On the wall
      there are PHOTOS: Anna in various costumes, some with
      Rafael; Luisa.  Richie is helping the dazed Anna to a chair.

                                            RICHIE
                        Can I get you something?  Coffee?

                                            ANNA
                        I was so sure it was him.  I was
                          certain.
                              (beat)
                        I don't understand.

                                            RICHIE
                        Okay, forget coffee.  Something
                          stronger.

      He opens a liquor cabinet, takes out a brandy bottle and
      snifters, and pours her a drink.  On second thought, he
      pours himself one, and belts it back.

                                            RICHIE
                              (strained)

                        double somewhere.

                        But he looked so much like Consone.
                              (beat)
                        But that's impossible, isn't it? 
                        He'd be much older now... almost
                        sixty.

                                            RICHIE
                        There, you see?

      He hands her the glass.  Anna nods, trying to force her
      mind to accept what her heart refuses to believe.

                                            ANNA
                        But I felt it inside, like a knife.
                              (anguished)
                        It was him.
                              (beat)
                        The look... the voice.  The same
                          arrogance that told you whatever you
                        were was nothing compared to him.
                              (beat)
                        But it couldn't be him!

                        Anna, please.  You'll just make
                          yourself crazy.

                                            ANNA
                              (lost)
                        Maybe I already have.

      Richie feels her anguish, and his heart goes out to her. 
      He wants to tell her the truth.

                                            RICHIE
                        No, don't think that.

      He puts his glass down and kneels beside her.

                          Sometimes something seems impossible

                        is.

                        What way is this, Richie?  How could
                        this be possible?

      She searches his face.  Richie has no answer.


14151415INT. BARGE - DAY

      MacLeod, looking preoccupied, has placed a long, carved
      antique WOODEN BOX on the table.  He is looking at it,
      lost in thought, as Richie paces behind him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What did you tell her?

                                            RICHIE
                          Anything... nothing.  What could I
                        tell her?
                              (beat)
                        She's afraid she's going crazy.  Her
                        mind tells her it can't be him.
                              (beat)
                        But she knows it was, Mac.  She knows
                        it in her gut.

      MacLeod places his hands on the box without turning.  He
      opens the box, slides out a short blade, then draws out
      its companion sword -- the weapons used in the Destreza.

                                            RICHIE
                        What are you doing with those?

      He hefts them in his hands, his voice distant, eyes far
      away.  He turns the blades in his hands, and OFF this

14161416INT. CONSONE'S STUDIO - MADRID - 1851 - DAY                        

      The same blade, as MacLeod and Consone face one another.

      The floor of the studio is painted with four large circles,
      with guidelines painted inside each one.  Within one circle,
      Consone and MacLeod are practicing the Spanish sword
      discipline, destreza, the art of the Mysterious Circle. 
      In the background, other pairs do the same.  Each man holds
      a long-bladed sword and, in the left hand, a dagger for
      parrying.

      Consone catches MacLeod's blade against his dagger.

                        Hold.

      MacLeod freezes in position and Consone uses the dagger to
      move MacLeod's sword down, correcting the angle of strike.

                            (as MacLeod adjusts)
                        Good.  Yes.

      Consone disengages and steps out of the circle to inspect
      MacLeod's form.

                                            CONSONE
                        Head.  Heart.  Shoulder.  Gut.

      Consone claps out the rhythm as he calls out the strikes,
      like a dance teacher.  MacLeod moves around the circle,
      pivoting feet and body to take each new position, his sword
      aiming at the named region on an imaginary opponent.

                        Hold.

      MacLeod stays locked in position as his teacher corrects
      minute form breaks.

                        So.  And... so.
                            (of the long blade)
                        The line is direct.  The master of
                          destreza is like a surgeon.

      He steps back into the circle, into the place of MacLeod
      imaginary opponent.  MacLeod's blade brushes Consone's
      abdomen -- right on target.  Consone knocks it away with
      his dagger, positions his own long blade in line for
      MacLeod's heart.  MacLeod parries hastily with the dagger,
      pivots sideways to present a narrower target, presenting
      shoulder instead of exposed gut.

                        Now, exstranjero!

      He presses the fight.  MacLeod is on the defensive, but he
      has clearly learned well -- he parries well, moving around
      the circle, holding his own.  But he's rushed, sweating,
      where Consone stays clinical.

                                            CONSONE
                          Control!  This is gentleman's work,
                        not your gypsy dance.

                              (great effort)
                          Whatever it takes.

      With an unscripted spin, MacLeod succeeds in getting past
      Consone's defense and drawing blood from his shoulder.

      Consone reacts in surprise and a burst of fury at being
      bettered.

      He binds MacLeod's blade with his own, steps inside the
      circle, and quickly buries two inches of his dagger in
      MacLeod's gut.

                                            CONSONE
                        You are a good student.  But you
                        still have much to learn.

      Consone laughs.  MacLeod grimaces as Consone discreetly
      withdraws his dagger, unseen by the other fighters.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That was not necessary.

                                            CONSONE
                        Are you the Master, now?
                              (MacLeod shakes his
                              head)
                        You must be relentless.  Were this a
                        fight to the death, would you let a
                        dagger in the gut stop you?

                                            MACLEOD
                        I would not.

                        Bueno.
                              (beat)
                        The art of the swordfight lies not
                        only in winning -- it lies in not
                        losing.  Let yourself believe you
                        are defeated, and you will be.
                              (warmly)
                        The champion is a man who fights
                        until the final stroke.

      MacLeod nods thoughtfully, absorbing the idea.

                                            CONSONE
                        Now, my young friend, a bath.

      He puts his arm around MacLeod, leads him out of the circle.


14171417INT. STEAM BATH - MADRID - 1851 - DAY

      A simple place.  A couple of stone benches, a small window,
      and steam.  Both MacLeod and Consone are in towels and sit
      on a bench.

                                            CONSONE
                        You have good instincts, MacLeod. 
                        You never make the same mistake twice. 
                        If I had another year with you, I
                        would make a real swordsman of you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm thinking of staying in Madrid.

                                            CONSONE
                        Are you?  And I thought you had too
                        much of the gypsy in you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa wants me to propose. 
                          Marriage.

      Consone is dumbfounded.  He stares at MacLeod.  Finally:

                                            CONSONE
                        A young woman of quality doesn't
                        discuss such things.

                          customs.

      Consone turns his head so that MacLeod will not see his
      anger.  MacLeod is thoughtful, reflective -- not yet seeing
      the anger smoldering in the other Immortal.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Marriage isn't an easy thing for us. 
                        Staying in one place -- how long do
                        we have before someone notices I'm
                        not getting older?  We'd have to
                        travel.  She'd have to leave all she
                        knows.
                              (pensive)
                        She talks about children.  I can't
                        give her those.

                        Theresa is not available to you! 
                        She is of noble blood.

      MacLeod reacts to Consone's tone.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I am the son of a clan chief.

                                            CONSONE
                        You are the son of a barbarian. 
                        You're a foreigner -- an exstranjero. 
                        Forget her, MacLeod.  She is not for
                        you.
                              (beat)
                        I have already spoken to her father.

      MacLeod is blindsided by this.  He stares at Consone.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Perhaps you should have spoken with
                        the lady.

14181418EXT. OUTSIDE THE WALLED GARDEN - MADRID - 1851 - DAY

      MacLeod approaches hurriedly.  As he reaches the gate in
      the garden wall

                                            THERESA (O.S.)
                        Never!  I would rather die!

      MacLeod hastily pushes on the gate.  Locked.


14191419EXT. WALLED GARDEN - MADRID - 1851 - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod comes over the wall and lands inside the courtyard. 
      He hurries toward the house.  As he does, Theresa runs
      out, sobbing, and nearly runs right into him.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa!

      She stumbles, startled; he reaches out and steadies her.

                                            THERESA
                        Oh, Duncan...  You're too late.

      They both turn to see that CONSONE has followed MacLeod
      into the garden.

                        But she knows who she is.  What she

                                            THERESA
                        No!  I'll never marry you!  I hate
                        you!

      Consone reacts, stung.  He turns to MacLeod.

                                            CONSONE
                          I warned you.

                        Let's see if the barbarian can die
                        like a gentleman.

      MacLeod salutes him with his sword.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa, go inside.

                                            THERESA
                        No!  No, don't do this --
                            (a plea)
                        Otavio, you mustn't.  Please, he's

                        No more.

      With that, he strikes.  MacLeod reacts, parries well.  His
      fighting instincts are alive, every nerve alert for
      Consone's next move, his eyes locked on his opponent.

      The two fighters exchange rapid-fire strikes and parries,
      the long swords flashing as move and counter-move are
      executed with precision.

      Consone may be the Master of the form, but MacLeod has
      been well taught.  He presses the offensive, testing his
      opponent, driving Consone around the imaginary circle with
      a series of attacks to head and heart.

      Consone deftly dodges and parries, surprises MacLeod with
      a low move, slashing his thigh.

                                            THERESA
                        No!

      MacLeod's attention is momentarily diverted by her outcry.

                                            MACLEOD
                          Theresa, go inside.

      It's the moment's distraction Consone needed.  He attacks,
      catching MacLeod out of position, and his blade finds its
      target in MacLeod's shoulder.

      MacLeod falls to his knees, his own sword dropping from
      his nerveless hand.  His eyes are wide with astonishment
      and realization -- he's about to die.

                                            CONSONE
                            (to Theresa)
                        Go now.

      But, as Consone raises his sword for the beheading stroke --

                                            THERESA
                        Wait.

      The desperation is gone from her voice.  Her tone is flat,
      firm.  It stops Consone.

                                            THERESA
                        Spare his life, Otavio.  Spare him...
                        and I'll marry you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        No!

      He's on hands and knees, weak, disoriented -- he can't
      stop her.  Theresa doesn't look at him.  She can't.

                                            THERESA
                            (to Consone)
                        Do this for me, and I will be your
                        wife.  Kill him, and I will be in a

                                            THERESA
                          I swear.

      A long moment.  Finally -- Consone releases MacLeod from
      the point of death with great satisfaction.  He offers his
      arm to Theresa.  She takes it.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa...

      She finally looks at him, eyes shining with unshed tears.

                                            THERESA
                        I have given my word.  Go.  Go, and
                        think of me no more.
                              (beat)
                        It is my honor, now.

      She turns away.  As she and Consone move off, push in on
      MacLeod, on his knees in the dirt, helpless and shattered.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


14201420EXT. PARK - THE PRESENT - DAY

      CLOSE - A GEOMETRIC OUTLINE

      drawn in the dirt, with straight lines sectoring it the
      Mysterious Circle.

                                            RICHIE (O.S.)
                              (doubtful)
                        It looks like a chess board.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's a lot of things.

      Richie watches as MacLeod opens the carved box, removes
      the dagger and sword, preparing to step into the circle.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's a discipline.  A weapon.
                              (beat)
                        A frame of mind.

      He steps into the circle.

      Slowly, ceremonially, he starts to move the blades, moving
      faster as his body remembers the moves he learned 150 years
      ago.

                                            RICHIE
                        You really think this guy's gonna
                        stand in that thing while you fight?

      MacLeod doesn't stop moving.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This little circle was his world. 
                        He was the master of it.
                              (beat)
                        He'll come.

                                            RICHIE
                              (exasperated)
                        Why not just whack the guy?  Why
                        play his game, on his turf?

      MacLeod pauses.  This is hard to put into words.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Because it all comes back to this.

                                            RICHIE
                              (shakes his head at
                              this folly)
                        Mac, this isn't poetry.  It's a fight
                        to the death!  Why give him an edge
                        you don't need to?
                              (beat)
                        If Consone beat you before, he could
                        beat you again.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (tight)
                        I'm better now.

                                            RICHIE
                        Yeah.
                              (beat)
                        But maybe he is, too.

      MacLeod pauses, the blades stopping in mid-flight.  He has
      thought of it -- but he doesn't care.  He continues to
      spin the blades, and OFF THIS --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

14211421INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

      MacLeod is gazing at one of framed PHOTOS on the wall: a
      photo of Anna, a striking young beauty, dancing.  She looks
      like a bird caught in mid-flight.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Beautiful.

      He moves past other photos of Anna in different poses,
      different costumes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        The Soleares, Baile Grande, the
                          Fandango...
                              (turning to Anna)
                        I heard no one moved like you, Anna. 
                        No one.

      Anna shrugs, modestly accepting the compliment.

                                            ANNA
                        I was pretty good, wasn't I?
                            (sad smile)
                          I thought my Luisa would be better.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Maybe she will be.

      She turns to him.

                                            ANNA
                        She's all I have left, Duncan.  I
                        don't want to lose her.
                              (beat)
                        Even if she never danced again.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You won't lose her.
                              (beat)
                        Are you certain she hasn't mentioned
                          anything about where he lives?  Where
                        he takes her?

                                            ANNA
                          Nothing.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What about the other dancers in the
                          company?

                        They tell each other everything. 
                        But they're her friends.
                              (beat)
                        I'm the boss.  They'll never tell
                        me.  And they've seen you with me
                        before.  They know we're friends.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (beat)
                        Then we'll just have to find
                        Someone they don't know.

      And off his thoughtful look --


14221422INT. DANCERS' APARTMENT - DAY

      A small apartment.  Stockings and dance leotards are strewn
      around, set out to dry.  Two of the female dancers from
      Annals troupe are there: GILDA wears a skintight aerobic
      outfit, works out to a loud TV aerobics class.  There's
      knocking at the door; Gilda's not stopping.

                                            GILDA
                        It's unlocked, Manuel!

      The knocking continues.

                                            ISABELLA
                        I'll get it.

      ISABELLA crosses the room wearing a skimpy bathtowel.  As
      she reaches the door it swings open --

      Richie steps in, shades on, looking the entrepreneur.  He
      takes in Isabella.

                                            RICHIE
                        Whoa!  Have I come to the right place!

      Isabella steps back, pulling up her towel.

                                            ISABELLA
                        Who are you?

                                            RICHIE
                        Richie, uh... Richard Redstone.

      He offers his hand.  Isabella takes it.  The towel slips. 
      We are on her back as she moves slowly to grab the towel.

                                            RICHIE
                          Sorry...

      Her friend steps into the breech.

                        Richie who?

                                            RICHIE
                        I saw you at the Club.  Got your
                        address from one of the musicians,
                        what's his name... ?

                                            GILDA
                        Ramone?

                        That's it, Ramone.  He said you might
                        be interested.

                                            GILDA
                        In what?

                                            RICHIE

                        Whaddya say?  Interested?

      They look at each other, break into smiles.

                                            GILDA
                        Maybe.

                                            RICHIE
                        Great.
                            (the clincher)
                        But there were three of you.
                        Where's the other one?

                                            GILDA
                        Luisa's not here.  There's only the
                        two of us right now.

                                            RICHIE
                        Problem... this is a problem.  I
                        need three dancers.  Can't you give
                        me her number?

      Gilda and Isabella trade looks.

                                            GILDA
                        We don't know where she is.

14231423EXT. CONSONE'S HOUSE - DAY

      An expensive house in the outskirts of Paris, at the end
      of a drive.  MacLeod climbs from his car, and gazes at the
      house for a long moment.  An old HOUSEKEEPER is exiting
      the house.  As MacLeod sees her --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


14241424EXT. WALLED GARDEN - MADRID - 1853 - DAY

      Theresa's Old Duenna is picking roses.  Two years have
      passed since MacLeod lost Theresa -- but the Duenna looks
      10 years older, her face lined.

                                            MACLEOD (O.S.)
                            (loud whisper)
                        Senora!

      She turns to the sound.  MacLeod has ridden up on horseback. 
      She almost faints when she sees who it is.  She hurries to
      the gate.

                                            DUENNA
                        You're mad, Senor.  What are you
                        doing here?!

      He dismounts.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I have to talk to Theresa.

                        Senor Consone will kill you if he
                        sees you.  Please, ride on.  Leave

                        Then please... at least take her a
                          message.

                                            DUENNA
                        Oh, Senor MacLeod.  You don't know
                        what you ask.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Tell her... tell her I haven't
                          forgotten her.  Tell her I cannot. 
                          I haven't had her out of my heart
                        for two years.

      He takes her hand, tearing up --

                                            MACLEOD
                        Senora, I know you had a love when
                        you were young.  A man you never
                          married.

                        If he rode up to this gate today,
                          wouldn't you want to see him?  To
                        talk with him?

      The Duenna's face shows how right MacLeod is... He pushes
      the advantage:

                                            MACLEOD
                        If you love her, Senora, please.
                        Let me see her.

      Duenna sighs deeply, then relents.  Opens the gate.

                                            DUENNA
                        Come, Senor... prepare yourself.

      She hurries out through the gate.


14251425EXT. CEMETERY - MADRID - 1853 - DAY

      MacLeod and the Duenna stand at Theresa's grave.  The
      headstone reads: "THERESA DEL GLORIA CONSONE, Beloved
      Daughter, Sister, and Wife, 1829-1853.  Gone to God."

      MacLeod looks down at the gravestone in silent grief.

                                            DUENNA

      In slow motion, Theresa's hands seem to be reaching for
      the camera as she falls down the flight of stairs.

      Consone stands at the top of the stairs, his face
      unreadable.

      The Duenna turns away from MacLeod.  Her tone changes.

                                            DUENNA
                        She must have slipped.

      Something about her tone alerts MacLeod

                                            MACLEOD
                        Was she alone when it happened?

                        Was he there?

                              (unconvincing)
                        No, Senor, you mustn't say such a
                        thing!

      She crosses herself devoutly.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Tell me the truth, Tialita.

                                            DUENNA
                        No one saw anything.  We only heard.
                              (beat)
                        She never stopped loving you.  It
                        made the senor insane with jealousy.

      His hand goes to his sword.  The Duenna reacts in fear.

                        As long as Theresa was alive, I

      She grabs his arm with surprising strength, her voice filled
      with grief and passion.

                        She gave her happiness to spare your

                        you were safe.

      MacLeod's gaze moves down to the door where an old SPANISH
      HOUSEKEEPER is just stepping out, locking up the house. 
      He approaches her.

                        give it to him in person.

      She nods and moves off.  As she goes, MacLeod turns back
      to watch the house.

      The Club is closed, dark and quiet.  Anna has just opened
      up.  She turns on a light, looking drawn, moving across
      the room with a pronounced limp -- her leg is bothering
      her tonight.  As she walks

      she crashes painfully to her knees, grabbing a chair for
      support.

14321432EXT. CONSONE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

      MacLeod waits in his car, watching Consone's house.

      HEADLIGHTS

      Sweep across the drive.  A car pulls up.  There's no BUZZ. 
      No Consone.

      LUISA

      Gets out of the car.  She moves toward the house.  As she
      reaches the front gate, pulls it open

      MACLEOD'S HAND

      Pushes it shut.

      Luisa turns in surprise.

                                            LUISA
                        Duncan!

                        Did my mother send you?  Look, I
                        love her, but she can't keep doing
                        this.

                        He had an errand to run.  He'll be
                        home soon.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Get your things.  You're leaving.

      MacLeod winces at the reminder of Theresa's words to him.

                        And that the woman he married meant
                        a great deal to me.

                                            LUISA
                        I think you should leave.

                              (intense)
                        And he killed her.

                                            LUISA
                        You're as crazy as my mother.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Your mother's not crazy.

      MacLeod gets the BUZZ.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Go inside, Luisa.  And stay there.

                                            LUISA
                        But --

                                            MACLEOD
                        Now.

      MacLeod's intensity frightens Luisa.  She quickly does as
      she's told.  MacLeod moves down the drive to face

      CONSONE

      as he arrives.

                                            CONSONE
                          Highlander.  I always seem to find

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa was never yours.

                              (pressing)
                        But she thought of me, Consone.  She
                        thought of me every night.  Every
                        time you looked at her.  Every time
                        you touched her.
                              (beat)
                        That's why you killed her.

      Consone is shaken, but covers quickly.

                        Forget her, Consone.  I sent her
                        back to her mother.

                        you once she knew the truth?

      Consone's face darkens.

                                            CONSONE
                        She can run all she likes.  If it

                        seduce the daughter.

      The door is flung open and Luisa runs out of the house.

                                            LUISA
                        You son-of-a-bitch!

      Luisa flings herself at Consone.  MacLeod hauls her back.

                        For both of you.

      MacLeod gets between Consone and Luisa.

                              (giving her a shove)
                        Go, Luisa!  Get out!  Run!

      She hesitates, then sees his expression -- and runs to her
      car.  As she goes, Consone draws his sword.

                                            CONSONE
                        I'll find her.  I'll have her.

      MacLeod draws his own in return.

                        Did I say anything about a sacrifice?

      Consone bows acknowledgment.  Gestures MacLeod toward --


14371437EXT. CONSONE'S HOUSE - THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCLE - NIGHT

      A tiled patio with the circle of combat embedded in the
      design.  The two opponents face each other, twin blades in
      hand.  A bow of respect, and then the fight is engaged.

      There's no question that Consone is still a Master.  He
      moves around the circle with ease and grace -- thrusting,
      parrying, slicing.  MacLeod defends himself well, but can't
      get the upper hand.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               47.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96

      Consone is working up a sweat.  This isn't as easy as he
      expected.  More than once he's forced to parry hastily,
      breaking form to protect his flanks.  MacLeod grins at him
      wickedly.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Still think you could make a swordsman
                        of me, Otavio?

                        You were born a pig farmer, and you'll
                        always be a pig farmer.

      He makes a concerted rush, forcing MacLeod onto the
      defensive.  MacLeod's face shows his surprise -- Consone
      has moved the fight up a level, and MacLeod is pressed to
      deflect his opponent's sword.  He'll have to win this
      quickly, or not at all.

      MacLeod dodges Consone's blade, sees an opening, advances --

      And finds CONSONE'S BLADE in his path.  The Master has
      anticipated him.  Consone's stabs him with his blade.

                                            CONSONE
                        And you die a pig farmer.

                          Maybe...

      MacLeod drops his dagger, grabs Consone's arm in his left
      hand, and pulls himself deeper onto the sword and closer
      to his opponent.

      If it hurts, he doesn't feel it -- he's reached that state
      of grace that the dancers call duende.

      Consone is taken completely by surprise.  He's unprotected
      as MacLeod swings with his free hand --

                                            MACLEOD
                        ...but not today.

      Consone's body falls.  MacLeod, gravely wounded, falls
      beside it.

      The Quickening plays along the lines and arcs of the
      Mysterious Circle, outlining MacLeod's body against the
      tiled pattern.

      As if on cue, the BUZZ.  Richie turns in relief to see

      MACLEOD'S CAR

      Finally arriving.  As a weary MacLeod climbs out, he sees
      Richie approach.

                                            RICHIE
                        You won.

      MacLeod nods.

                                            RICHIE
                        Was he as good as you remembered?

                                            MACLEOD
                        He was better.

      He starts moving up the gangplank.  Richie stays on his
      heels.

                                            RICHIE
                        How'd you do it?

                                            MACLEOD
                        I don't know.

      MacLeod stops at the top of the steps, thoughtful.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Consone thought the fight was all
                        about control.  About mastering every
                        line, every step.
                              (beat)
                        There's a place in the dance where
                        you forget you're dancing.  Where
                        you do things beyond what your
                          conscious mind is capable of.  Beyond
                        what your body has learned.

                        Duende.
                            (off MacLeod's look)
                        I'm learning.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (a nod)
                        Duende.

      And with a mysterious smile, he heads inside.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:
