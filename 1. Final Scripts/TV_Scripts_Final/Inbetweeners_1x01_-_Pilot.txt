FADE IN:

EXT. SCHOOL LAWN - MORNING 

WILL, 15, serious about his dress shirt and sweater vest, 
stares out at a sea of teenagers waiting for the morning 
bell... His buddies JAY, SIMON and NEIL (holding a football) 
sit on a concrete picnic table next to him.  

WILL V.O.
My name is Will Mackenzie.  And 
these... are my closest friends.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - (FLASHBACK)

MR. GILBERT, a bored-looking 30-something, leads WILL out of 
the front office and into the hallway of students. The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   2.


WILL V.O.
See, the thing about being a 
teenager is that your social 
standing can be determined by one 
moment.  One choice.  And though 
sometimes that choice is your own...

Will nods hello to a pretty girl, who smiles back-- but Mr. 
Gilbert quickly drags him past her.

Mr. Gilbert stops at SIMON, at his locker with JAY and NEIL.  

MR. GILBERT
Simon, this is Will Mackenzie.  He 
just transferred from a private 
 been carefully school, and you ve
selected to show him around.

SIMON
What?  Why me?

MR. GILBERT
You were standing closest to the 
door.

Simon looks at the administration office door, groaning, as 
Jay and Neil take in Will with an amused chuckle. 

JAY
Is that a briefcase?

SIMON
(to Mr. Gilbert)
Why do I have to show him around?  
Nobody showed me around.

MR. GILBERT
Because Will suffered from bullying 
issues at his last school.  

WILL
What?  No.  No, I didn t.

MR. GILBERT
 nothing to be ashamed of--It s

WILL
Sorry, but it is, kinda.  And I 
  Sooo...wasn t.

MR. GILBERT
Did they pick on you because your 
dad left your mom for a prostitute?

Will glares at him for a beat.

WILL
 They didn tknow that at my last 
school.

MR. GILBERT
Oh.  Well, you ve got a fresh start 
now.  Good luck.

her for a whore, I intended to make 
the best of it.

CARLY, a stunningly-hot girl walking with her girlfriends.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   4.


WILL
You really think throwing a 
football will make a girl like you?

NEIL
It makes her see him as an athlete.  
Subliminal advertising.

WILL
 the opposite of subliminal, It s
actually.

JAY
True.  It s liminal.

WILL
Not a word.

JAY

WILL V.O.
...And, as I came from a school 
where popularity was determined by 
how early you got into Harvard...

Simon, across the lawn now, pivots in front of Carly and 
LAUNCHES THE FOOTBALL.  A nice tight spiral.  Carly and the 
other students watch as it sails through the air towards the 
guys.  Will jogs a few steps and CATCHES IT.  People notice.  
A brief moment of cool that s not lost on him.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
...It was nice to be at somewhere you 
could have it by throwing a football.

Will drops back and hurls the ball with all his might.  It 
flips through the air, end-over-end, veering wildly off 
course and slamming into the head of a special-ed student 
struggling to walk on arm braces.  He goes down hard.

The students gasp at the challenged kid, moaning and flopping 
around on the ground, then turn their glare at Will, who 
stares in silent horror. 

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Yup...  This was going to be great. 

SLAM TO OPENING CREDITS.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   5.


ACT ONE

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
So far my first day of public school 
had been a wonderful voyage of 
discovery...  About how awful public 
schools were.

MISCELLANEOUS SHOTS OF SCHOOL DAY

- WILL opens his locker door.  It comes off in his hand.

- WILL walks down a CROWDED HALLWAY.  A group of students 
chuckle at his briefcase.  He pretends not to notice.

- WILL approaches the door to the LIBRARY and tugs on it.  
It s locked.  He sees a sheet of paper taped inside, reading: 
 Closed for budgetary reasons. 

- WILL enters a CLASSROOM, the briefcase on his back - his 
 a Jansport.  He heads to arms through the handles like it s
an empty seat, when the briefcase opens and his books fall 
out in a noisy avalanche.  He smiles tightly.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

WILL, looking beat, enters to see row of toilet stalls with 
no doors.  He sighs... 

WILL V.O.
...Especially the toilets.  Which 
have no doors on them to discourage 
drug use.  This also, curiously 
enough, discourages shitting.  

Will enters a stall, noticing the urine-soaked floor.  He 
delicately hangs his windbreaker across the stall opening.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
But at least I got to spend some 
more time with my new friends...

JAY, SIMON and NEIL enter.

JAY
I m telling you, I spent the entire 
 the Summer porking vag.  That s
upside of your parents dragging you 
to a bunch of RV parks.  The girls 
there all have one thing in common.

SIMON

Jay pauses, considering.

JAY
Just-- deep.  Try to get really 
deep.  Right up to the balls.

NEIL
And do you put the balls in?

JAY
What?

NEIL
ve gotta put the  heard you I ve
balls in if you really want a girl 
to get off.

JAY
(unsure, then covering)
Yeah.  You can.  Some chicks like 
it.  Some don t.

SIMON

there.  You re full of shit.  You ve 
never fucked anyone.  Neither have 
I, and neither has Neil.

JAY
Hey-- you can think whatever you 
ve scrubbed  care.  I want.  I don t
enough crabs off my jock to know 
how many sluts I ve--

A group of GOOD-LOOKING SENIORS walks in.  Jay immediately 
clams up and starts washing his hands.  

WILL V.O.
...And as much as I wished I didn t 
fit in with these idiots...

Will s windbreaker detaches from the stall opening and falls 
to the urine-soaked floor.  He looks down at it, then up at 
the bathroom full of guys now staring at him as he squats six 
inches above the toilet-paper covered seat.  The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   7.


WILL V.O. (CONT D)
...I did.

He gives them a sheepish wave.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The guys sit with their lunches.  SIMON, NEIL and JAY with 
school trays and WILL with a series of meticulously packed 
tupperware containers.  He unfolds a linen napkin and puts it 
in his lap.

JAY

WILL
What?  Good manners cost nothing.

JAY
Good snatch costs nothing.  Unless 
your dad s around.  

WILL
Thanks.  

NEIL
Do you still have to give a

Simon nods, humbled, and smiles back at Carly.

She leans in close to take a sniff... giving him a peek down 
her unbuttoned blouse.  He swallows hard.

SIMON
It s kind of an all over body spray.

CARLY
 nice.  See ya in economics?It s

He nods, crossing his legs and squirming a bit as she crosses 
away.  Jay stares at him in disbelief.

And, if there was one upside to 
being trapped in this hellhole of an 
institution, it was finding a group 
of friends that would make anyone 
feel better about themselves.

Have you tried thinking about 
something unsexy?  Like dead nuns?

Simon concentrates for a beat, then cringes.

EXT. SCHOOL - LATER THAT DAY

SIMON, JAY and NEIL walk away from the school in a crowd of 
students.  WILL hurries up to them.

EXT. SUBURB - THE NEXT MORNING

WILL walks along the sidewalk with his briefcase. 

WILL V.O.
The next morning I headed to 
 house to skip school for Simon s
the first time ever.  

A school bus full of kids passes by.  Will squirms guiltily, 
but presses on, approaching:

Cooper a doff of his invisible hat...

WILL

And regrets it immediately.

eyebrows.

Yyyes.  It is a little molestery, I 
know.  But I got a great deal.  
From a molester.  But its never 
been-- he never molested in it.

towards the van.  She heads back inside as they get to it.  The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   15.


SIMON (CONT D)
Well that was flawless.

WILL
I should have pointed to the Volvo.

JAY
You think?

A balding, 40-something guy with a creepy mustache approaches 
and smiles delightedly at the sight of them. 

GUY
You guys need a lift?

NEIL
Sure!

Will, Jay and Simon glare wide-eyed at Neil, then tear off.  
Neil shrugs apologetically to the guy and hurries after them.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - LATER

The guys sit around a fountain in a city park.

WILL V.O.
So, so far - skipping school had 
 mom, consisted of lying to Simon s
dodging a rape, and hanging out 
with the only other people not in 
school or at work.

A group of toddlers skip by.  Jay crumples his 7-11 cup and 
hurls it after one of them.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Two year-olds.

JAY
Alright, this is totally lame.

 or something.Red Rover with  em

night.  So stupid.

briefcase.

NEIL
You also talk kinda grownuppy.

JAY

Will sighs, resigned.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

WILL approaches a bored-looking CLERK reading a magazine.

WILL
Good afternoon.

CLERK
Hmm?  Oh.  Hey.

WILL
(as if correcting 
himself)
Yes.  Hey.

The clerk looks up at him, puzzled.  Will, panic setting in, 
quickly grabs an armful of potato chips.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   17.


WILL (CONT D)
Warmer out than I thought it d be.  
When I left for my job.  At the

WILL
Yes.  I am a man, who has just

thing he sees...

WILL (CONT D)
Some Remy Martin?

CLERK
Cognac?

WILL
Yyyes.  Is it a good year?

JAY finishes pouring the Remy Martin into paper cups.

JAY

They all take a shot, then immediately cringe.

 I do.  I love her.  She s

WILL

NEIL
Yeah.  Girls like being told guys 
like them.  Just be direct.  
Spraypaint it on an overpass.

SIMON
What?

JAY
No no no.  Not intimate enough.  
You want to be romantic, you have 
to aim straight for the heart.

Simon nods.

WILL V.O.

advice for killing a deer, it was 
all Simon needed to make his move.

CARLY approaches on the sidewalk with her buddies, including 
her best friend WENDY, on their way home from school.  They 
stop in their tracks at the sight of the spray-painted drive.

CARLY
What the hell is that?

SIMON
What?

Simon looks up, caught.

CARLY
Simon, why are you spray-painting 
my driveway?!

SIMON
Um--

CARLY

Will, Jay and Neil stifle drunken laughter.

SIMON

 HOUSE - THAT EVENINGEXT. CARLY S

 WILL and SIMON (looking a bit hammered) walk up to Carly s
house and ring the bell.

WILL V.O.
So, after three hours of drinking 
what tasted like mouthwash and 
formaldehyde, Simon was ready. 

CARLY opens the door, seeing Simon.

CARLY
Hi.

SIMON
Hi.

WILL
(peeking from behind 
Simon)
Hello.

CARLY
Oh.  Hey, Will.  
(to Simon)
Is he your chaperone?

SIMON

CARLY

SIMON
Really?

CARLY
Mm.  Come on.  I was just gonna 
grab a drink.  Dylan is in there 
watching TV, Will. 

Will nods and gives Simon a thumbs-up before heading to the 
living room.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

CARLY takes a bottle of wine out of the fridge as SIMON tries 
to lean suavely on the counter, but is clearly wobbly.

CARLY
Dad totally lost it when he saw the 
 gonna make your driveway.  He s
parents pay for a stone cleaner.

SIMON
It was worth it.

Carly smells the air.

CARLY
Do you smell Windex?

SIMON
(putting a finger on her 
lips)
Shhhhh.

She winces at his breath and pushes his finger away.

CARLY
Oh God is it you?  What ve you been 
drinking?

SIMON
Shit.  My manners--  

He produces a bottle of liquid with gold flakes floating it.  

SIMON (CONT D)
Want some?

She looks at it, repulsed.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   26.


CARLY
Ew.  What homeless guy did you 
 stick to steal that from?  I ll
wine.

SIMON
Wine is for girls.

CARLY
I am a girl.

SIMON
(off her look)
Well, this is a man s drink.  For 
men.  And if you can t take me like 
 sorry baby, but this, well... I m
this is the package.

He chugs far, far too much of it, grabs a brownie, then chugs 
some more.  This is clearly not a great package.

INT. CARLY S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

WILL watches TV with Carly s eight year-old brother, Dylan.  
Will points at the screen, still a little drunk himself.

WILL

what would happen if a chemical 
bomb hit a city.  Streets would 
pile up with corpses.  Stacked up 
on the curb like recycle bins.

Dylan looks at him, concerned.

DYLAN
My parents are in the city.  Would 
they be killed?

WILL
Yup.  dead.  Stacked up on a curb.

Dead forever?

CARLY

CARLY
What?!  Jesus!

Simon freezes, suddenly green.  He swallows some puke.  

CARLY (CONT D)
Simon?  Are you alright?

SIMON
Oh shit--

He turns in the direction of the sink and PROJECTILE VOMITS 
in a chunky, gold-flaked arc -- across the kitchen island and 
appliances, then staggers to the sink and VOMITS HARD into 
that.  He wipes his mouth and looks back at Carly.

SIMON (CONT D)

He turns back and VOMITS AGAIN, as a bloodcurdling scream is 
heard from the other room.

fetal position as he moans.

CUT TO:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

WILL and SIMON walk through the night, Simon hunched over and 
humiliated.  Will puts a supportive hand on his shoulder. 

WILL V.O.
Though the night was a complete 
disaster, it actually bonded the 
two of us.  A friendship forged out 
of failure.  We were the golden 
flakes floating in the pool of 
vomit.  And there was comfort 
knowing it would never get any 
worse than this.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   29.


They stop at the sight of Simon s house...  A sporty red car 
parked in the driveway.

WILL and SIMON sit on a couch as POLLY and MR. & MRS. COOPER 
lecture them.

MR. COOPER
I mean, did you think the school

alcohol?

Not cheap.  It had gold in it.

Polly looks at him for a beat, speechless, then GRABS HIM IN 
A SYMPATHETIC HUG.  Will smiles to himself over her shoulder.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - THE NEXT MORNING

WILL, SIMON, JAY and NEIL saunter through the crowd of 
students, goofing around and shoving each other.  

WILL V.O.
 safe to say public So I think it s
school is going to work out fine.  
I have three friends that seem to 
accept me, and a lifetime of 
superior private education to get 
me out of any jam this environment 
could present.

He waves goodbye to the guys and heads into a CLASSROOM, 
smiling at an ATTRACTIVE GIRL as he passes.  She smiles back.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Who knows?  I might even get laid. 

He has a seat in an empty desk, feeling good about himself, 
as the morning announcements start from the PA SPEAKER:

MR. GILBERT (O.S.)
(from PA)
Morning students.  First, I want to 
 had a formal announce that we ve
suit filed by the mother of William 
Mackenzie, regarding his treatment 
by the student body.  

Will looks up, the color draining from his face.

MR. GILBERT (O.S.) (CONT D)
(from PA)
Any student caught bullying him, or 
causing him any emotional or 
physical distress, will be severely 
disciplined by the school and 
possibly outside law enforcement.  
Will is a good boy, with a great big 
heart, and he deserves your respect.

The students all turn and giggle at Will, who is mortified.

WILL V.O.
But then again, I m a fucking idiot.

He slams his head down on the the desk, as we CUE END MUSIC, 
OVER:The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   31.


INT. FRONT OFFICE - SAME TIME

MR. GILBERT finishes reading from a sheet of paper into the 
microphone, then hands it back to POLLY MACKENZIE.

POLLY
That was perfect.  Thank you.

She smiles and heads out.  He checks out her ass as she goes.

MR. GILBERT
(quietly)
No, thank you.

The THEME MUSIC RISES, OVER:

 DRIVEWAY - DAYEXT. CARLY S

The guys clean the spray-paint off the driveway.  JAY uses a 
pressure washer, but we notice he s used the water stream to 
draw a massive cock in the concrete.  SIMON sees it and 
throws a scrub brush at him.  Jay dodges, accidentally 
turning the washer on the garage door, which blasts off a 
large stripe of paint.  

They all stare, horrified, then start laughing.  WILL turns 
the water hose on all of them, and they get into it -- 
carrying on, completely drenched, not a care in the world. 

PULL BACK to see the brown panel van parked on the curb, the 
man with the mustache smiling warmly at the peaceful sight.
