          A stream of hot coffee hits a cup.  The pourer, SARAH,
          slides it across her table as she sits down.

                                        SARAH
                          Honestly?  I think you make a lot
                        of noise, and people react to
                        noise.  I think you're crude,
                          aggressive, and bull-headed. 

          Reveal she is speaking to GREG STILLSON, who is sitting
          at her kitchen table, sipping the hot coffee.

                                        GREG
                        Good coffee.

                                        SARAH
                        Again, that's just as a public
                        figure, I don't mean to imply...

                                        GREG
                        Sure you do, and that's just fine. 
                        I like to hear it.  I never get
                        to hear this stuff.  You know
                        why?

                                        SARAH
                        Because everyone around you kisses
                        your ass?

                                        GREG
                        Because everyone around me kisses
                        my ass.
                                (beat)
                        I say I'm the last honest
                          politician, but I can't find people
                        who'll be honest for me.  That's
                        why I'm always on the lookout for
                        people like you. 

                                        SARAH
                        You make house calls to people
                        who are gonna offend you?

                        I want on my team.
                                (off Sarah's surprise)
                        The success of a grassroots
                          campaign relies on the dedication
                        of smart, honest, real people. 
                        Like you, Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        You don't even know me...

                        Bachelor's in political science
                        from University of Maine, and you
                        want Harrison Fisher out of office
                        just like the rest of us.  Who do
                        you think's gonna do that?  Steve
                        Hansz?  It's true, I plan to 
                        shake things up.  I'm here to
                        make a difference, and empower
                        others to do the same.  How do
                        you feel about making a difference?

          She thinks about that, then shakes her head.

                                        SARAH
                        Your... research must've told you
                        I'm already running a campaign.

                                        GREG
                        "Bannerman for Sheriff," I know. 
                        And I completely support that.  I
                        think your husband's doing an
                          exceptional job.

                                        SARAH
                        I'll let him know you think so, 
                        but I... I'm just not interested
                        at this time.

                        Oh, you're at least interested. 
                          Otherwise when I called you
                          wouldn't have said sure, stop on
                        by and have some coffee.

                                        SARAH
                        It's not every day a congressional
                          candidate wants to hear your
                          thoughts.  I was curious.

                                        GREG
                        I think it was more than that.  I
                        think you want to make a
                          difference.

                        I wish that were the case.  Truth
                        is, you'd be horrified at the
                        level of apathy out there.

                        Tell me.

                          I substitute teach at Cleaves
                        Mills High, English and Music. 
                        Our district is so desperate to
                          increase its per-student funding
                        that my classroom gets bigger and
                        bigger every year.  The student-
                        teacher ratio's gotta be 35 to 1
                        now, and I can tell you the quality
                        of these kids' education is
                        suffering.

                                        GREG
                        That's exactly the kind of thing
                        you can change.

                        That's exactly the kind of thing
                        I'm going to change.  "Making
                        sure money helps, not hurts," is
                        one of my planks.

                        And how do you plan on doing it?

          Greg smiles, and puts down his coffee.

                                        GREG
                        By being crude, aggressive, and
                          bull-headed.  By making so much
                        noise that Washington can't help
                        but listen.  I will go to war for
                        you... but you have to give me
                        the ammunition.

          Off Sarah's reaction, absorbing Greg's honest passion. 
          He sees he made a mark, and immediately pulls back.

                                        GREG
                        Think about it.  Meantime, why
                        don't you stop by the debates
                          tonight, check out the scene, see
                        if it sparks you.  Better than
                          watching it on TV.

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe.

                                        GREG
                        Thanks for the coffee.  And thanks
                        for listening. 



          JOHNNY sits in a booth that affords him a good deal of
          privacy as he reads the paper and enjoys a cheeseburger.

          The hanging door bell JINGLES and Johnny casually glances
          up... then double-takes when he sees Greg Stillson enter. 
          Johnny tenses up as Greg walks straight toward him;
          suddenly this private booth has become a bear-trap.  Greg
          gives a friendly nod, then slides in across from Johnny.

                                        GREG
                          Anything about me in there?

          Johnny leans out and looks down the aisle - it looks like
          Stillson came alone.  Johnny folds up his paper.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, no, this is the sports section.

          It's like a bad dream.  Johnny wants to wake up.

                        I'm sorry, Mr. Stillson, can I

                        Greg, please.  We've met a couple
                        times.  Just never had a proper
                          sit-down.  Gene Purdy seems to
                        think you're the greatest thing
                        since Christian Rock.  Said, "Greg,
                        get to know this guy."

                        I'd call first but I figure you'd
                        sense I was coming anyway. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't really work that way. 

                                        GREG
                        Yeah?  How does "it" work?  You
                        touch someone and get a vision of
                        them doing something bad, like
                        kidnapping a kid or murdering
                        some girl, and then you try and
                        make it right.  Right?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something like that.

          Greg leans forward, as if sharing a secret.

                                        GREG
                        And when we shook hands at that
                        rally, you got a vision of me
                        doing something bad.  

          Johnny doesn't answer, which sounds like 'yes' to Greg.

                                        GREG
                        And now you want to make it right.

          Johnny just holds his look.  Greg nods, leans back.

                                        GREG
                        I may have done some things in

                        But upon reflection, I realize I
                        had good reasons and best
                        intentions for all of them. 
                          Whatever you saw, you probably
                        took out of context.

          There's a trace of doubt in Greg's voice, like he may be
            searching for a way to confess.  But all that's banished
          in a hearty laugh.

                        As if I have to justify myself to
                          a fortune teller.
                                (suddenly all business)
                        Look, I know what this is about. 
                        You want a chip in the big game,
                        and I don't blame you.  But it's
                        not something I can give right
                        now.  Maybe when I'm in office...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't want anything from you.

                                        GREG
                        Then stop going through my closet. 
                        I got enough to worry about with
                          Harrison Fisher, I don't have
                        time to worry about you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then don't.

          Greg shakes his head, smiling.  His tone to Johnny is
            sympathetic.

                                        GREG
                        I know you've seen some awful
                        things, Smith.  Wicked, brutal
                        things.  But you ain't seen
                          politics up close, and trust me,
                        you don't want to. 

          Greg gets up, drops some bucks on the table to cover
          Johnny's tab, then pats him on the shoulder --   

          FIRE ROLLS OUT ACROSS THE SCREEN, then we see three quick
          images - A SATELLITE in space, a BLOODY FEMALE HAND on a
          white silk pillow, the BLACK MONOLITH/WASHINGTON MONUMENT
          rushing toward us... and over this we hear a wild, roaring
          scream that sounds like Greg in agony or ecstasy...

          Johnny snaps out of his vision, shaken.  Greg notices.

                                        GREG
                        What'd you see?  Do I win?  Wait, 
                        don't tell me!  Don't tell me.

          Greg backs out, finger to his lips.  He turns and exits. 
          Johnny watches him go.  Then realizes he's been clenching
          his butter knife under the table so tightly that he's
          broken skin... and drawn a thin line of his own blood.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          Johnny, working fast, closes down his laptop and starts
          winding up the power cord.  BRUCE turns from staring at
          the Stillson bulletin board. 

                                        BRUCE
                        I got a bad feeling about this,
                        Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So do I.  I got this real bad
                        feeling about the end of the world. 
                        Do you see a brown leather case...

          Bruce picks it up off a chair.  Johnny takes it, starts
          packing in the laptop. 

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?  You
                        know how I know. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You told me you touched Stillson,
                        and saw Washington D.C. in flames. 
                        But did you see how it got that
                        way?  Was it a nuclear attack? 
                        Did Greg Stillson breathe fire on
                          everyone?  Did you actually see
                        him doing anything?

          Johnny crosses to the board, begins pulling down select
            clippings to pack in his valise.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For the past two months, I've
                        been sitting in this basement,
                        digging into the past, trying to
                        find a connection.  A clue. 
                        Something.

                                        BRUCE
                        And?

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I'm sick of waiting.  I know
                        this guy is linked... no,
                          responsible, for a future atrocity
                        that ends in apocalypse.  I know
                        it.  I feel it.

                                        BRUCE
                        But you didn't see it.  Not
                          exactly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw enough.

          Johnny heads for the door, passing Bruce, who is
          unconvinced and concerned.  Johnny suddenly turns.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you had the chance to go back
                        in time, and kill Hitler, would
                        you do it?

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa.  Slow down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's 1926, he hasn't risen to
                        power yet.  You can still get to
                        him. 
                                (Bruce opens his mouth,
                                  Johnny cuts him off)
                        You're in a room alone with him
                        and you have a gun.  What do you
                        do?

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you buy a gun, John?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't need a gun.  All I need
                        to do is change one detail, and
                        all of life changes.  Today I
                        found that detail, and you know
                        who showed it to me?

                                        BRUCE
                        I know you're not gonna say --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Greg Stillson.

          Johnny walks through the door, heads up the stairs.



          Follow Johnny as he comes out of the basement.  Bruce
          follows.

                        He said, "I have enough to worry
                        about with Harrison Fisher, I
                        don't have time to worry about
                        you."  I don't know why I didn't
                        see it before.

                                        BRUCE
                        See what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I can help Fisher win the
                          election, Stillson's rise to power
                        is shut down.

                        So that's it, huh?  Mr. Smith
                        goes to Washington?

                                (stopping at door)
                        You gotta admit, the one place
                        that could use a psychic is a
                          campaign office.

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't know, man.  Politics...
                        just saying it makes me feel dirty. 
                        You sure this is how you should
                        be using yourself?   

                                        JOHNNY
                                (starts the car)
                        Only thing I've been sure of for
                        a long time.

          He heads out the door. 


  66OMITTED



          HANK CASSISSI, Fisher's charismatic, mercurial campaign
          manager, preaches to the very tired CAMPAIGN STAFFERS
          seated around the conference table.

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                        Okay, we're two days into the
                        debates and let's not beat around
                        the bush:  We're losing.  Greg
                          Stillson will say pretty much
                          anything, and the result is he's 
                        closing the gap in the polls.

          Most of the staffers are terrified of Hank.  A young man
          stands in the back of the room, watching them.  This is
          PHIL ROGERS (25), picture Alex P.  Keaton but more
            conservative.  Phil already knows Hank's routine.  His
          eyes roam out the conference room window into the campaign
          bullpen... then narrow as he spots JOHNNY enter the offices
          and begin chatting up a volunteer.  

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                        We have to change our angle of
                          approach.  This isn't issue vs.
                        issue, it's candidate vs.
                        candidate.  It's experience vs.
                        ignorance.  A decorated past vs.
                        a shady past... 

          ON A HARRISON FISHER POSTER - featuring the confident,
          smiling face of the incumbent.  Pan down to find the real
          man, HARRISON FISHER, whose mouth is closed in thought
          (also on the walls: pictures of Fisher shaking hands with
          George Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.)

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Let's not go there. 

          Everyone turns to face their ultimate boss.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        I've managed to stay in office
                        fifteen years without name-calling. 
                        It'll look like weakness.  The
                        dirtier Stillson plays, the cleaner
                        we play. 

                                        PHIL ROGERS
                          I agree.  Excuse me one moment.

          Phil exits the conference room. 



          Johnny is filling out a form with cheerful SYLVIA when
          Phil walks up.  He addresses Sylvia, eyes on Johnny.

          Phil is curt with him.

                        I know who you are.  I read the

                        only one.

                        Phil Rogers, I'm the campaign's
                        party liaison, and I'm wondering
                        why a local celebrity and known
                          Stillson supporter is lurking
                        around our offices in the middle
                        of the debates.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wouldn't call this lurking, and
                        you shouldn't believe everything
                        they print in the papers.

          Hank and Fisher look over.  Phil, ticked off, calls to a
          suited BODYGUARD, who's reading the paper at his desk.

                                        PHIL ROGERS
                        Rick.

          RICK, the bodyguard, heads over to Johnny.

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                        There a problem, Phil?

                                        PHIL ROGERS
                        Greg Stillson sent over a celebrity
                        spy.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Fisher)
                        That's not true, Sir.

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                                (trying to place Johnny)
                        Channel 9.  You do the weather,
                        right?

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Guys.  Guys.  Let the man speak.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not a spy for Stillson, and I
                        don't do the Weather.
                                (some staffers laugh,
                                  Johnny turns to Fisher)
                        Some people like to call me a
                          psychic, which is a pretty broad
                        term...

          Fisher gives a look to his aides, "Okay,  Get me out."

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've helped out the police in the
                        past, and some other people. 
                        I've never used my abilities for
                          a political cause, but I think
                        this is important.

                        I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, the
                          Congressman's time is very limited,
                        I'm afraid we don't have room for
                          a psychic in our circus. 

          Johnny watches Fisher being swept away into another
          meeting. 



          The meeting hall is substantially sized, but still intimate
          (shaped like a mini-stadium theater).  A couple CUSTODIANS
          are vacuuming the aisles.  Johnny keeps to the side of
          the room as he heads for center stage, where three podiums
          are set up in close proximity. 

          Johnny steps up on the stage.  The podiums have nameplates:
          HANSZ on stage right, FISHER in the center, and STILLSON
          on stage left.  Johnny walks around Stillson's podium. 
          Standing behind it, he reaches out and grips the podium
          with both of his hands...

          We CIRCLE 360 degrees around Johnny - as the camera arcs
          behind his back we see the empty hall is now FULL of
          people, including TV Cameras.  When the camera arcs back
          to its original position facing Johnny, we see he's now
          in a suit, raging.  He is GREG STILLSON, and right now
          he's in the middle of savaging Harrison Fisher. 

                                          JOHNNY/STILLSON
                        ...For the last 15 years all it's
                        been about is tax breaks and
                          campaign kickbacks and woe to any
                        mere mortal who gets in the way!

                        Fact: In August '99, you voted
                        yes on H.R. 232, which awarded
                        300,000 acres of the North Woods
                        to Harper Lumber, the biggest
                        timber company in Maine and your
                        major campaign contributor.  You
                        didn't care that it forced a
                        smaller logging business to go
                        under.  Put a 138 people out of
                        work, but that's just a drop in
                        the bucket, right?

          Harrison Fisher reels at the speed of the tirade.  He
          tries to recall that bill and all its amendments...

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        I'd... have to check on that
                          incident but I'm sure my vote had
                        the best interests of our citizens
                        and workers in mind...

                                          JOHNNY/STILLSON
                        Oh, we're all sure of that, Harry.

          The room APPLAUDS Stillson, cheering David over Goliath.     

          And the room is suddenly quiet as Johnny snaps back to
          reality.  He exhales, lifts his hands off the podium,
          looks at them... and smiles. 

                                        CUSTODIAN
                        Hey!  Whatcha doin' up there?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm getting good at this.

          Johnny walks off the stage. 



          Sylvia is on the phone at her desk.  General campaign
          chaos in the background action.  She's multi-tasking as
          she writes on a message pad. 

                                        SYLVIA

          Johnny, on the phone, getting anxious.

                        gonna try to sandbag him tonight
                        about some logging company and
                        how H.R. 232 shut them down and
                        put people out of work...

          Sylvia scribbles this down, distracted.  She has three
          calls holding.   

                                        SYLVIA

                        Fisher for Congress.

          At home, Johnny slowly hangs up.  Uncertain.



          The debates have already begun.  C-SPAN is covering the
          packed house.  On stage, democratic candidate STEVEN HANSZ
          has the floor, droning in a thick nasal accent.

                                        STEVEN HANZ
                        ...A list of things that folks
                        have told me are important to

                        affordable prescription drugs for
                        the elderly...

          JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Watch from the back of the room, standing.  They whisper
          to each other.  Johnny seems anxious, on edge.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on... come on...

                          I walked up on that stage, touched
                        the podium, and saw what was going
                        to happen.

                                        BRUCE
                        So?  That's what you always do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what you think?  That I'm
                        in control of this thing?  The
                        visions have a life of their own,
                        I work for them.  Except today,
                        up there, they worked for me.
                                (off Bruce's look)
                        What?

                                        BRUCE
                          Nothing.  I guess I never seen
                        you excited about a vision before. 
                        Don't know if that's good or bad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All I know is it feels right. 
                        Like instinct.  Or deja vu.

                                        BRUCE
                                (joking)
                        Or "destiny."

          Johnny thinks about that, then looks across the seated
          audience where he knows he'll see REVEREND PURDY, sitting
          in the Stillson-Supporters section.  We also spot Sonny. 
          They applaud for Greg on stage, who begins speaking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wonder what Purdy will say when
                        he finds out I'm standing against
                        his golden boy. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Forget Purdy, what's that about?

          Johnny doesn't know what he's talking about.  He follows
          Bruce's nod to another person in the Stillson Section...

          Heads turn to Fisher, who weighs his response.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        You're right about one thing,
                        Greg.  Aaron Harper is my primary
                          campaign contributor, and I'm
                          grateful for his support, and
                        proud of our friendship.  I asked
                        him to step in and clean up a
                        mess.  Ajax Logging, that "small
                        business," was clear-cutting the
                        area to shreds.  I allowed Haper
                        to annex the land under the
                          condition they'd employ selective
                          cutting.  They did, and we saved
                        that forest.  Mr. Harper, I believe
                        you're in the audience tonight,
                        would you stand up?  Come on,
                        Aaron.  Get up.

          AARON HARPER stands up.  Harrison leads the crowd in
          APPLAUSE for him.  Stillson is speechless. 

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT ONE - 11/22/02 BLUE            21.



          The debates are over now.  The crowd is breaking up.  The
          Candidates have regrouped to their camps of aides and
          supporters.  


          JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Are still in back, people are shuffling out past them. 
          Moving against the traffic flow is Sylvia, the Fisher
          campaigner.  She's wearing a bright blue "Fisher For
            Congress" campaign shirt.  Johnny smiles at her.  She
          leans over and whispers in his ear.

                                        SYLVIA
                          Congressman Fisher would like you
                        to stop by our post-debate meeting
                        tonight at campaign headquarters. 
                        If you're available.


          STILLSON AND SONNY

          Are in a heated pow-wow in the Stillson section. 

                                        GREG
                        I don't care, Sonny.  We got a
                        leak somewhere, and I when I find
                        it I'm gonna plug it with my bare
                        hands.  I looked like a fool.

                                        SONNY
                        Greg, there is no way he could've
                        seen that question coming.  No
                        way.

          Greg looks around, pissed off.  And then, in the back of
          the room, he spots Johnny Smith.

          Talking to a staffer from the Fisher campaign. 

          Johnny looks over this way, and the two men lock eyes. 

          Stillson then realizes that Johnny was somehow responsible
          for this.  He nods, as if acknowledging a well-made chess
          move.  Johnny makes no move to return the nod, but he
          makes no move to deny his responsibility, either. 

          Holding on both of their looks, we... 

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                        END OF ACT ONE          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT TWO - 11/27/02 GREEN           22.

          FADE IN:


          Greg sits with his shirt off, while LINDA massages his
          back and shoulders.  Sonny Elliman enters. 

                                        GREG
                        What's the fallout?

                                        SONNY
                        Word is the night pretty much
                        went to Fisher.

                                        GREG
                          I looked like an idiot up there. 
                          Unprepared.
                                (to Linda)
                        Harder.

                                        SONNY
                        Your Dad's not happy about you
                        calling Aaron Harper out like
                        that.

                                        GREG
                        Ah, Harper doesn't care. 
                                (over his shoulder)
                        Harder.

                                        SONNY
                        I think you made a bad play with
                        John Smith. 

          Greg suddenly grabs Linda's hand, gripping it tight and
          making her nails dig into his skin.

                                        GREG
                        So I can feel it. 

          She gasps, as he's crushing her hand.  Greg stands,
            releasing Linda who backs away, holding her reddened hand.

                                        LINDA*
                                (pissed off, to Sonny)*
                        He's all yours.*

          Linda stalks out of the room.  Greg opens the mini-bar,*
          pours himself a drink as he laughs to himself.

                                        GREG
                        God damn crippled freak.  I hate
                        freaks, Sonny, I really do.  Like
                        that retarded chick in that movie,
                        I just wanted to strangle her.

                                        GREG (CONT'D)*
                        What was the name of that movie?

                                        SONNY
                        Maybe I should have a talk with
                        him.

          Greg looks at him, and we wonder what "have a talk" might
          mean. 

                                        GREG
                        I don't think that's necessary
                        yet.  Let's give him a little
                        time.

          Sonny's not happy with that.  Greg downs his drink.

          As Johnny and Bruce enter the campaign bullpen.  Fisher
          staffers are applauding Johnny.  It's a bit of a party in
          here.  Punch, cookies, finger foods.

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                        Is this the guy?  This him? 
                        Someone get Fisher out here.
                                (to Johnny)
                        You, my friend, may have punch.

          Hank hands Johnny a paper cup with some punch.  Someone
          else hands Bruce a cup.  Johnny raises his glass to Phil
          Rogers, who sheepishly looks away into his cup. 

          The crowd parts for Harrison Fisher as he approaches
          Johnny.  Holding Fisher's hand is his sleepy GRAND-
            DAUGHTER.  He hands her off to his DAUGHTER, who's on the
          campaign staff.  The room naturally goes quiet for him.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        You could say it's an...
                          unexplained phenomenon that
                          Stillson is gaining on us.  Maybe
                        we can use a psychic around here,
                        after all.

          Everyone laughs.  Fisher extends his hand.  Johnny shakes
          it.  And on their touch we RAMP INTO JOHNNY'S FACE --


  2020FLASH!

          A DARK MASK.  The eyes open, and we realize we're looking
          at Johnny, whose face is covered in camouflage.  He moves
          through the jungle with five heavily armed NAVY SEALS. 
          Keeping silent, pushing some plants aside, we reveal:          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT TWO - 11/27/02 GREEN           26.



          The machine-gun fire bleeds back into applause as Johnny
          comes out of the vision, the color drained from his face. 
          Bruce notices.  So does Fisher.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        You okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Yes.  It's nothing.
                                (forcing a smile)
                        What'd you guys put in this punch,
                        anyway?

          More chuckles all around.  Johnny steps aside.

                                        BRUCE
                                (sotto)
                        You saw something.  What?

          Johnny collects himself, then faces Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                          A chance.  We got a good chance
                        of beating Stillson.   

          Bruce is dubious.  Johnny turns back and spots Fisher,
          looking at him.  

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



            A distraught Johnny sits with Bruce.  He's just finished
          confessing the truth about the vision he got off Fisher.

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn.  I knew you saw something
                        last night, but not Mai Lai.

                                        JOHNNY
                        On a smaller scale, that's what
                        it felt like.  Except for one guy
                        with a gun, who was probably
                        protecting his family, they were
                        all women and children.  I looked
                        up the citation for Fisher's Bronze
                        Star, it says the raid took out
                        20 Viet Cong insurgents, and
                          destroyed a weapons cache.  They
                          reported a lie.

                                        BRUCE
                        And got a medal for it.

          They shut up as a WAITRESS stops by to refill coffee. 
          Bruce speaks quietly after she leaves.

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you see anything else?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This morning, I was talking to
                        Sarah, at her place, and I saw
                        the little boy from the village.

                                        BRUCE
                                (confused)
                        Saw him where?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just standing there, next to her. 
                        Looking right at me.

                                        BRUCE
                        You were having a vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But I wasn't touching anything.
                                (off Bruce's stare)
                        And when I saw him, I felt a...
                        pain in my chest.  A tightening.

                        I'd be feeling something, too.  I
                        mean, do you realize how huge
                        this is?  You're sitting on top
                        of a major scandal.  We gotta
                          corroborate this.  Get witnesses
                        who were there...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        BRUCE
                        No?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Harrison Fisher is a decorated
                        war hero.  If the truth gets out,
                        it's like you said.  A major
                          scandal.  Big enough to kill any
                        chance for re-election.  And then
                          Stillson has a clear path to power.

                                        BRUCE
                        You are talking about covering up
                        for a guy who lied about murdering
                          innocent people.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think Fisher's a good guy who
                        got caught in a bad situation. 
                        He wasn't in command...

                                        BRUCE
                        So you're just gonna let him off
                        the hook?  Are you allowed to do
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean, "Am I allowed?"

                                        BRUCE
                        I mean, can you just ignore one
                        of your visions?  I thought you
                        "worked for them." 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not when they work against each
                        other.  If I'm going to change
                        the future, I have to let the
                        past stay where it is.

          But as he says this, Johnny looks past Bruce to a booth
          where a YOUNG COUPLE sits.  UNDER THE TABLE, the small
          Vietnamese Boy huddles with his arms around his knees,
          peering at Johnny.

          The couple laughs as the girl feeds the guy a french fry. 
          Johnny breathes in, and out, and closes his eyes.  But
          when he opens them, the boy is still under the table. 
          Staring.

          sits at the head of the table, Phil Rogers sits on the
          other side.  Hank Cassissi is pacing, energetic.  During
          the following, Fisher's eyes never leave Johnny, and Johnny
          makes an effort not to make eye contact with Fisher.

                                        HANK CASSISSI
                        I gotta tell you, I see no limit
                        to where we can take this.  See
                        the future, see the past, we can
                        fire our whole polling team, who
                        needs 'em?  This is the epitome
                        of out-of-the-box thinking.   
                                (turning to Fisher)
                        I got it.  Reception for the
                          Daughters of the American
                          Revolution.  At the Governor's
                          mansion.  All the candidates'll
                        be there.

                        No.  No way.  We can't let it get
                        out that Harrison Fisher is
                        consulting a psychic.  We'll be
                        laughed out of office. 
                                (to Fisher)
                        Sir, please. 

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Would you guys mind stepping out
                        for a second, I'd like a word
                        with John. 

          Phil and Hank exchange looks.  They nod and exit.  The
          door closes.  Johnny and Fisher are alone in the room. 
          Johnny is forced to look at Fisher.  Silent, tense beat.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Got your wallet on you, John?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, yeah.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Slide it over.
                                (off Johnny's confusion)
                        I can tell everything about a man
                        by looking at his wallet.

          Johnny hesitates, then takes out his wallet, and slides
          it across the table to Fisher, who stops it.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Mm.  Less than a year old.  Looks
                        like department store leather,
                        I'm guessing you didn't buy this
                          yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was a gift.

                                        HARRISON FISHER

          Fisher nods, opens it up.  Smiles.

                                        HARRISON FISHER

                        facing the same way.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can see that.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Business cards are the jackpot?

          Fisher goes through the cards, which reflect the various
          people Johnny has helped throughout the series so far.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Each one's a story.  We got
                          sheriff, doctors, C.E.O.'s, website
                        designers, bartenders, chemists...  
                                (beat)
                        You know what this wallet says? 
                        It says here's a man whose life
                        is stripped down, unstructured,
                        and very, very complicated. 
                        Because your life is more focused
                        on others than it is on yourself. 
                                (puts wallet on table)
                        In that way, you and I are a lot
                        alike.

          He slides the wallet back to Johnny, who catches it:

          MUZZLE FLASHES AND DEAFENING SOUND. 

          Johnny controls his reaction.  Fisher stands, walks over.

                        don't tell me everything, they
                        just kind of lead me where I'm

                        Well, you could definitely be of
                        use here.  Though I agree with
                        Phil, about keeping a low profile. 
                        You should come to the reception
                          tonight, but come alone, and we
                          probably should keep interaction
                        between us to a minimum.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think that's best. 

          Sylvia knocks, then pops her head in the door.

          No hand shake this time.  Fisher exits with Sylvia.  Johnny
          exhales, releasing tension.  He looks at the wall of
            pictures.  At one in particular; Fisher in Navy Uniform,
          with the Bronze Star.  

          Through the conference room windows, we see Fisher in the
          middle of the bullpen, looking back at Johnny, looking at
          that picture.          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT THREE - 11/22/02 BLUE          37.

          accurate 18th century dresses.  ROVING SERVERS and
          BARTENDERS serve traditional food from the period (most
          of which remains on the trays).

          POV FROM ACROSS THE ROOM - JOHNNY AND HANK CASSISSI

          The man watching is Sonny Elliman, and he doesn't like
          what he sees. 

          We FOLLOW Sonny as he moves through the party guests.  He
          manages to give a polite nod to Sarah, who looks stunning
          in a formal dress.  We STAY with Sarah and Walt, who is
          tugging at his bowtie.  He looks good in his tux, but
          doesn't feel good in it. 

                                        SARAH
                                (re: Sonny)
                        That guy creeps me out.

                          Everyone here creeps me out.

                                        SARAH
                                (fixing Walt's bowtie)
                        Hey, this is supposed to be the
                          glamorous part of politics. 

                                        WALT
                        I think glamour looks better on
                        you than on me.

                                        SARAH
                        I think you look very debonair.

                                        WALT
                              (a la James Bond)
                        Bannerman.  Walt Bannerman.

          As Sarah laughs, Walt spots someone over her shoulder.

                                        WALT
                        What's he doing here?

          Like Johnny in the debate scene, Sarah doesn't know who
          he's talking about.  She follows Walt's look to see JOHNNY
          across the room.           DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT THREE - 11/22/02 BLUE          39.



          Sonny walks down the carpeted hallway up to a door that a
            BODYGUARD is standing in front of.

                                        SONNY
                        He in there?

          The Bodyguard nods and steps aside.



          Sonny walks in, we hear the sounds of rough sex. 

          Greg is in the handicapped stall with a beautiful Daughter
          of the American Revolution, in full 18th century garb. 
          He's having her up against the door, which is shaking. 

          Sonny turns on the sink faucet, turns it off.  Greg stops.

                                        GREG
                        Three minutes.

                                        SONNY
                        Smith is here.

          Greg reacts with mild surprise, grins at the Girl. 

                                        GREG
                        Why don't we hold this thought.

          He lets her down and exits the stall, crosses to the sink
          and begins to wash his hands.  Sonny waits a moment, then
          exits, starting the air dryer for Greg on his way out. 
          Greg checks himself in the mirror.



          We find Johnny off by himself, sipping his wine, taking
          in the crowd.  He sees SARAH, and then pretends not to
          have.  He turns away... straight into Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Hello, Johnny.  Didn't expect to
                        see you here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me neither.  Nice tux.

                                        PURDY

                        Is this because of something I've

                        You had no problem turning your
                        back on him. 

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, talk to me.  I need to
                        understand your reasons.

          Greg walks up, right in the middle of the conversation.

                                        GREG
                        Hello, Boys. 

          It's an awkward moment for everyone but Greg, who appears
          to graze on nervous energy.

                                        GREG
                        Have you tried those stuffed
                        chicken things?  Blechh. 
                          Cornbread's okay, though.

          Behind them, THE BAND starts up an appropriate slow dance
          song.  LINDA approaches as if cued, taps Purdy's shoulder.

                                        LINDA
                          Reverend, may I have the honor of
                        this dance?

                                        PURDY
                        Oh, I...

                                        GREG
                        Go for it, Reverend.
                                (whispers in his ear,
                                re: Johnny)
                        He wants to talk to me.

          Purdy looks at Greg, feeling like he's on the outside of
            something important - a place he hates to be.  But Greg's
          honest look is enough to hold Purdy's trust.  For now. 
          Linda takes his hand and leads him to the dance floor.

          Greg and Johnny stand alone, face to face in tuxedos.

                                        GREG
                        Thought you'd like to chat just
                        the two of us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not really.

                        I gotta say, Smith, I'm
                          disappointed with your performance
                        so far.  Haven't been living up
                        to the hype.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have my deepest apologies.

                                        GREG
                        Hey, listen, I know that sending
                        you over to Fisher was a gamble,
                        but in my experience, risk provides
                        the greatest payoff. 

          Johnny goes from smug to confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did you say?

                                        GREG
                        That trick at the debates was
                        good, I don't know how you did
                        that.  I figured you'd be of some
                        use to Fisher but I was betting
                        that by now you would've blown
                        his secret wide open.  I mean,
                          whatever he did's gotta be ten
                        times worse than anything I did.

          Johnny's world is reeling.  He looks over and spots the
          VIETNAMESE BOY again.  Ignores him.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

                                        GREG
                        Come on, Johnny.  There's no one
                        else here.  I'm being honest with
                        you.  I know Fisher's hiding
                          something but I don't know what. 
                        I found out a year ago when we
                        tracked down an old 'Nam buddy of
                        his, name of John Mulvert.  Used
                        to be a Navy SEAL, but by the
                        time we found him he was a useless
                        drunk.  

          MEMORY FLASH - Johnny/Fisher grabbing MULVERT.

                        We got all excited 'cause Mulvert
                        was ready to spill his guts about
                          something he wanted to get off
                        his chest.  But before we got the
                        fat lush to talk he blew his brains
                        out with a 45. 


          ON SARAH AND WALT

          In a slow dance.  Sarah is looking past Walt, across the
          dance floor to Johnny and Stillson talking.  She can't
          take her eyes off them - what the hell is going on? 


          STILLSON AND JOHNNY

          Johnny, not feeling well, starts to walk away.  Greg
          casually keeps up with him.

                                        GREG
                        Now this was a damn shame, but it
                          convinced me that there was an
                        awful truth to be found.  And I
                        knew if I sweet-talked you right,
                        you'd go see Fisher.  And if you'd
                        go see Fisher, you'd see the awful
                        truth.  'Cause that's what you
                        do.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (stops to face him)
                        Sorry to break it to you, but
                          Fisher's got nothing to hide. 
                        And now, thanks to you, he's got
                        nothing to worry about.  I'm gonna
                        make sure he wins this.

          Greg shakes his head, that didn't faze him at all.

                                        GREG
                        I think I can tell when people
                        having something to hide.  I don't
                        have second sight, but my first
                        sight's pretty solid.  Hell, I
                        could see within five minutes
                        that Sarah Bannerman spread for
                        you not too long ago...

          Sounds of the room become echoes. 


          JOHNNY'S POV - WINE GLASS

          His glass of white wine becomes stained with red, spreading
          from within like blood through the River Nile.

          Johnny then sees the BOY standing five feet away, staring
          at him just as he did in the hut.


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          Suddenly an arm in camouflage fatigue wraps around Johnny's
          neck, and a knife in the other hand cuts Johnny's throat
          (we don't see the face of his attacker).  Johnny's hands
          go to his throat, and blood pours out between them.  He
          drops his glass and drops to his knees, bleeding.   

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hoarse)
                        We gotta get outta here!

          Guests look over.  The shattered glass has spilled white
          wine, and Johnny is fine.  Johnny takes his hands from
          his throat.  They're clean.  Greg reaches down.

                                        GREG
                        You okay?

          Johnny recoils from Stillson's hand.  He turns around...
          and there's Harrison Fisher.  Ten feet away.  He clearly
          saw and heard everything.  Johnny then hurries for the
          exit, passing Stillson.  Many eyes following him.  Walt
          and Sarah move to help him, but they're too far away. 

          Johnny runs out the front door...



          Johnny falls to the floor, right next to a desk.  Standing
          over him is Sonny Elliman, but he's not looking at Johnny. 
          Greg Stillson also towers above.  Both men are facing
          AARON HARPER.  Greg hands Aaron a drink.    

                                        GREG
                        I'm sorry I called you out like
                        that at the debate.  I meant no
                          disrespect. 

                                        AARON HARPER
                        Greg, one of my sayings is, "I
                        know which way the tree is gonna
                        fall."  And I think it's pretty
                        clear Fisher's gonna be under it. 
                        But I think you got a damn good
                        chance at this office, and I don't
                        mind helping out with a little
                        boost to help you get there.

                                        GREG
                          A little boost?

                        you want in public. 

          Greg remains poker-faced.  He shakes his head, scolding. 

                                        GREG
                        Aaron, you know one of the main
                          platforms I run on is campaign

                        So we better keep this between
                        you and me. 

          They smile and toast with their glasses...



          A dark figure sits alone in the dark room.  Closer, we
          can make out the features of Harrison Fisher, still in
          tuxedo.  He's staring across the table, at the American
          flag hanging from a pole in the corner.  In this light it
          looks like a dark, drooping curtain. 

          Fisher reaches into his pocket, and pulls out his wallet. 
          He opens it.  Looks at a family photo.  Wife, two
          daughters.  Fisher's eyes move to the right, distracted
          by something through the conference room windows.  In the
          lighted bullpen, he can see Johnny Smith enter.  Johnny
          chats with a VOLUNTEER STAFFER (a skeleton crew is working
          late into the night), who points him toward Fisher's back
          office.  Johnny approaches.

          Johnny walks into the dark room, is excited to see Fisher.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Have you.

                        I know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know?

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                          I know... that you know, John.

          Johnny stares into Fisher's eyes, and then looks down to
          see what's sitting on the table in front of him.  His
          wallet.  

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        The operation's code-name was
                        Hondo.  Captain Aulbach named all
                        our operations after old Westerns. 
                          Objective was to take down a Viet*
                        Cong outfit that was supposed to*
                        be storing weapons along the Mekong
                        River.  Turns out there were no*
                          weapons, no soldiers.  But you*
                        already knew that. 

          Johnny nods. 

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        I saw the look in your eyes the
                        first time we shook hands.  You
                        looked sick, drained, tired.  I
                        recognized that look but I didn't
                        know where from.  Then, it came
                        to me.
                                (beat)
                        It's the look I see in the mirror
                        every morning.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw what happened.  It wasn't
                        your fault.  Mulvert opened fire...

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Mulvert opened fire, he couldn't*
                        see it was a C-Rat can, it was*
                        dark... excuses like that are*
                        what's kept me going.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe if you told the Navy that,
                        they would've understood.

                        But instead we told 'em a lie. 
                        And so that's what all those little
                        excuses became.  And every time I
                        try to remember them, all I can 
                        see is this... one face.

                          A little boy.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        You're the first person I've ever
                        talked about this with outside
                        the unit.  Even my wife still
                        thinks I deserve that Bronze Star. 
                        I lived the lie for so long I
                        feel like it's a part of me. 
                        Like an extra arm that no one
                        else can see, but I can feel. 
                        And I'm tired of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's talk about this.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        I know you want to keep it a
                        secret.  If not you'd have gone
                        to the press already.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If this gets to the press, the
                        campaign's over.  Your political
                        career is over.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        Casualties of war.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The casualties we'll suffer if
                        Greg Stillson wins this election
                        are a hundred times worse.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        How do you-

                                        JOHNNY
                        Trust me.  I know what your hell
                        looks like, and I'm willing to
                        stay there for as long as it takes
                        to bring Stillson down.
                                (beat)
                        It's going to take courage, from
                        both us, to see that through.

          Fisher looks at Johnny, moved by his conviction.          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT FOUR - 11/27/02 GREEN         50A.



          The final night of the debates.  Stillson has the floor,
          and he's back on his game.

                        The truth is, Harrison Fisher has
                        lost sight of what's truly
                        important, and that's the people.

                                        GREG (CONT'D)
                        Big Business is all it's about
                        and all it's ever been about for
                        the last 15 years.  We need to
                          introduce policy that's going to
                        protect Maine's most endangered
                          species:  the middle class.

          Applause from the audience.  Johnny leans forward,
            anticipating the response.  Fisher leans into his
          microphone.  For a while he doesn't say anything.  Johnny
          tenses.  Fisher looks at Greg.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        You claim to stand against corrupt
                          corporate influence, against
                        serving special interests.

                                        GREG
                          Business has no business in
                          government.  They don't control
                        us, and we don't control them.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        So you would never accept campaign
                        support from one of our state's
                        largest corporations for a sum
                        like...  ten million dollars?

          Greg hesitates.  Where is he going with this?

                                        GREG
                        My contributions cap is twenty
                        five hundred, so that's a little
                        rich for my blood, I'm sorry.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        How about six million?

                                        GREG
                                  (hesitates, then)
                        Can I bid one dollar, Bob?

          The audience laughs, but Fisher keeps going.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        So you would say in good faith
                        that you would never accept a
                          campaign contribution of six
                        million dollars from a big company
                        like Culp & Belling, or ProTEK,
                        or Harper Lumber...

          Stillson's eyes sweep the audience... and settle on Johnny,
          who raises his eyebrows.  What's your answer, Greg?

          Greg, a dead gleam in his eyes, leans into his microphone.

                        Absolutely not.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        I'll be holding you to that, and
                        the people will be holding you to
                        that.  I'll be watching you, Sir. 
                        I will be watching you from the
                        sidelines, and as you may discover,

                        Teddy, I'd like to announce that
                        I'm withdrawing from the
                          Congressional race tonight.

            A SHOCKED BUZZ goes through the crowd.  Johnny closes his
          eyes.  Harrison Fisher speaks and silence follows quickly.

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        My decision to withdraw is not
                        based on a change in my commitment
                        or dedication to the office. 
                        Instead it is deeply personal,
                          painful, and something I need to
                        tell you all, because you deserve
                        to know.    

          Audience members look around; what's going on?

                                        HARRISON FISHER
                        For the last 32 years, I've been
                        living a lie.  The Bronze Star I
                        earned in Vietnam was not awarded
                          appropriately.  The true story of
                        what happened then has been sent
                        by myself to the media, you'll
                        all get a chance to read about it
                          tomorrow morning.  Tonight, I
                        only wish to say that I am sorry,
                        for deceiving you so long as to
                        who I am.  Because my past is a
                        part of me.

                        And I've found to deny who you
                        are is more painful than to
                          confront what you hate about

                        Guilt drove me to silence, and
                        guilt forced me to the truth.  It
                        is something we should embrace. 
                        It is the only weapon our morality
                        has to wield against us when we
                        forget ourselves.

          We hear the "Jingle" of the door bell.  Johnny doesn't

          Greg slides in across from him.  This time it's he who
          has the paper, and he puts it in front of Johnny.  Fisher

                        I just want to thank you, for
                        doing what I consider to be the

          Johnny doesn't answer.

                                        GREG
                          Although when he said that crap
                        about Harper Lumber I wanted to
                        rip your throat out.  How'd you
                        find out about that?  Did you
                        touch Harper at the party? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can thank your lap dog, Sonny.
                                (points to his shiner)
                        All it takes is one touch.

                                        GREG
                                (shakes his head)
                        Sonny.  That boy's heart's in the
                        right place.

                                        GREG (CONT'D)
                        He's just gotta learn a little
                          finesse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Pretty forgiving for someone who
                        cost you six million dollars. 
                        There's no way you could hide
                        that money now. 

                                        GREG
                        That is true and that does hurt,
                        but I choose to look at it this
                        way... it's a small price to pay
                        for the house seat.  So I think
                        it evened out in the end, wouldn't
                        you agree?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What makes you think this is the
                        end?

          Stillson slaps the table, grinning.

                                        GREG
                        I like you, Johnny.  I can see
                        why Purdy's so high on you now. 
                        You see the truth, simple as that.

          Greg suddenly gets very serious, his voice slipping into
          his near-confessional tone.

                                        GREG (CONT'D)
                        I see the truth, too.  Inside
                        myself.  And I know I'm right.

          Greg whispers, this is just between them.

                                        GREG (CONT'D)
                        It's a powerful feeling, isn't
                        it?  To know you're right?  Lots
                        of people think it, but you and
                        I... we know it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want?

                                        GREG
                                (leaning back)
                        If we go toe to toe, I know how
                        that ends.  And I don't find it
                        that interesting.  But, if we go
                        side by side, join forces, I have
                        no idea where that goes, but I
                        gotta admit... it makes me curious.

                                (beat)
                        What are you thinking?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think you'll find it that  
                          interesting. 

          Greg gets it.  He stands up.

                                        GREG
                        Keep the paper.

          Johnny watches him as he walks out.  He looks down at the
          headline of the newspaper:  "THE AWFUL TRUTH."

                                                                              FADE OUT:
