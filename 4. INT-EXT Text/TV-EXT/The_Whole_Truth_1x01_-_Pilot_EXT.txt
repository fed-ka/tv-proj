                Sweet hoop dreams, the Knicks  *
                pulled it out! *

                I m looking into his alibi.  If he  *

                to toss the jurors another suspect. *

                of time with him at this point, and  *
                there s something about his manner -  *
                probably from his years in front of  *
                  a classroom - that might not seem  *
                entirely authentic. *

                without you - but I need Lena as my  *

                the aisle, the victim is female - 
                we need the female jurors. *
