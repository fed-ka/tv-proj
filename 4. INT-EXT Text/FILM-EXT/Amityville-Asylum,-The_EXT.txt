We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on
the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night
blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning
hours.

Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and
neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch
Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,
two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on
the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the
top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at
us.
A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament
to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.

cleanly in half.
