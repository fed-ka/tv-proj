                                              TEASER

          PRODUCER'S NOTE: Lest there be any misunderstanding, this*
          is not a forties period piece or a take-off of a film*
          noir; it is to be performed and produced in a forthright,*
            contemporary fashion.*

          FADE IN:

  11CLOSE ON A RUGGED COP FACE

          We'll call him EDGAR LANCTE.  Plain-clothed, 50ish.  Jerry
          Orbach type, a little better dressed than your average
          street cop.  Works for the State C-I-D.  He's looking
          straight at CAMERA.

                                        LANCTE
                        I gotta tell ya.  I've been doing
                        this a long time.  And I think I
                        know when someone is lying.  And
                        you're lying.

          He stares at --


  22JOHNNY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF AN INTERROGATION TABLE

                                        LANCTE
                              (a beat)
                        You're lying, Mr. Smith.

          Our Johnny, lying?   How can that be?


          VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM

          Walt watches, frustrated, as Johnny stonewalls.  Lancte
          sees he's getting nowhere, rises to exit... comes out and
          looks at him, shakes his head.

                                        LANCTE
                        There's something going on there. 
                        You ask me - it's the girl.

                                        WALT
                          I dunno.

                                        LANCTE
                        It's always a girl.  Cherchez la
                        femme.

                                        WALT
                        What's that?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/13/03 BLUE  2.

                                        LANCTE
                        French.  Look for the woman.

                                        WALT
                          I didn't know you speak French.

                                        LANCTE
                          I don't.

          Lancte walks away.

                                        LANCTE
                        He's all yours, Sheriff.  I have
                        bigger fish to fry.

          Walt studies Johnny a beat.


  33INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

          as Walt enters.  Johnny looks up.  Walt is frustrated
          with Johnny, and is tough on him here even though he never
          forgets they're friends, maybe even overcompensating for
          that friendship.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you talked to the hospital?

                                        WALT
                                (re: the girl who is
                                in the hospital)
                        Is this about the girl?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I only asked if...

                                        WALT
                        Is that why you're blocking a
                        major C-I-D investigation?  Because
                        you've got some soft spot for the
                        girl? 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I met her once, Walt.  I barely
                        know her.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah except when John Smith barely
                        knows a girl, he knows her past,
                          present, future.  None of it being
                        very pretty in this case.

          Johnny stares at Walt, stonewalls... 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/13/03 BLUE  3.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        JOHNNY
                                (low-key)
                        You gonna charge me with something,
                        Walt?  Charge me.  Otherwise, let
                        me go, cause I've got nothing
                        else to say... 

                                        WALT
                                (quietly serious,
                                  stares at him)
                        You're not going anywhere.  You're
                        into this up to your neck, John. 
                        And don't think I won't cut it
                        off if I have to.

          Damn, what the hell is going on here?  Walt threatening
          Johnny?  Johnny doesn't back down an inch either.

                                        WALT
                                (beat, calmer)
                        We're gonna go through it all
                        again.  From the top... starting
                        with the murder.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat, evenly)
                        I told you -- it wasn't murder,
                        it was self defense.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  Yeah.  I have the crime
                        scene reports: Small time hood
                        named Mickey Doyle walks into the
                        store with a gun and Cathan
                        Donnegal's wiseguys shoot and
                        kill him.

          Slow push to Johnny as his tired mind tries to wrap itself
          again around the reality of what happened...

                                        JOHNNY
                        They shot him. 
                                (beat)
                        But I'm the one who killed Mickey
                        Doyle.  

          The slow push continues for another beat before we begin
            a flashback... and we need a hard (as opposed to soft
            dissolve) non-vision transition into it...          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/14/03 PINK  4.


  44INT. ENSUITE BATH & KITCHEN SHOWROOM -- DAY - CLOSE ON
          JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        A man is going to come in here
                        with a gun.

          REVERSE ANGLE to see the reaction of CATHAN DONNEGAL, 40,
          doesn't look terribly out of place in a plumbing fixture
          shop (and a rather tony shop it is too, these are designer
          models)... he's a few years past an athletic build but
          not much, a very Irish face, not handsome but arresting,
          eyes you remember after seeing them once.  He's cordial
          if not friendly.  He's just sold Johnny new bathroom
          fixtures among other items.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It started like they all start.  
                        He was in danger.  I saw it.  I
                        warned him.  It's what I do.

          FAST REVERSE ACTION

          to about twenty seconds earlier...

                                        DONNEGAL
                          I definitely recommend the extended
                          warranty.  Covers everything. 
                        Full replacement, no questions
                        asked.

          He hands the warranty paperwork to Johnny.  As Johnny
          takes the paper to look at the policy -- he HEARS TWO
          POPS... and...


  55DONNEGAL

          suddenly has holes in his chest... and blood running out...
          he falls to the floor dead... and Johnny turns to see a
          small time hood named MICKEY DOYLE, 39, short,
            unattractive, the kind of role Elisha Cook Jr. would play
          in a forties movie... he's holding the gun...


66THE VISION ENDS - RESUME JOHNNY

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Cash or credit?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (urgent)
                        Listen to me.  A man is going to
                        come in here with a gun.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/14/03 PINK  5.


    6CONTINUED:6

          REVERSE ANGLE to see the reaction of Donnegal as before. 
          A long shocked beat then...

                                        DONNEGAL
                        I'm sorry...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He might be a robber, I'm not
                        sure.  About five foot nine,
                          balding, deep set blue eyes,
                          goatee... he'll be wearing a black
                        fedora.

          Donnegal glances at a couple of other workers who move
          slowly over to observe the exchange...  FITZ -- hollow
          cheeks, suspicious eyes -- and MANNY, heavy set - both
          could be installation guys who work with their hands.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (measured)
                        Who are you?  Why would you be
                        telling me this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is Smith, John Smith.  I
                        have psychic abilities.

          Donnegal eyes Johnny as though for the first time.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Psychic... abilities...

                                        FITZ
                                  (recognizing him)
                        You're the... 
                                (then to Donnegal)
                        ...I read about him in The Star...  
                        He predicted the whole JLo-Ben
                        Affleck thing. 

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (eyes never leaving
                                  Johnny)
                        Shut up.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it's hard to believe but...
                        this man, he could very well shoot
                        you... you really need to call
                        the police...

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Yes, I'll be sure to do that.

                        He threw in the extended warranty
                        for free.  Said 'have a nice day'. 
                        And said the new fixtures would
                        be delivered in a week.  And Mr.
                          Donnegal is a man of his word.  


  77INT. SMITH HOUSE -- BASEMENT -- DAY

          Johnny working in his Stillson pit... watching a video of
          a Stillson campaign appearance...

                                        REPORTER (V.O.)
                          ...appearing at a fund raiser in
                          Penobscot County, Stillson took a
                        moment to call for the defeat
                        Prop 151, the Indian casino
                          initiative.  

          During the above, Johnny's eyes narrow as he sees Sarah
          moving with the Stillson entourage...

                                (to an O.S. reporter)
                        The people of this county ought
                        to take a hard look at this
                        measure... and listen to Sheriff
                          Bannerman on the subject... I
                        know I do and not only because
                        his wife is a member of my staff...
                                (reporters laugh)
                        Seriously, this is about the
                        quality of life in Maine... and
                        as Maine goes so goes the nation. 
                        I have the greatest respect for
                        the Native American people but
                        facts are facts: every township
                        that has invited gambling into
                        its midst has also invited crime
                        and moral decay.

                        This measure rolls the dice on
                        the lives of our children, and
                        frankly I don't like the odds, I
                        don't like the stakes, and I don't
                        like Prop. 151.

          During the above, the doorbell rings and Johnny moves
          upstairs without turning off the computer.  We stay on
          the screen to hear the last of Stillson's statement.


  88INT. UPSTAIRS - DAY

          Johnny moves to the security system... looks out to see
          the security cam looking at Fitz and Manny from the fixture
          store in a van with the "Ensuite Bath & Kitchen" logo on
          the side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes?

                                        FITZ
                        We have your fixtures for you,
                        Mr. Smith.

          Johnny buzzes them in.


  99INT. FOYER - SECONDS LATER

          As Johnny opens the door, Fitz grabs him hard... and Manny
          checks him over for a wire...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey... what...

                        Please excuse the inconvenience.

                                        MANNY
                        He's clean.

                                        FITZ
                        I need you to come outside with
                        us, Mr, Smith.  You got a jacket?  
                        You'll need a jacket.  It's chilly
                        out.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/13/03 BLUE  8.

          MINUTES LATER

          As Manny opens it to reveal a long bag zippered down the
          middle.  Manny UNZIPS the bag and folds back the flaps,
            revealing the corpse of MICKEY DOYLE -- the shooter from
          Johnny's vision.

                                        FITZ
                        This the guy you saw?

          Johnny stares stunned at the body and let's face it, people
          like Johnny and you and I don't come face to face with
          dead bodies very often and we should play it that way. 
          He nods 'yes.'

                                        FITZ
                        Name's Mickey Doyle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... happened?

                                        FITZ
                        Exactly what you said was gonna
                        happen.  Up to a point.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This... this was not what I
                          expected...

                                        MANNY
                                (not at all a joke)
                        Yeah.  It's not what Mickey
                          expected either.

                                        FITZ
                        But your description fit him to a
                        'T'.  So when he came in, we were
                          ready...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (stomach churning)
                        You killed him because I...

                        You don't have to worry; we kept
                        your name out of it with the cops
                        so far.

                        As a token of his appreciation,
                        Mr. Donnegal is gonna tear up the
                        bill for the fixtures.  But he
                        does have one more favor to ask
                        of you...

          The Ensuite van still in the driveway.  Johnny, Fitz and
          Manny as before.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        By now, I was beginning to realize
                        that Ensuite Bath and Kitchen
                        wasn't your usual plumbing
                          supplier.  Tell me why the Maine
                        mob would advertise in the yellow
                        pages, I don't know but they do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I... I can't be any more
                          involved in this...

                                        FITZ
                        Mr. Smith, John, my reputation is
                        sort of on the line here... truth
                        is Mr. Donnegal doesn't know what
                        to make of you but I'm a new age
                        kind of guy... I personally put
                        in a good word for you... 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dubious)
                        Thanks.  But, seriously, I can't...

                                        FITZ
                                  (interrupting, low
                                key)
                        I'd consider it a personal favor
                        if you'd give us your cooperation
                        in this matter.  

          Fitz puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder... as he does --

                          I really can't take no for an
                        answer.  
                                (to Manny)
                        Give the man room to work.

          Manny steps aside.  Johnny has no choice, slowly approaches
          the corpse of Mickey Doyle...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        I don't like touching dead bodies. 
                        Call it a peculiarity of mine. 
                        Usually it takes me somewhere I
                        don't want to go.   

          This is hard for Johnny -- he touches the corpse on the
          cheek... as he does, RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE...


  1414VISION - MATCHING FACE

          as a girl's long, slender, bejeweled fingers caress his
          cheeks and pull Johnny who is now Mickey (dressed in the
          same clothes as the day of the shooting) toward a kiss. 

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Not this time.

          And as we see her for the first time, we might even be in
          SLOW MOTION as her face moves closer to Johnny/Mickey's,
          and her big velvet eyes flutter closed.  In her late
            twenties, she is lit with a glamorous light -- the way an
          old-time movie star might be lit, Lana Turner or Lauren
          Bacall -- and she plants on Johnny/Mickey's lips a kiss
          that neither man will ever forget.  And then she looks at
          him, with eyes that are at once vulnerable and wise, too
          wise, maybe, for her own good.

          And he can still taste her.  Fitz and Manny can see
            something has happened.

                        What'd you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was kissing a girl.  

          The two men wait for more... there is none...

                        At least Mickey got lucky before
                        he passed.

                                        FITZ
                        Touch him again.

                        It doesn't work that way.

          Fitz takes Johnny by the hair and shoves him closer to
          the corpse.  Losing his temper for the first time and
          it's scary.

                                        FITZ
                        Put your heart in it.

          Johnny touches Mickey again.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.    

          Fitz stares at Johnny... extremely displeased... controlled
          fury, murder in his eyes...

                        I... need more... his personal

                        up before the service this
                        afternoon.  The coroner really
                        left him in a mess.

  1616INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Fitz leads Johnny inside a depressingly spare railroad
          flat: couch, TV set, bookshelf.

                                        FITZ
                        It's not much, but Mickey called
                        it home.

          He looks at Johnny to do something... Johnny reacts, goes
          to work, wanders about picking up things, waiting for a
            vision...

                                        FITZ
                        Maybe the phone.  Who was the
                        last person he talked to?

          Johnny takes the cue and moves to the phone... as he does -
          RAMP TO HIS FACE...

          on the phone...

                                        JOHNNY/MICKEY
                        No, really, I'm fine, Ma... no, I
                        don't feel like goin' out
                        tonight... just gonna watch
                          something on TV... they're doing
                        the Knights of the Round Table on
                        the Discovery Channel.  Yeah.

                        I will.  I promise.  I love you
                        too.

          As he hangs up, we might feel this lonely, single man
          kind of existence Mickey was living...... the vision
          ends...

          Johnny finds one of those disposable cameras that you can
          buy at any convenience store... as he touches it...

          at the shore... and these shots should feel like a roll

          heel shoes, wearing a spring dress that blows in the ocean
          breeze revealing her legs, a scarf around her hair...
          she's wearing sunglasses here and she's not smiling...
          she's almost melancholy... and she's absolutely
            breathtaking.  Although the shots are all wide, Johnny's
          vision takes him into close-ups but they are blurry as
          they might be in a close-up of a cheap photo...  still
          the blur can't disguise that this is an unforgettable
          woman.  The sequence barely lasts fifteen seconds, if
          that long... but adds to the mystery of the woman.

                          exploring several potential
                          business opportunities that may
                        occur if the initiative passes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's possible they're related.  I
                        don't have enough information
                        yet.

          But Fitz can't hide the fact that he's pleased.

                                        FITZ
                        But it's a start, John.  It's a
                        start.

          And they exit.          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT ONE - 1/13/03 BLUE  18.


  2323EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - ESTABLISHING

          People arriving in black limousines for the service.


  2424AT THE GRAVESITE

          Mickey's corpse lies in a closed casket by a freshly dug
          grave.  Fitz is greeting some other old friends.  Johnny
          is under-dressed for the occasion.  Many of the attendees
          look at him with a curious, even suspicious eye -- among
          one group is Manny... who can be overheard confirming
          that --

                                        MANNY
                        Yeah, that's the guy... the guy
                        who told Mr. Donnegal that Mickey
                        was coming for him...

          Johnny feels eyes staring at him... is as uncomfortable
          as he has ever been.


          POV - PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF CARS MOVING ACROSS THE CEMETERY

          And getting out of one stretch limo with Cathan Donnegal
          is the same beautiful woman Johnny's been seeing.  She's
          alone, not crying or close to it, wearing dark sunglasses,
          dressed in black, like most everyone else but Johnny...
          except this is a woman born to wear black... anything
          black... and even in this setting, a man's eyes are
            irresistibly drawn to her...

          As Fitz notices Johnny looking...

                                        FITZ
                          Expensive proposition, John. 
                        Don't get your heart set on
                          anything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's her.  The girl he was
                          kissing. 

                                        FITZ
                        Nina and Mickey?  Not possible. 
                        There was a certain separation of
                        the classes involved, you know
                        like on the Titanic.

          But as Johnny looks at Fitz, Fitz sees Johnny has no doubt. 
          As Donnegal and NINA approach, Fitz decides to push the
          envelope and introduce Johnny to Nina...

                        Mr. Donnegal, you remember John. 

          Donnegal nods uncomfortably at Johnny, avoids a handshake,
          as Fitz continues the introductions...

                                        FITZ (CONT'D)
                        Nina, this is a friend of mine,
                        Johnny Smith.

                                        NINA
                        Hello, Johnny Smith.

          Nina takes Johnny's hand.  On contact, RAMP TO JOHNNY'S
          FACE --


  2525VISION -- INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Wide shot pushing in to the king sized bed... where two
          naked people are having vigorous sex... as they change
          position we get a flash of Nina's smile in the
            candlelight... she's in her element here, gets and gives
          great pleasure out of this.  We don't see the man yet but
          based on everything we've seen so far, we fully expect
          him to be Johnny/Mickey.  Then as we continue the push in
          and the man whoops with delight at this incredible woman,
          we see the face emerge from the shadows for the first
          time until it catches enough light for us to see that it
          does not belong to Johnny/Mickey after all but to Greg
          Stillson... the vision ends...


  2626RESUME -- JOHNNY

            Struggles to keep his composure.  Donnegal is watching
          all of this with a sharp eye.

                        Nice to meet you.

          And she moves away with Cathan.  On Johnny's reaction...

  2929JOHNNY

          his mind working, walks alone toward the cars... watches
          Nina get into the back of a stretch limo...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        A few minutes earlier, if these
                        guys had told me to get lost, I
                        would have been the happiest man
                        in the cemetery.  But after I saw
                        Greg Stillson might be involved,
                          I wasn't in such a hurry to leave
                          anymore.

          Behind him, Fitz has been briefing Donnegal on what
          Johnny's been saying... after a beat, Donnegal moves beside
            Johnny... they continue to walk... without pleasantries,
          Donnegal gets to the point --

                                        DONNEGAL
                        My first thought was you got a
                        tip from your friend the Sheriff
                        that Mickey was coming for me...
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Guys like me know how to use the
                          internet too...

                                        JOHNNY
                        If that were true, why would I
                        warn you?

                                        DONNEGAL
                        To set me up.  Or gain my trust. 
                        Or both.  It's an old police trick. 
                        Maybe you're just the newest twist. 
                        If you are, I promise you'll regret
                        it, Mr. Smith.

          A beat as he makes sure Johnny gets the message.  

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Now, I don't read minds but I can
                        read faces.  You saw something
                        when you touched Nina, didn't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be honest, I saw her in bed
                        with someone.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        I hope it wasn't me.  That would
                        be uncomfortable.  

          Johnny thinks a beat and then looks Donnegal straight in

          the eye and tells him straight out because more than
          anything else, he wants to know if there's the possibility
          that he's tripped over something that might bring Stillson
          down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was with Greg Stillson.

          Donnegal's eyes narrow... a beat... and he's not going to
          be forthcoming with Johnny, a man he barely knows, so he
          frames his responses carefully.

                                        DONNEGAL
                          I believe Nina is acquainted with
                        Mr. Stillson.  You believe he
                        might be involved in what happened?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if he was?

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (understatement, murder)
                        It would be the end of a promising
                          political career.

          Johnny considers the temptation of the moment.  A lie
          might end Armageddon.  But he's Johnny and he can't do
          it.  He sighs as he realizes that himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know yet.

          Donnegal studies him, mind working.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        There are certain business matters -
                        ours, for example - that I would
                        never share with Nina.  But I do
                        trust her.  As much as I trust
                        anyone.  But then I trusted Mickey
                        too.  Stillson?  He's a politician. 
                        Last guy on earth you want to
                        trust.  But I don't know why he
                        would want to kill me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your relationship with
                        him?

                                        DONNEGAL

                        Now when I hear questions like
                        that, I worry about you again.

          Johnny understands - this man is not his friend.  Will
          never be his friend.  He feels Donnegal's eyes on him...
          as though the man is measuring him for a suit.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        You just worry about answers. 
                        I'll ask the questions.  


  3030INT. LIMO - DAY

          Nina's in the back.  Suddenly the door opposite her opens
          and Cathan looks in.

                                        DONNEGAL
                          Johnny's going to go along with
                        you, Nina.  I hope that's okay.

                        Of course.   

          Johnny gets into the limo.

                          I expect to hear from you later,
                        John... don't be a stranger...

          That's a warning even though it isn't spoken as one. 
          Donnegal shuts the door and signals to the driver to take
          off.


  3131INT. LIMO -- DRIVING

          Johnny and Nina.  Nina is a smart lady and knows that
          Cathan Donnegal doesn't put a man in the back seat with
          her for no reason.  So she's curious about him.  Is he a
          player or a worker?  He isn't dressed like a player.  
          Nina is remote but not too far out of reach for a man who
          can afford to reach out for her...

                                        NINA
                        Mind if I smoke?

                                (he would mind)

          Too late for objections - she already has lit the cigarette
          and holds it provocatively between two black gloved
          fingers...

                        him very well.

                                        NINA
                                (the truth)
                        Neither did I. 

          But of course, that doesn't click with the kiss that Johnny
          saw...

                                        NINA
                        Until somebody told me he was
                        dead, I didn't even know his last
                        name.  He was just... Mickey.  Do
                        you work for Cathan?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually he works for me.

                                        NINA
                                (reacts, huh?)
                        Cathan Donnegal works for you.  

                                        JOHNNY
                          I bought some bathroom fixtures
                        from him... he's doing all the
                          installation work for me.

          She looks at him evenly.  Puts out her cigarette in the
          ashtray as she considers the wealth implied in the next
          line:

                                        NINA
                        A hotel chain?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nope, just an old leaky sink at
                        the house.  Thanks...

                                        NINA
                        For...

                        Putting out the cigarette.

          She studies him a beat.

                                        NINA
                        Pour me a drink?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.

                                        NINA
                        Vodka and ice.

          Johnny reaches over to the bar...

                                        NINA
                        I'm curious.  Why did Cathan put
                        you in the car with me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hmm?  Oh, they were just a little
                        short of limo space... I think
                        Mr. Donnegal just picked this car
                        by chance.

          He returns with her drink.  

                                        NINA
                        Cathan Donnegal never does anything
                        by chance.  

          As he hands her the glass of vodka, RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE. 
          And we are:


  3232INT. NINA'S PLACE -- NIGHT -- VISION

          A cocktail party in progress -- a crowd that seems to
          consist mostly of GORGEOUS GIRLS in tight dresses and
          CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY enjoying some roguish, slightly
          illicit fun.  A group gathers around a piano player at an
          upright, playing gentle stride jazz.  Nina hangs on
          Cathan's arm, chatting up guests, sipping the last drops
          of champagne from her glass.

                                        JOHNNY/MICKEY
                        Let me get you refill, Nina.

          He didn't even seem to be there before his line.  She
            certainly was unaware of him.  But she smiles and hands
          him her glass.  He moves off toward the bar on his mission. 
          Glances toward...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT TWO - 1/13/03 BLUE  26.

          THE DOOR

          as Greg Stillson enters the party, followed by SONNY
          ELLIMAN.  The celebrated face brings quick attention from
          the crowd... murmurs of recognition, smiles across the
          room... Greg smiles back, plays the room with his eyes...

                                        STILLSON
                        My kind of party.  More girls
                        than boys.

          A LOVELY GIRL takes Greg's jacket.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're good at that sweet-heart. 
                        You could do that professionally.

                                        GIRL
                        What?

                                        STILLSON
                        Remove my clothes.

          The girl laughs and walks off with Greg's gaze planted
          firmly on her backside.  Greg is like a kid in a candy-
          store, but Elliman quickly takes him in tow to join
          Donnegal and Nina.  Johnny/Mickey watches from the bar as
          a bartender pours two fresh glasses of champagne.


          NEW ANGLE - FINDING JOHNNY/MICKEY 

          picking up two glasses of champagne from the bar, careful
          not to spill them...


          HIS MOVING POV - STILLSON, DONNEGAL, ELLIMAN, NINA

                                        ELLIMAN
                                  (mid-conversation)
                        ...Greg has the confidence of the
                        tribal leaders, we've got the
                        regulatory chair sewn up.  Be in
                          a perfect position to run
                          interference after prop 151 passes.

          But as Johnny approaches, a waiter with glasses of
            champagne passes and Stillson grabs a couple - one for
          him and another for Nina.  Johnny/Mickey stops dead in
          his tracks with his glass, thwarted in his mission and
          turns back.  Nina never even notices him.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT TWO - 1/14/03 PINK  27.


    32CONTINUED: (2)32

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Why don't we talk business later,
                        Mr. Elliman.  It's a party.  Have
                        a good time. 

                                        STILLSON
                        Cathan, you are obviously a man
                        with the right priorities in life.

            Laughter.  But the line was directed as much at the
            incomparable Nina as to Cathan.


          WITH JOHNNY/MICKEY 

          as he awkwardly retraces his steps to the bar, sits alone
          with the champagne.  He chugs a glass of champagne as
          though it were Scotch instead of Crystal.  Then he turns
          his gaze to a strategic piece of mirror behind the bar.


          THE MIRROR -- JOHNNY/MICKEY'S POV

          Reflecting Nina as she lifts her lovely neck in laughter.  


          THE FOURSOME

          Drinking and laughing.  And ever so subtly Johnny/Mickey
          sees Donnegal hand off Nina to Stillson... it comes after
          a look from Donnegal to Nina, just a look is enough for
          her to know what she has to do; and after the briefest
          flicker of humiliation in her eyes, she exchanges Cathan's
          arm for Greg's.  Greg is delighted.  Glances back at
            Donnegal.  Donnegal nods his approval.  Stillson nods his
            appreciation as the gangster moves away from the newly
          joined couple.

          OUR VIEW moves yet again across the mirror to find
            Johnny/Mickey staring vacantly at the image of Mickey in
          the mirror: a self-portrait in disappointment.  A cell
          phone rings breaking the vision.


  3333RESUME LIMO

          as Johnny finishes handing off the drink and grabs his
          phone...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (answering)
                        Hello.          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT TWO - 1/13/03 BLUE  28.


    3434CROSSCUT WITH WALT - INT. SECURITY VAN

                                        WALT
                        What the hell are you doing in a
                        limo with a hooker in a funeral
                        procession for a mob guy?  Are
                        you okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, hi... yeah, everything's
                          great... maybe I'll see you
                          later...
                                (beat)
                        Mom...

                                        WALT
                        We have to talk.

          He hangs up.

                                        NINA
                        Talking to your mother.  Now you
                        sound like Mickey.  Are you the
                        new Mickey, John Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The new Mickey?

                                        NINA
                        Mickey looked after me now and
                        then for Cathan.  Maybe that's
                        why Cathan put you in the car.   

                                        JOHNNY
                        He didn't mentioned it.

                                        NINA
                        He wouldn't.  Somehow it just
                        happens when Cathan wants it to
                        happen.

          The driver parks the car and gets out...


  3535EXT. NINA'S CONDO BUILDING - DAY

          As the driver opens the door for Nina... she looks back
          at Johnny, still curious...

                                        NINA
                        But, nothing personal, you don't
                        look the type.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you believe me if I told
                        you the cleaners lost my black
                        Armani suit?

                                        NINA
                        See you around, John Smith.

          She smiles evenly, curious, and walks toward her high
          rent building... and any guy in the audience can only
          wish a girl like Nina would someday say 'see you around'
          to them.


  3636INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny is very uncomfortable with Walt being there... 
          Walt couldn't care less that Johnny feels uncomfortable..
          he needs to know what's going on... he follows him around
          the house as Johnny wants nothing to do with him... this
          is not light banter - there's a genuine conflict at play
          here...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I suppose you're going to promise
                        to protect me... like you protected
                        Mickey Doyle.

                                        WALT
                        I never promised to protect Mickey
                        Doyle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you can protect me.

                                        WALT
                        No, but Sarah and I will throw
                        you a helluva funeral.

          Johnny gives him a look.

                                        WALT
                        Let's not forget how Mickey Doyle
                        bought the big casino.

                                        JOHNNY
                        'The big casino'.  You know you're
                        a very different guy out on the
                        street, Walt.

                                        WALT
                        It's a job.  And I need my
                          snitches.  And thanks to you, I
                        lost my best snitch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your 'best snitch'.  Mickey   
                        never told you a thing.

                                        WALT
                        He would've before I was done
                        with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was playing you, Walt.  He
                          would've gone to jail before he
                        gave you anything.

                                        WALT
                        Spilled milk and I'm not crying
                        now that I have you on the inside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't have me on the inside.  
                          Donnegal knows about us... you
                          shouldn't even be here...

          Walt is tired of moving... he grabs Johnny, not rough and
          tough like he did with Mickey, but we have to recall that
          scene as he presses Johnny...

                                        WALT
                        John, I'm not playing games here. 
                        I need your help and eventually
                        you'll need mine to get out of

                        have... getting Harrison Fisher
                        to withdraw from the race.

          Johnny knows that irony... and wonders why fate plays
          with him the way it does.  Sighs to himself --

                        Yeah, well, I'm still trying to

                        Greg thinks you've seen things
                        about his past... he's made
                          mistakes, he admits that...

                        I'm more worried about the mistakes
                        he hasn't made yet.

                        And you don't want to tell me

          nature of the vision that Johnny has had.  She takes his

          kinds of mistakes.

                        At least, we agree on one thing.

          Johnny has to stop and consider the possibility that even
          Sarah has a role to play in the ultimate destiny that
          Johnny has foreseen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you're right, Sarah.  Maybe
                        you shouldn't quit.  Maybe you're
                        not supposed to quit.

                        Quit?  Not while I have any say
                        in the matter.

          Greg comes in... behind him is Sonny Elliman, who has a
          bruise on his cheek from a fight...

                                        STILLSON
                        Sarah's my conscience.  Every
                          candidate needs a conscience.
                        Isn't that right, Sonny?

          Sonny doesn't smile.

                        Sonny doesn't do the conscience
                        thing.  But that's my secret.

          Stillson looks at Johnny, choosing to keep his distance.

                        Excuse me for not shaking your
                        hand in a proper greeting, John,

                        What brings you over this way?

          Johnny decides to throw it out there for a reaction...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It turns out we have mutual friend.
                        Mickey Doyle?

                                        STILLSON
                        Sorry, John, your famous second
                        sight failed you this time --
                        never heard of the fellow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No?  Used to work for Cathan
                          Donnegal.

          Stillson's easy grin never wavers but maybe there's a
          look in his eye and a glance toward Sonny.  He sees he
          needs to move this out of here, looks to Sarah.

                                        STILLSON
                        It's hard when old friends find
                        themselves on opposite sides of
                        the fence.  You've known John
                        longer than you've known me.  But
                        we're adults, right?  Reasonable
                        people can agree to disagree.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm not quitting.

          But then he adds with a grin, first pointing to John --

          But Stillson is wiser, knows Johnny knows what he knows,
          and isn't afraid of it.

                        on my toes when you're around.

          And he's all politician as he explains in the most natural

                        it but privately, I happen to

                        Mickey Doyle to kill him.  Maybe
                        someone involved with the casino
                          initiative.

          He looks to Stillson for a reaction... Stillson volleys
          well...

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't generally try to kill
                        people who help finance my
                          campaign, John.  

          Johnny studies him evenly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Donnegal apparently isn't so
                        sure of that.

          For the first time, Stillson's even demeanor drops for a
          beat, and fear flickers across his eyes.  Elliman is far
          less under control... he moves threateningly toward
            Johnny...

                                        ELLIMAN
                        You just be careful what you tell
                          Donnegal.

          Elliman grabs Johnny.  On contact, RAMP INTO JOHNNY'S

                          I haven't been asked that since I
                        was ten.  What's next?  My favorite

                        months old.  That's when he smiles
                        for the first time.  By then it
                        was winter.

                          Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  We
                        were driving to the Menenaki Indian
                          Reservation and one of the biggest
                        casinos in the Northeast.

          The vision ends cutting back to --

          Like he did in "What It Seems", he is following the
            footsteps of an alter ego; and we intercut between Johnny
          walking into the casino in real time and...

          walking in the past into the casino trailing Nina by
          several yards.  She heads past a sign stating
            "Administrative Offices."  A casino security guard nods
          her inside.

          as he moves to go through the same door but a different
          SECURITY GUARD (to avoid confusion, should be a different
            ethnicity than the first guard) stops him...

          Johnny considers his options.  Before him lies the whole
            flashing, jingling, money-making apparatus of the casino.

          As one by one the triple JACKPOT image CLICKS to a stop

                        we go for.  You brought something?

          She hands the envelopes that Donnegal gave to Mickey in
          the earlier scene to Sonny.  Sonny in turn hands one of
          the envelopes to Jonas.  The deal is done.

                        to her condo that night.  And I
                        decided to do the same thing.  It
                        was time she and I had a talk
                        about Sonny Elliman and Greg
                          Stillson.

          As he gets out, his mind continues to work... quite by
          instinct now, he does a slightly curious thing - he moves
          around and opens the back door even though no one is in
          the backseat... but as he does... he MORPHS TO --


    7070JOHNNY/MICKEY - NIGHT

          opening the car door for Nina... Her face is stained with
          tears... escorts her to her front door... as they walk,
            Johnny/Mickey mumbles to the best of his ability, trying
          to express the depth of his feelings for her... he's not
          a verbal guy but his heart is full and he needs to tell
          her.  She's into her own pain and humiliation and sees no
          exit from it... 

                                        JOHNNY/MICKEY
                        I hate to see you like this,
                        Nina... you shouldn't have to be
                        doing these things... Cathan has
                        no right...

          They reach the door.

                                        JOHNNY/MICKEY
                        You need to get out of this.  You
                        need to go home to St. Paul.

          He looks at her with hangdog eyes.  She tries to smile at
          this pipe dream... like any of it has a chance of
            happening... and really for the first time ever in their
            relationship, she looks at this little man who may be the

          only one in the world who genuinely cares about her well
          being...

          She sadly smiles at him and kisses him gently on the
          lips... the one and only time they've ever kissed... and
          the kiss that Johnny saw in his very first vision of them. 
          She studies him with those wise, too wise, eyes.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        And that's when I realized what
                        it was all about.  Not casinos. 
                        Not Stillson.  Just a kiss.  The
                        one and only kiss from Nina.  But
                        for Mickey... who watched TV shows
                        about King Arthur on the Discovery
                        Channel... it was a kiss that
                        raised him to knighthood.

          She turns and goes inside... as the door closes, the vision
          ends as we --

          moves aggresively to Donnegal and grabs him with one hand,

          But Johnny's face shows that he's seen something on
          contact... and he's already relaxed his grip... it was
          barely a matter of seconds before he regained control.

                          probably not.

                          Somebody tried to kill Nina.

                        She was on her way to the hospital
                        when I left her.

          Donnegal looks at his men, motions for them to put away
          their weapons.

                        Same somebody who sent Mickey to
                        kill you, maybe?

                        But you know, don't you?  You

                        Mickey did this on his own.

                        Mickey never did anything on his

                        He was in love with her.

                        He could have had her.  All he
                        had to do was ask.  Why'd he think
                        he had to kill me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's one of those questions I
                        can't answer if you don't already
                        know.

          Donnegal puzzles over this but doesn't tax himself.  He
          stares a beat at Johnny and determines that he is telling
          the truth.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        That's it.  You're sure.

          Johnny nods.  Donnegal thinks about it, shakes his head
          at man's folly... glances at his colleagues... sighs --

          Shrugs, okay that's over.  Reaches into a drawer and starts
          counting out cash.

                        You did good, John.  Ten thousand

          He points his finger at Sonny for emphasis... and there's
          more than a trace of Mickey in his manner.  He walks away
          leaving Sonny lying in the filth of the ground.


  8484INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Nina lies on her back, unconscious, hooked up to a glucose
          drip.  In sleep, her expression is serene and peaceful,
          and she is most beautiful.  Johnny sits beside her,
          watching over her.

          He takes her hand in his and squeezes gently.  Nina stirs,
            a fractional smile appears on her face and her eyes crack
          open.

                                        NINA
                        Mickey?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm here, Nina.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
