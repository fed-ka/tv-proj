                (ANTIC) My dad. My dad! Myyyy 

                daaaad! Hooray! 

                                  ELI 
 
                  (CHUCKLING) Yes. What? Disaster? 
 
                                  WARNER 

                  Ridiculous. I don t know how he 

                doesn t know what he does. How could 

                he not know? 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                (STILL CHUCKLING) He s a dad, that s 

                how. Are we talking around the house 

                  disaster, or financial disaster? 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Both! Remember that solar panel oil 

                fracking company my dad was trying to 

                get off the ground? 

                                  ELI 
 
                Yeah, the one that simultaneously 

                helps and hurts the environment.  2. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Exactly.  So last night I get home and 

                there s this weird little guy sitting 

                in the living room having a drink with 

                my dad. Like 5  2  little. 

                                  ELI 

                Ew. You don t want to be surprised by 

                someone that short. I feel like they 

                know magic. 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                So my dad introduces me, and it turns 

                out the little guy is, Clem, the CEO 

                of the solar-fracking company and he s 

                staying for dinner. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Also weird. What company has a tiny 
 
                CEO? That s not good for business. 
 
                                  WARNER 

                Sad, tense board meetings, right? 

                Anyway, I m like,  Dad, yes I am 

                letting you live here, but no, you 

                cannot just invite people over without 

                asking.  
 

                                  ELI 
 
                  Especially creepy short guys in charge 

                of weird stuff. 

                                  (MORE)  3. 
 

                                  ELI (CONT'D) 
 
                Another reason I live alone. There 

                will never be a creepy short guy in my 

                  apartment by surprise. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                It turns out the whole reason my dad 

                invited him over was because he 

                  convinced  Clem  that the best way to 

                market his company was by making a 

                video game about it, (THEN, DAD VOICE) 

                 and my son is the king of making 

                video games.  
 
      WARNER SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISBELIEF AT THE MEMORY, ELI STARTS 
      LAUGHING. 
 
 
 ELI 
  
                Yes.  
 
                                  WARNER 
 

                A video game about solar panel oil 

                  fracking?! What the hell?! What 

                would that even be?! And for who?! 

                For what possible person?!! 

                                  ELI 
 
                  (LAUGHING) We should make a game about 

                your dad called,  Ambush of Nonsense.  

                                  WARNER 
 
                I thought you d enjoy my misery.  4. 
 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                I do. Immensely. That s why you re 
 
                my best friend. If you ever get happy, 

                this relationship is over. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Well, you should be overjoyed today 

                because he s behaving very dadly. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Dadly Do-wrong. Is that something? 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                No. And neither was  Dadly .  Dadly  
 
                was bait, and you took it. You okay?

      CHARLYNE YI) ENTERS. 
 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                Oh, hi guys. I couldn t help but hear 

                you complain about your dads for the 

                last forever. 

                                  WARNER 

                Yeah, well, they are a pain in the 

                ass. 
 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                My dad beat me with a math book until 
 
                I was 16. 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Yes, but we re white, so we can whine 

                about things that you can t.  5. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Speaking of awesome Asians... Is 

                  everything ready for the Nanjing 

                  Investment Group visit on Friday? 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                All the presentation stuff is ready, 

                yeah. The rest is up to you guys. If 

                you want to expand your games into 

                China, you better put on a coat and 

                tie and wear some expensive dumpling 
 
                cologne. 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Is that a real thing? 
 
                                  VERONICA 
 
                Of course not, you racist! 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                (TO ELI) Dude, why do you keep taking 

                the bait today? 

                                  ELI 
 
                I m a little shook up. I sneezed while 

                peeing this morning, and I think I 

                blew something down there. 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                Gross. (THEN) V, are you from  no 

                freedom  Asia or  too much freedom  

                Asia?  6. 
 
 

                                  VERONICA 

                No freedom. My parents escaped in an 

                ox torso. 
 

                                  WARNER 

                Good, well maybe you can help us with 

                these guys. 
 

                                  VERONICA 

                No! They d hate me. 

                                  WARNER 
 

                Why?   
 
                                  VERONICA 
 

                They re from Guangdong Province and my 

                family s from Gonsu Province. 

                                  WARNER 
 

                So?   
 
                                  VERONICA 
 

                All Asians hate all other Asians. 

                They all look down on each other for 

                weird reasons. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Can t you just put that aside and help 

                us by sitting in the meeting? 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                Are you kidding? I d never sit in a 

                room with a Guangdong. They wear fish 

                skin underwear and bathe in dog spit.  7. 
 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Ok, we re hiding you from them. 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                How many of them are there? 
 
                                  VERONICA 
 

                12.   
 
                                  ELI 
 

                That s like none to them.

      WARNER ENTERS THE FRONT DOOR. HIS TWO DOGS GREET HIM, AND HIS 
      FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON ALDEN RACES INTO HIS ARMS. 
 
                                  ALDEN 

                Daddy! Daddy! Look, you are here at

      WARNER S WIFE KATHERINE, MID-30 S, DARK, BEAUTIFUL, COMES 
      AROUND THE CORNER HOLDING A ONE-YEAR-OLD IN HER ARMS. HE 
      KISSES THE BABY.  8. 
 
 

                                  WARNER (CONT D) 
 
                Hi, small baby. Did your Latina mommy 

                beat you today with her mean, jungle 

                hands? 

      KATHERINE ROLLS HER EYES AT WARNER AND HANDS HIM THE BABY. 
 
                                  KATHERINE 
 
                Here, go with your dorky video game 

                white bread and mayonnaise father. 

      WARNER AND KATHERINE KISS. 
 
                                  KATHERINE (CONT D) 
 
                Did you have a nice day of being a 

                  professional child? 

                                  WARNER 
 
                I can t wait until all of your mom 

                  paychecks roll in and I can quit. 

                                  KATHERINE 
 

                Shut up. 
 
      THEY KISS AGAIN THEN A DROP OF WATER FALLS ON WARNER S FACE. 
 
                                  WARNER 
 

                What the-- 
 
      WARNER LOOKS UP AND SEES THAT THE WATER IS DRIPPING FROM A 
      LIGHT FIXTURE IN THE CEILING. JUST THEN, CRAWFORD, WARNER S 
      DAD MID-60 S, W.A.S.P.Y, COMES DOWN THE STAIRS. HE LOOKS 
      HAPPY AND RELAXED, AND HIS HAIR IS WET AND FRESHLY PARTED. 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                I just love that new jacuzzi tub. I 
 
                am so relaxed. 
 
      ANOTHER DROP OF WATER FALLS ON WARNER S FACE.  9. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Oh my god, dad, did you turn off the 

                jets before you drained it? 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                I didn t want to touch anything, just 

                in case something bad happened. 

      THE LIGHT FIXTURE ABOVE WARNER S HEAD SUDDENLY GOES OUT WITH 
    A POP AND A FLASH. THEN THE POWER IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE 
      GOES OUT. A BEAT THEN: 
 
                                  CRAWFORD (CONT D) 

                Warner, I believe the power s gone 

                out. (THEN) What a shame, I was really 

                looking forward to listening to the 

                radio tonight.

                It s like I can t get away from him. 
 
                I finally have my own thing going and 

                he s just pulling me down. 

                                  KATHERINE 
 
                He doesn t mean to. It could be 

                worse, you could have Eli s dad. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                I wish!  Eli s dad lives in another 

                state. Mine s in the next room.

                My whole childhood was: (DAD VOICE) 

                 Guys, I ve hit it big with my natural 

                gas partnership, we re going to 

                Barbados for spring break! Gang, my

                                  KATHERINE 
 
                It s because he s a dreamer. He 

                believes in everything. All he sees 

                is possibility. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Yeah, and because of that all I see is 
 
                   disaster ahead!  I m constantly 

                  worrying, because he never does. I 

                never had any control, and now he s 

                back again to drag me down until I 

                have nothing. I mean, how much is 

                this jacuzzi nightmare gonna cost me?

                and focus on something else tonight. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Not tonight, babe. I have a huge dump 

                on deck. It s pushing all the buttons 

                at once back there. 

                                  KATHERINE 

                Well, why don t you go to the 

                  bathroom? 
 

                                  WARNER

                a morning pleasure.

                attach an address.

      ELI HANGS UP AND THE SPLIT SCREEN ENDS. 
 
                                  ELI (CONT D) 
 
                Thanks for announcing that to my dad. 
 
                                  TANIA 

                I didn t know. 

                                  ELI 
 
                How could you know? You were too busy 

                taking up the entire surface of my 

                bed. 
 

                                  TANIA 
 
                God, you always get so mean when you 

                talk to your dad. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Sorry, my dad is just so annoying. 

                He s like the ghost of Conan O Brien 

                and I m the only one he haunts. 

                                  TANIA 
 
                Is Conan O Brien dead? 
 
                                  ELI 
 
                No, but he d be a pretty annoying 

                ghost, right? 

                                  TANIA 
 
                What about a Craig Ferguson ghost?  15. 
 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Come on, he s got a Scottish accent. 

                That s delightful. Think.

      ELI SITS AT HIS DESK WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AS WARNER 
      STANDS OVER HIM WITH A BROAD SMILE. 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                Yes! Feel It! Feel the dad! 
 
                                  ELI 
 
                Come on, this is not funny. He s a 

                life grenade. 

                                  WARNER 

                Oh, but it s funny when I have to deal 

                with my dad? 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Yes! Because that s you, so it s 

                funny. This is happening to me! Not 

                funny. Besides, my dad is way worse 

                than your dad. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Excuse me? I thought you just said 

                your dad is worse than mine. 

                                  ELI 
 
                He is! Way worse. Your dad is nice. 

                My dad is the king of negativity. It 

                sucks.  16. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 

                My dad searched our entire house for 

                his reading glasses with dog crap on 

                his loafer. 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                My dad sucks food through his teeth 

                and it sounds like new sneakers on a 

                  basketball court. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                He then cleaned the loafer in our 

                kitchen sink, where we prepare food. 

                                  ELI 
 
                My dad can clear his throat for 50 

                minutes of a two hour movie. 

                                  WARNER 

                The paper towels used to clean the 

                loafer were then disposed of not in a 

                garbage bin outside, oh no, but in  

                house. 
 

                                  ELI 

                My dad is a light-kiss-on-the-lips 

                dad. 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                The search for the origin of the smell 

                of dog crap was fruitless, because it 

                was so well-dispersed around the 

                entire house. It was everywhere.  17. 
 
 

                                  ELI 

                My dad divorced my mom and left the 

                country when I was 5. (BEAT) Yeah, 

                top that. 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                We had to sleep with the windows open 

                that night. It was 37 degrees out. 

                Both kids got ear infections. That s 

                what my dad does. 

      VERONICA ENTERS. 
 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                Guys, all this complaining is 

                  ridiculous. My dad died of lung 

                cancer when I was 19. 

                                  WARNER / ELI 

                Lucky. / So lucky.

                Your dad was telling us about your 

                visit to the petting zoo.

                  yesterday. 
 

                                  ELI 

                Well, when you re only a dad for 5 

                years, there are way fewer things to 

                  remember.

                  remembers. Stop being so mean to him. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Boy, you love using that word with me.

                                  ELI 
 
                Well, maybe don t drink that one. I 
 
                was saving it for me. 
 
                                  TANIA 
 
                Drink it. I ll go buy some more, it s 

                not a big deal. 

                                  ELI 
 
                Yes dad. Do anything you want without 

                a thought for anyone else. The world 

                is yours for free!

                Really? Where s the joke there? 

                What s the set up? What s the 

                  punchline? Oh yeah, guy walks into a 

                bar and his nightmare dad is there and 

                the guy has to buy him all the drinks 

                in the world as a reward for being a 

                mediocre parent. Haha!! What a

                It s embarrassing.

                He s not sweet. He s a monster. And,

                Do we ask them to invest, or do they 

                ask us? I feel like there s a Chinese 

                protocol that we need to observe. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Are you asking me? I don t know. 
 
                                  ELI 

                No, I m asking our resident ching-

                                  VERONICA 
 
                Yes, you have to let them ask you. 

                They are the guests. But you can t 

                say things like  ching-chong , and you

                                  VERONICA 
 

                Sorry.   
 
                                  WARNER 
 

                Well, get it out of your head! Smoke 

                pot and listen to Zeppelin, or 

                  something. Don t mess this up. 

                                  ELI 
 
                That s the problem, I can t smoke pot 

                when my dad s around. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Why, you think he d care? 
 
                                  ELI 
 
                No, he d probably do it with me and 

                the last thing I wanna do is bond with 

                him. 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Last night, my dad answered our house 

                phone and pledged $500 to a local 

                animal shelter. Of course, he doesn t 

                have $500, so that s where I come in. 

                                  ELI 
 
                I don t think my dad has spent $500 

                dollars on anything in his life ever.  25. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 
 
                That s the smallest amount mine pays 

                for anything. 

                                  ELI 
 
                That s good. At least he s generous. 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                Even more so with my money. 
 
                                  ELI 

                You know they re having lunch today. 

                (PERKING UP) You can pay for my dad s 

                meal! I would text him to order a 

                steak but he s too cheap to get a 

                  cellphone. 
 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                My father was accidentally cremated 

                while working a low skill factory job. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Stop rubbing it in! Wait, didn t you 

                say your dad died of lung cancer? 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                He was diagnosed with lung cancer 

                right before the factory accident. 

                                  ELI 
 
                God, save a dad tragedy for the rest

      EXT./ESTAB. DINER - DAY 
      INT. DINER - SAME  26. 
 
 

      DAVID SITS BY HIMSELF AT A BOOTH. HE HAS CLEARLY BEEN WAITING 
      FOR A LONG TIME. HE LOOKS AROUND, AND THEN QUICKLY TAKES AN 
      EQUAL PACKET FROM THE SUGAR TRAY AND SHOVES IT IN HIS WALLET. 
    A WAITRESS APPROACHES. HE IS CAUGHT. 
 
                                  DAVID 
 

                I was just--   
 
                                  WAITRESS 
 

                  --stealing a packet of equal because 

                you re crazy cheap. You want me to 

                take away this setting or are you 

                still expecting someone? 

                                  DAVID 
 
                What happened to  the customer is 

                always right ? 

                                  WAITRESS 
 

                Time. 
 
      JUST THEN, CRAWFORD WALKS IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE 
      RESTAURANT. HE IS CARRYING A LARGE AND VERY WORLD-WEARY 
      CANVASS BAG OVERFLOWING WITH PAPERS. WE SEE HIM SCAN THE 
      RESTAURANT FOR DAVID. HE IS UNABLE TO SPOT HIM EVEN THOUGH HE 
      IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. 
 
                                  DAVID 
 

                  Crawford. 
 
      CRAWFORD HEARS HIS NAME AND LOOKS IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE 
      DIRECTION OF DAVID. HE CONTINUES TO SCAN THE ROOM. 
 
                                  DAVID (CONT D) 
 

                  Crawford. 
 
      AGAIN CRAWFORD LOOKS IN THE WRONGEST POSSIBLE DIRECTION. 
 
                                  DAVID (CONT D) 

                (WAVING) CRAWFORD! 

      FINALLY CRAWFORD SEES DAVID RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, AND MAKES 
    A FACE THAT READS:  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?   27. 
 
 

                                  CRAWFORD 

                David, how are you? 

                                  DAVID 
 
                Good to see you, Crawford. 
 
      THEY SHAKE HANDS AND CRAWFORD SITS DOWN. 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                You know, I think the last time we saw 

                each other was at the reunion. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                Yeah, the 40th. 
 

                      CRAWFORD DAVID 
  
    I love those things. What? I hate those things. What? 

    I said I love those things! I said I hate those things! 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                Yeah, they re terrific. 
 

      CRAWFORD PLACES HIS OVERSTUFFED CANVAS BAG IN THE BOOTH WITH 
    A KIND OF AWKWARDNESS AND CAREFUL OVER-BALANCING THAT 
      SUGGESTS HE HAS NEVER PUT ANYTHING DOWN EVER. HE SITS. 
 
                                  DAVID 
 
                You got your whole office in there? 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                Nearly, yes. I just came from a very 

                  interesting -- very interesting in 

                fact -- meeting with an outfit that 

                owns the copyright on Black Santa 

                Clause of all things. 

                                  DAVID 
 

                Huh.  28. 
 
 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                It almost sounds silly until you 

                realize what kind of money can be 

                made. They are going to make a 

                fortune for the right investor. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                  (GENUINELY INTERESTED) Really? 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                No question. It s the investment 

                  opportunity of the century. Do you 

                have any idea how much the firm that 

                owns the copyright on the Mexican 

                Easter Bunny made last year? 

                  $400,000,000. I ve talked to Warner 

                about it, but I just can t seem to get 

                him interested. 

                                  DAVID 

                Yeah, well our sons wouldn t know a 

                good opportunity if it smacked them in 

                the face. 
 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                Well, I don t know about that. 
 
                Without a doubt, they run the hottest 

                video game company in the country, if 

                not the world.  29. 
 
 

                                  DAVID 
 
                Well, those things have a way of going 

                south before you know it. 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                Well, if there s bigger video game 

                talent out there, I surely haven t 

                seen it. And I am a business man. 

                                  DAVID 

                People were pretty confident in 1929 

                then, poof! 
 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                They re doing great. Our sons are 

                making a ton of money. They are. 

                Warner just bought me a $3,600 pair of 

                hearing aid implants. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                $3,600? Is that right? 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 

                He did. And they have a masseuse come 

                over once a week. Don t think for one 

                second I don t get in on that, too. 

                  (CHUCKLES) 
 

                                  DAVID 
 
                Sounds like you got a pretty good set 

                up over there.  30. 
 
 

                                  CRAWFORD 
 
                I do, but I pull my weight. Believe 

                me. I spent the better half of 

                  yesterday afternoon searching for the 

                cheapest fares to Hawaii. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                Oh, they re going to Hawaii? 
 
                                  CRAWFORD 

                No, I am. Going to look at this 

                company that does (RAISING HEAD AS IF 

                ITS THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE 

                WORLD) Pineapple gene therapy.

      THE TRANSLATOR CONVEYS THE THANK YOU. 
 
                                  ELI 
 
                And, in the words of Confucious,  To 

                see what is right and not do it is 

                want of courage.  

      THE TRANSLATOR RELAYS THIS TO THE INVESTORS WHO NOD 
        APPROVINGLY. AMONG THEM IS AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER EARLY 
      30S, DONGMEI. SHE AND ELI MEET EYES AS THE INVESTORS STAND 
      AND SHAKE HANDS WITH WARNER. VERONICA LOOKS IN THROUGH THE 
      CONFERENCE ROOM WINDOW WITH A  HOW D IT GO?  EXPRESSION. 
      WARNER GIVES HER THE THUMBS UP AND, IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT 
      AND CONFUSION, WHISTLES THE SAME OFFENSIVE TUNE THAT VERONICA 
      HAD WARNED THEM NOT TO DO. THE INVESTORS ALL LOOK AT WARNER 
      WITH EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER AND DISAPPROVAL. ONE OF THE 
      INVESTORS ASKS THE TRANSLATOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THE 
      TRANSLATOR WHISTLES THE SAME OFFENSIVE TUNE. THE INVESTOR 
      MAKES AN ANGRY EXPRESSION OF DISAPPROVAL.

                Warner, he ruined the entire chair. 

                He s like a smiling buffalo. In a 

                house. Full of my pretty stuff.  32. 
 
 

                                  WARNER 

                Look, I m mad too, but he didn t know 

                he had an open hi-lighter in his back 

                pocket. 
 

                                  KATHERINE 
 
                But he does this all the time! 
 
                                  WARNER 
 
                Yeah, I know, but he doesn t know what 

                he s doing. He has zero awareness. 

                In fact, when you point these things 

                out to him, he acts as if a third 

                party was responsible. And then you 

                can t get mad at him, because he s 

                already mad at the third party who 

                never existed. 

                                  KATHERINE 
 
                Ugh, it s just so frustrating. Can t 

                you just talk to him about it? 

                                  WARNER 
 
                It will make no difference. Why don t 

                you try talking to him? 

                                  KATHERINE 
 
                  (YELLING) Because I m too shy and 

                  wonderful to get mad at other people! 

                I can only get mad at you!

      ELI HANDS WARNER A BOTTLE OF WINE. 
 
                                  WARNER 

                Nice. Very nice. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                It better be the best wine you ever 

                tasted. It was $27! 

                                  ELI 
 
                Dad! Shut up! You don t know 

                anything about what wine costs. 

                                  DAVID 
 
                I know it costs enough that you could 

                have bought 1,300 paperclips instead 

                of that wine. 

      ELI LOOKS MORTIFIED.  34.

                Grow up?! I have grown up! I have a 

                job! Do you? No, you have a shopping 

                bag with two pairs of underwear in it. 

                Great job, dad. Way to grow up!

      INT. ELI S APARTMENT - EVENING 
      ELI, DAVID, EDNA 
 
      DAVID SITS ON THE COUCH WITH HIS FEET UP, DRINKING A SODA AND 
      WATCHING A BRITISH DOCUMENTARY ON THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS. 
 
                                    BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.) 

                And so, this new wave of anti-semitism 

                led to what became known as the 

                Granada Massacre of 1066-- 
 
      ELI ENTERS. HE AND DAVID EXCHANGE A GLANCE IN SILENCE, 
      NEITHER WILLING TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE PREVIOUS NIGHT S FIGHT. 
      ELI THROWS HIS BAG DOWN ON A NEARBY TABLE AND EXITS INTO HIS 
      ROOM TO CHANGE FOR HIS UPCOMING DATE. DAVID CLEARS HIS 
      THROAT LOUDLY.  41. 
 
 

                                    BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.) 

                Some 1500 Jewish families were 

                  slaughtered and those left behind were 

                forced to pay the newly imposed poll 

                tax for the deceased-- 

      ELI RE-ENTERS SILENTLY IN HIS BOXERS AND A T-SHIRT. HE 
      STANDS BEHIND DAVID WHO CONTINUES TO WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY ON 
      THE COUCH. ELI MIMES CHOKING DAVID, AND SILENTLY SCREAMS 
       GET OUT!  HE PULLS OUT HIS OWN HAIR. DAVID TURNS AND ELI IS 
      SUDDENLY STILL, PRETENDING TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING. DAVID 
      TURNS BACK TO THE TV AND ELI MIMES MORE MURDEROUS GESTURES. 
 
                                    BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.) 

                In many ways, the event was mirrored 

                in 1840 by what is commonly known as 

                the Damascus Affair, in which middle- 

                eastern Jews were blamed for the 

                  disappearance of a French monk and his 

                scribe. 

      ELI CONTINUES TO MIME VIOLENT ACTS BEHIND DAVID. WHILE HE IS 
      DOING THIS, EDNA SNEAKS IN BEHIND ELI AND SILENTLY TAKES A 
      LONG SLUG FROM A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. SHE THEN EXITS, DUSTING 
    A POTTED PLANT ON HER WAY OUT. ELI LOSES STEAM, HANGS HIS 
      HEAD AND HEADS BACK INTO HIS ROOM. 
 
                                    BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.) 

                Once again, the Jews were forced to 

                gather what meager possessions they

                I was trying to set it to record  The 

                Golden Age of Airships  , and (GETTING 

                ANGRY) the damn thing went absolutely 

                crazy and I think it erased 

                  everything. And I also was unable to 

                record my show. God!

                hitting on this girl from the group is 

                gonna mess things up. 

                                  ELI 

                  Actually, you already did that with

                I don t care. I m just so excited 

                that he s leaving tonight. This is

                You should be a little more grateful 

                to your dad. You know he had to have 

                sex in the 1970 s so that you could 

                exist. And there (THEN, ENUNCIATING) 

                weren t much personal grooming back

                Gross. They probably did it on brown 

                paisley sheets, too. 

                                  WARNER 
 
                Yeah, and some guy that looks like 

                Joaquin Phoenix with big sideburns was 

                probably peaking in through the 

                window. 
 
 
 ELI 
  
                Creepy.  
 
                                  WARNER 
 

                Yeah, and he has a shotgun, and then 

                he breaks in and your dad had to fight 

                off Joaquin Phoenix guy just so he 

                could finish with your mom and create 

                you.

      WE SEE A FLASHBACK OF ELI HAPPILY SINGING IN HIS CAR WHILE 
      STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT IN THE AIRPORT. AFTER A BEAT, A TAXI

                Well, the truth is, there s no home to 

                go back to. I couldn t make the last 

                few payments on the condo and the bank 

                took it back. 

                                  ELI

                Do you have any idea how humiliating 

                that is? I mean, yes, I m your dad, 

                but I m also a human being with pride. 

                I couldn t do that to either of us.

                it s just sometimes I feel like you re 

                rooting for me to fail, and that s

                me.

                regarded in the business community,

                Guys, I think I fixed your racial 

                blunder with the Chinese. 

                                  ELI 
 
                What?! That s awesome! 
 
                                  WARNER 

                How did you do it? 

                                  VERONICA 
 
                You remember Timmy, the translator, 

                right?  55. 
 
 

                                  VERONICA (CONT D) 

                Let s just say I wrecked him in the 

                bedroom like a panda wrecks bamboo if 

                a panda was having crazy sex with 

                bamboo. 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Nice! Gross. But nice. 
 
                                  VERONICA 

                No big deal. It was China penis, so 

                it was like wrecking a furious baby s 

                toe. 
 

                                  ELI 
 
                Okay, that was just gross. But...

                                  WARNER/ELI

                                  VERONICA 
 
                They said they wanted to do an initial 

                  investment of $50 million. 

                                    WARNER/ELI 
 

                Oh. My. God. 
 
      THEY ALL JUMP UP AND DOWN AS THEY HUG. SUDDENLY CRAWFORD IS 
      PART OF THE HUG.
