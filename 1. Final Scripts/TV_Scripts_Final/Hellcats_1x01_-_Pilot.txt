      MONTAGE

    Hot ChelleRae wails "I Like To Dance" over FAST-CUT SHOTS of 
      collegiate cheerleaders in action throughout history.  We 
      start with the all-male  yell squads  of the early 1900 s-- 
      muscular dudes in uncomfortable-looking letter sweaters with 
    the distinctive Green and Gold school colors of Memphis  
      LANCER UNIVERSITY.

      These historical images INTERCUT and V.O. LAP WITH TALKING 
      HEADS, current young cheerleaders in contemporary Hellcat 
      uniforms, short skirts, sexy midriff-exposed tops on the 
      girls, muscle shirts on the guys.  

      TALKING HEAD: SIERRA SLOANE(21), a petite and peppy Texan 
      with fierce intensity.

                                  SIERRA
                    The Lancer Hellcats are the oldest 
                      competitive cheer squad in the 
                    country.  I m here for the legacy.

    Now it s the 1920 s.The first-ever female cheerleaders in 
      flapper haircuts, wearing long buttoned cardigans over 
      turtlenecks.  Still looks pretty damn uncomfortable.

      TALKING HEAD: ALICE VANDEMARK(20), a willowy beauty with 
      jaded New York cool.  

                                  ALICE
                    I m in it for the competition.  
                    Knowing I m the best.  Good 
                    training for the real world.  Plus 
                    Memphis has the best music.

    We next move into the 1970 sand 80 s, and see footage of 
      organized CO-ED COMPETITIONS.  The athleticism becomes more 
      pronounced and the stunts become breathtakingly dangerous.  
      Muscular guys ( bases ) toss acrobatic girls ( flyers ) into 
    the air, balance them on palms, etc.  It s hard, grueling 
      work.  These girls have calf muscles like marble. 

      TALKING HEAD: LUIS FAMOSA(19), Cuban, easy and laid-back, 
      seriously unserious.If he weren t doing this, he d probably 
    be surfing.

                                  LUIS
                    My frat buddies dared me to try out 
                    as a joke.  
                                  (MORE)          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           2.

                                  LUIS (CONT'D)
                    It turned out to be the hardest 
                    thing I ve ever done, harder than 
                    football and wrestling.  That s 
                    what I love about it.   

      BEAUTY SHOTS of the Hellcats working out in a gym.  Serious 
      sweat and sinew, befitting serious athletes.  These aren t 
      your typical high school cupcake cheerleaders.

                                  LUIS (CONT D)
                    Plus, I get to look up girls  
                    skirts all day --   
                          (living the dream)
                    -- Viviendoel sue o.

      TALKING HEAD: PATTY  THE WEDGE  WEDGERMAN(20), ballsy, 
      fearless, cheerfully profane.

                                  WEDGE
                    The Hellcats are a family.  A loud, 
                      ball-busting, occasionally 
                    incestuous family.  My kinda
                    people.

    Now we re into the LATE 1990 s.We see former Hellcat star 
      (and current coach) VANESSA HODGE, in her early 20 sdoing 
      amazing tumbling stunts in competition.  The Hellcats win.  
      CLOSE ON smile Vanessa, waving the victory trophy, having the 
      time of her life with her celebrating teammates.   

      TALKING HEAD - SIERRA

                                  SIERRA
                    I m also here to learn from our 
                    coach Vanessa Hodge, who led the 
                    Hellcats to a four year winning 
                    streak way back when she was cheer 
                    captain.  
                            (suddenlyworried)
                    I said  way  back.  It makes her 
                    sound old.  You ll edit that out, 
                    right? 

      TALKING HEAD - VANESSA, now somewhere around age 32 wearing 
      athletic attire.  She s an elegant, striking African-
      American, a tough but loving taskmistress.

                                  VANESSA
                    Don t tell me they re not athletes.  
                    Our bases hold 250 pounds on their 
                    shoulders.  Our flyers get launched 
                    25 feet for basket tosses.

                                  VANESSA (CONT'D)
                    Our tumblers take passes that could 
                    get them into the Olympics.  But 
                    they choose Lancer.

    Now we whip past the sights and sounds of Memphis.  Musicians 
      buskon BealeStreet.  Pretty people make the scene on the 
      Highland Strip.  The Redbirds play AutoZonePark.  Barbecue 
      everywhere you look.   

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    They choose to sweat.  To bleed.  
                    To push themselves to the breaking 
                    point.  They choose to compete, win 
                    and find out first-hand what it 
                    feels like to be a champion.  

    And finally the bustling campus of Lancer itself.  Lush green 
      lawns, grand Jeffersonianarchitecture, diverse student body. 

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    See you at nationals -- we will be 
                    the ones holding the large-ass 
                    trophy!

      EXT. LANCER CAMPUS - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

      Late afternoon practice.  The Hellcats jam through their 
      paces.  Vanessa barks orders from the sidelines. 

                                  VANESSA
                    Sierra!  Squeeze tighter -- you re 
                    making Darwin work too hard!  

      ANGLE ON:  A SMALL GROUP OF TOWNIES, 

      hanging out under the bleachers with nothing better to do 
      than drink beer and watch the cheerleaders practice. 

                                  VANESSA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    You wanna make the castle, you 
                    gotta get your head in it!

    The only girl in the group is MARTY BERGER (21).  She s a 
      townie too, but the pile of textbooks beside her tell us 
      she s also a student.  Marty is wicked smart, an acerbic 
      outsider.            "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           4.


      She s also athletic, but covers it with a punky, Gwen Stefani
      vibe-- light years from the conventionally pretty 
      cheerleaders across the field.  She s shooting the shitwith 
    DAN PATCH (24), a shambling charmer.  

                                  DAN 
                    What makes a person decide to 
                    become a cheerleader?

                                  MARTY 
                    Science.  Over time, all that pep 
                    builds up pressure.  If they don t 
                    vent, their heads explode. 

      Vanessa blows her whistle.  The Hellcats form a human pyramid 
      with flyers being thrown into position by the bases.

                                  MARTY (CONT D (CONT D)
                    I don t trust any culture that 
                    builds pyramids, human or 
                    otherwise.  Egyptians enslaved the 
                    Jews, Aztecs did human 
                      sacrifices... 

                                  DAN
                    Freemasons put pyramids on money.  
                    And gave Dan Brown something to 
                    write a lame book about.  

                                  MARTY
                    They ve earned their spot in 
                    hell...  

      Marty eyes Sierra doing a  shoulderstand,  a difficult stunt 
    in which her base tosses her into the air and catches her on 
    his shoulders to form the next level of the pyramid.  

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    ...Right next to the cheerleaders. 

      Marty aims an imaginary bow and arrow at the pyramid, which 
    is three cheerleaders high.  It s pretty damn impressive.  

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Okay, Patch.  Call it.

                                  DAN
                    Mmmm... Ponytail chick.  I want her 
                    head above my mantel.

                                  MARTY
                    You want her head in your lap.           "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           5.


                                  DAN
                          (mock shock)
                    Marty.  My delicate sensibilities.

                                  MARTY
                    Do not actually exist.

      Marty lets fly with her imaginary arrow.

    The pony-tailed cheerleader, Alice, shoulderstands, 
      completing the pyramid.  Suddenly, she SLIPS --  

    -- creating the illusion that Marty s  arrow  has just 
      toppled the pyramid.  Which has just happened. 

      Marty gasps.  Dan and the slacker dudes bust a gut laughing 
    as the surprised Hellcats extricate themselves from an 
      unseemly tangle of well-toned arms and legs.

                                  DAN
                    Marty shot the cheerleaders!  
                    Outstanding!  Who s next?  The 
                    mayor?  Can t shoot the president 
                    anymore, he s cool.

                                  MARTY
                    Knock it off.  That girl is hurt.

      Marty points.  Alice rolls on the ground, holding her arm, in 
      pain.  Dan shoves her playfully.

                                  DAN
                    Smile.  They re only cheerleaders.


      EXT. BERGER HOME - DAY

    A modest row home, adjacent to campus.  Marty zips up on a 
      bike, chains it to the mailbox and grabs the mail.  She wears 
      ear-buds.  Ludacris s How Low  pounds from Marty s iPod.


      INT. BERGER HOME - DAY

      MUSIC CONTINUES.  PAN ALONG an ego wall:  Framed photos, 
      plaques and ribbons of Marty in her younger days as an award-
      winning gymnast.  Marty on the balance beam, Marty on the 
      uneven parallel bars.  Nothing recent though.      

      FIND MARTY, curled up on the sofa, bobbing her head to music 
    as she studies.  The decor cues us that this isn t a dorm or 
    any type of student housing.  Marty lives here with her 
      single mom whom we ll meet shortly.  Marty eats leftover take-
    out and highlights passages in a Pre-Law textbook.            "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           6.


    She shuts the book, her brain full.  She carries the takeout 
      container to the kitchen and dumps it, still grooving to the 
      music.  She s got some fierce moves for a skinny white girl.  

    She notes the unopened mail.  Bills.  Marty picks up her 
      mom s checkbook.  Time to deal with life.  

      TIME CUT.  Marty pays bills, carefully noting the balance in 
    the checkbook ledger.  She opens an envelope from the 
      University.  She reads the contents.  Her face falls.

                                  MARTY
                    No.  No!  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      EXT. LANCER CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

      Marty bikes along the path, weaving expertly around 
      pedestrians.  She s a girl on a mission.  She pulls up to the 
      University Center, drops her bike and runs inside.


      INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

    A place where students hang out.  School store, game room, 
      lounge and the campus pub.  Marty heads downstairs to...


      INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER - PUB - MOMENTS LATER

    A rathskeller type snack bar that serves food and drinks.  
      Marty s mother WANDA tends bar.  Wanda is a party girl who 
      never quite grew up.  Marty s the parent in the relationship.

                                  MARTY
                    Mom, what is this?

      Marty slams down the notice.

                                  WANDA
                    Oh.  You weren t supposed to see 
                    that.  They send those to scare you 
                    into paying.  Are you hungry?

                                  MARTY
                    It says my scholarship was 
                    cancelled.  Last semester!  

                                  WANDA
                    The university cut back fringes for 
                    university employees.            "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           7.


                                  MARTY
                    Fringe?  My scholarship is not 
                    fringe!  It is central to my life.

                                  WANDA
                    It ll be fine.  The union says they 
                    can t pull scholarships from 
                    enrolled students. 

                                  MARTY
                    But they did!  

                                  WANDA
                    Yes, but they can t.  

                                  MARTY
                    But they did!

                                  WANDA
                    See, they can t.  The union is 
                    taking them to court and 
                      everything.   

                                  MARTY
                    And how long will thattake?!

                                  WANDA
                    You re the one studying law.  Why 
                    not ask one of your professors?

      Marty swallows her exasperation.  Deep breath.

                                  MARTY
                    This bill is three months past due.  
                    I ve got a week to pay or I m 
                    barred from classes.  

                                  WANDA
                    They say that to scare you.

                                  MARTY
                    It worked!

                                  WANDA
                    I didn t tell you because I didn t 
                    want you to worry.  Everything 
                    works out eventually.  You ll see.

      Marty walks away, beyond frustrated.  Wanda calls after.

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    You sure I can t fix you something

      INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

    A hand writes  HEALING  on a bare arm in sharpie.  The scribe 
    is Sierra, whom we re finally meeting up close and personal.

                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                    Sure it will.

    The arm being written on, belongs to Alice, the cheerleader 
    who fell.  Her hand is in a hard splint.  She s in a bitchy 
      mood.  Maybe it s the pain... or maybe it s just her.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Wish you could have inspired Luis 
                    not to land on my friggin  hand.

      Luis, looks up from stowing gear and smiles, unruffled.  We 
      can t help but notice he s ripped -- tossing girls into the 
    air is apparently great exercise.  

                                  LUIS
                    You slipped and knocked down the 
                    pyramid.  And I m the bad guy 
                    because I fellon you?

                                  ALICE
                    It was clumsy.  You don t pay 
                    attention and it shows.

                                  LUIS
                    Reality de la Alice.

      Helping Luis stow equipment is Patty, whom we also met 
      briefly.  She s a female  base.   Unlike petite flyers Sierra 
    and Alice, Wedge is big and beautiful, like a plus-size 
      model.  Utterly comfortable in her own skin.  She grins, 
      never one to pass up an opportunity to bust balls.

                                  WEDGE
                    Relax, Luis.  It s just her 
                    bitterness talking. 

                                  ALICE
                    I m not bitter.

                                  WEDGE

                                  ALICE
                    Uh, I dumped him.

                                  LUIS
                    Not how I remember it.  

      Luis manages to say things like this without coming off mean.  
      He s clueless, not callous.

                                  WEDGE
                    She fell, maybe hit her head.  
                    Retrograde memory loss happens.  

                                  ALICE
                    Wish I could be giving you both the 
                    finger right now.  Oh wait, I have 
                    two hands.  Yay.

    She lifts her other hand, but Sierra stops her from giving 
      Luis the finger.

                                  SIERRA
                    No more negativity.

                    Accomplishes More. 

      Alice scowls and jerks her arm away.

                                  ALICE
                    You re a circus freak.  

      Alice scrubs her arm with a washcloth.

    An exit to the locker rooms, another to the corridor.  
      Vanessa works a schedule on a computer.  BILL CURRAN (60 s), 
      crusty, head of the Lancer athletic department, walks up with 
      football coach RED IRVINE (30 s), a handsome rogue who never 
      lost the boyishness of youth.

                    You know he s been taking trustees 
                    out for fancy dinners, trying to 
                    get you fired.  

                                  VANESSA
                    By blaming me for injuries?  Rhia
                    threw her back out moving a desk.

                    The trustees are a bunch of 
                    stubborn old men.  They believe 
                    what they wanna believe.  What is 
                    it with you and Red anyway?

                                  VANESSA
                    It s ancient history, and has no 
                    bearing on the job.  I ve loved 
                    this squad since I was a Hellcat, 
                    and we will make it great again.

                                  CURRAN
                    Well, hurry the hell up.  If the

                    This is my second semester on the 
                    job.  I ve got to build a 
                      foundation.  Whatever happened to a 
                    honeymoon period?

                                  CURRAN
                    The squad s on a five year losing 
                    streak.  The trustees aren t 
                    feeling very charitable.  

    He exits out to the corridor.

                                  SIERRA (O.S.)
                    We can place at nationals.

      Vanessa whirls around.  She didn t realize Luis, Sierra and 
    the Wedge were in the doorway to the locker room, listening.  

                                  VANESSA
                    How long you been standing there?

                    Relax, half the athletic department

                                  VANESSA
                    That s great.  Really fantastic.

                    I don t see how we even get past 
                      qualifiers.  I hear Southern 
                    Christian is on fire this year.  
                    And with Alice out, Sierra s our 
                    only decent flyer.

                    We ll find someone even better.  

                                  WEDGE
                    Like who?

                                  SIERRA
                    I ll schedule tryouts for the end 
                    of the week.  Hellcats!  Hellcats!

      INT. LANCER CAMPUS - BURSAR S OFFICE - DAY (DAY2)

      Marty sits with a FINANCIAL OFFICER who scans her records.  
      He s sympathetic, but a bit clueless.

                                  OFFICER
                    So until last semester, you were 
                      beneficiary of our scholarship 
                    program for children of university 
                    employees.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           13.


                                  MARTY
                    Yeah, my mom works at the UC pub.  

                                  OFFICER
                    That was an ugly cut.  Hurt a lot 
                    of students.  One option is a 
                    student loan...  
                          (hands her a form)
                    It requires a co-signer.  Does your 
                    Mom have a decent credit rating?

      Marty laughs bitterly and hands back the form.

                                  MARTY
                    Like I said, she works at the UC
                    Pub.  What else ya got?

    The Officer pulls out another form.

                                  OFFICER
                    You can fill out a FAFSA.  Try for 
                    some government aid.

      Marty looks at the form.

                                  MARTY
                    This is due October 1.  That was 
                    last week.

                                  OFFICER
                    You ll be applying for next year.  

                                  MARTY
                    Next year?  What do I do till then?

                                  OFFICER
                    Take a nice vacation.  See the 
                    world.  Travel broadens you.  

                                  MARTY
                    You have to understand.  I ve been 
                    taking care of my mother since my 
                    dad left eleven years ago.  I wash 
                    her clothes, I make sure she s fed.  
                    I buck her up when her heart gets 
                    broken, which is basically always.  
                    I pay bills, work weekends.  Do you 
                    know what gets me through?

                                  OFFICER
                    If it s drugs, don t tell me.  I m 
                    obligated to report it.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           14.


                                  MARTY
                    Hope.  The hope that I can graduate 
                    from a decent school, move far, far
                    away and live like a normal person.  
                    Kill my hope and you kill me.  I 
                    have to stay in school.

    The Officer shrugs, at a loss.

                                  OFFICER
                    As I said, we have a lot of 
                    students in the same boat.  Our 
                      discretionary funds are long gone.  
                    I wish you d come to us sooner.

      Marty nods, devastated.  

                                  MARTY
                    I wish I d knownsooner.

                                  OFFICER
                    If it helps, there are some niche 
                      scholarships.  Odd little things 
                    from speciality groups.  There s a 
                    catalog outside.


      INT. BURSAR S OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Marty glumly thumbs through a catalogue.  She gripes to a 
      bored RECEPTIONIST.

                                  MARTY 
                    Oh, great.  They have a scholarship 
                    for students with the last name of 
                    Van Valkenberg... one for people 
                    fluent in Klingon... and one for 
                    those interested in pursuing a 
                    career in the potato industry.  I 
                    don t know where to start.

    The receptionist looks up, tired of listening.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    If you flip to the back, there s 
                    one for very sarcastic people.

                                  MARTY
                    Glad you can find joy in your job.

    As Marty continues to flip through the catalogue and take 
      notes, Sierra enters.  She pins a bright neon flyer 
      announcing  CHEERLEADER TRYOUTS  to a public bulletin board.  
    The receptionist brightens when she sees her.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           15.


                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Hey Sierra.  Hellcats taking us to 
                    nationals this season?

                                  SIERRA
                    You know it, Mona.

      Sierra plops a folder onto the counter, festively bound with 
    a vinyl cover and colorful ribbons for brads.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I m dropping off my scholarship 
                    papers for Mr. Rabin.  Can you see 
                    that he gets it?

      Marty looks up, suddenly interested.

                                  MARTY
                    You applying for a scholarship?

                                  SIERRA
                    I have one now.  For cheerleading.

                                  MARTY
                      Cheerleading. 

                                  SIERRA
                    It comes with being a Hellcat.  
                    They need us fierce and focused.  
                    Eye on the prize.

                                  MARTY
                    There s a scholarship for 
                      cheerleading?For being a football 
                    groupie?  
                            (toreceptionist)
                    Did you know about this?

                                  SIERRA
                    You did not just call me a groupie.  

                                  MARTY
                    Nothing personal against you.  

                                  SIERRA
                    It doesn t get more personal than 
                    calling someone a groupie.

                                  MARTY
                    Groupies jump up and down in skimpy 
                    outfits screaming adulation for 
                    masculine fantasy figures.  Beyond 
                    that, we re splitting hairs.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           16.


      Sierra gasps with indignation.

                                  SIERRA
                    Take that back.

                                  MARTY
                    What are we, in grade school?  I 
                    call no take-backs.

      Sierra steps forward, pissed.

                                  SIERRA
                    Don t make me come down off this 
                    porch.  I will.

                                  MARTY
                    Are you actually threatening me?  
                      Physically?  

                                  SIERRA
                    We are an NCA competitive sport.  
                    We spend twenty hours a week 
                      practicing. We bench press twice 
                    our body weight and run a seven 
                    minute mile. We compete with broken 
                    thumbs and twisted ankles smiling 
                    through the pain.  We are athletes!

                                  MARTY
                    Back in Dollywood, maybe.

      Sierra tries to slap Marty, but Marty catches her hand.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Wouldn t you rather get right to 
                    the hair-pulling?

      Sierra wrenches her arm free, incensed.

                                  SIERRA
                    I m not letting some grubby little 
                    gothinsult the Lancer Hellcats! 

                SIERRA (CONT D)MARTY
    And you d best be afraid, Oh my god, did you just call 
      because I ve got me a squad me  goth?   You don t even 
    of lean, hard champions that know what goth is, you 
      will troop on down to peroxide whack-job.  Yeah, 
      whatever gas station you work let s have a cheerleader gang 
    at and knock that smart mouth war!  I ll text some of my 
      clean off your face!brooding vampire cronies and 
                                                  we can all throw down!

      Both girls are breathing hard.  They ve stopped the room.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           17.


                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    Everyone s staring.

                                  MARTY
                    We should leave quietly.

                                  SIERRA
                    Count of three.

      They silently count, turn and exit in opposite directions.  
    As she exits, Marty notes THE FLYER for cheer tryouts.  Ugh.  


      EXT. VIDEO STORE - DAY

      Marty stands outside a video store with her bike, 
      deliberating, agonizing.  Making a decision, she enters...

      TIME CUT -- Marty emerges from the store, DVD in a bag.


      INT. BERGER HOME - DAY

      Marty enters, locks door, closes blinds, making sure she s 
      alone.  Then she pops out the DVD and sticks it into the 
      player.  WE FIND the title of the movie:   BRING IT ON. 

    She moves furniture, clears space in the middle of the room.

    As the movie begins, Marty imitates the cheerleader moves.  
    She does a standing back flip and knocks a lamp into one of 
    her framed gymnastics photos.  She rights the lamp, surprised 
    as we are that she can still pull it off.  Off her grim 
      resolve...

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT ONE        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           18.


                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      EXT. SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

    Big cross and a banner  HOME OF THE CYCLONES.  The CYCLONES, 
    a group of perfect white Christian cheerleaders in perfect 
      white uniforms practice routines.  They re more 
      conservatively dressed, way less sexy than the Hellcats, and 
      show zero ethnic diversity.  It s like watching the Osmonds 
    in their heyday.  Their guys are huge, way more powerful than 
    the Luis, Wedge and the Hellcat bases we ve seen in action.     

      REVEAL THE WEDGE

      She s on the sidelines, surreptitiously videotaping the 
      rehearsal.  A SECURITY GUARD hurries up.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    What are you doing?  

    He grabs her camera, takes out the tape.

                                  WEDGE
                    I m sorry, sir.  Is there a policy?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Cheerleaders come from other 
                    schools, steal routines.

                                  WEDGE
                    Are you making fun of me? Does this 
                    look like a cheerleader s body?  

    She slaps her butt, making the guard uncomfortable.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Oh, I didn t mean anything by it.

                                  WEDGE
                    I just wanted to get some footage 
                    of the Cyclones to show at our 
                    potluck this Sunday.  All the girls 
                    at my church are huge fans. 
                          (pointsto cheerleaders)
                    See Donny?  One there at the end?  
                    He s so cute.  I would totally
                    abstain from having sex with him.

    She eyes the tape hopefully.  The guard sighs and returns it.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           19.


                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Go on.  Get out of here.

                                  WEDGE
                    Thank you, sir!

      Wedge runs off, smiling to herself.  Sucker.


      INT. LANCER ATHLETIC CENTER - VANESSA S OFFICE - DAY

      Luis, Sierra, Wedge, Alice and Vanessa, all in uniform.  ON 
      VIDEO, they watch the Cyclones rehearse, dismayed.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Their elevators are flawless. 

                                  SIERRA
                    I can t go half that high.

                                  ALICE
                    It s not you.  Those guys are 
                    monsters.  
                          (a bitchy look at Luis)
                    I wish ourbases had that power.

                                  LUIS
                    They re probably juiced.

                                  SIERRA
                    It s a Christian University.  They 
                    don t take drugs.

                                  WEDGE
                    Or drink.  Or dance.  Or get laid.  

                                  ALICE
                    Jesus is the wind beneath their 
                    skirts.

                                  VANESSA
                    Well, it s clear we can t out-power 
                    them.  So we ll need another angle.  
                    Something to set us apart.

                                  SIERRA
                    And fast. Qualifiers are in a week.

                                  VANESSA
                    We ve got our work cut out for us.

      A hunkybase named DARWIN (23), Asian, sticks his head in.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           20.


                                  DARWIN
                    The wannabes are done learning the 
                    steps.  They re waiting for you.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Let s pray for a ringer.

      Vanessa grabs a clip board and the gang exits...


      EXT. LANCER CAMPUS - PRACTICE FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

    A sign:  HELLCAT TRYOUTS TODAY.   

      Nervous HOPEFULS sit in the bleachers, waiting for their turn 
    to try out.  Each has a big numbered sticker on their back so 
    the judges can take notes.

      Alice and Sierra are seated, the judges.  Luis, Wedge and 
      some ND HELLCATS are in position.  Vanessa addresses the 
      hopefuls.

                                  VANESSA
                    I am Coach Vanessa Hodge.  At the 
                    table is cheer captain Sierra Sloan 
                    and her secondary Alice Vandemark. 
                    We need flyers for airborne stunts, 
                    so I hope you brought your A-game.  
                    You ve had a chance to run the 
                    routine, so let s see who among you 
                    has what it takes to be a Hellcat!

    The hopefuls jump up, cheering and whooping, lousy with 
      ersatz spirit.  More laid back is

      MARTY -- at the top of the bleachers with Dan.  She s dressed 
    in Converse sneaks, sweats and a  HOME TAPING IS KILLING 
      MUSIC  T-shirt.  She wears a sign identifying her as  #26. 

      Marty rises to join the other hopefuls.

                                  DAN
                    You realize this is insane.  

                                  MARTY
                    Painfully aware, thank you.  

      Luis calls up to Marty.  

                                  LUIS
                    Move, #26! Stragglers will be shot!

      He s smiling, so it s okay.  Marty heads down.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           21.


                                  DAN
                    Don t trip, #26!

      Marty ignores him.  Dan laughs.

      ANGLE ON JUDGE TABLE

      Marty passes Sierra.  Both girls recognize one another.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh God, you re a judge.

                                  SIERRA
                          (cold)
                    Captain, actually.  Good luck.

      Luis ushers the stunned Marty.  

                                  LUIS
                    C mon, 26, take your place.

      Marty takes her position, presumably doomed.  

                                  ALICE
                    You know that one? 

                                  SIERRA
                    I tried to slap her yesterday.  She 
                    has fast hands.

    As the girls gather on the mat and space themselves out, 
      Vanessa flips on Lady Gaga s JUST DANCE.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Five, six, seven, eight!

    The hopeful cheerleaders move in unison to the music.  

      Girls HANDSPRING backwards across the mats, flashing blinding 
      white teeth, smiling like their lives depended on it.  

      Heads bob mechanically, arms SHOOT up in V-formation.  They 
      bound off the mat and straddle their legs in a TOE TOUCH 
      JUMP, then land in a tucked position.

      TIGHTER SHOTS on individual girls.  Some are good, some not.  
    One looks like a stripper.  One is great but appears to be 
    12.  One has a great body, hideous face.  More than one girl 
      falls on her ass.  One aspiring flyer appears to be a dude.  
      Sierra, Vanessa and Alice react like  American Idol  judges.  

                                  ALICE
                    Someone put 11 out of my misery.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           22.


                                  VANESSA
                    Oh, I can t watch this.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Is that... an adam sapple?

      While the group shake their hips and glide two steps to the 
      RIGHT, Marty glides to the LEFT and COLLIDES with another 
      girl.  Shit.She struggles to regain her footing.    

    The girls take two steps forward for another TOE TOUCH.  But 
      Marty is a half step late.  Her rhythm thrown off.  

                                  ALICE 
                    Don t worry about 26.  She s toast. 

    But Vanessa s had her eye on Marty, too.  She s not so quick 
    to dismiss her potential.  She shouts -- 

                                  VANESSA
                    26!  Relax!  Count it out.  

      Marty picks the steps up and is back in the line with the 
      others.  But three counts later, she steps RIGHT, when she 
      should step LEFT.  Alice and Sierra exchange scornful looks.

                                  ALICE
                    Hopeless.  

    IN THE BLEACHERS -- Dan buries his head in his hands.  Yikes.

                                  VANESSA
                    Chill, 26!  Just have fun!

      Marty pauses for a beat.  A deep breath, then...

      Suddenly, she s doing her own thing.  A mash-up of styles: 
    she ISOLATES and POPS her chest and shoulders in the style of 
      krumping, she LEAPS into the air, legs aloft, graceful as 
      anything George Balanchineever staged. 

                                  ALICE 
                    What the hell is she doing?

                                  VANESSA
                    She s dancing.

                                  SIERRA
                    That is not what we do.

                                  VANESSA
                    No.  It is not.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           23.


      Marty does a PERFECT PIROUETTE, then CRASHES into a gutsy 
      break-dance move: a one ARMED PIKE FREEZE - both legs 
      suspended in air, parallel to the ground.  One hand supports 
    her body weight, free hand reaching out toward her toes.   

      Marty s body is FROZEN for a few beats as she waits for the 
      judges to pick their jaws off the floor.  Marty bends her 
      knees and KICKS OUT, propels herself upright to standing.  

                                  ALICE
                    She doesn t know the choreography.  

    But Vanessa is riveted.  Marty s dangerous, sexy performance 
    is intense -- more  top model  than zippy cheerleader.

                                  SIERRA
                    And what s with the facials?  She s 
                    not smiling, she doesn t look 
                    happy.  A cheerleader never pouts.

    A switch has flipped inside Marty.  She executes a perfect 
      tumbling pass: ROUND OFF, BACK HANDSPRING, BACK FLIP.  

      Luis leaps out of his seat and cheers -- that rocked!

                                  LUIS
                    Yeah!

      Propelled by her body s momentum, Marty finishes off with a 
    360 DEGREE TWISTING ROTATION (known as a  full  in cheer 
      parlance) in the air, legs straight as a metal rod.  She 
      lands effortlessly.     

                                  SIERRA
                    Oh my god.  Did she just do a Full?  
                    It took me six months to hit that.  

      Alice purses her lips, unimpressed.  

                                  ALICE
                    Well, that s you.

    The routine wraps up and the girls jump in the air, land on 
    the mat with a loud THUD in SPLITS.  Marty looks around, 
      realizes she s behind, JUMPS and also lands in line, in 
      perfect splits.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Nice work.  Take a breather.  

    The group dissipates.  Marty passes Luis.  

                                  LUIS
                    Where dyou pick up those moves?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           24.


                                  MARTY
                    Townie bars.  Been going since I 
                    was sixteen.  We close down 
                    Republic every Saturday night.

      Marty shoots a look at Vanessa, Sierra and Alice conferring.  
    She looks like she s gonnabe sick. 

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    So, Captain Blondieover there --?

                                  LUIS
                    Sierra.

                                  MARTY
                    Can the other two outvote her?

                                  LUIS
                    I guess.  Why?  

                                  MARTY
                    No reason.  

                                  LUIS
                    I know she nearly crappedherself 
                    when you landed the Full.  

                                  MARTY
                    Landed the what?  

                                  LUIS
                    Mami, you are green. 

      From high above, Dan watches the muscle-bound cheer-jock 
      flirt with Marty.  He s not thrilled.

      JUDGE S TABLE

      They go through the list and compare notes.

                                  VANESSA
                    Next is #26.  

                                  ALICE
                    No way.   

                                  VANESSA
                    I like the crazy dancing thing.  

                                  ALICE
                    It s weird.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           25.


                                  VANESSA
                    It s different.  We need to mix it 
                    up or Southern kills us at 
                      qualifiers.  Sierra?

      Sierra doesn t answer.

                                  ALICE
                    Hello, Sierra?

    Off Sierra s indecision...


      INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER

    A huddle of expectant hopefuls.  They allow Sierra respectful 
      distance as she enters and posts a list of who made the cut.  
      Once Sierra is gone, the girls crowd in like guppies vying 
    for a sprinkle of fish food.  Most girls are disappointed, a 
      precious few are elated.  Once they re gone, Marty enters and 
      walks to the list.  Her eyes are closed.  

                                  MARTY
                    And... open.  
                          (eyesstill closed)
                    Open now and... 

      Another beat.  She opens one eye.  Breathes a sigh of relief.  
    Her name is on the list!  Marty looks around to see if anyone 
    is watching, and does an exuberant cartwheel.


      INT. LANCER ATHLETIC CENTER - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

      Alice changes the splint on her hurt hand.  It s tough going 
      one-handed.  Red passes by, sees Alice, enters.

                                  RED
                    Can I help you splint that?

      Alice looks up, shrugs.

                                  ALICE
                    Knock yourself out.

      TIME CUT.  Now Red sits beside Alice, finishing helping her.

                                  RED
                    Me and the boys felt awful when we 
                    heard about your injury.  Ask me, 
                    Vanessa pushes you girls too hard.  
                    Puts the entire program at risk.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           26.


                                  ALICE
                    Accidents happen.  I m just lucky 
                    there was no serious nerve damage.

                                  RED
                    Thank God for that.

                                  ALICE
                    Cuz then I wouldn t be able to feel 
                    your hand.

    She glances down.  Red has his hand on her leg.  

                                  RED
                    Touche. 

    Red smiles and slowly removes his hand. 

                                  ALICE
                    Is this how it works?

                                  RED
                    Mm?

                                  ALICE
                      Compassionate coach reaches out to 
                      impressionable cheerleader, 
                    charming her with his sensitivity 
                    and warmth.  When her head clears, 
                    she s staring at the roof of his 
                      Expedition, panties around her 
                    ankles. 

    Red laughs hard.

                                  RED
                    How da little thing like you get 
                    so cynical?  

                                  ALICE
                    Close proximity to guys like you.  

                                  RED
                    Alice, you are terrific.  I hope 
                    you re back on the field soon.  I 
                    only wish Vanessa saw the same 
                    potential I do.

      This hits a nerve with Alice.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           27.


                                  RED (CONT D)
                    Bumping Sierra to Captain.  You put 
                    two years into the squad, then a 
                    little nobody like Sierra transfers 
                    in from another school and 
                    leapfrogs you?  

                                  ALICE
                          (unconvincing)
                    Sierra s good.  It was Vanessa s 
                    call to make and she made it.

                                  RED
                    Still mustahurt.  

                                  ALICE
                    Yeah, well.  I m happy where I am.

                                  RED
                    Girls like you are never happy 
                    where they are.  Get well soon.

    Red rises and leaves.  Alice stews.


      EXT. LANCER CAMPUS - CHEERTOWN - NIGHT

      Fraternity row.  A hopping scene, good-looking young people 
      socializing, looking to hook up and avoid their studies.

      Wanda s car is parked by one of the houses.  Marty pulls bags 
      from the trunk.  A sign identifies the building as  BARKER 
      HOUSE,  but someone (maybe Sierra) has neatly painted the 
      nickname  CHEERTOWN  above the official name.  

                                  WANDA
                     Cheertown?   

                                  MARTY
                    They force all the cheerleaders to 
                    live here.  It supposedly promotes 
                    spirit.  Rah.

                                  WANDA
                    Well, it seems a waste when our 
                    house is barely off-campus.  

                                  MARTY
                    It keeps me in school.  Do you 
                    understand how close I came to 
                    having to drop out?  The position 
                    you put me in?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           28.


      Wanda ignores the confrontational tone.  We re starting to 
    get the sense she does this willfully.

                                  WANDA
                    What s important is it all worked 
                    out.  I told you there was no 
                    reason to worry.   

      Marty bites her tongue.  Why start a fight?

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    What do you say we celebrate?  
                    We ll drop off your stuff, go out 
                    for ribs, find some guys to buy us 
                    drinks...?  

                                  MARTY
                    After we drop off this stuff, I 
                    have to actually unpack it.  And 
                    get sleep.  Because I have three 
                    hours of classes and three hours of 
                        cheerleadingrehearsal tomorrow.  

                                  WANDA
                    I think they call it practice.

                                  MARTY
                    Whatever they call it, it s going 
                    to kick my ass.  I m still sore 
                    from the audition.  
                          (beforeMom corrects her)
                    Tryout.

                                  WANDA
                    I miss you already.  

    Now Mom s getting weepy.  Perfect. 

                                  MARTY
                    You work on campus.  I see you 
                    every day.  Whereas I am facing a 
                    house full of alien cheerleaders. 
                    If they don t accept me, I ll get 
                    cut from the squad, lose my new 
                      scholarship and end up working the 
                    grease gun at Jiffy Lube. 

                                  WANDA
                    Marty the martyr...

                                  MARTY
                    Yes, I love it when you call me 
                    that.

                    Now if you ll excuse me I have to 
                    go bond or instigate a pillow fight 
                    or something.  I love you, good 
                    night.

      Marty picks up her bags.

                                  WANDA
                    Can I come meet your new friends?

                                  MARTY
                    Good night!

      Marty heads up to the front porch.


      INT. CHEERTOWN - COMMON AREA - SAME TIME

    The Hellcats (usual suspects plus our ND extras) watch a 
      football game, Titans vs.Colts.  Everyone s totally into it. 

      There s a knock at the door.  Alice is closest.  She gets up 
    and answers.  It s Marty with her bags.

                                  ALICE
                    You don t have to knock.  There s a 
                    swipe card for your ID.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh.  Okay.  I m one of the new 
                    girls.  Marty.

                                  ALICE
                    I know who you are.  I voted 
                    against you.  Got overruled.  
                      Democracy s a bitch.

      Alice rejoins the group, leaving Marty with her bags.  

                                  MARTY
                          (under her breath)
                    So are you, apparently.

    The group cheers a play in the game, not noticing Marty.  Off 
      Marty, isolated, uncertain and out of her element...

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT TWO        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           30.


                                          ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      INT. CHEERTOWN - MARTY & SIERRA S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

      Marty enters and throws her bag onto the bed.  This is a 
      double room that has been expanded into a double single.  
      Everything is bright pastel colors and extremely feminine.  

      Marty is a bit repulsed, particularly by the matching 
      coverlets with Lancer logos sewn upon them.  Marty inspects 
    the wall.  Many photos and clippings of Sierra cheerleading
    all the way back to a cheerleader halloweencostume she wore 
    as a toddler.  Along with it are a number of awards, ribbons, 
      etc.  Marty smiles at this ego wall, perhaps reminded of her 
    own back at home. 

      Sierra enters.

                                  SIERRA
                    Hello, Marty. Welcome to Cheertown.

                                  MARTY
                    Can we start over?  I m sorry about 
                    the other day.  I was in a crap 
                    mood, I went looking for a fight...  

                                  SIERRA
                    I ve put that aside.  Vanessa 
                    thinks you can help us beat 
                    Southern Christian next week, and 
                    that s what matters.  That s why I 
                    voted for you.

                                  MARTY
                    You did?  Seriously?  After 
                    everything I said?

                                  SIERRA
                    You can make up for your appalling 
                    rudeness with hard work and 
                      perseverance.

      Marty shrugs, fair enough.  Sierra bustles around opening the 
      closet, drawers, etc.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I ve allocated half of the closet 
                    space for you.  The furniture is 
                    mine, but I prefer the upper 
                    drawers.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           31.


                                  MARTY
                    I m a bottom, myself.

      Sierra stares blankly.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    That s just a joke.

                                  SIERRA
                    Mm, we should come up with a signal 
                    for that to avoid confusion.  I ve 
                    earmarked half of my linens, 
                    coverlets and towels for you.  

                                  MARTY
                    If by coverlet you mean bedspread, 
                    I ve already got one.

                                  SIERRA
                    It s nicer when it matches, don t 
                    you think?  

      It s not up for discussion.  Sierra turns to the desk.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I ve cleaned out a desk for you and 
                    lined it with shelving paper.  What 
                    kind of light bulbs do you like?

      Marty has no answer.  It s going to be a long semester.


      INT. CHEERTOWN - SIERRA & MARTY S ROOM - DAY

      Marty wakes up.  Blearily looks at clock.  7AM.Sierra is 
      already up and dressed.       

                                  SIERRA
                    Morning.  I m off to the gym.  See 
                    you at practice.  We ll fit you for 
                    your new uniform.

      Sierra flounces out.  

                                  MARTY
                    Yaaaaaay.

      Marty drags herself out of bed.


      INT. CHEERTOWN - HALLWAY - DAY

      Marty emerges from her room in a robe carrying a towel and 
      shower kit.  She walks into...          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           32.


      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

        A co-edbathroom.  This is the central room with stalls and 
      sinks, fair game to either gender.  Two doors lead to 
      separate shower rooms for guys and girls.  A couple of guys 
      step out of the men s shower area in towels.       

      Marty opens the door to the girls  shower area.  


      INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER AREA - CONTINUOUS

      Shower stalls with frosted doors.  Patty the Wedge is here, 
      towelling off from a shower, not remotely self-conscious.

                                  WEDGE
                    Yo, Marty.

                                  MARTY
                    Hi.  It s Patty -- right?  

                                  WEDGE
                    Everyone calls me  The Wedge. 

      Alice steps out of the shower and grabs a towel.

                                  ALICE
                    In or out, you re causing a draft.

      Marty s not thrilled by group nudity, but when in Rome.  She 
      enters, hangs up her robe and wraps a towel around herself. 

    She sees Wedge s arm has the word  STRENGTH  written on it.

                                  MARTY
                    What s with all the writing?

                                  WEDGE
                    It s Sierra s thing.  It s supposed 
                    to be an inspirational mnemonic. 

                                  MARTY
                    Does it work?  You look pretty 
                    strong already.

                                  ALICE
                    The Wedge can t afford to coast.  
                    She s barely keeping up with the 
                    guys as it is.  

    But Wedge is too smart to let Alice bait her...         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           33.


                                  WEDGE
                          (to Marty)
                    Like Luis.  He s physically bigger, 
                    so he has more power than me.  
                    You ll get to experience those 
                    steel-belted arms first-hand, since 
                    you re replacing Alice here as his 
                    flyer.  They used to date.  Did you 
                    know that?  It was a big thing when 
                    they broke up.

                                  ALICE
                    This girl is not replacing me.  
                    I ll be back in a month or so.

                                  WEDGE
                    A lot can happen in a month.  
                    Better not coast. 

    The Wedge exits.  Now Marty and Alice are alone.

                                  MARTY
                    Alice.  I understand you didn t 
                    want me.  But I m here now.  I 
                    think we should try -- 

                                  ALICE
                    -- You won t be around long.

                                  MARTY
                    Huh?

                                  ALICE
                    The Hellcats are short on flyers at 
                    a crucial moment.  That sthe only 
                    reason a dangerously inexperienced 
                    outsider got a foot in the door. 

                                  MARTY
                    I tried out like everyone else.

                                  ALICE
                    You re no flyer.  You re petite and 
                    you can move.  That s it.  And the 
                    weirdo dance moves?  Forget it.  
                    You re a tumbler at best, and we ve 
                    got more tumblers than we need.  
                    Once I m back, you ll get bounced.  

                                  MARTY
                    Unless I... oh what s the word... 
                    prove myself.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           34.


                                  ALICE
                    In my experience, when you re done 
                    with a band-aid, you rip it off and 
                    throw it away.  

    A beat.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh, I m the band-aid.  Got it.  
                    Do you invent your own catty 
                    metaphors, or is there a book?  

      Marty steps into the shower.  Alice fumes.  She then notices 
      Marty s robe and towel hanging on a peg.  Alice impulsively 
      grabs both and exits.  


      INT. BATHROOM - LATER

      Back to the common area.  It s empty.  After a beat, we hear:

                                  MARTY (O.S.)
                    Oh, crap! Crap!

      Marty has just noticed her robe and towel are missing.  After 
    a beat, Marty peeks in from the girls  shower room.  We hear 
      some guys showering in the next room.  Marty runs into the 
      common area and peeks out the door to the hallway...   

    HER POVOF HALLWAY:  ND-Hellcats gossip.  Marty looks around, 
      panicked.  There s nothing with which to cover herself!  

    The voices from the shower area grow louder.  Someone s 
      coming!  Marty runs into a bathroom stall and shuts the door.

      INSIDE THE STALL

      Marty perches on the toilet.  We hear the voices of Luis and 
      some ND male Hellcats.

      OUTSIDE THE STALL

      Luis, wearing a towel, checks for feet and opens the door. 

      INSIDE THE STALL

      Marty is hunched on the toilet, pleading with her eyes.

                                  LUIS
                    Wow.  Shower and a show.

                                  MARTY
                            (desperately whispers)
                    Help me.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           35.


      Luis winks, then shuts the door.  Under the stall door, Marty 
    can see his bare feet turn away.  Suddenly, Luis  towel 
      drops.  We hear him yell to his buddies:

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    Yo -- this look crooked to you? 

                                  ND HELLCAT #1 (O.S.)
                    Ugh!  

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    I think maybe I slept on it wrong.  

                                  ND HELLCAT #2 (O.S.)
                          (laughing)
                    Put it away!  

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    I need a splint or something.  Hey, 
                    come back!  I need help!  Dudes!

      Luis  feet kick the towel under the stall door for Marty.  We 
      hear him chase his laughing buddies out into the hall.  
      Scandalized O.S. squealsfrom ND FEMALE HELLCATS as Luis 
      streaks the hall outside.  Marty gratefully grabs the towel.


      EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - UNDER THE BLEACHERS - DAY

      Marty eats takeout with Dan under the bleachers.

                                  DAN
                    So we gonnahit Republic tonight?

                                  MARTY
                    Practice, exam, second exam, more 
                    practice.  You re gonnahave to 
                    seduce Rosalie without me.  

                                  DAN
                    Rosalie s not my type. 

                                  MARTY
                    Your type is a girl who says, 
                     Sure, Dan, I ll sleep with you.   

                                  DAN
                          (shrugs sheepishly)
                    Okay, that s a little true.

                                  MARTY
                    More than a little.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           36.


      Across the field, the Hellcats assemble.  Time for practice.  
      Marty doffs her bomber jacket to reveal a workout sports bra 
    and shorts.  Dan mock-recoils from Marty s exposed rack.  

                                  DAN
                    Jeez, come on, put those things 
                    away.  Are we cheering or hooking?  

                                  MARTY
                    A little of both, actually.  Time 
                    to start earning that scholarship.

    She shoves her jacket into her bag.  

                                  DAN
                    You sure college is worth all this? 

                                  MARTY
                    I m going to graduate, pass the bar 
                    up North and work in a DA s office 
                    where everybody talks in flat 
                    Yankee vowels.

                                  DAN
                    C mon, how can you leave Memphis?

                                  MARTY
                    Mom.  Lives.  Here.  

                                  DAN
                    I live here too.  That s gotta 
                    count for something, right?

    He says it very casually, but we see him search her for a 
      reaction.  She doesn t give up anything.  

                                  MARTY
                    If I were gonnastay for something, 
                    I d stay for the ribs.

                                  DAN
                    Oh, you did not.

      They both laugh.  Clearly, banter is safer.  Marty fist bumps 
    Dan and runs off to join the Hellcats.  Dan watches 
      thoughtfully, bitter-sweetly.  

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           37.

      FADE IN:


      EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 

    The guys (and the Wedge) work on tossing the flyers into the 
    air and catching them in a cradle hold.  

      Marty hustles up to Sierra and Vanessa.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty.  With Alice out, you and 
                    Sierra are my first-string fliers.

                                  MARTY
                    What does that mean?

                                  VANESSA
                    It means you ve got a ton of work 
                    to do between now and qualifiers 
                    this weekend.  It ll be hard, but 
                    we ll get you there.  Sierra will 
                    show you the fight song, which is a 
                    basic 16 count combo.  You ll do it 
                    thirty times in any given event, so 
                    memorize it.  

      Marty nods.  Sierra locks her body into place.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Start legs hip width apart.  
                          (shouting)

                    So it s: arms low V. Clap.  Arms 
                    high V.  Touch left, hip, hip.

      Marty follows the basic foot and armwork. 

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    Good.  Now step it up, put some 
                    real energy into it.  Power!    

      Marty moves with Sierra.  Arms snapping, hips popping. 

                                  SIERRA
                    GO BIG GREEN.  EVERYBODY SAY GO BIG

                    POWER!  I wanna hear you, Marty!  

                                  MARTY
                    Go big green. Everybody say go big 
                    green!  

                                  VANESSA
                    Like you mean it!  You love this!

                                  MARTY
                          (a mighty bellow)
                    GO BIG GREEN!!!  

                                  VANESSA 
                    You ll get it.  Practice in the 
                    mirror, in your car.  LOUD.    
                          (a beat, then)
                    Moving on.  Hit your hip one, tuck 
                    two, kick three... 

      Vanessa and Sierra do a HIGH KICK that ruffles hair.   

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    ...touch four, wind it up five, toe 
                    touch six... 

    A JUMP that seems to defy gravity.

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    ...land seven, clean it up eight.  

      Bodies rigid, stiff and flawless.  

      Marty follows along, does the combo once.  She gets it, but 
    her body flows a more naturally to the steps, less rigid.    

      Shakira s Give It Up to Me  kicks in.  QUICK MONTAGE CUTS:  
      Marty and Sierra go through the 16 counts dozens of times...  

    -  Marty s style rears away from stiff cheer-style and into 
      funkier, more stylistic dance.  Sierra reacts, appalled.  

    -  Vanessa is getting into it, joins them.  After a half-
      dozen or so times running through the routine, she starts to 
    put a little more GROOVE into her hips, more SHAKE into her 
      booty.  She and Marty smile at one another, this is fun.     

    -  Sierra executes the routine precisely the same each and 
      every time, not one errant hip or flick of her hair.  Vanessa 
      stops Sierra.  Way too white.  She motions for Marty to show 
      Sierra the move.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           39.


    -  Marty puts her hand on Sierra s hips to show her the new 
      moves.  Vanessa joins.  Sierra, Marty, and Vanessa do the 
      combo.  Sierra smiles, starting to get into it.Now all 
      three are pretty funkified.

    -  Now the other Hellcats have joined in.  We re seeing the 
    two styles mesh -- Marty s odd moves with the vocabulary of 
      traditional cheer.  It s awesome, hot and sexy.  Feels almost 
      like a dance production number.  As the song wraps up, Marty 
      punctuates the combination with an impressive BACK FLIP.  

                                  MARTY
                    WOO!

                                  VANESSA
                    Nice work.  Very nice.  

      Marty glances to see if Dan saw how cool that was.  She s 
      disappointed to see he s no longer there.  In his place, 

      COACH RED IRVINE

    Now watches practice.  He grumbles to a nearby Bill Curran.  

                                  RED
                    What the hell is Vanessa teaching 
                    these girls?  She s got  em dancing 
                    like goddamnstrippers.  

                                  CURRAN
                          (appreciative)
                    She sure does.  


      INT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

      Practice is still in progress.  The girls are all sweaty from 
    the exertion.  Marty sips from a water bottle, exhausted.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Okay.  Time for partner work.  
                    Marty, you re with Luis. 

      Luis joins Marty.

                                  MARTY
                    Thanks for the save this morning.

                                  LUIS
                    I m a sucker for a damsel in 
                    distress.  Plus, I like getting 
                    naked.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           40.


                                  MARTY
                    Me, not so much.

                                  LUIS
                    Too bad, you got the body for it.

      Marty blushes -- first time we ve ever seen her speechless. 

    The guys hold the girls  shoes in one hand, the girls 
      teetering over head. (This move is called an  Awesome. )  

                                  LUIS (CONT D)
                    You re going up, baby.  

      Marty s eyes go wide.  Shit. 


      INT. PRACTICE FIELD - SAME TIME

      Sierra towers several feet off the ground, one foot in each 
    of Darwin s hands (he s her base).  Darwin tosses Sierra into 
    the air.  When she reaches maximum height, she kicks both 
      feet up to head height, and sails downward, butt first.  

      Darwin catches her in cradle position.  Perfect BASKET TOSS.  

      Luis reaches for Marty to do the same.  She pulls away.

                                  MARTY
                    I m sorry, no.  

                                  LUIS
                    What?

                                  MARTY
                    What if you drop me?    

                                  LUIS
                    I won t.

                                  MARTY
                    I believe you believe that.

                                  VANESSA
                    We having a problem?

                                  MARTY
                    Look, in gymnastics it s just me.  
                    If I get hurt, I own it.  I can t 
                    just -- in the air -- I mean, what 
                    is wrong with you people?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           41.


                                  SIERRA
                          (knowingly)
                    She s getting mental.  

      Marty shoots her a look.  Was that an insult?

                                  MARTY
                    Don t make me come off this porch.

                                  VANESSA
                    It s cheer slang.  It means you re 
                    thinking of all the bad things that 
                    can happen.  In cheer, we sometimes 
                    have to lie to ourselves.  Create a 
                    world of best possible outcomes, 
                    where everything works out right.  
                    I fly fearlessly into the air with 
                    a big easy smile, because I know my 
                    team won t let me hit ground.

                                  MARTY
                    Yeah well, life s not like that.

                                  VANESSA
                    Not always.  But when you expect 
                    the worst, you tend to get it.  

      This lands with Marty.  Vanessa blows her whistle.  

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    Line up for suicide drops!

      Marty looks alarmed.  Don t like the sound of that.  


      EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

    A HELLCAT FALLS THROUGH FRAME IN SLOW-MO to eerie beautiful 
      music like SigurRos  Festival.   Graceful, hair and skirt 
      billowing as she executes a perfect PRETTY GIRL DISMOUNT. 
      After a beat, she flies back into frame and pulls her leg 
      behind her to a standing SCORPION.

      Normal speed resumes and we CUT WIDE.  

      This is a fear-busting exercise.  A line of Hellcats are 
      positioned at the very top of the bleachers, about thirty 
      feet in the air.  One by one, they take a leap of faith into 
    the waiting arms of a team of bases waiting below with a 
      trampoline (Wedge, Luis, Darwin, ND-base).   

    The Hellcat hits the trampoline a second time, flips 
      elegantly into the air and lands gracefully on the grass.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           42.


      SERIES OF SHOTS:  All the girls take a turn jumping, twisting 
    and spinning.  It looks scary and fun at the same time. 

    TOP OF BLEACHERS

    Now it s Marty s turn.  She stands atop the bleachers, alone 
      with Sierra.  Marty hesitates, afraid to jump.

      ANGLE ON VANESSA

    She calls up with a bullhorn.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Remember, positive outcomes only, 
                    so smile!  Your team will never let 
                    you hit ground! 
                          (sotto to bases)
                    Drop her and I ll kill you slow.

    But Luis exudes easy rock star confidence...

                                  LUIS
                    I got her.

      BACK TO MARTY AND SIERRA

      Marty is poised to jump, but can t bring herself to do it.

                                  MARTY
                    Sierra, I can t.   

                                  SIERRA
                    You heard Vanessa.  Trust your 
                    team.  Can you do that, Marty?  Can 
                    you trust us?

      Marty bites her lip, turns back to look at the drop.

                                  MARTY
                    This was a mistake.  Alice was 
                    right -- 

                                  SIERRA
                    Oh, screw Alice.

      Without warning, Sierra gives Marty a little push.  Marty 
      teeters a beat -- 

                                  MARTY
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

    And goes falling into space!

      DOWN BELOW -- The guys hustle to catch the flailing Marty.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           43.


      WHAM!Marty hits the trampoline feet first and bounces high 
    and off-center.  Luis catches Marty in his powerful arms.  

    A moment.  The two lock eyes.  There s real chemistry here.

                                  LUIS
                    You okay?

      Marty s face goes from utter shock to a wide grin.

                                  MARTY
                    That... was FREAKING AWESOME!!!

    The Hellcats celebrate this small milestone.  All, except 
      Alice, watching Marty in the arms of her ex.

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT FOUR        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           44.

      FADE IN:


      INT. LANCER ATHLETIC CENTER - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

      Sierra pins Marty s Hellcat uniform.  It s the first time 
      we ve seen Marty wearing Hellcat colors and she looks hot.  

                                  SIERRA
                    You look great. 
                            (inspectsMarty s legs)
                    We ll get some base to hide the 
                    bruises.

                                  MARTY
                    Training s been pretty rough.  
                          (beat)
                    But I guess it s like that with any 
                      competitive sport.

      Sierra slowly smiles.

                                  SIERRA
                    You don t think we re groupies?  

                                  MARTY
                    I do not. 

      Sierra nods, pleased.

                                  SIERRA
                    So what happened to you anyway?

                                  MARTY
                    What do you mean?

                                  SIERRA
                    You ve clearly trained.  A lot.  
                    Otherwise you wouldn t be able to 
                    keep up.

                                  MARTY
                    I was a gymnast up until high 
                    school.

                                  SIERRA
                    Why dyou stop?

                                  MARTY
                    My senior year, we made state, so 
                    my Mom was there to cheer me on.  
                    She brought a date.

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    And they d been drinking at lunch.  
                    She was screaming, hooting and 
                    hollering.  All the other girls 
                    were looking, wondering who the 
                    white trash freak was.  I kept 
                    praying that nobody would connect 
                    her to me.  

                                  SIERRA
                    What happened?

                                  MARTY
                    I got mental.  I missed a jump and 
                    fell on my ass.  Mom s an emotional 
                    drunk, so she comes lurching out of 
                    the stands in tears to make sure 
                    I m okay.  Everybody s looking, the 
                    other gymnasts are laughing... 
                          (beat)
                    ... and then she puked on me.

      Sierra stares.

                                  SIERRA
                    Shut up.

                                  MARTY
                    I couldn t make that up if I tried.  

      Both girls laugh. 

      ANGLE ON NEXT ROW OF LOCKERS -- Alice has been sitting and 
      listening.   

                                  SIERRA
                    So you never went back?

                                  MARTY
                    I kept at it for a month or so.  
                    But I couldn t get her to stop 
                    coming to meets.  Every time I d 
                    step up to the bars, I d feel her

                    out and blow the routine.  

      Alice makes a face, bored by Marty s old emotional baggage.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    I finally stopped trying.  Wasn t 
                    worth it.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           46.


                                  SIERRA
                          (suddenly concerned)
                    You didn t invite your mother to 
                      qualifiers, did you?

                                  MARTY
                          (laughs)
                    Oh, God no.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Good.  We need this win.  By the 
                    way, how do you feel about Luis?

                                  MARTY
                          (flustered)
                    Good. He s good. I mean fine.  Why?

      Suddenly, Alice is paying full attention.

                                  SIERRA
                    He s only our best base.  He came 
                    to Vanessa and asked if he could 
                    make you his permanent flyer.

                                  MARTY
                    He did?  And permanent how? 

                                  SIERRA
                    He s first-string, so you stay a 
                      first-string.  It s a big deal.  
                    Base and flyer have a special 
                    relationship -- they learn each 
                    other s rhythms and do everything 
                    together, like Batman and Robin.  

                                  MARTY
                    Pretty sure Batman and Robin didn t 
                    do everything together.

      Suddenly, SLAM!  Alice storms out of the room.  Sierra and 
      Marty exchange puzzled looks, wondering what the noise was.

      Alice storms up to Luis, who is watching TV.

    She nestles in closer to him, he pushes her off.

                                  LUIS
                    We should never have hooked up.  I

      Wanda tends bar. Alice walks up in her Hellcat uniform.  

                                  ALICE
                    I ll take a Stella, please.

      Wanda nods and serves the beer.

                                  WANDA
                    I see you re a Hellcat.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes, I -- Oh my gosh.  You re 
                    Marty s mom.  Wanda, right?

                                  WANDA
                    Well, yeah.  How dyou -- ?

                                  ALICE
                    The resemblance is uncanny.  I 
                    would have guessed older sister, 
                    but Marty talks about you a lot, so 
                    I feel like I know you.  You must 
                    be so excited about seeing Marty at 
                    qualifiers this Saturday.

                                  WANDA
                    What are qualifiers?

                                  ALICE
                    Marty s debut. You re going, right?  

                                  WANDA
                    Marty always yells at me when I 
                    come to these things.  She can be 
                    such a diva.  Every little thing 
                    has to be just so.  

                                  ALICE
                    I know.  But she talks about you 
                    all the time.  You ve been a huge 
                      inspiration in her life.

                                  WANDA

    is covered with a UNITED CHEERLEADINGASSOCIATION logo.  The 
      JUDGES sit center, along with an ANNOUNCER.

    We FIND our intrepid Hellcats, a cluster of green.  They re

      Sierra passes out little strips of paper.  Everyone licks 
      their papers.  The guys slap them onto their forearms.  The 
      girls press them to their cheeks.   Sierra licks one and 
      sticks it on Marty s forehead.

                                  MARTY
                    Ugh!  You licked that!

      Marty s tattoo is the Lancer University cartoon tiger.

                    Grrrr! Grrr! Grrrrrreeeeeen!

    The rest of the squad responds with the same cheer.  Marty 
      looks around like she s arrived on an alien planet.  Vanessa 
      leans into Marty excitedly.  

                                  VANESSA

      Marty sees Dan in the audience.  She waves and begins working 
    her way towards him.


      INT. UCA GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

    An all-girl team is first up.  Tiny bird-like women are the 
      flyers.  The bases are big and powerful like the Wedge.  
      Marty reaches Dan.  He notes her tattoo.

                                  DAN
                    That s some mad ink you got there.

                    You look amazing.  Despite the fact 
                    that you re dressed like a 
                    cheerleader.  That part s weird.

      Luis stands in the bleachers and whistles, waving Marty over.

      Marty and Dan return to the Hellcats.  Suddenly, we hear: 

                                  WANDA (O.S.)
                    Baby!  

      Wanda is sitting a few rows back, right next to Alice.  Wanda 
      crowds her way past Hellcats, making her way to Marty.  She 
      leans forward, gives Marty a big hug and kiss.

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    All the good seats were taken, and 
                    then I ran into Alice.

    She waves up to Alice, who waves back, favoring Marty with a 
      big, bitchy smile.

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    She invited me to sit with the 
                    girls.  I hope people don t mistake 
                    mefor a Hellcat.

      Wanda does a little cheer move followed by a tiger claw move.  
      It s even more embarrassing than it looks on the page.  

      Vanessa and Sierra sense danger and approach.  Alice leans 
      back, enjoying the show.

                                  MARTY
                    Mom, you can t be here.

                                  WANDA
                    How come Dan s allowed?

    A beat.  Marty doesn t have a good answer for that.

                                  DAN
                    I m sleeping with the coach.

    He interlocks fingers with Vanessa.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Baby, you re looking fine today.

      Vanessa yanks her hand back.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           52.


                                  MARTY
                    Can you just go home?  Please?

                                  WANDA
                    Why wouldn t you want me here?  I m 
                    proud of you.  

                                  SIERRA
                    I think you should do what your 
                    daughter says. 

      Sierra takes Wanda s arm.  Wanda shakes her off.

                                  WANDA
                    Touch me again, I ll bust your 
                    nose.  This is between me and my 
                    daughter.  

                                  MARTY
                    Fine.  Stay.  Whatever.

      Marty storms away.  

                                  WANDA
                    I ll be quiet as a mouse!

      Wanda takes a seat.  Vanessa follows Marty.    

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty?  What s going on?

      Sierra is left alone with Dan.  She looks up at him -- she s 
      tiny, he s gigantic.

                                  SIERRA
                    So.  How long have you and Vanessa 
                    been together?

    Dan needs a moment to realize she s serious. 

                                  DAN
                    We re not.  I was trying to take 
                    the heat off Marty.  It was a joke.

                                  SIERRA
                    I sometimes miss those.  I m 
                    Sierra, her roomie.

    She extends her hand.  He shakes it.

    Dan looks over at Marty.  She s enraged by her mom s presence 
    and is unloading to Vanessa and Luis.  Luis has his arm 
      around Marty.  

    Dan looks back to Sierra, a plan formulating.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Hey, Sierra.  You seem cool.  You 
                    want to go out with me tonight?  

      Sierra cocks her head, utterly dumfounded.

                                  SIERRA
                    Is that another joke?

                                  DAN
                    No.

                                  SIERRA
                    Then... okay.  Yes.  

    She whips out a sharpie and jots her cell number on his arm.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    Next up all Division 1 co-edteams, 
                    report to the staging area.  

                                  SIERRA
                    That s us.  

                                  DAN
                    Yeah.

                                  SIERRA
                    I should go.

                                  DAN
                    Okay.

                                  SIERRA
                    Bye.

    Dan watches Sierra join the Hellcats in the center of the 
      gym.  He may only have eyes for Marty... but things change.

      FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT FIVE        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           54.


                                            ACT SIX

      FADE IN:

    The Hellcats are in position in the center of the gymnasium.  
      They re awkwardly waiting for Marty, who sits in the 
      bleachers fending off the worried Luis and Vanessa. 

                                  LUIS
                    Marty...

                                  MARTY
                    I want no comfort.  What I do want 
                    is for the ceiling to collapse 
                    crushing everyone in this room, 
                    starting with my mother.  
                          (glancesup)
                    Not my day all around.

      Luis and Vanessa exchange a look.  This is bad.  The crowd is 
      starting to murmur, is something wrong?

      ALICE watches from the sidelines.  Coldly satisfied.  Red 
      sidles up to her.

                                  RED
                    Y know, once we downsize the 
                    Hellcats, we re gonnaneed a new 
                    captain.       

                                  ALICE
                    What are you talking about? 

                                  RED
                    The trustees feel the Hellcats 
                    aren t pulling their weight as a 
                      competitive squad.  It s an 
                    expensive program.  If y alldon t 
                    place at nationals, your mandate 
                    will be simplified.

                                  ALICE
                    What does that mean? 

                                  RED
                    No more scholarships, no more 
                      competitions, no more travel.

                                  ALICE
                    ... No more Vanessa.

                                  RED
                    Why talk about the past when we can 
                    talk about the future?

                    If you d like to discuss yours, 
                    drop by during my office hours.  
                          (winks)
                    Or after.

      Alice stares in shock as he moves off.

      BACK TO MARTY

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty look at me.  Look.  This is 
                    the part where you lie.  Smile.  
                    The music s about to play and for 
                    three minutes and thirty-one 
                    seconds, you live in a world where 
                    your mother is perfect.  Nobody 
                      embarrasses or disappoints.  And if 
                    anything scares you or makes you 
                    angry, you can fly away from it.

                                  MARTY
                    That s the biggest load of facile 
                    crapI ve ever heard in my life.

      Vanessa cuffs Marty upside the head.  From Vanessa, the 
      gesture doesn t seem remotely mean.

                                  VANESSA
                    What part of lyingdo you keep 
                    missing?  For the next three 
                    minutes and thirty-one seconds?  
                    You got wings, girlfriend.

      Luis extends a hand to Marty.

                                  LUIS
                    C mon.

      Marty nods, resolved to try.  She and Luis join the others.


      INT. UCA GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER 

    The Hellcats begin.  A SIREN sounds, followed by a thundering 
      techno beat -- a wild MASH-UP of music, sounds and SFX. 
      First up: tumbling passes.  Two tumblers run in from each 
      side and break into unison ROUND-OFFS, BACK HANDSPRINGS, BACK 
      FLIPS.  Marty looks genuinely happy to be performing.  Maybe 
      she s missed gymnastics more than she realized. 

    The squad moves onto a dance combo with sharp, SNAPPY ARMS 
    AND POWERFUL KICKS.  They re doing the awesome  Marty-fied  
      sexy dance moves and the crowd eats it up!         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           56.


    THE CYCLONES 

    Are one exception.  They re scandalized by the sexy moves.

    RED AND BILL CURRAN

    Red looks pissed.Curran bops to the beat, enjoying it.    

      SIERRA

      Hits an ace STANDING BACK TUCK, playing the crowd like a pro.  

    A MECHANIZED VOICE on the soundtrackinstructs us to GET 
      RIGHT TO IT! And the squad lines up to get into a pyramid.  

    As Marty presses her foot into the Wedge s quad and steps 
      into place as the squad forms several smaller human pyramids.  
    The pyramid in the center is three people high, SIERRA 
      TEETERING ON TOP.  Sierra is hoisted into the air and FORWARD 
      FLIPS down into the waiting arms of Darwin below.  

    The crowd goes WILD.  As the rest of the pyramids dismantle, 
    the music switches to KANYEWEST S  STRONGER.   

    The team reassembles for the most important part of the 
      routine: STUNTING.  As Marty and Luis come together, he sees 
    the worry on her face.  Luis sings along with the music --

                                  LUIS
                    That that thatthat won t kill 
                    me... can only make me stronger...  

      Marty steps up into his hands and sings:  

                                  MARTY
                    ...I can t wait much longer...

      Marty s legs shake as Luis raises her up to his shoulders....  

                                  LUIS
                    Steady.   

      Marty s left leg bends just slightly, not enough for the 
      audience to see, only enough for Luis to feel it.  

                                  LUIS (CONT D)
                    It s all you.  Hold steady.

                                  MARTY
                    Luis, I can t do this, don t...  

                                  LUIS
                    Lock that knee, you re going up.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           57.


      There s no use arguing.  Marty LOCKS her knee and UP SHE 
      GOES, SAILING INTO THE AIR.  Kanyeyells on the soundtrackas 
      Marty hits her TOE TOUCH like a pro.  SHE WHOOSHES BACK 
      DOWNWARD INTO LUIS S ARMS.  Perfect basket toss!

    The team moves into the CHEER portion, brimming with energy.  

                                  HELLCATS
                    GO BIG GREEN!  EVERYBODY SAY, GO 
                    BIG GREEN!!

      Final tableau!  The crowd goes crazy!  

                                  LUIS
                          (to no one in particular)
                    Did you see my girl Marty?  I mean, 
                    did you see my girl Marty?

      DAN, WANDA AND VANESSA jump up, clapping and cheering.  Wanda 
      tries to run down to the floor.

                                  WANDA
                    I have to go hug my baby!

                                  DAN
                    Easy, Trigger.

    Dan pulls her back by her belt, preventing her from leaving.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    Great score from the judges.  The 
                    Hellcats live to fight another day!

    The whole squad clusters around Marty.  Sierra hugs her.

                                  SIERRA
                    Way to go, Hellcat.

      Marty can t help grinning like a little kid.  

      FADE OUT.
