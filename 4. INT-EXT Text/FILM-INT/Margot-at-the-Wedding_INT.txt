A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The
boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard
tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This
is Claude.
We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,
balances it in one hand as he opens the door.
The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.
He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits
while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above
the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration
alternating between the food and the path.
He sits next to a brunette woman.
He hands her a hot dog.
CLAUDE
Here.
He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black
circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly
blushes and mumbles:
CLAUDE
Sorry.
He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next
to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder
length hair. Her name is Margot.
MARGOT
That was quick.
CLAUDE
I sat next to the wrong person.
MARGOT
Really?
Where?
She stretches up and peers over the seats.
He grabs her
shirt.
CLAUDE
Please don't look.
She'll see you.
MARGOT
Careful with my blouse.

Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude
listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,
and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes
between cars.
The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.
He stops,
looks around. He screams again.

CUT TO:

Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.
Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.
Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger
against the glass and traces the wires.
CLAUDE
Will the wedding be crowded?
MARGOT
I don't know. I think she doesn't
know anyone anymore.
CLAUDE
How long has she known Malcolm?
MARGOT
Only a year.
CLAUDE
Is that short?
MARGOT
(pointedly)
Would you marry someone you'd only
known a year?
CLAUDE
I'm not going to ever get married.
MARGOT
I can't say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing.
CLAUDE
Why are we going then?
MARGOT
We're supporting her.
3.
CLAUDE
I thought she wasn't speaking to
you.
MARGOT
No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,
but I'm over it.

Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is
in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,
Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.
Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a
panda on it.
MALCOLM
Paul apologizes for not coming,
she's still getting the house
ready.
MARGOT
I'm sorry it was such short notice.
MALCOLM
I don't care. Paul's frantic, but
I don't give a shit. Oh, and
Ingrid wants me to tell you that
she made us all bracelets.
INGRID
(embarrassed)
No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
MALCOLM
Oh, I thought you asked me to tell
them. Anyway...
Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
bracelet.
5.
MALCOLM
I got Knicks colors.
INGRID
They're not Knicks colors!
MARGOT
It's beautiful, Ingrid.
INGRID
(to Claude)
I made this one for myself.
She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.
INGRID
Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
CLAUDE
I guess.
INGRID
Where's your dad and Josh?
CLAUDE
They might come later.
MARGOT
Josh's spring break is next week.
Jim teaches through Friday and then
they open the house in Vermont on
the weekend.
MALCOLM
(bluntly)
It means a lot to Pauline that
you're here.
Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
MARGOT
Oh.
Good.
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near
their car. Malcolm swerves anyway.
MALCOLM
Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
Ingrid giggles.
Margot clutches the handle above the door.
6.
MALCOLM
If you're wondering about the
moustache --
MARGOT
No, I wasn't.
MALCOLM
I had a full beard
for a while and
then when I shaved
it I left this
part for last, you
know to see how
it looked, and...
It's meant to be
funny.
Margot nods politely.
The sound of tires on gravel:

Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his
wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door
opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto
another bedroom.
Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a
realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.
INGRID
This is my room.
CLAUDE
Okay.
INGRID
Do you like showers or baths?
CLAUDE
Showers.
What about you?
8.
Ingrid shrugs.
She says, already bored with the topic:
INGRID
I don't care.
10

Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now
wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one
another.
PAULINE
Is Malcolm what you thought he'd
be?
MARGOT
Well, I didn't know what to --
PAULINE
The moustache is temporary. He
left it for last when he was
shaving. It's meant to be funny.
MARGOT
He told me.
PAULINE
Yeah...
They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the
curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.
PAULINE
I'm sorry -- with so little time to
prepare, we had to put you in
Malcolm's storage room --
MARGOT
This was Becky's room.
Poor Becky.
PAULINE
Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a
storage room. I've just started to
feel like it's our house not my
parents. You know?
MARGOT
Our parents.
PAULINE
Of course. It might still smell
like paint, but...
9.
MARGOT
I thought he was a musician.
Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to
unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.
PAULINE
Well, music's officially a hobby...
He's painting now. And writing
letters to newspapers and
magazines. He's very meticulous,
he'll spend up to a week writing a
response to a music review. He's
incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
I don't know. We're doing very
well.
MARGOT
Good.
I mean, you must be.
Silence.
PAULINE
I don't know where to begin. What
can I tell you? It seems I'm
pregnant, but it's really early
so... I haven't told anyone. I
mean, I haven't told Malcolm or
Ingrid.
MARGOT
Wow...
PAULINE
Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I
hope so. Things are good. We did
a couples seminar two months ago or
so in Maine. They give you
exercises and things to do. I know
you're not convinced, but...
MARGOT
(vaguely)
Mm hm.
PAULINE
We got engaged right afterwards.
The guy who runs it, Strickland,
wrote a really interesting book
about loving which I'll lend you if
you want.
10.
MARGOT
(non-committal)
Okay.
PAULINE
But only if you'll read it.
Because I need it back. I made
notes in the margins.
MARGOT
I may not get to it for a while.
PAULINE
Well, I'm not going to lend it to
you if you're not going to read it.
They meet eyes.
Pauline quickly turns away.
PAULINE
It's going to be very informal by
the way. Just Mom and Becky.
Malcolm's brother. Few friends.
And now you and Claude. Nothing
like the first one.
MARGOT
(wary)
Becky's coming?
PAULINE/MARGOT
She isn't how you.../I'd really
like...
PAULINE
You go.
MARGOT
I was going to say, "I'd really
like some white wine."
PAULINE
Oh. Yeah. We have a...
Well...I'm glad you changed your
mind and came. I never heard from
you after I sent the invite...I
even wondered if you got it.
MARGOT
(quickly)
Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
PAULINE
Did you get it?
11.
MARGOT
Yeah.
Pauline waits for an explanation.
MARGOT
I'm sorry you were so angry...
PAULINE
I wasn't angry. I
was...disappointed.
MARGOT
Uh huh. But you see when you say,
"disappointed" it puts me in a
crummy situation. Like I let you
down.
PAULINE
But you did in a way.
MARGOT
I don't see it like that.
PAULINE
Fine. I felt betrayed.
Is that
word okay?
MARGOT
Again, you're making me the
aggressor.
PAULINE
You were the aggressor.
(pause)
Let's not... I've become a really
good cook.

Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his
feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record
sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.
MARGOT
I can't believe you've still got
all of our old records.
Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the
scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and
hands it to her mother.
12.
INGRID
Mom, can you hide this please.
Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.
PAULINE
(for Margot's benefit)
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek
once?
MALCOLM
In the late `80's. It was a solo
gig after he left the Cars.
CLAUDE
So, you're kind of famous.
Malcolm reddens.
MALCOLM
No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I
used to want to be, but, No. Do
you want to be famous?
MARGOT
Claude wants to be very famous.
MALCOLM
Well, make sure you can handle
rejection. I can't. For me,
expectation just turns to
disappointment. So, ultimately I'd
rather not try. It'll all go black
for us soon enough anyway.
PAULINE
Claude, ignore him.
Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows
uncomfortable. She says to Claude:
PAULINE
When your mother moved to New York
she used to send me books and
records. She sent me REM's
Murmur...
MARGOT
And the Pixies.
13.
PAULINE
And X. She was very cool your
mother.
MARGOT
You only liked top forty.
PAULINE
Yeah, but I love REM now.
Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.
MARGOT
I don't really listen to music
anymore.
PAULINE
I was dating that guy, Horace back
then. Remember him?
MARGOT
Was that the guy who liked to rough
you up?
PAULINE
No, that was our dad.
Pauline and Margot crack up laughing.
Malcolm raises an
eyebrow at Claude.
MARGOT
Our father used to strip down to
his skivvies and beat us with a
belt.
MALCOLM
That man had a sexual screw loose.
PAULINE
It's awful -- that stuff that
happens to kids. Malcolm was
fondled by a male baby-sitter.
MALCOLM
Just use that information however
you want...
PAULINE
Sorry. We're with family.
I
figured...
Claude looks at Malcolm.
Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.
14.
PAULINE
I think Becky got it the worst.
MARGOT
Did she ever. Raped by the horse
trainer...
Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back
into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream
down Margot's face. Claude watches.
12
13
Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter.
She
hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.
14
15
Claude sleeps in bed.
Margot gently touches his face.
She
whispers:
MARGOT
Are you asleep?
CLAUDE
(softly)
Yes.
18.
MARGOT
Will you remember this?
CLAUDE
Yes.
MARGOT
I just talked to your dad...
Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.
MARGOT
I'm only going to tell you if you
won't remember.
CLAUDE
Okay.
Margot hesitates.
She changes her mind and says
thoughtfully:
MARGOT
Everyone finds you so funny and
charming. I always get compliments
about you.
Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and
smears some eye make-up off of her face.
MARGOT
Are you having fun?
Is it nice to
see Pauline?
CLAUDE
(opens his eyes)
Yeah, I really like her.
MARGOT
Yeah.
She is crazy though.
CLAUDE
In what way?
MARGOT
She's really berserk. Maybe it's
hormones. You don't notice
anything different about Pauline?
CLAUDE
No.
19.
MARGOT
She's pregnant -- she told me. But
she's keeping it a secret -- I mean
from Malcolm and even Ingrid.
Which I think is unforgiveable.
Now she'll have to marry him.
What's she planning -- to get
married and not drink champagne?
Then she'll just be lying. I guess
she's afraid she'll miscarry. She
probably will. I think on some
level she's ambivalent about the
marriage and that's why she's not
telling him.
CLAUDE
Are you stoned, Mom?
MARGOT
Maybe a little.
CLAUDE
I don't like it.
16

Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of
whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.
MALCOLM
(shakes his head)
My scrotum is longer than my penis.
He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of
the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.
MALCOLM
It's sweet how Claude looks up to
me.
He waits for a reaction and gets none.
MALCOLM
Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you
made her out to be.
PAULINE
What she did to Toby and Alan
tonight didn't seem crazy enough
for you?
MALCOLM
I guess that seemed pretty crazy.
20.
PAULINE
(immediately defensive)
Well, she cares deeply.
MALCOLM
Yeah, she's really worried about
Bruce.
PAULINE
This has nothing to do with Bruce.
She thinks everyone is autistic.
Malcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed.
PAULINE
What?
MALCOLM
Nothing, you keep changing your
position -- I'm just trying to
figure out if I should agree with
you or not?
PAULINE
Well, can't she be both, care
deeply and be crazy? Do people
have to be all one thing?
MALCOLM
I guess not.
PAULINE
Well, okay...
(back into it)
It is nice she came for the
wedding. She's so pretty, don't
you think?
MALCOLM
(warily)
She's attractive.
PAULINE
A little thin maybe...
But it is
nice she came.
MALCOLM
Let's fuck.
21.

Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries
to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and
gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.
18
22
Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid
laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious.
CLAUDE
You were great on the way up.
MARGOT
Don't patronize me, Claude.
Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it.
PAULINE
We're all laughing, Margot.
26.
MARGOT
You're laughing in a kind way.
Claude is taking too much pleasure
out of it.
CLAUDE
I am not.
MARGOT
You are. You like to make fun of
me. To see me get embarrassed.
It's mean.
Silence.
Margot puts her pinky back in her ear.
She frowns.
PAULINE
What are you doing?
MARGOT
I've got a fucking bug in my ear,
okay?
23
28
The car pulls into a driveway.
A modern house.
Dick and
Maisy come out to greet them.
DICK
You found it!
Margot, the kids and Pauline get out. We stay in the car
with Malcolm. Pauline comes to his window.
PAULINE
What's up?
MALCOLM
I don't want to do this...
PAULINE
Come on, don't be that way.
Maisy sits on the hood of the car and Ingrid introduces her
to Claude. Dick approaches Margot -- she turns back to
Pauline.
MALCOLM
I'm not being that way -- I just
don't feel like it. I'm going to
go back and... I have work to do.
PAULINE
Dick doesn't care that you don't
make any money.
MALCOLM
Is that why you think... That's
not why I'm...I just hate swimming.
I really hate it. It's disgusting
to me. My mistake was saying I'd
do it to begin with. You have fun.
PAULINE
Fine, we'll have fun.
35.
Malcolm's gaze goes to Maisy's breasts.
Margot watches him
watch her.
MALCOLM
People always pee in the pool.
PAULINE
I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in
their pool.
MALCOLM
I'll bet you 500 dollars there's
pee in that pool.
29
30
Margot, reclining on the couch, drinks a white wine with ice
cubes. Pauline passes the doorway and stops. She holds tear-
sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various
magazines.
PAULINE
Here you are.
MARGOT
You've got a problem.
PAULINE
What do you mean?
MARGOT
I don't like the girl and I don't
like the way Malcolm looks at her.
38.
PAULINE
Oh, come on, it's sexy.
MARGOT
You didn't see it. I saw it.
You've got a problem.
PAULINE
I'm not worried.
(pause)
We could teach Claude how to swim.
MARGOT
He won't want to do it.
It's too
late.
Pauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple
steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.
Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips.
MARGOT
Are you supposed to be doing that?
PAULINE
No.
She hands it back.
PAULINE
I liked your last story in, was it
Harpers? The one about mom. I was
very...I liked it very much.
MARGOT
It wasn't really about mom.
PAULINE
I thought it was. Anyway. Why
don't you want Claude to know how
to swim?
MARGOT
I didn't say I didn't want him to.
Why do you care? It's not in his
life -- we're New Yorkers. If he
wants to learn when he's older, he
can. I'm curious why you're so
interested in the whole thing.
PAULINE
I'm not. I'm just... As a safety
thing and...I'm... Forget it.
(pause)
(MORE)
39.
PAULINE (CONT'D)
It's interesting -- this is the
first time Dick has invited us
over.
MARGOT
But are you really friends?
PAULINE
Kind of. We're neighbors. We
employ Maisy. I mean I don't care,
I just think it's interesting.
(pause)
Are you excited about the talk? I
thought I'd come if that's okay.
My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's
it like to have a celebrity as a
sister?" I said, I've got no
problem with celebrity. Alice
Munro taught at Bennington and was
kind of a friend of mine.
MARGOT
I'm not a celebrity.
PAULINE
Well, you're well known.
MARGOT
To a very few people.
PAULINE
Just accept the compliment.
MARGOT
I guess I didn't realize it was a
compliment.
31
34
Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's
"Parallel Lines" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to
the song, "Sunday Girl." He depresses the red record button
on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and
full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.
41.
Maisy appears in the doorway and watches.
Claude turns mid-
lyric. He jumps, startled.
MAISY
Singing?
Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.
CLAUDE
Hm?
A bit.
She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who
remains on the bed.
Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape.
She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's
hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth
stomach.
MAISY
Can I make a suggestion?
CLAUDE
Uh huh.
MAISY
You should get underarm deodorant.
CLAUDE
Uh huh.
MAISY
You kind of smell.
Claude blushes.
MAISY
Better I tell you than someone
else.
35
35
Margot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind
her, in the mirror.
MARGOT
I think you smell nice.
You smell
real.
CLAUDE
I stink.
42.
MARGOT
It causes cancer.
CLAUDE
Underarm deodorant?
MARGOT
Yes. It's got chemicals and things
that are extremely harmful.
CLAUDE
I'm not going to die from underarm
cancer.
MARGOT
No, you'll get it somewhere else.
Like your stomach or your
testicles.
CLAUDE
(laughs)
Testicles.
MARGOT
Don't laugh, that's a serious
thing.
Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
CLAUDE
Yeah.
MARGOT
I hope you're not interested in
that girl. I find her
insufferable.
CLAUDE
What does that mean?
MARGOT
It means I can't suffer her. She's
loud and stupid. She goes on about
things of which she knows nothing
about.
CLAUDE
She got into Harvard early.
MARGOT
Stupid people get into Harvard
early all the time.
43.
CLAUDE
Where did you go again?
MARGOT
Barnard.
(pause)
I just don't think you should do
anything with her.
CLAUDE
(embarrassed)
We're just friends.
MARGOT
If you do, use a condom.
Claude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with
a red lip outline floats on top of the water.
CLAUDE
Where are you going?
MARGOT
Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.
CLAUDE
Are kids coming?
36
36
Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back
seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The
ignition turns.
Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.
Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of
them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a
stalk of celery.
INGRID
Who do we know who's gay?
MAISY
How do I know what gay people you
know.
CLAUDE
Alan and Toby.
INGRID
And Bruce.
He's gay and Aspergers.
44.
CLAUDE
I don't know if Bruce is gay.
INGRID
He might be, it's very common.
CLAUDE
Your mom is pregnant.
INGRID
No she isn't.
CLAUDE
She is.
Ingrid looks stricken.
MAISY
How do you know that, Claude?
CLAUDE
She told my mom. But you can tell -
- she's hormonally weird.
MAISY
Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to
have a baby sister or brother.
INGRID
(quietly)
My mom thinks your mom is
unreliable.
CLAUDE
Who cares.
But he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on
the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:
MAISY
Do you think your mom is fuckable?
CLAUDE
I don't know.
MAISY
I think she's hot, your mother.
I'd do her if I was gay. I might
anyway. I mean if she came on to
me.
CLAUDE
She won't.
45.
INGRID
I'm not going to do anyone.
There's a scraping sound on the window.
The kids turn
quickly:
CLAUDE
What was that?
INGRID
Is it scary?
37
38
Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's
smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the
backseat.
PAULINE
Margot used to never speak. I
remember when we went on a double
date in high school, that kid Ron
asked you if English was your first
language.
MARGOT
It's true. I used to think I might
have some kind of brain defect.
PAULINE
You thought you were aphasic.
MARGOT
I'm still not sure.
PAULINE
Oh, Jesus, Margot.
MARGOT
It's very possible, Paul.
46.
PAULINE
I just...your diagnoses sometimes
irk the hell out of me.
Malcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways.
MARGOT
Malcolm, can you slow down.
MALCOLM
What?
DICK
I can drive if you like.
MALCOLM
No, you got dinner, the driving's
on me.
DICK
Well, I'll let you pay your half if
you'll slow down.
MALCOLM
Well, neither Pauline or I ordered
dessert.
PAULINE
Malcolm, let it go.
(taunting)
Margot would insist on driving if
she knew how.
MARGOT
(to Dick)
My license elapsed.
But I know
how.
MALCOLM
It's probably for the best. I have
this theory, I think, historically,
women have been held back in so
many ways that when they get power,
like they do behind the wheel, they
can't help but abuse it. It's akin
to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory
about prison guards and prisoners
switching rolls.
DICK
That's a charming philosophy.
47.
MARGOT
Yeah.
Tell that one a lot.
MALCOLM
This isn't a blanket thing. I
mean, women can be great drivers
too...
He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.
PAULINE
Said the man with the moustache
that he thinks he's wearing in
quotes.
MARGOT
It's meant to be funny.
MALCOLM
(to Pauline, re: Margot)
Are you doing this for her benefit
or mine?
Malcolm pumps the brake.
MALCOLM
What the fuck?
PAULINE
What?
MALCOLM
(momentarily sober)
No, there they go. Okay. It's
fine. I thought I had no brakes
for a minute...
Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
through Margot's window and lands on her lap.
MARGOT
Malcolm!
Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
MALCOLM
(turning around)
What?!
The car swerves again -- everyone jumps.
MARGOT
Watch it!
48.
MALCOLM
It's fine, Margot!
PAULINE
(to Malcolm)
You're just so incompetent.
MALCOLM
(exploding)
Why don't you fucking drive
yourselves home!
Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder.
They
jolt to a stop.
PAULINE
(quietly furious)
Oh, God.
Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. She
leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. Malcolm
watches in the rearview mirror.
MARGOT
You should go after her.
Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. Margot and
Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming
and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.
DICK
Come back with me tonight.
MARGOT
I've got Claude.
DICK
Come on, I've been trying to get
you up here all year.
MARGOT
(vaguely)
She's pregnant.
Dick leans over to Margot's neck.
He licks her.

Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his
pinky fingernail. He hesitates and places it on an end-
table.
49.
INGRID
Why are you putting that there?
CLAUDE
I just want to keep it.
INGRID
I left a piece of skin in a movie
theater once so it could watch
movies all its life.
CLAUDE
I don't know if it's the same
thing.
INGRID
Are you obsessed with Maisy?
CLAUDE
No.
INGRID
You're always staring at her tits.
Ingrid traces Claude's upper lip with her finger.
INGRID
You have a moustache.
CLAUDE
My mom bleaches it.
INGRID
I'm going to kiss your cheek and
then you kiss mine.
CLAUDE
I don't want to do that.
INGRID
Why not?
CLAUDE
Because it's pointless...
Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and
dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into
the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water
groans through the old pipes.
50.
INGRID
Where are you going? I thought we
were having a conversation.
CLAUDE
You're starting to annoy me.
40
40
Claude walks -- he passes an open door: Malcolm is shaving
his moustache -- the electric razor whirring.
41
41
Claude enters.
It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the
bedside table.
He hesitates then opens it:
It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive
in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.
Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles
against the pillow and squints to read the writing.
MARGOT (O.S.)
What are you doing?
Claude startles.
Margot stands in the doorway with a glass
of water.
CLAUDE
I didn't think you came home.
MARGOT
Where would I be?
CLAUDE
Can't Josh and Dad come to the
wedding?
MARGOT
We've been through this.
Go to
bed.
Claude slides down to the floor.
He hesitates.
CLAUDE
Can I sleep in here?
MARGOT
No, honey.
CLAUDE
We can put a pillow between us.
51.
MARGOT
Okay.
Just for tonight.
Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs
into the covers in a nightgown.
MARGOT
When you were a baby I wouldn't let
anyone else hold you. I think that
may have been a mistake.
42
45
Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a
white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.
MARGOT
Woa!
Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a
pad and paper in front of him.
MALCOLM
Hey, sorry. I'm here.
MARGOT
No, I...
I should've looked.
MALCOLM
I'm just writing my vows. Trying
to do something appropriate but
also funny -- not jokey, more
character based humor.
Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm
to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a
long drink. Silence.
MALCOLM
You having an okay time?
MARGOT
Oh, yeah.
Besides Wizard getting --
57.
MALCOLM
Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or
else, I don't know...
MARGOT
We won't.
MALCOLM
Right, or else he's dead or
something.
(pause)
It means a lot to Paul that you
came.
MARGOT
Yeah.
Silence.
Malcolm mumbles a tune.
MARGOT
Oh God, this is the same toaster we
had here as kids. Paul is so
weird.
MALCOLM
I hear you've heard the news.
MARGOT
Yeah.
Congratulations.
MALCOLM
Pretty cool. Hard to fully take
in. It's a little abstract still.
I haven't had that thing yet where
you realize that you're not the
most important person in the world.
I'm anxious for that to happen. I
guess I have to thank you -- I
wouldn't know yet if you hadn't
arrived.
MARGOT
You're welcome.
MALCOLM
Of course I can't help but worry
I'll pass some not so great genes
onto the kid. I mean, in my family
there's a lot of hand washing, you
know. I don't have it, but my
brother does.
(pause)
You working on anything now?
58.
MARGOT
Besides the thing with Dick?
MALCOLM
Oh, right.
He nods.
She nods.
Silence.
MARGOT
How about you?
MALCOLM
Oh, I'm working on some acrylic
paint --
MARGOT
Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in
the freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to the
sink. She runs the water.
MARGOT
Sorry, what were you --
MALCOLM
Nothing.
It doesn't matter.
MARGOT
No, what were you saying?
MALCOLM
It really... Nothing.
MARGOT
Okay.
She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full
trays.
MALCOLM
I was saying I'm doing these
abstractions in acrylic paint. But
it's not... I'm not getting paid
or anything. I don't know, I hate
that question, "What do you do?"
MARGOT
You asked me.
MALCOLM
I know, but...
59.
Malcolm exhales in frustration.
46
49
Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat.
MARGOT
I already have slippers.
JIM
Well, that's okay.
Two sets are
fine, right?
MARGOT
It makes me sad to get a present
that I already have.
JIM
Why?
MARGOT
It makes me feel like you don't
know me.
She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.
JIM
What's wrong with your ear?
MARGOT
I asked you not to come. I was so
clear and you did it anyway so
blithely.
JIM
We need time alone to sort this
out. You can't just run away --
MARGOT
Okay, so we're here.
I'm giving
you this time.
JIM
(trying a joke)
Well, now you're putting too much
pressure on me.
Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.
He takes
a moment, preparing to speak. Then:
JIM
What is that?
His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They
pass.
67.
MARGOT
Keep driving.
Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder.
MARGOT
No...no...no. Jim, no.
JIM
Let me just...
Jim gets out of the car.
A sobbing woman crouches, cradling
a bloody dog.
WOMAN
Please help me.
Jim comes toward her.
WOMAN
Please help me. He got hit by a
car. Please help me.
Margot opens her door and steps out.
MARGOT
(warily)
Jim...
Jim kneels down by the whining pit bull.
The woman screams:
WOMAN
Help me!
MARGOT
Careful, he might bite you!
Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal.
50
50
Jim drives, his front covered in blood. Margot is shot-gun.
The lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap.
WOMAN
Hurry...he's dying.
He's dying.
Margot puts her hands over her ears.
Jim speeds up.
WOMAN
He didn't do anything. Roger is an
innocent. He's an innocent
creature.
68.
MARGOT
Oh, God.
JIM
Margot.
MARGOT
(whispering)
I can't stand her.
51
52
Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white
wine. Pauline eats from a left-over Chinese container.
MARGOT
If it were someone else I'd
understand it, I'd feel sympathy
even. But since it's me, I just
feel bad. And horribly critical.
I haven't been able to tell Claude
what's happening. And I have to.
I'm going to.
(frustrated)
How can I be all these people? How
can I be married to Jim. And fuck
Dick. And want them both and then
neither of them...
PAULINE
I know. We're at the age where
we're becoming invisible to men and
if a guy wants to fuck us, it's
very tempting.
MARGOT
What are you saying?
PAULINE
I'm saying, if you get your sense
of self from being fuckable and
that starts to wane -- it's very
hard. I almost had an affair too.
But you know, you don't have to do
it. You can, I don't know, get a
manicure or something.
70.
Margot grows furious.
She turns to hide her face.
PAULINE
You know I tell people you're my
closest friend. I really miss you.
MARGOT
(barely)
Me too.
PAULINE
But I can't help feeling that you
really came to my wedding because I
live a mile away from the guy
you're fucking.
MARGOT
Come on, Pauline. You make it
sound like I'm using you.
PAULINE
Yeah.
There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline
indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.
PAULINE
You have a...
Margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.
MARGOT
Did I get it?
PAULINE
Yeah, I think so.
MARGOT
(suddenly)
Paul, what are you doing getting
married to this guy? He's not good
enough for you. He's so coarse,
he's like guys we rejected when we
were sixteen. You know...don't
make a mistake like this.
(pause)
I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to
say that, but you know I'm truthful
so... Would you rather I lie?
PAULINE
Who should I be with then?
71.
A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures
turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground.
Garbage is strewn across the driveway.
MARGOT (O.S.)
Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.
I will call the police. This is
our property. Pick that up.
Pauline remains seated at the table, stunned.
Margot comes
back inside.
MARGOT
Creeps.
53
55
Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and
runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes.
MARGOT
Woa, don't run so fast.
CLAUDE
There's a boy! He bit me!
MARGOT
(alarmed)
Who bit you?
CLAUDE
A boy.
A Vogler!
Where's Ingrid?
74.
MARGOT
Let me see.
He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck.
There are red and purple bite marks.
MARGOT
(rising)
I'm calling the police.
Claude grabs her arm.
CLAUDE
No, don't! It'll get worse. Why
did you say anything to them?
MARGOT
Claude, this isn't my fault.
CLAUDE
That boy bit me because you
couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.
MARGOT
Claude, you're being a jerk.
CLAUDE
You shit in your shoes and then you
fuck them!
Margot smacks Claude in the face.
Ingrid stares wide eyed.
56
56
A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick
Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude
admire the display of Margot's books.
PAULINE
You really want to know? I'll tell
you. She wrote a story about Lenny
and me.
(flips through pages)
Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were
talking almost every day at this
point and there was no warning.
Maybe a couple of remarks that
she'd used some things of ours...
Then The New Yorker comes -- we
have a subscription -- and there's
the story and... It's things we
said and did -- stuff I told her in
confidence.
(MORE)
75.
PAULINE (CONT'D)
I think it helped end our marriage.
I read it and thought, "She hates
me."
CLAUDE
She doesn't hate you.
Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister.
PAULINE
You think? Margot tried to murder
me when we were girls. She put me
on a baking sheet, sprinkled me
with paprika and put me in the
oven.
57
CUT TO:
57
The crowd files in.
Margot and Dick stand in a corner.
MARGOT
Jim was here.
Dick flips through some notes.
DICK
Is Jim still writing?
MARGOT
(nods)
I told him to go to Vermont without
me.
DICK
I'd love to see him tell a linear
story for a change. Jim never
wanted to make it easy for the
reader, did he. The nicest man
I've ever met, but he can't play
the game.
MARGOT
I'm not joining him. I'm going to
stay here and then...we'll see.
Right. Okay?
DICK
I didn't ask you to do that.
(pause)
The guy's pointing at us...
76.
58
CUT TO:
58
Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of
rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain.
Pauline and Claude sit in the back.
DICK
I'm very interested in your story
"Middle Children."
Some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets
started.
DICK
The father is a loathsome character
yet we also feel a strange sympathy
for him.
MARGOT
Yeah, well I was very interested in
exploring a father-daughter
relationship. While he clings
desperately to her, suffocates her
really, he also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood.
DICK
There's this sexualized push-pull
with Daphne which I find --
MARGOT
He craves isolation really. I
always thought of him as someone
who so over identifies with
everyone around him that he begins
to lose all sense of himself.
DICK
You make his only recourse to
abandon his family, including his
beloved daughter.
MARGOT
Right, that's true.
That's true.
DICK
I write historical fiction so I
don't have to answer to this, but I
wonder for someone who writes so
nakedly about family, how
autobiographical is this portrait?
Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.
77.
MARGOT
My father was a loving person. He
had his days, of course, but...he
was devoted to us as children. I
wouldn't have written this portrait
were it true.
Pauline nods slightly.
DICK
But I'm interested in how the
father could be in fact a portrait
of you.
Margot stares, dumbstruck.
MARGOT
Umm...I don't... Why do you assume
it's based on... We all take from
life. I had to have our
refrigerator repaired the other day
at our apartment in Manhattan. I
was alone with a guy, I think he
was Puerto Rican, sent over
by...Whirlpool, I think it is who
made our fridge. Although he said
he worked for an independent
organization who Whirlpool
subcontracts. I think he was
retarded. There was an anger in
him and suddenly I became afraid
for my life. I called Jim at NYU.
I asked him to come home.
Margot stops.
Her face is awash in sweat.
Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest.
His
eyes widen, fixed on his mother.
MARGOT
It might be Frigidaire... I'm
sorry... I don't... I'm not sure
what I'm... I think I need to take
a moment...
She stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still
has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat.
MARGOT
(almost incoherently)
You're an asshole...
78.
59
59
Margot grabs a pill from her pocket, puts it on her tongue
and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot
opens the door. Claude looks up at her. Pauline and Dick
wait in the background.
MARGOT
I need to be alone right now, okay?
CLAUDE
What's wrong?
MARGOT
I don't know. I'll tell you
sometime. Go on.
CLAUDE
Are you sure?
MARGOT
Yes. Go with mom.
I'll see you
later.
CLAUDE
You said, mom.
MARGOT
(snapping)
But you know what I mean. Go with
Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need
to spell it out for you?
(she points)
Go. With. Her.
60
60
A simple, spare space, empty except for Pauline and Claude.
PAULINE
Are you okay?
CLAUDE
I'm okay.
PAULINE
You're your mom's favorite.
Do you
know that?
CLAUDE
I don't think she has a favorite.
79.
PAULINE
She's always liked you best.
More
than Jim even.
CLAUDE
But they're married.
It's
different.
PAULINE
But she still loves you best. It's
hard, I think, to find people in
the world you love more than your
family.
CLAUDE
I like Malcolm.
PAULINE
Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do
too.
(pause)
I can teach you to swim if you
like.
CLAUDE
No, thanks.
Claude looks at the floor. His sneaker rests next to her
open toed sandals. She taps his foot with hers.
PAULINE
Has your mother talked to you yet?
CLAUDE
I don't think so.
About what?
PAULINE
Are you okay? It's hard to see
your mom like that -- get attacked
like that. Right? It was mean
what he did. I think it was really
shitty.
CLAUDE
Mm hm.
PAULINE
You know, I think your mom's going
through a rough time right now
and...whatever she tells you...like
if she says she's leaving your
father...remember that she often
changes her mind and...
(MORE)
80.
PAULINE (CONT'D)
I don't want you to worry about
anything right now.
Claude says nothing.
61
64
Pauline enters in a daze.
A toilet flushes.
Maisy comes out
of Pauline's bathroom.
MAISY
Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I
hope that's okay I used yours.
Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove
grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.
MAISY
I love your wedding dress.
It's so
unconventional and great.
Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at
the pictures too.
Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.
Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right
behind her.
MAISY
Is everything okay?
87.
PAULINE
(pause)
Nothing.
Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the
staircase playing with a string.
MAISY
Claude, do you want to play
croquet?
CLAUDE
Okay.
Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower
back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy
turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.
Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.
Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.
65
67
Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers,
silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows.
MARGOT
Come with me to New York.
PAULINE
I can't talk about it --
MARGOT
Okay, but you can't marry him. You
have to go now. We can think about
what to do with the baby --
PAULINE
(stands)
Margot, I can't --
MARGOT
Don't turn vague, listen to me --
PAULINE
I want you to pack all your things
and get out of here. You can take
our car and leave it at the ferry.
MARGOT
(startled)
What?
CLAUDE
I'll help out more.
I can make
popovers.
Pauline looks at Claude strangely.
She leans down and kisses
him on the lips.
PAULINE
Do you love me?
(Claude nods)
Good.
90.
MARGOT
Don't take this out on me?
I'm on
your side.
PAULINE
No, you're not. You're not.
MARGOT
I've kept my mouth shut because --
PAULINE
No, you haven't kept your mouth
shut! No you haven't...kept your
mouth shut...
MARGOT
Okay, I told you and I was right.
He's done an insane thing. You
don't know this man. What he did
is criminal.
PAULINE
Margot, I can't...
MARGOT
It's pedophilia.
PAULINE
Get out!
Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the
table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their
breathing.
PAULINE
Becky and I talk about you -- about
what a monster you are. Is it
cause Mom gave me the house? Can't
I have anything? What was I
thinking? I let you in. Get!
Out!
MARGOT
What? What are you saying? I
don't recognize you -- it's like
you're channelling someone.
PAULINE
(suddenly)
Ingrid!
91.
68
69
The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the
steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit
stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.
CLAUDE
I thought you couldn't drive.
MARGOT
(irritated)
I can drive. Why does everyone say
that? I used to drive.
They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.
The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:
PAULINE
We have to call people and cancel.
INGRID
What happened? Can I still sing?
Margot rolls down the window.
MARGOT
(to Claude)
You do smell.
CLAUDE
Well, I'm not wearing any
deodorant.
They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend.
The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the
brake.
MARGOT
Shit.
CLAUDE
What?
93.
MARGOT
I don't think...
(she pumps again)
No... We don't have brakes.
PAULINE
(resigned)
The brakes are bad, that's right.
CLAUDE
What does that mean?
MARGOT
What do you think it means?
CLAUDE
I mean, what can we do?
The car coasts faster down the hill.
CLAUDE
Mom.
Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.
Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.
Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck.
The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
a tree.
70
CUT TO:
70
Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony
white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down.
They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their
feet and ankles.
MARGOT
I ruined these shoes.
Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.
She races
behind a tree. Margot follows.
INGRID
Mom, are you okay?
PAULINE (O.S.)
Don't look!
Margot stops.
94.
PAULINE (O.S.)
Shit!
INGRID
Mom, what happened?
PAULINE (O.S.)
Nothing.
Margot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow
behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt.
She tosses them in the brush.
PAULINE
Fuck.
Margot turns to the kids.
Ingrid hides a smile.
CLAUDE
Did she poop in her pants?
MARGOT
It happens to everyone. Not just
babies. It'll happen to you too
someday.
71
73
A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall
carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double
beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the
other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot
stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in
a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink
drips.
MARGOT
Sweety, there's a bus that leaves
to Vermont from town tomorrow
morning. I just talked to your dad
and he's going to pick you up.
CLAUDE
Aren't you coming?
MARGOT
No.
CLAUDE
Why not?
MARGOT
I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.
Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet.
CLAUDE
I don't want to go tomorrow.
The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting.
Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are
already looking out.
Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed
in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
coffins.
96.
PAULINE
There's Malcolm.
Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see
it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of
tears.
PAULINE
I can't live in that house alone.
MARGOT
You're going to be fine.
PAULINE
Maybe...maybe I could get a place
in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or
something. People are living there
right?
MARGOT
You don't want to live there.
It's
all young people.
PAULINE
But what do you think of that idea?
MARGOT
Maybe. Let's see. You know if you
don't want to come with me, I'm
sure mom will let you stay with her
--
PAULINE
(through tears)
You're already trying to pass me
off on mom...
MARGOT
Don't say that. Come on, you'll
come home with us.
PAULINE
You don't even know where you're
going to live. You might have to
move in with mom too.
Margot tightens.
PAULINE
What? Oh.
(mouthing a whisper)
Didn't you tell him?
97.
Margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the
window.
74
CUT TO:
74
Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall.
She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.
PAULINE
What have I done? What have I
done?
Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few
stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of
signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She
puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She
watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.
CLAUDE
What?
MARGOT
Nothing. Just then I felt so much
love for you.
75
CUT TO:
75
Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits
on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline
marches around and across to the other side of the room. She
snatches the book out of Margot's hands.
MARGOT
Hey!
PAULINE
You cannot write about this.
You
can't have it.
MARGOT
I wasn't writing about you.
PAULINE
You already took a part of my life,
you can't have any more. And that
goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and
Wizard. We all own our own rights.
They're not for sale.
MARGOT
Give it back.
98.
Pauline glances at the book.
PAULINE
If I could read your handwriting
I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I
ever see a story that involves a
hotel room or any of this shit, I
will fucking take your bowels out.
Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --
CUT TO:
The kids sleep in one bed.
Margot and Pauline lie awake in
the other.
PAULINE
You've now successfully ruined two
of my marriages.
MARGOT
You're not wearing any underwear.
PAULINE
It's hot, I'm pregnant.
Move over.
Jesus.
MARGOT
You're not hot, your feet are cold.
PAULINE
Stop touching me. I am so hot.
Feel my head.
Margot puts her lips to Pauline's forehead.
MARGOT
You have a fever.
PAULINE
I don't have a fever... I'm
pregnant...are you always like
this?
MARGOT
Get used to it... Mom and Becky
share a bed -- you and I will
probably get the other.
PAULINE
You should just go to Vermont.

MARGOT
I was thinking -- you know if you
want -- you and Ingrid could go to
Vermont. Keep Claude company and
Jim adores you.
PAULINE
You don't like Malcolm because
you're not attracted to him.
MARGOT
Will you do it?
PAULINE
No. I won't do that for you.
MARGOT
(pause)
Did you two talk about me in town?
What did you say?
PAULINE
(pause)
I told him you often change your
mind.

Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.
Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot
drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids
have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
plastic red basket lie between them.
A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The
music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen
Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:
MARGOT
I'm sorry, sweety. There's
something wrong with me.
PAULINE
I'm going to call him.
Margot quickly turns to her sister.
MARGOT
No.
Don't. I'm telling you.
100.
PAULINE
I...I need some clothes and things.
MARGOT
He should get the hell out of our
house.
PAULINE
Okay. I'll tell him to get the
hell out of our house.
Pauline walks over to a pay phone.
77
CUT TO:
77
Pauline holds the receiver to her ear. She stares at a
drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the
pay phone. Malcolm is crying.
MALCOLM'S VOICE
The tent looks so lonely.
PAULINE
It has no one to get married in it.

Malcolm sits in the grass, the tree and wreckage behind him.
MALCOLM
I know. And it's smashed. I'm
such a fucking idiot. Please don't
take me seriously. I mean take me
seriously, but not the fucked up
parts, you know. I love you so
much. Please marry me.
PAULINE
You can't do what you did again.
Do you understand?
MALCOLM
I promise.
PAULINE
No matter how tempting.
At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent-
mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it
onto the floor.
Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to
Claude.
101.
INGRID
You left it in my room.
It's a piece of fingernail.
He hesitates then puts it in his
pocket.
At the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall.
Malcolm is bawling on the other end.
PAULINE
I don't know. I don't know.
Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:
MALCOLM
I ate some of the cake.
I don't
know why, but I did it.
PAULINE
What was... How was it?
MALCOLM
Good.
PAULINE
It's not too sweet? They sometimes
make their stuff too sweet.
MALCOLM
Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't
even notice... They fucked up the
cake. How sad. I love our little
baby. I miss you.
PAULINE
I miss you too. Maybe we should do
another seminar.
Malcolm says something incomprehensible.
PAULINE
I can't understand you, honey.
Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her
sister.
INGRID
There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
Margot startles and looks out the window. Across the street
is an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating
ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.
102.
PAULINE
They didn't get my message.
Pauline now stands above them.
MARGOT
I told you she can't work the
machine --
Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands.
She takes her mother's
hand. Margot remains seated.
PAULINE
What?
You're not coming?
MARGOT
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What did
he say?
Pauline and Ingrid head for the door.
Claude waits for
Margot.
MARGOT
What did he say?
She grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table.
MARGOT
(to herself)
Don't worry, I got it.

81
Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.
He
puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.
Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her
ear and shakes her head.
The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
pavement. She starts walking.
The bus hisses and lurches forward.
Claude strains to see:
Margot looks back.
The bus groans as it picks up speed.
Margot sprints.
MARGOT
Wait!
She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.
MARGOT
Wait!
Wait!
She pants, breathless.
The bus brakes.
She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.
Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and
panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.
MARGOT
(almost euphoric)
Did you see me running out there?
CLAUDE
Yeah.
Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
MARGOT
Good. That was a lot of running.
I'm out of breath.
Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.
