Fog.
Penetrated only by sound.
The LAPPING of sea at a drifting
hull.
Tendrils of mist part, revealing...
...a face.
Strong and blond and handsome.
SUPERIMPOSE:
SEPTEMBER 15, 1954
LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross
spar of his mast.
He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber
overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN
TITLES BEGIN...
ANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.
Empty, silent.
A tin
COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.
The battery well open, revealing
two large BATTERIES in place.
PAN to...
...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.
The fishing net stretched
from the huge DRUM into the sea.
Keep PANNING to the bow, where...
...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching
as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.
The silhouette of a
FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.
As fragments of fog part,
we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...
...his eyes.
They are Asian.
SMASH CUT to...
Blinding sun.
Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.
As CREDITS
CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.
SHERIFF ART
MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.
Only the eyes
reflect his disquiet.
His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts
anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.
As the net brings
silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...
...the cabin.
Tidy as before.
Only two things have changed.
CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the
floor.
PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE
BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.
CUT to...
...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface...
...the face of Carl Heine.
Turned to the sun.
SMASH CUT to...
Snow falling on cedars.
SUPERIMPOSE:
DECEMBER 6.
The heavens descend softly onto our island.
Exquisite, silent,
hypnotic.
An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against
the limitless scope of nature.
As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of
QUICK ANGLES...
...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned
school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...
...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens
waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...
...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels
blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building
a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,
and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...
...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and
flawless as the Sahara...
Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,
people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we
FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...
Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young SONS dash around the
corner of the house.
Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold.
Silent,
shirtless, barefoot.
MORAN
Hey there, men.
Is your mother
home a-tall?
He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper.
And as the younger boy
nods across the distance...
SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)
Sheriff Moran, hullo.
She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's
diaper across her shoulder.
And he smiles back.
Tells the boys...
MORAN
You go on and play, now.
But they don't.
So he follows into her entryway, closing the door
behind him.
And at the foot of her curving staircase...
SUSAN MARIE
What can I do for you, Sheriff,
Carl's not home y...
MORAN
That's...
Too quick.
He stops himself.
And she sees that.
MORAN
It's why I'm here.
I'm afraid I
have some...very bad news to tell
you, the...worst...kind of news.
She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to
fade, before...
MORAN
Carl died last night.
In a fishing
accident.
In White Sand Bay.
She only blinks.
As if translating the words from a foreign
language.
SUSAN MARIE
No, Carl's fine, h...
MORAN
We found him, Mrs. Heine.
Tangled
in his net.
And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she
stumbles back one step, sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of
her curved staircase.
He doesn't know what to do.
She digs her elbows into her lap, and
begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands.
Her
face is more terrible than tears.
It is frightened.
She murmurs
to herself, so that we can barely hear...
SUSAN MARIE
I told him this could happen.
Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf.
Purpose in his stride...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
A gill-netter works through black
nights with only himself to talk
to.
And learns to be silent.
They were lonely men and products
of geography.
Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.
Moran stands
chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
...men who, on occasion, realized
that they wished to speak, but
couldn't.
As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.
Not happy to see him.
Of course, neither is anyone else.
MORAN
Figure you'da heard by now.
Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.
WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a
sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp
cigar butt.
GJOVAAG
You go fishing, it happens.
ISHMAEL (to Moran)
You see Susan Marie?
MORAN
I did.
Boy.
ISHMAEL
Three kids.
What's she going to do?
GJOVAAG (disgusted)
Well, what can she do?
Jesus Christ.
ISHMAEL
Excuse me, Gjovaag.
GJOVAAG
I don't need to excuse nothin'.
Fuck you anyhow, Chambers.
Everybody laughs.
It is all good-natured, sort of.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Like the Sheriff, I did not work
the sea, and could never merit trust.
Or respect.
MARTY JOHANSSON
Sheriff's been askin' which boats
followed Carl out last night...
MORAN (quickly)
Only to see if somebody talked to
him out th...
ISHMAEL
So who talked to him?
Out there.
Staring.
At each other.
Eye contact holds during...
JAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish)
So far, we figured the guys who went
to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry,
Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto...
GJOVAAG (spits)
Japs.
MORAN
All right, look, if you see these
boys...
GJOVAAG
Never saw you so hard-ass, Art.
Ain't this just an accident?
Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's.
Which are right there,
waiting.
Moran looks away.
MORAN
Course it is, but a man's dead,
William.
I got to write my report.
ANGLE...Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf.
The
Sheriff is worried.
Finally...
MORAN
I'm not gonna see some article
about an investigation, am I?
ISHMAEL (quietly)
You want me to lie?
MORAN
No, I wanna be off the damn record,
that's what I want.
No answer.
They keep walking.
MORAN
I mean, if there is a killer, why
would you want him all alerted?
Silence.
Silence.
And slowly...
ISHMAEL
Let's say...someday I need some
cooperation from you on this thing.
Do I get it?
And looks over.
Like the guy holding all the aces.
Mist of early light.
Two dark figures, little more than
silhouettes, measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs.
We may think of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, for one is a full-
grown man.
The other, eight years old.
Dialogue plays in
subtitled JAPANESE...
ZENHICHI
Hips, stomach, cut.
Stomach muscles
tighten as stroke advances...
And STRIKES a fearsome blow, which the child REPELS with startling
proficiency.
We can see ZENHICHI's stony face, now.
If he is
impressed by his son, he does not show it.
ZENHICHI
Elbow soft, or there is no follow-
through.
You cut your bokken off
from the power of your body, unl...
WHAP!
WHAP!
WHAP!
The boy LASHES fiercely, the man parrying each
stroke with blinding ease.
ZENHICHI
Hips sink more.
Less weight on the
heels, so tha...
CRASH!
The father has sent a blow in mid-word, FLINGING the child
like a doll.
The boy BOUNCES up, snatching his bokken into ready
position.
ZENHICHI (very quiet)
Zenshin.
Is constant awareness.
Of dang...
WHAP!
The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his
father's HEAD.
It has been blocked.
The staffs rest against each
other, just above Zenhichi's ear.
There is no anger in either
warrior.
That we can see.
ZENHICHI
Elbow soft.
A little better.
LATER...father and son sit on the ground, eating a small meal.
The sun has risen, angling light across the undulating fields.
They are alone in beauty.
A long silence.
Dialogue in subtitled
JAPANESE...
ZENHICHI
You can be good with the bokken.
If you begin to concentrate.
Eyes on his food.
As if alone, as if speaking to himself.
The boy
darting glances, unseen, at his father's profile.
ZENHICHI
You must choose now, Kabuo.
At eight
years.
If you want this.
KABUO (boldly)
I want it.
The father keeps eating.
Never turns.
ZENHICHI
Then speak quietly.
So you may be
heard.
Stars above a desert.
Wind gusts.
PAN barbed wire, rows of dark
barracks blurred by swirling dust, to...
...a fragile tar paper structure, its 'walls' rippling pre-
cariously.
And inside, to see that it is...
Hatsue and Ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered
in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree.
They watch the rain as
it pummels the woods around them.
She is speaking, carefully,
thoughtfully.
He listens with complete attention.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
She would tell me stories of
this woman and her lessons.
As
if complaining, or at least ex-
plaining her world...
He shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes
him reflexively pull away.
She seems not to notice.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
But I always fantasized.
The
lessons were for me.
Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of
what seems a festive carnival.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
He was, for better or worse, the
only God in my life.
I guess it's
our nature to resent those we know
we can never measure up to...
They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games.
A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races
heedlessly mingling.
A community.
Arthur unselfconsciously slips
his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
...which keeps us from accepting
the warmth.
The way we should.
Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse.
Something's up.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Every summer, after harvest, the
Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-
ite story to cover.
Good news was
his preference.
Making him an oddity
among journalists.
As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the
courthouse steps.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
Princess.
Always a Japanese girl,
sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
to the concept of racial harmony.
We are there now.
Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael
would use years later.
Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the
crown on the radiant young girl...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Senior Year.
It was Hatsue.
And as the applause ripples through the crowd.
As the Strawberry
Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on...
...Ishmael.
She drops him a wink.
And a special wave.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
She winked at me.
In public.
Which was unusual.
Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach.
Digging for clams in the mud.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I had kissed her once, when we
were ten.
Looking at fish through
a glass-bottomed box.
It was just
an impulse, and no big deal.
Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to
reach down.
We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in
geoduck clam.
HATSUE
He's still got a good grip.
We
need to dig more.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
At school, she kept mostly to the
Japanese kids, and sort of ignored
me.
As if all of our times alone
together...in the hollow cedar,
everywhere...were a secret.
They are digging now, together.
Carefully.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I told myself that was good.
That
it made our friendship special.
And
didn't mean she was ashamed of it.
Necessarily.
HATSUE
Easy.
Slow is best.
Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I thought about her.
Sometimes,
all the time.
I knew I was unhappy.
But I knew if I told her...
She lifts it clear.
And as she admires its size and roughness with
her fingertips.
As she washes it in the shallows.
He watches her
movements.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
It might be a mistake.
I could
never correct.
ISHMAEL (quietly)
I like you.
The words make her turn.
Not startled, exactly.
Alerted.
But
neutral, without affect.
ISHMAEL
Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?
I've always liked you.
There is no answer.
He leans slightly closer, and she looks
down.
This is the moment.
Afraid and driven, he moves slowly
to her face.
And puts his mouth against hers.
She lets him and,
encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...
...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to
support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a
long moment, before...
...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the
beach like a deer.
He stands slowly.
To watch her go.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I knew in my heart that we would
love each other forever.
His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.
Contemplating this truth.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
The way she kissed me.
She knew
it, too.
Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
She avoided me for a week.
Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the
porch.
Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry
from the line.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
So this way, I could see her
without...bothering anyone.
He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching
the clothespins in her teeth.
Then reeling the line again, elegant
hand over elegant hand...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I was certain everything would
work out.
She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before
heading inside.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
And frightened.
Children working fields in sunlight.
Kneeling in the rows.
Hatsue
with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly
sheened with sweat.
She works with efficiency and grace, filling
her flat.
Three rows away.
Ishmael watches.
The fear not far beneath the
surface of his quiet, dark features.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
By two weeks, I knew I had made
the defining mistake of my life.
Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks
DOWN rapidly at his work.
Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.
Which she is not.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I'd ruined everything.
LATER...end of day.
The young pickers turning in their flats as a
gentle rain begins.
Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her
pocket, and...
...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.
Ishmael sees.
Stricken to his soul with longing.
And indecision.
Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of
the hollow cedar.
The rain is driving now, and she glances up.
At something we don't see.
And watches it.
Finally...
HATSUE
You followed me, huh?
PULL BACK to see him.
Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.
She
is waiting for an answer.
So...
ISHMAEL
Sorry.
It sort of...happened, I
just...I followed you.
I'm sorry.
She pulls her hair behind her ears.
A movement which stretches her
body.
HATSUE
I'm all wet.
She starts refastening her hair now, looking away.
He comes
inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can.
Which is
close.
He watches her, watches her, and...
ISHMAEL
I'm sorry I kissed you on
the beach.
No reaction.
As if she hasn't heard.
Now his heart is beating
straight through his chest.
ISHMAEL
Let's just forget about it.
Forget it happened.
She picks up her damp straw hat.
And, eyes down, tracing a finger
around its brim...
HATSUE
Don't be sorry.
I'm not sorry
about it.
His heart bursts within him.
And he struggles to keep it from his
face.
Even though she isn't watching.
ISHMAEL
Me neither.
She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile.
It is
genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy.
She lies back on
the ground.
Her eyes so unafraid and direct.
HATSUE
Do you think this is wrong?
He swallows.
Staring at her lying there so comfortably.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
The best part was that there was a
'this'.
To debate the wrongness of.
ISHMAEL
Your friends would.
Your dad would
kill me with a machete.
HATSUE
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.
He'll slice you up with a ceremonial
sword.
Ah.
Better.
They are both grinning now.
HATSUE
My mom.
Would be the problem.
ISHMAEL
Why?
We're only talking.
Her eyes flicker.
The synapse that a woman can offer a man.
HATSUE (softly)
Sure.
And touches his hand.
With her fingertips.
The barest whisper...
HATSUE
I can't hear you.
Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue.
Kisses her mouth with all
the tenderness in him.
This time, her eyes close gently.
And her
body arches slightly, into his.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
We kissed for half an hour, that
first time.
And I knew there would
never be another day like it.
Rain POUNDING now.
A curtain of water, sealing them from the
world.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
No matter how long I lived.
Mist of moments before dawn.
As tendrils part, there is enough
light to see...
...eyes.
They are Asian.
They are razor-keen.
PULL BACK to
reveal...
...Kabuo alone in G.I. gear and helmet.
Rifle up high, sweat
on his face, moving soundlessly, turning in a circle as he goes,
until...
...he stops.
A heartbeat of silence.
Then...
...the BLAST of automatic tracer TEARS through trees, as he WHIRLS
and RETURNS FIRE in a single motion, until...
Silence.
His heart is pounding.
He waits.
Waits.
Weapon at the ready, he
pushes THROUGH the dense foliage to see...
...the 15-year-old German SOLDIER, splayed on the forest floor, his
chest torn and bloodied.
Kabuo's gaze LOCKS with the boy's.
The
young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as
Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly...
...INTO view, metal GLINTING in motion, as Kabuo...
...BLOWS the boy AWAY with staccato rifle BURSTS that JUMP the
already-lifeless body like an electric jolt.
And falling from the
kid's hand, not a pistol, but...
...ID TAGS.
No expression on Kabuo's face.
None at all.
He moves on.
Ole sits in a wicker chair at a wicker table.
His wife LIESEL is
setting out cold drinks.
But their visitor stands rigid,
disbelieving.
LIESEL
I'm sorry to tell you, we took his
earnest money, he shook Ole's hand.
Come November, he'll sell his boat,
and take over the farm.
Kabuo is thunderstruck.
KABUO
But your sign...
OLE
We din't have no time to take it down.
He just come ten o'clock.
Kabuo nods.
His voice is soft, but his eyes are steel.
KABUO
It's my fault.
I should have come
earlier.
He looks so odd, perhaps he's ill.
Liesel looks concerned.
OLE
If you want t'buy them seven
acres.
Carl Heine's the only
fella can sell 'em.
Safe within their haven, the 18-year-olds kiss and hold each other
urgently.
Their tongues exploring each other's mouth, her legs
open beneath her skirt, pressing her body up against him.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I gave her all of my soul to love.
I knew someday we would live in
France.
Italy.
Somewhere.
Far
from the things that upset her.
ANGLE...later, they lie so quietly.
Her head nestled in the crook
of his arm, he gently plays with her hair.
Her face so still, so
thoughtful and grave.
ISHMAEL (a murmur)
You don't have to be so tragic,
you know.
Ah.
Her dark eyes flicker.
HATSUE (dry)
Kind of magical, the way you know
how to comfort a girl.
She cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his.
HATSUE
I can just feel my spirits soar.
ISHMAEL
Well, I don't do it for just
anybody.
And kisses her head.
But her eyes still stare off into the tangle
of her worries.
He draws a breath...
ISHMAEL
There can't be any wrong in
this, Ha...
HATSUE
I lie to my parents every day.
And every night.
His light tone against the fear...
ISHMAEL
Well.
Since I never told your
folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em,
too.
But you don't hear me
complaining about it.
She winds her fingers with his.
Loyalty against her doubt.
Very soft with...
HATSUE
I'm in awe.
Of your strength.
They walk slowly up the path.
An arm around each other's waist,
their bodies brushing as they go...
HATSUE
My father can't get our money from
the bank.
We have a few dol...
ISHMAEL
It'll be over soon.
I can get
you money.
She stops.
By a weathered fence, covered in vines.
It's growing
dark.
HATSUE
It's not going to get better, okay?
She sighs.
He moves close, looks so grave.
HATSUE
They arrested Mr. Shirazaki,
because his farm is near a navy
transmitter.
And his family can't
leave their house.
What can he say.
ISHMAEL
It's just Pearl Harbor.
People
are a little crazy, right n...
HATSUE
Look at my face.
It's the face of
the people who did that.
My father
hardly speaks English.
We're in
bad trouble, you have to see that.
He reaches.
Touches this face that he loves with all his heart.
Forces up a smile.
ISHMAEL
Maybe we can fix your eyes.
She leans up.
CROSSES her eyes in a goofy expression.
Then kisses
his mouth.
When she pulls back...
ISHMAEL
Don't let this hurt us, okay?
Whatever happens.
And she studies this boy.
Knowing more than he can ever
understand.
And chooses to whisper...
HATSUE
It won't.
You'll see.
They lie so close.
Their bodies touching, not moving.
Their faces
inches apart, so that every word is a murmur...
HATSUE
You're like me.
You've learned
to be devious.
He's never seen her this fragile, this scared.
He knows he has to
be strong for her.
ISHMAEL
It's not devious, it's what we have
to do.
You're leaving tomorrow...
He unties her hair.
So gently.
Tries to keep his smile calm,
steady...
ISHMAEL
You write to my house, and put
Kenny Yamashita's name on the
return address.
It's no big deal.
He brings his face to her hair.
Kisses it.
ISHMAEL
You smell like cedar.
Her eyes are wide.
They move over his face.
A murmured...
HATSUE
So do you.
It's your smell I'll
miss as much as anything.
He looks in her eyes.
And words come from his heart, before he can
stop them...
ISHMAEL
Let's get married, okay?
Her eyes fill with tears.
Are they from happiness?
ISHMAEL
I want to marry you.
Is that okay?
Her face so still.
One tear falls, and he kisses it.
ISHMAEL (a whisper)
Just say yes.
No answer.
Not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his
head, and brings him nearer.
His mouth opens into hers, with more
force, more of his heart, than he has ever given.
Deep and tender.
His hands reach beneath her dress...
...peel her panties down her thighs...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
When something that means your
whole life.
Is the last time ever...
And suddenly, he is OVER her, drawing her legs up around him...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
God should tell you.
Or it's not
fair.
Her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed.
And as he enters
her...
ISHMAEL (whispers)
Please say yes...
...her hands GRASP his upper arms.
And push away.
HATSUE (softly)
No.
And he blinks.
As if waking from a dream.
Everything has stopped.
Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.
HATSUE
No.
No.
It isn't right.
So he draws away.
Stunned, uncomprehending.
Watching with blank
eyes, as she stares up at him.
Then, with dignity and tenderness,
he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...
ISHMAEL
It felt right to me.
It felt
like getting married.
She draws her legs up.
Kneeling now, putting her hands on his
face...
But no words come.
No words.
Until...
HATSUE
I'll write you.
And KISSES him fiercely, and BOLTS up before he can grab her,
RUNNING off like a deer, while he...
...kneels.
His mouth open.
Like a silent scream.
An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air.
Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four
sisters climb from the truck, to see...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
On Monday, March 30, 1942, the
United States Army graciously
transported the Imada women to
the docks.
...a ferry, the KEHLOKEN, stands waiting.
Soldiers are dis-
tributing tags for luggage and coats.
The evacuees, mostly women,
stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other.
And
lined against the railing...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Lifelong neighbors came to watch.
Curiosity masked as kindness...
...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors
file toward the ferry.
A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who
casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.
And
just as they reach the gangway...
...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance,
among a group of students.
She pauses.
Her eyes hold his for a
heartbeat...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
...with some exceptions.
The wisp of a smile.
And she is gone.
Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.
Snow is no
longer falling.
She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively.
The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain
impenetrability of her Asian exterior.
She closes her eyes, and...
...draws deep on the smoke.
The act seems to cause her pain.
When
the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.
Nowhere to turn.
The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto
the snow.
Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her
feet against the cold, the helplessness.
And looks out...
...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered
moonlight, become...
...a moonlit DESERT.
PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks,
the desolation.
Come to...
...two women walking alone.
The younger one glancing at her mother
as they go.
Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead.
The barracks, everything, in distance behind them.
HATSUE
You think we're far enough
away now?
No sarcasm in the voice.
She lets the words carry her irony.
Her mother stops.
Looks at her so directly, so strong.
Even her
tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.
HATSUE
Mom, whatever this is, they don't
keep war secrets this carefully.
Fujiko thinks that over.
Nods.
FUJIKO
Secrets are hard to keep.
She goes over to a large, flat rock.
Sits down.
Pulls two sheets
of paper from her coat.
And waits.
As her daughter comes and
crouches at her feet.
Fujiko clears her throat.
FUJIKO
This letter.
Was opened.
By mistake.
And watches.
As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.
Silence.
Then...
FUJIKO (reads)
'My love.
I still go to our
cedar tree in the afternoons every
day.
I shut my eyes, waiting.'
Hatsue has turned to stone.
To ice.
Wind blows.
FUJIKO (reads)
'I smell your smell.
And I dream
of you.
And I ache for you to come
home.
So I can hold you and feel
you near.'
Fujiko scans the page silently.
Turns to the second...
FUJIKO (reads)
'After all these years that we've
been together, I find you're a
part of me.
Without you, I have
nothing.
All my love, forever...'
And looks up.
Her eyes calm, quiet.
FUJIKO
The neighborhood boy.
Who taught
you to swim?
The look holds.
And holds.
HATSUE
You shouldn't have opened that.
It was mi...
FUJIKO (so quiet)
How deceitful of me.
Anger only at the edges.
Like finely-honed steel.
FUJIKO
How can I ever hope.
For your
forgiveness.
The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.
They seem not to
notice.
FUJIKO
I have written this letter to
the boy's parents...
She pulls out a single page.
Hands it down to her daughter.
Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.
FUJIKO
Attraction is no crime, certainly
among children.
The dishonor
lies in the concealment.
From
your families.
Watches her daughter reading.
And quietly...
FUJIKO
I know that you know this.
I know
you have suffered.
Even if the
hakujin could not.
Silence.
Hatsue's eyes cast down.
She folds the page.
FUJIKO
There will be no further letters.
No contact of any k...
And stops.
Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.
She looks
up.
Into her mother's shock.
HATSUE
One more letter.
I will write
it.
You may read it, and send
it for me.
Her mother's anger fades.
Into interest.
HATSUE
I deceived more than you.
I
deceived this sweet boy.
And
myself.
It was never love.
Never love.
The mother's face changes.
There is understanding,
acceptance.
Even pride.
HATSUE
I will work hard.
To earn your
forgiveness.
A sigh.
A sadness deep, beyond her years.
HATSUE
I can never hope for his.
Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch.
He draws from
his coat a black CIGAR.
Box of matches.
The cigar goes into his
mouth.
With amazing dexterity...
...he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the
wall, and still palming the box, STRIKES a match on the buckle of
his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical
puffs before the match dies.
He turns toward...
...the fields.
Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the
horizon.
Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become...
...the shimmering Pacific.
We are with Ishmael in an LCVP landing
craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon.
Bobbing past two
DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach.
Ishmael and his platoon
mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw
fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Her letter reached me on the North
Island of New Zealand.
So I had a
month to think it over...
Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other,
frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify-
ingly huge and near.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I wrote her four times.
'I hate
you with all my heart.
I hate you,
Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'
Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.
They are
still 300 yards from shore.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I never sent the letters.
I wanted
to kill as many Japs as possible.
SQUAD LEADER
MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT,
LET'S GO!!
The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side, Ishmael and others follow,
struggling with 85 pound packs.
As Ishmael hits the water, the
squad leader is SHOT in the face, a man five yards from Ishmael has
the top of his head BLOWN AWAY, men are DROPPING in numbers under
the WITHERING BURSTS of fire, the deafening ordnance sweeping over
the SHRIEKS of terror and agony, and Ishmael...
...submerges behind his pack, splashing hard, keeping its bulk
ahead of him as a shield, until he can wade and swim and plunge
toward shore, as hellfire CRASHES everywhere, dead bodies floating,
machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the water's surface, Ishmael at...
...the shallows now, men rising to make a run at the seawall, being
CUT DOWN, Ishmael crouching in the water, watching other men draw
fire, and in a moment's lull, four of them and Ishmael...
...GO for it, lungs BURSTING, pounding MADLY up the sand, one
SHOT DEAD, another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes down
writhing, as three men...
...MAKE IT to the wall.
Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and
fright.
They have no gear, no weapons.
One of them is Ishmael.
He looks back to...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.
Thirty yards away.
Bullets FLYING everywhere, CHEWING up the sand.
The young man
twitching, pleading...
BLEDSOE (crying)
Oh, shit, please, please help me
you guys, come on, help me, fucking
help me, PLEASE...!
And flat against the seawall, three men watch.
Not daring to look
at each other.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I knew nothing could save him.
Hell,
I didn't have so much as a band-aid.
I also knew I was a coward.
For not
giving up my life to try.
Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others.
Sixty or
so men mill in the shadow of the seawall.
The beach is littered
with dead marines and wounded, calling for help.
As Ishmael
glances up, a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall, cigarette dangling
from his mouth...
SERGEANT
You pussies are the kinda chickenshits
deserve to have your balls chewed
off real slow when this is over!
Stands with his hands on his hips.
The men below him properly
mesmerized.
SERGEANT
Any man who won't follow me over
this wall is a cornhole-fucker with
a half-inch hard-on wh...
The words CUT OFF by the shell that RIPS THROUGH his spine, OPENING
his shirt front as he PITCHES forward FLAT upon the sand.
No one looks.
No one speaks.
It never happened.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I wanted to live.
And I didn't
know why.
Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete.
PULL BACK to reveal
300 MARINES all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the
survivors of multiple landings.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Some colonel came down the beach.
Any man who didn't go over the wall
at 2100 would be court-martialed,
disgraced and imprisoned...
Every man lining up now, rifles at the ready.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
The captain who followed said shot
on sight.
They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified.
There is no interaction.
Each man dealing with his own insides.
And suddenly...
...squad leaders go OVER THE WALL, the firing ERUPTS, and three
hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it, mortar and machine-
gun BARRAGE lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees,
Ishmael SPRINTING, the man next to him goes DOWN, Ishmael TURNS
instinctively, and a shot...
...RIPS into his left bicep, SPINNING him OFF his feet in SLO-MO,
falling to dirt as all goes...
BLACK.
Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth.
By a shovel.
By a lantern.
This
place is shielded by trees.
PAN across the ground to...
...his father.
Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap
sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.
Wooden swords, hakama
pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.
Dialogue plays in
subtitled JAPANESE...
ZENHICHI
Your great-grandfather was a
samurai, a magnificent soldier.
The father never looks at the son.
Only at his work.
ZENHICHI
He killed himself.
On the
battlefield.
At Kumamoto.
The boy knows this.
Yet his entire being is focused on every word.
ZENHICHI
He went to battle with a sword.
Against rifles, mind you.
Knowing
what honor required.
An elegant SWORD.
Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light.
ZENHICHI
He was angry.
To the point of
being crazy, yes.
But he knew
what honor.
Required.
A separate sack, just for this.
Folded with respect.
ZENHICHI
Honor can require loyalty.
Revenge.
Death.
It goes into the ground.
With the others.
He seems nearly
overcome now.
By some emotion that sweeps through him.
Prompting
the boy to murmur...
KABUO
These are safe, father.
The
hakujin will never f...
ZENHICHI (quietly)
...it is the only scale...
Meaning, be still.
So the boy is still.
ZENHICHI
Only scale.
In which our worth.
Is weighed.
The man gazes into the hole.
At his treasures.
ZENHICHI
Every life ends.
And if it ends
dishonored.
It is as if...
And turns to his son.
To complete the words.
KABUO (in English)
...we have never lived.
There is love.
There is strength.
There is no more to say.
Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.
He is sliding a
new BATTERY into place.
Beside its older companion.
He bolts it
down.
Starts his engine.
He is visibly tense.
As he steps onto
the deck, he sees...
...two figures at the pilings.
Sheriff Moran makes a cutting
motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line.
MORAN
Cut your engine, we're coming
aboard.
Kabuo doesn't move.
The tension has fled beneath the surface.
His
face now a mask.
KABUO
What for, Sheriff?
MORAN
We have a warrant.
To search
your boat.
He holds it up.
Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything.
KABUO
Well, what are you looking f...
MORAN (calmly)
A murder weapon.
We think you
might be responsible for the death
of Carl Heine.
Kabuo blinks.
As if hearing a foreign language.
Words that do not
compute.
KABUO
Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl,
it sure as hell wasn't me.
Moran steps from the dock ONTO the boat, Abel awkwardly following.
MORAN
Then let's get this over with, so
you can get to fishin'.
Now, cut
yor engine.
And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across
everything.
Kabuo follows, killing the engine.
And in the sudden
silence, Moran's beam finds...
...the still-open battery well.
MORAN
You always run with the well open?
KABUO
I was checking the cables.
Moran's light moves over the batteries.
MORAN
D-6s, huh?
And says no more.
Runs his beam once more around the cabin.
MORAN
We'll come back, let's take a
look at the stern.
Off he goes.
Kabuo's glance goes to the open well.
Then follows,
noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow.
But in the stern,
Moran is shining his light.
Third cleat.
Port side.
MORAN
See you replaced a mooring line,
lately.
This one's new.
KABUO
Naw, I had that around for a while.
MORAN
Sure you did.
Help me with this
hold cover, willya?
So Kabuo slides the cover away.
They peer in.
KABUO
There's nothin' to see.
I need to
get out there fi...
ABEL (O.S.)
Art.
Looka this.
He has the fishing GAFF.
Three-and-a-half feet long.
Steel hook
at one end.
Hands it to Moran.
ABEL
There's blood on it.
KABUO
Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.
Moran carefully examines the object.
MORAN
You gaff with the hook end.
Blood's on the butt.
Where
your hand goes.
KABUO
Sure.
Blood gets all over your
hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Moran takes out a handkerchief.
Holds the gaff with it.
MORAN
Gonna have this tested.
Now you
go home, okay?
Wait til you hear
from me.
Kabuo's heart is racing.
KABUO
Sheriff, I can't afford not to
fish toni...
MORAN
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out
there.
In a half hour you could
be in Canada.
Kabuo's face has gone dead.
Which makes it seem somehow fierce,
almost threatening.
And the sheriff is watching that.
MORAN
I'm sorry, son.
But you're under
arrest.
The squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces,
surround Sgt. Maples.
He paces before them, holding up a wooden
staff, looking in their eyes...
MAPLES
Anyone.
And Kabup steps forward.
Bows slightly.
Then salutes...
KABUO
SIR!
Maples stares.
Hard.
MAPLES
You don't salute me, you don't
call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an
enlisted man.
Kabuo stares back.
Blank.
MAPLES
And nobody bows in this man's
Army, you're in America, son.
Not Japan.
KABUO
I'm sorry, sir, force of habit.
MAPLES
No more 'sir'.
That's the last
of that.
Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet.
A little hard.
As Kabuo
slips the helmet on...
MAPLES
The exercise is avoiding thrusts.
Now, first y...
KABUO (quietly)
Ready, sergeant.
Cut off in mid-word, Maples glares back.
Are you?
THRUSTS
sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more
than an inch.
Their eyes lock.
Suddenly, Maples unleashes...
...a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED, and Kabuo...
...SLIPS them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move.
As a man
might toy with a child.
Maples studies the face for any trace of
mockery.
And sees nothing at all.
STABS out, only to have Kabuo...
...SLASH Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to
be nearly invisible.
Maples clearly STUNNED by the display.
KABUO (quietly)
Excuse me.
He bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him.
And bows.
Slightly.
The sergeant is hot.
He looks into the faces of this
Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk.
There is none.
MAPLES
Are you ready for some simulated
combat, soldier?
KABUO
For combat.
Sergeant.
And Maples LUNGES with surprising speed, to be SWEPT off his feet
in a BLUR, lying FLAT on the earth, his head PINNED to the ground
by the tip of Kabuo's staff.
A hush.
Kabuo withdraws his staff.
Retrieves Maples'...
KABUO (just above a whisper)
Your weapon, sergeant.
And bows.
A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the
sea.
Ishmael's hand in his pocket.
Trudging toward it.
Ishmael at 24, crouched among trees.
Above a sunlit stretch of
beach.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I left the grocery, and wrote a
letter.
I apologizes from my heart.
I should never have said that word
to her.
I never would again.
CLOSE on his face.
Eyes gazing down.
At something.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
It sat in my desk for two weeks.
Before I threw it away.
He sighs.
Rises slowly.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I knew her car.
And sometimes
when I'd see it, I'd...drive that
way.
At a distance.
See Hatsue down on the beach.
Alone, raking for steamer clams.
Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella.
Ishmael walks down to the sand.
Crosses to where she works.
And
squats down.
At a respectful distance.
ISHMAEL
Can I talk to you?
She must have seen who was coming.
Because the words do not
startle her.
Or slow her work.
HATSUE
I'm married, Ishmael.
It isn't
right for us to be alone.
People
will t...
ISHMAEL
There's no one here, and I've got
to talk to you.
Her back is to him.
She is motionless.
ISHMAEL
Don't you owe me that?
And she turns.
Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.
Then she
walks over, and sinks to the sand.
Just before him.
Near enough
to touch.
She looks in his eyes.
And waits.
ISHMAEL
I'm like a dying person.
The words just came out.
His eyes move over her face.
His aching
for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.
ISHMAEL
I don't sleep.
I tell myself this
can't go on, but it goes on anyway.
He seems at the edge of insanity.
Or tears.
HATSUE
I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.
I knew what you felt.
And what I
didn't.
Sadness in her voice.
But strength as well.
HATSUE
And I never found the courage to
tell you.
His eyes swim with tears.
He chokes them back, he has to.
ISHMAEL
You'll think this is crazy, but all
I want is to hold you.
Just once.
And smell your hair.
She absorbs this.
No sign of repulsion or anger.
Her eyes seem
wise.
And very sad.
HATSUE
You have to hear this, I can
never touch you, Ishmael.
Not
once, not ever.
There's no half-
way.
As much as I know it hurts
you, you have to let this go.
ISHMAEL
Look, I want to forget you, I do.
I think if you hold me, just this
once, I can walk away and never
speak to you again.
She just keeps looking at him.
There is a bravery to her steady
gaze.
Her calm resolve.
ISHMAEL
Please?
As one human being to
another, just because I'm miserable
and don't know where to turn.
I
need to be in your arms.
If it's
just for thirty seconds.
His pleading look holds her for a moment.
In the silence...
HATSUE
I hurt for you.
Whether you'll
ever believe that or not.
Feeling behind her eyes.
First time she lets it show.
HATSUE
I feel sick sometimes, with the
guilt of what I've done to you.
And I can't make it right.
She rises slowly.
Brushes the sand from her skirt.
HATSUE
To hold you would be wrong and
deceitful.
You're going to have
to live without holding me, that
is the truth of the way things are.
She takes one step back.
HATSUE
Things end.
They do.
Get on
with your life.
And turns away.
She gathers her baby in her arms.
Takes her
blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.
He watches, never
moving, as she gathers her things.
Gathers them as if he wasn't
there.
And with her back turned...
HATSUE
Get on with your life.
She walks slowly away.
Her baby cries.
Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned
at the elbow.
The diggers are filling a grave in distance.
Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael.
Keeping
their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.
One man comes to him.
MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.
But his
voice is clear...
NAGAISHI
The Japanese people of the island
are saddened by this loss.
Your
father was a man of great fairness
and compassion for others...
He stands at a respectful distance.
Ishmael clears his throat.
He
nods, thank you.
No words to say.
So the small man adds...
NAGAISHI
A friend to us.
And to all people.
Silence.
They are a tableau of stone.
Finally...
ISHMAEL
Well...
And no more.
The man takes a step back...
NAGAISHI
We know you will follow in his
footsteps.
And honor his legacy.
Which changes Ishmael's face.
To something harder.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
I thought it then.
And often since.
A balance, he's said.
Finding the
facts.
That folks needed to know.
Fog.
The sound of water.
Lapping at the hull of a boat.
The mist
drfits, revealing...
Eyes.
They are blue.
The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted
and damp.
CARL (O.S.)
My batteries are drawed down, both
of 'em.
ALternator belts were loose.
PULL BACK to see him.
With his keroses lantern and his air horn.
KABUO (O.S.)
No sweat.
We'll pull one a mine,
get ya started.
PULL BACK to see him now, leaning on his gaff.
Squinting up.
At
the top of Carl's mast.
We follow his gaze to see...
KABUO (O.S.)
You lashed up a lantern?
'Gainst
a fog like this?
See it now.
SWAYING as the helpless boat bobs in the night.
CARL (O.S.)
Lantern and a air horn.
That's
all I got, without my juice.
Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at
him.
Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful.
He
squints up...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
God's kindness, my father said.
Despite the hardship...it reminds
us.
Of our place in things.
Our place in things.
He slides a black cigar between his teeth...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
What the hell.
Did he mean
by that?
He has the match box.
Manipulating it with the dexterity we've
come to know.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Things fall on us, I suppose.
From the sky.
STRIKES the match on his belt buckle...
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Wars.
Freighters plowing through...
Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the
cigar.
A single puff.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
And we seem...helpless.
Until we
understand.
One more.
Savors it.
The sky.
The thought.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Accident rules every corner of
the universe...
Down the steps.
Snow swirling between us.
Gone.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Except the chambers.
Of the
human heart.
FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK.
ROLL END CREDITS.
