                                    January 3, 2013                                    AINSLEY (O.S.)*
                    First thing.  Wake up.  Keurig s *
                    broken.  *

                                                                      FADE UP ON:*


      EXT./INT.  OFFICE - DAY*

      Cubicles divide a sedate office.  We re on the FIRST FLOOR, *
      looking through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW onto a PARKING LOT *
      outside.  Two pasty OFFICE WORKERS, AINSLEY and FRED, sit in *
      FRONT of the window, BACKS to it, in the midst of a full-on *
        white-collar American moan-and-groan.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    No coffee.  Yeah.  So I drive to *
                      Starbuck s.   Cause I can t *
                    function.  I get out of the car.  *
                    Phone flies off my lap onto the *
                    asphalt.  Screen cracks.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh, man.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    I m staring at the crack.  Pissed *
                    as shit.   Cause I just got the new *
                    5S.  And a new plan.*

                                  FRED*
                    Take it back, tell them it came *
                    that way.  They might replace it.  *
                    If you find the right Genius.*

      In the parking lot BEHIND Ainsley and Fred, a woman silently *
      SPRINTS in HIGH HEELS toward her CAR, chased by a hungry *
      ZOMBIE.  Thus begins a marvelously intricate, chaotic, *
      gruesome ACTION SCENE kicking off the zombie apocalypse.*

      WE HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE MADNESS OUTSIDE, BUT AINSLEY *
      AND FRED HAVE THEIR BACKS TO IT, OBLIVIOUS AS THEY BITCH.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    And of course what do I notice - *
                    this isn t even part of the story - *
                    one of my apps is missing.  The *
                    icon.  From the home screen.  *
                    Somehow I deleted it.*

                                  FRED*
                      Butt-deleted.*                                                                                      2.


      The woman outside squirms into her car and slams the door.  *
      The zombie dives through the glass of the DRIVER S WINDOW.  *
      Its legs dangle out the window.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                      Butt-deleted.  Yeah.  Only I can t *
                    remember which one s gone,  cause *
                    it s gone.  And I won t figure it *
                    out-*

                                  FRED*
                          (nods)*
                    - til you need to use it.  I hate *
                    that.*

      The woman PEELS OUT of her space.  A truck speeds past, a *
      BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE hanging off its back bumper.  The truck *
      SMACKS the LEGS of the first ZOMBIE, RIPPING it IN HALF.*

      The truck goes over a SPEED BUMP.  The businessman zombie *
      lets go, FACE-PLANTS, SKIDS across asphalt, notices the *
      disembodied legs of the first zombie, and starts to EAT them.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Fucking.  Hate!  So it gets better.  *
                    I order at Starbuck s.  And they *
                    ask my name.  No one ever hears my *
                    name right.  Ainsley.  No one ever *
                    gets that.  So I say Jill.  And he *
                    writes Jill on the cup.  Only now *
                    my coffee s ready.  They call out *
                    Jill.  I ve forgotten I m Jill!  *
                    Which wouldn t be a problem...*

                                  FRED*
                    Lemme guess...*

        A LANDSCAPER runs into frame with a JANITOR ZOMBIE on his *
      heels.  The landscaper is trying desperately to start a gas-*
      powered double-bladed HEDGE TRIMMER.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Another fucking Jill.  She walks *
                    off with my soy chai latte.  And I *
                    end up with her whole milk whatever-*
                    the-fuck.  But of course I don t *
                    realize it  til I m back in the *
                    car, and I m two thirds through the *
                    venti, thinking this tastes a *
                    little different.*

                                  FRED*
                    Wait, aren t you-?*                                                                                      3.


      The LANDSCAPER starts the HEDGE TRIMMER, turns, SWINGS, and *
        HALF-DECAPITATES the JANITOR ZOMBIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Lactose intolerant.  And now I ve *
                    finished a venti of cow s milk.  So *
                    I gotta pull into Walgreen s for *
                    some Lactaid so I don t get *
                    diarrhea.   Cause that s what dairy *
                    gives me.  Diarrhea.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh my freaking God.  So-?!*

      The businessman zombie abandons its meal and runs after the *
      landscaper, who fails to extricate his hedge trimmer from the *
      janitor zombie s neck.  The businessman zombie TACKLES the *
      landscaper, who is IMPALED on the hedge trimmer.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Still haven t shit my pants.  *
                    Genius of Lactaid.  But day ain t *
                    over yet.  I know, I know.  Hash-*
                    tag,  First-world problems.   Some *
                    poor soul s actually suffering out *
                    there...*

      A MAN runs past the window ON FIRE, chased by a 400-POUND *
      FEMALE ZOMBIE.*

                                  FRED*
                    It s OK to get irritated.  You re *
                    used to the life you re used to.  *
                    You re allowed to get annoyed.  Ah, *
                    lunch...*

        TALLAHASSEE, 40 s, square-jawed, wearing khakis and a green *
      polo shirt,  WHICH SANDY?  embroidered onto the chest,  pulls *
      a SANDWICH CART up to the cubicles.  He s just as oblivious *
      as Ainsley and Fred to the chaos outside.*

      Tallahassee hands over 2 wrapped sandwiches, NAMES in MARKER.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                     Fred.    Aisley?    Ashley?    Ass-*
                    ?  *

                                  AINSLEY*
                    It s mine.*

      The 400-pound zombie fails to catch the man on fire.  It *
      stops, catches its breath, and turns to look IN the WINDOW.*                                                                                      4.


                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Can I interest you in dessert?*

      Ainsley shakes her head, reaches across her desk, and holds *
      up a TWINKIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Already hit the vending machine. *
                          (to Fred)*
                    On the Lactaid, figured why not a *
                    Twinkie.*

                                  FRED*
                    Go, girl.*

      The 400-pound zombie catches sight of the Twinkie, TURNS, and *
      BEELINES for the PLATE GLASS WINDOW.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Mm!  Can t remember the last time I *
                    had a Twinkie!*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Shut the fuck up.  Pickles in the *
                      tuna-fish?!*

      Inspired by the tuna, the 400-pound zombie gets closer...*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    You don t like pickles?*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Pickles make everything else taste *
                    like pickles.  I specifically asked-*
                          (tosses sandwich down)*
                    Could this day possibly get any *
                    worse?!*

      On cue, the 400-pounder SMASHES through the WINDOW... and we *
      FREEZE FRAME.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Call me crazy, she may be about to *
                    get an answer to that question.  *
                    You know what they say about zombie *
                    attacks.  You always remember your *
                    first time.  Any guesses who s *
                    gonna survive this one?  Choose *
                    fast!*

      The action STARTS again.  The 400-pounder takes AINSLEY DOWN.  *
      Then turns and BELLY-SPLASHES Fred.*                                                                                      5.


      Tallahassee recovers from the shock, thinks fast, *
        aggressively RAISES his SANDWICH CART ABOVE his HEAD, and *
      SMASHES it over the zombie s noggin.  The zombie FALLS STILL.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Maybe you woulda chosen the *
                    sandwich guy if you knew where this *
                    scene took place.  Little state *
                    called Florida.*

      Tallahassee stands tall and spies the BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE *
      approaching the broken window.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                     Little town called... Tallahassee.*

      Tallahassee picks up a broken piece of the cart, brandishes *
      it like a weapon... and steps out the window to DO BATTLE.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                      Welcome... to Zombieland.*

                    Ssh.  This could be the big finale.*

      An awe-inspiring FINISH.  The dust settles.  Tallahassee 
      APPLAUDS by his lonesome, his claps ECHOING.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Perfect.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    I dunno.  It was missing something.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    It s George Washington s birthday!  
                    Our teeth are red-white-and-blue *
                    from eating Bullet Pops!  I just 
                    blew up an entire fireworks 
                    factory!  What could possibly be 
                    missing?

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (to Wichita, sotto voce)
                    Are we letting the  George 
                      Washington s birthday  thing go?

                                    WICHITA
                          (to Columbus, sotto voce)
                    Maybe he was born on June 17th.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Answer me!  What was missing?!

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Can t you hear?

      Tallahassee strains to hear.  He s rewarded with NOTHING but *
      VAST, ENCOMPASSING SILENCE.  Columbus abruptly REALIZES:

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    All of a sudden, I knew.  It wasn t 
                    what we could hear.  It was what we 
                    couldn t.

      Everyone gazes out over an empty STREET.  An empty CITY.                                                                                       8.


                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    The oohs and aahs of a crowd.  The 
                    laughter of friends.  The chatter 
                    of children...

                                  COLUMBUS
                    What good is fun?  If there s no 
                    one to share it with.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    People.


      EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

      WICHITA marches angrily up a CITY STREET, past some rotting 
      CORPSES, followed by COLUMBUS, TALLAHASSEE, and LITTLE ROCK.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I m just saying, she s right.  
                    We ve been wandering around, just 
                    the 4 of us, for what, a month?  We 
                    need to think about our future.  
                      Humanity s future.  And there is no *
                    future without people.*

                                    WICHITA
                    Yeah, well, we ve got a saying.
                          (nudges Little Rock)
                    Tell him.  Go on.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (very reluctant)
                    People suck.

                                    WICHITA
                    People.  Suck.  What s so great 
                    about people?  They re responsible 
                    for everything bad that s ever 
                    happened to anyone.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s not true!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    He s right!  Shark attacks.

                                    WICHITA
                    Slavery.  And World War 2.  And...

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                      Head-lice.                                                                                      9.


                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I once had head-lice.
                          (frowns)
                    Though I got it from a girlfriend.   
                    She was technically a person.*
                          (to Columbus and Little 
                            Rock)
                    Sorry.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s OK.  We prefer you on her 
                    side of the argument.
                          (to Wichita)
                    I know you re skeptical.  But you 
                    know the saying.   It takes a 
                    village! 

                                    WICHITA
                    And where are we finding this... 
                    village?

      Columbus has no answer.  But TALLAHASSEE raises an eyebrow.*


      INT.  YUKON - NIGHT*

      The FOURSOME finishes climbing into a BLACK CHEVY YUKON, *
      Tallahassee s ubiquitous number  3  on the side.  Tallahassee *
      and Little Rock sit up front, Wichita and Columbus in back.*

      Tallahassee reaches UP and hits the ON-STAR button (GM s *
      roadside service).  After two rings, a sassy, young AFRICAN-*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    By way of introduction, meet *

                    How can I help?

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    We were hoping you might be able to *
                    lead us to other survivors.   *

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)*
                    Lonely, eh?  Well... rumor has it *
                    there s a big, safe community on *

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    The magic word.  Ever since I lost *
                    a family, and found one, all I ve *
                    ever wanted to be... to feel... is *

                    For just this once, your big sis *
                    may be right.  The east coast is *
                    3,000 miles away-ish.  With a lot *
                    of mindless meat-lovers in between.*

      Little Rock and Columbus look defeated.  Then an idea quickly *
      rekindles his enthusiasm.*                                                                                    11.


                                  COLUMBUS*
                    Maybe we don t have to find a *
                    village.  We can found a village.  *
                    Y know, start it up.  Gather our *
                    own people.*

                    Even give the place a name!  *
                       Tallahassee. *

                                  WICHITA*
                    We already need a new leader.*

                    But why couldn t we start a *
                      community?*

                                  COLUMBUS*
                    We found Bill Murray, didn t we?  *
                    Bad example.*

                    Survivors are few and far between.  *
                    But they re out there.  Here we go-  *
                    Wilshire east.  Then left to 135 *

      EXT.  BEACH - DAY - FLASHBACK

      WICHITA walks out of the ocean, slamming in a one-piece.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    ...a couple weeks ago.

      COLUMBUS is lying on a towel, reading a BOOK, which he subtly 
      puts away as she approaches.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    In the movies, a first kiss means 
                    happily ever after.  But in real 
                    life, a first kiss is only a first 
                    kiss.  The beginning of a 
                      relationship.  In this case, a 
                      relationship between two people who 
                    epically suck at relationships.  
                    The trouble started like this...

      Wichita sits down on her towel... SNATCHES the BOOK.  Stares:

                                    WICHITA
                     Rookie Dad:  Adventures in 
                      Fatherhood ?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    No, no!  It s not what you think!  
                    I don t want to be an actual 
                    father.  Not yet.  I m just trying *
                    to relate to Little Rock.*

                                    WICHITA
                    OK.  Um.  She s not your daughter.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I guess more like sister-in-law.

                                    WICHITA
                    Nope.                                                                                      13.


                                  COLUMBUS
                      Girlfriend s sister?

                                    WICHITA
                    Hadn t discussed the G-word. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    We are dating, right?

                                    WICHITA
                    Dating.  Right.

      She smiles to put him at ease.  But awfully NERVOUSLY.  He 
      takes her hand.  She doesn t entirely fight it.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    It occurs to me.  We know each *
                    other... but we don t really know *
                    each other.  Stuff like... what *
                    would be your favorite place to 
                      honeymoon?  Sorry!  Something 
                    lighter.  Who was your 1st grade 
                    teacher?  OK.  What s your favorite 
                    bottled water?
                          (off Wichita s stare)
                    Another time.


      EXT.  IKEA SHOWROOM FLOOR - DAY - FLASHBACK

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    And the trouble ended, not long 
                    after, like this...

      Our GUYS are camped out in an IKEA SHOWROOM, enjoying 
      different  rooms.   LITTLE ROCK swings in a hammock, scarfing *
      a plate of SWEDISH MEATBALLS.  COLUMBUS PLOPS down on a SOFA *
      next to WICHITA and hands her a PIECE of PAPER.  She reads:

                                    WICHITA
                    What are these?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Clues.

                                    WICHITA
                          (reads)
                    My honey.  My sweetie.  Look for 
                    the  X  right under your feetie.
                          (beat, trying hard to act 
                            pleasantly surprised)
                      A scavenger... hunt?                                                                                    14.


      CUT TO a MONTAGE of WICHITA uncomfortably  hunting.   
      Flipping over pillows.  Kicking over trash-cans.  Columbus *
      watches.  At the end of the hunt, there s a FANCY ENVELOPE.  *
      Wichita pulls out the card and acts excited.*

                                  WICHITA*
                    A... poem!*
                          (scans)*
                    You rhymed  yearning  with... *
                       burning. *
                          (panicky)
                    That s incredibly nice.  I m so...
                          (goes to say  touched )
                    ...sorry.  Really, really sorry.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Oh, man.  Are you..?

                                    WICHITA
                    Slowing this down.  Way down.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    But Krista...

                                    WICHITA
                          (winces)
                    Cool if we go back to Wichita?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    You re revoking my Krista *
                      privileges?!  Be honest.  Is there *
                    anyone else?*

      Wichita and Columbus look over at the anyone else:  
        TALLAHASSEE.  He s writhing around on a fake BEARSKIN RUG, 
      wrestling to get his JEANS on OVER his BOOTS.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    So you see, Wichita and I had *
                    already slowed it down.  Way down.  *
                    Maybe it was a good thing.  This *
                    family s plenty dysfunctional.*


      EXT.  AHMANSON THEATER - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Maybe that s why we need new, uh, *
                    blood...*

      Our HEROES stand downtown, BLINDED by the GLITTERY glass of 
      the L.A. LANDMARK.  Suddenly, TALLAHASSEE spies MOVEMENT.  
      It s the REFLECTION of a ZOMBIE running from behind!                                                                                    15.


      Tallahassee nonchalantly draws his WINCHESTER RANDALL, swings 
      it until it s upside-down, pointing BACKWARD over his 
      shoulder, and FIRES.  The zombie DROPS in a spray of BLOOD.*

      Alerted by the noise, a BEARDED MAN in WINDOW-WASHING GEAR 
      appears on the ROOF of the Ahmanson, where he s been taking 
      clothes off a makeshift CLOTHESLINE.  He waves excitedly.

                                  WINDOW WASHER
                    Morning!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Morning!  Could use some company!  
                    Join us?!

                                  WINDOW WASHER
                      Marvelous!

      The man disappears, then reappears with a SUITCASE and climbs 
      onto a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM.  He uses the ROPE/PULLEY to 
      LOWER the platform - and himself - toward the street.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    It is marvelous.  Remember this 
                    day.  As the start of something 
                    truly special.

      Wichita ROLLS her EYES.  The man is passing a row of windows 
      when WITHOUT WARNING...

      ...a ZOMBIE SMASHES THROUGH the glass and TACKLES him.  The 
      pair SPLATS on the street.  Our heroes STARE, STUNNED.  *

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Fuck.  Me.*

                                    WICHITA
                    I ll remember it alright.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    16.


                                  ACT TWO


      EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY*

      COLUMBUS loads his GUN next to a GAS STATION BATHROOM.   *
      TALLAHASSEE exits the bathroom, waving the air with his hand.*

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Talk about post-apocalypse.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    Funny thing, the post-apocalypse.  
                    Not funny - haha.  Funny - we just 
                    watched a man die, but we ve 
                    already moved on.  Bottom line, you 
                    can t let things get to you.  Rule 
                    #41:

        Superimposed on-screen:  a TITLE:  41.  Everybody Dies 
      Sometime.

      Tallahassee and Columbus walk back toward the YUKON, which is 
      PARKED 100 yards down the street.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Y know, I do all my best thinking 
                    with my pants around my ankles.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    You don t say.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    And it just occurred to me.
                          (beat, we expect something 
                            important)
                    Why was every Steven Seagal movie 3 
                    words?
                          (imaginary marquee)
                    Steven Seagal in...  Marked For 
                    Death ...   Out for Justice ...  
                     Above the Law. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                     Hungry For Lunch. 
                          (beat)
                     Lather Rinse Repeat. 

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                     Keep Off Grass. 

      The two laugh as they keep it up:                                                                                    17.


                                  COLUMBUS
                     Now With Calcium. 

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                     May Cause Diarrhea. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                     Dry Clean Only. 

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                     No Free Refills. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (beat, STOPS WALKING)
                     Crazy Stupid Love. 

      Tallahassee stops, follows Columbus s gaze to the YUKON, 50 
      yards ahead.  WICHITA is LYING on the HOOD, SUN-BATHING.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    A-ha!  I just figured it out!  Why *
                    you keep wearing that sad bunny *
                    face!*

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I thought you did your best 
                    thinking with your pants around 
                    your ankles.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I was occupied with the Seagal *
                    thing.  The point is, you re upset *
                     cause you still wanna back up that *
                      ba-dunka-dunk.*

                                  COLUMBUS
                      Ba-what-a-what?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    No one likes getting thrown out at *
                    home.  But be patient, sad bunny.  *
                    She likes you.  No idea why, but *
                    she does.  You ll get another at *
                    bat.  Wait and see.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    In the immortal words of Wichita.  
                    Whatever.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I can t stand seeing you like this.  
                    Which is why I m gonna teach you 
                    something to do whenever you feel 
                    low.                                                                                    18.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Here we go.

      The two start WALKING AGAIN.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I want you to picture you ve been 
                    dead a long time.  And God comes to 
                    you.  And says, son.  I m gonna let 
                    you go back down to earth and live.  
                    For 5 minutes.  But only 5.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Uh-huh?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Then picture those 5 minutes... are 
                    right.  Now.

      Tallahassee closes his eyes and feels the SUN and BREEZE on 
      his face.  Life is good.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    It s hard to take advice from a guy 
                    who asks for a price check at the 
                    99 cent store.  But he may be onto 
                      something.

      Columbus drinks in the sight of WICHITA.*


      EXT.  BRIDGE - DAY

      A view THROUGH BINOCULARS of a LONG, TALL BRIDGE spanning a 
      CONCRETE CANAL.  Burned VEHICLES litter the bridge.  
      DETROIT s VOICE comes over car speakers:

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)
                    That should be her.  Better luck!

      The binocs  view falls on a CAMPSITE near the MIDDLE of the 
      bridge, complete with TENT and rolling HOT DOG CART.*

      We reverse angle to see TALLAHASSEE behind the WHEEL of the 
      YUKON, holding the binocs.  He lowers them.  Grins.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Take two.


      EXT.  BRIDGE - DAY

      Our HEROES walk down the bridge toward the tent.                                                                                    19.


                                    WICHITA
                    Girl Scout cookies!

      ZIP!  The tent door opens from the inside.  A GIANT (250 
      poundish) FRECKLED WOMAN with an UZI peeks out, SMILES.

                                  WOMAN
                    I m a sucker for Thank You Berry 
                    Munches.


      EXT.  BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER

      Our newly minted FIVESOME walks back down the bridge.*

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (ruh-GEEN-uh)
                    Regina?

                                  REGINA
                    Regina.  Like vagina.  With an R.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    For real?!  Vagina.*
                          (giggles)*

                                  WICHITA*
                      Over-under on how many times he *
                    says the word vagina?*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    That counted as 1.  Those of you at *
                    home, feel free to play along!*

      A  1  is superimposed on-screen.*

                                  COLUMBUS*
                          (to Regina)*
                    We can t tell you how happy we are.

                                  REGINA
                    And about to get happier.  Taste my 
                      boysenberry pie.*

      Regina hands Columbus a PIE TIN.  Everyone PARTAKES. It s the *
      BEST THING they ve EVER PUT in their MOUTHS.  Within moments, *
      everyone has purple lips and teeth.*

                                    WICHITA
                    Omigod.  Omigod.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Whoa.                                                                                    20.


                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Shut up.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (happy little whimpering)
                    Never been a food worth eating that *
                    didn t make your teeth a different *
                    color.  Welcome to the family, *
                    Vagina with an R!

      Every time Tallahassee says  vagina,  he pronounces it a *
      little differently (hard  g,  french accent, etc.).  A  2  is *
        superimposed on-screen.*

      Regina walks slower than the rest, and with every step, gets 
      further BEHIND.  They fail to notice, continuing to TALK:

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You re one of us now.  And 
                      membership has its privileges.  
                    Columbus here s got these rules for 
                    surviving Zombieland.  Kinda *
                    vagina, but absolutely foolproof.*
                          (the  2  rolls over, *
                            becoming a  3 )*
                    Then there s Little Rock.  She s a *
                    dead-eye with that rifle.  *

      The group walks toward camera in wide-shot.  Regina is nearly 
      20 feet behind...

      ...when a ZOMBIE SPRINTS into frame from right to left, 
      TACKLING her OVER the RAILING and OFF the BRIDGE.  No one 
      hears at first.  They keep right on WALKING.

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    And me?  My picture s up at the *
                    zombie post office.  Long as you re *
                    with us, we got your back.*

      Our heroes walk a couple more paces.  Then frown.  STOP.  And 
        tentatively, cringingly TURN AROUND.  Tallahassee slow-burns.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Could use an anger lap.


      EXT.  BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

      We look UP at our HEROES as they PEER OVER the side of the 
      bridge, APPALLED.  Everyone still has purple lips and teeth.*                                                                                    21.


                                    WICHITA
                    You can t help but think.  How 
                    quick it can all end.

      Tallahassee and Little Rock EXIT FRAME.  Wichita looks 
      Columbus in the eye:

                    Really?

                          (nods)
                    What did you do with the pie?
                    Hey.  She took a number.  God 
                    called it.  There was nothing we 
                    could do.  Pie?

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    Rule #19 for surviving Zombieland.

      Columbus opens his backpack and holds up a ZIPLOC BAG with 
      the remainder of the PIE inside.

                    Thank you berry much.*


      INT.  YUKON - DAY

      Our HEROES are back in the YUKON, weaving through DOWNTOWN 
      L.A. on the hunt for another community member.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (to Little Rock)
                    This may be news.  But there was *
                    actually life before Y2K.  Ms. Pac 
                    Man kinda looked like Pac Man in 
                    drag.  She had red lipstick.  And 
                    mascara.  And a bow in her hair.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    She had hair?                                                                                    22.


                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Actually, you re right.  She was 
                    bald.  They were both bald.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And she had a mole on her cheek.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    A big facial mole.  Right there.  
                    And she and Pac Man would just go 
                    around and eat.  All they d do was 
                    eat.   Til they met each other.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And then they kissed.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    So picture a yellow bald guy 
                    stuffing his cheeks, and then 
                    macking out with another yellow 
                    bald guy.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    With a big mole on his face.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    In drag.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    I m sorry I missed that.

                                    WICHITA
                    If Detroit s right... that s the 
                    place.


      EXT.  UNFINISHED BUILDING - CENTURY CITY - DAY

      Our HEROES are now parked by an UNFINISHED 10-story LUXURY 
      CONDO BUILDING overlooking the L.A. COUNTRY CLUB - floors in 
      place, but no exterior walls.  Tallahassee WAVES skyward.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I m Tallahassee!  This is Columbus, 
                    Little Rock, and Wichita!

      A TALL, NERDY MAN WAVES back down from about 6 stories up.

                                  MAN
                    Eugene!
                          (grins)
                    Oregon!  Be right down!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    No!  Stop.  We re coming to you!                                                                                    23.


      INT.  CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR - DAY

        TALLAHASSEE, WICHITA, COLUMBUS, and LITTLE ROCK ride an open-
      air, heavy-duty CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR UP to the 6th floor.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Listen up, dammit.  Eugene... is 
                    the president.  We... are the 
                    secret service.  I ll take a bullet 
                    if I have to... taste his food... 
                    lay down my life.  But he is not.  
                    Dying.  On our watch.

                                  COLUMBUS
                      Understood.

      Little Rock nods, all business.  But Wichita doesn t look 
      nearly as concerned.  Tallahassee and Columbus notice.

                                    WICHITA
                      Understood.  What!


      INT.  UNFINISHED BUILDING - DAY

      We re now on the unfinished 6TH FLOOR of the condo building.  
      Temporary wood floors.  Open walls.  Etc.  EUGENE finishes 
      zipping up his DUFFEL BAGS and slings one over each SHOULDER.

                                  EUGENE
                    So fired up.  Some folks to play *
                    Boggle with!  It s lonely.  You get *
                    to thinking, if something happens *
                    to me.  No one s even gonna know.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Hey, don t go all vagina.*
                          (a  4  is superimposed on-*
                            screen)*
                    Nothing s happening to you.  Trust *
                    us.*

      TALLAHASSEE tentatively takes the lead.  The others subtly, 
      awkwardly form a PROTECTIVE CIRCLE around EUGENE, GUNS DRAWN.

      Eugene finds this a little ODD.  Everyone BEAMS fake SMILES 
      at him.  The FIVESOME slowly crosses toward the ELEVATOR.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You re one of us now, Eugene.  And 
                      membership has its privileges.  
                    Tell him what he s won, Columbus.                                                                                    24.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Yes.  I have these rules for 
                    surviving Zombieland.  Very handy.  
                    One might even say foolproof...

      FROM NOWHERE, a SNARLING CONSTRUCTION WORKER ZOMBIE (complete 
      with hard hat) DROPS DOWN INTO FRAME from the open floor 
      ABOVE and TRIES to LAND on EUGENE s BACK...  

      ...only to lose its GRIP.  The zombie BREAKS THROUGH the 
      temporary wooden floor and SMASHES down through MULTIPLE 
      floors, all the way to concrete...

      ...leaving Eugene UNSCATHED.  His HEELS protrude over the 
      edge of the hole behind him.  A BEAT of silence and RELIEF.

                                  EUGENE
                    Whew.

      Suddenly, the EDGE of the damaged floor GIVES WAY, and Eugene 
      PLUMMETS after the ZOMBIE to his death.

      We look UP through the hole from BELOW as... one new head at 
      a time... our four heroes PEER down into the abyss.

      TALLAHASSEE closes his eyes.  Then throws an ANGRY TANTRUM, 
      PUNCHING and KICKING the air.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    We re cursed!  Like we picked up 
                    Bobby Brady s ass-reaming Tiki *
                    idol!
                          (to Little Rock)
                    Do not say who s Bobby Brady!

      Wichita chokes down a nasally trace of a GIGGLE.*

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Not funny.

                                    WICHITA
                    The tiniest bit funny.

      EXT.  R.V. PARK - DAY

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)
                      Destination s on the right.  And 
                    thank you for using On-Star. 

      Our HEROES drive through an abandoned R.V. Park, headed for a 
      really big, cool MOTOR HOME.  TALLAHASSEE looks out of sorts.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    What s wrong?  This is supposed to 
                    be a very sweet old couple.

                                    WICHITA
                    And slow and weak.  Someone we can  
                    outrun when we get attacked.  Hey, 
                    it worked with the other 3.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    It s not that.  It s just... this 
                    is the first time I ve been to an 
                    R.V. Park since - since - fall of 
                     99.  Just outside Flagstaff.  Me 
                    and the little lady were getting 
                    our Grand Canyon on.  We stopped my 
                     Bago at the Oceanview R.V. Park...

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                       Oceanview? 

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    That s what I said!  So we pull in, 
                    and who parks next to us?  None 
                    other than Matthew McConaughey... 
                    in his I ve-got-a-bigger-wang-than-
                    you Airstream.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    The Matthew McConaughey?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    We found one you recognize!

                                    WICHITA
                    Tell me he was shirtless.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I m getting there.  So, dude wedges 
                    his R.V. next to mine.  Cheek to 
                    cheek, windows this close.  And 
                    proceeds to spend 9 consecutive 
                    hours... balls-to-the-floor naked.                                                                                    26.


                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Uh, I m 11.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    That wouldn t have stopped 
                       Hollywood.   9 straight hours.  *
                    Fixing his satellite dish?  Naked.  
                    Making waffles?  Naked.  Late 
                    afternoon fucking Zumba?  Naked.  *
                    You imagine what that was like?

                                    WICHITA
                    I m gonna try.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Like you, my little lady was 
                    enjoying this.  Practically sliding 
                    off her seat.  So I man up.  Open 
                    the window.  And say:  Would it 
                    kill a guy to put on a stitch or 
                    two in front of another man s 
                    woman?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And..?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Dude hands me a hundred dollar 
                    bill, says,  you re welcome.   Next 
                    morning, Airstream s gone.  And 
                    there, on my driver s side window?  
                    An imprint of ass-cheeks.  What s 
                    worse, the so-called 
                      environmentalist s left 6 inches of 
                    sewage water under my front steps.  
                    Don t go barefoot around R.V. s.  I 
                    never forgave the son-of-a-bitch.


      INT.  R.V. - DAY

      We re INSIDE the QUAINTLY DECORATED MOTOR HOME when we hear 
      KNOCKING.  The side door OPENS from the outside, revealing 
        TALLAHASSEE, COLUMBUS, LITTLE ROCK, and WICHITA, guns drawn.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Anybody home?
                          (shrugs)
                    Probably making a Metamucil run.

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:

      Our HEROES exploring the MOTOR HOME.  There s a wall of 
      PHOTOS.                                                                                      27.


      At the center is a HUGE PORTRAIT of the SWEETEST OLD COUPLE:  
      2 adorable frost-tops, arm-in-arm, posing for a warm JC-
        Penney-style picture.  A bronze label on the portrait reads:

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Bubbie...
                    (the  u  sounds like the  u  in 
                    sugar)

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    ...and Pee-Paw.

                                    WICHITA
                          (genuinely touched)
                    Aww.

      Columbus looks at Wichita WISTFULLY.  It s cool to see her 
      moved by something emotional.

      The other pics show Bubbie and Pee-Paw surrounded by adoring 
        GRANDCHILDREN... wearing  I  HEART  Bubbie  and  I  HEART  
      Pee-Paw  t-shirts.  B&P push little kids on swings, blow out 
      birthday candles, frolic, etc.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Omigod.  They re, like, sooo cute.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Gotta admit, it s touching.  God 
                    bless the  Greatest Generation. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    They remind me of Nana and Zayde.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    And Granmoo and Gampoo.

                                  LITTLE ROCK AND WICHITA
                          (share a warm look, 
                              interlocking arms)
                    And Gray-gray and Muffer.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                       Gray-gray and Muffer? 

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                     Granmoo and Gampoo? 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    The point is, everyone had their 
                      grandfather and grandmother... and 
                    now they re gone.

                                    WICHITA
                    Kinda bringing down the room.                                                                                    28.


                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    I can t wait to meet Bubbie and 
                    Poopie.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (corrects)
                    Pee-Paw.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Right.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (wipes misty eyes, covers)
                    Little dusty in here.


      INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

      COLUMBUS opens the door to the BEDROOM and sees a big BED, 
      upon which sit TWO HEART-SHAPED PILLOWS, one with a picture 
      of Bubbie s smiling face, the other with Pee-Paw s.  He 
      SMILES and walks past, NARROWLY MISSING...

      ...an OLD PERSON s HAND protruding from UNDER the BED.  
      Columbus reaches the MASTER BATH, peeks inside, then rests 
      his SHOTGUN against the wall outside the bathroom.


      INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    One thing about Zombieland.  You 
                    can never feel clean enough.

      COLUMBUS washes his face in the BATHROOM, then reaches for 
      two TOWELS, one with an embroidered  B,  one with a  P.   He 
      pulls off the  P  towel, dries his face.  When he goes to 
      replace the towel on the rack, it SLIDES off onto the floor.

      He kneels to GRAB it when he SENSES SOMETHING, then raises 
      his head to find himself staring out the bathroom at TWO 
      FEET.  We TILT from TOE to HEAD to REVEAL...

      ...BUBBIE, standing by the bed.  She sports a BATHROBE with a 
      big  B  on the chest.  She s the cute old woman from the 
      picture, only RECENTLY ZOMBIEFIED.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    B-bubbie?

      Another ZOMBIE stands up from BEHIND the BED... an OLD MAN in 
      a bathrobe with  P  on the chest.  Yes...

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Paw-Pee?  Sorry, Pee-Paw?!                                                                                    29.


      INT.  MAIN ROOM - DAY

      TALLAHASSEE is visible OUTSIDE the R.V. s windshield, 
      CLEANING it with PAPER TOWELS and WINDEX.  LITTLE ROCK opens 
      a CUPBOARD and pulls down  World s Best Grandma  and  World s 
      Best Grandpa  COFFEE MUGS.  Hands one to WICHITA.

                                    WICHITA
                          (means it)
                    So precious...


      INT.  BATHROOM / BEDROOM / MAIN ROOM - DAY

      COLUMBUS stands up in the bathroom.  His shotgun leans 
      against the bedroom wall outside, out of reach.  He faces 
      down BUBBIE and PEE-PAW.  Pee-Paw has an almost gentle look.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    C-can you guys can still hear me?  
                    If so, you should know.  My Nana 
                    once mistakenly wrote me a birthday 
                    check for ten thousand dollars.  
                    And I did not cash it.

      Bubbie sweetly reaches out.  But then... her fingers clench 
      MENACINGLY.  BOTH she and PEE-PAW widen their EYES and SCREAM 
      BLOODY MURDER, the most terrifying WAILS ever.

      Columbus SCREAMS himself... and BUBBIE and PEE-PAW ATTACK!

      These two are hardly frail old things.  In fact, they re the 
      baddest-of-bad zombies.  Total Terminators.

      Columbus dives for his SHOTGUN, but TRIPS on the WET TOWEL 
      and FACE-PLANTS.  B&P land on Columbus and WRESTLE with him.  
      He kicks them off, but they still LOOM OVER HIM when...

      ...CRASH!  One of the COFFEE MUGS SMASHES into the back of 
      Pee-Paw s head... thrown by WICHITA.  He DROPS.

      Little Rock throws the SECOND MUG - BASH! - into Bubbie s 
      head.  Bubbie, too, drops.

                                    WICHITA
                    Not as cute as Gray-Gray and 
                    Muffer.

      Columbus bounces up and tries to STEP OVER B&P, when... Pee-
      Paw s EYES OPEN, and he GRABS Columbus s SHOE.

      Columbus pulls away, but his shoe POPS OFF at the HEEL.  He 
      tries to stomp it back on.                                                                                    30.


      Like lightning, B&P scramble to their feet.  Wichita and 
      Little Rock RUN toward the front of the R.V., Columbus hop-
      stomping behind them.  He KICKS OFF his shoe.

      Bubbie and Pee-Paw LUNGE.  Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock 
      go down in a DOG-PILE.  Everyone ROLLS AROUND in MID-GRAPPLE.

      BUBBIE is about to BITE Little Rock s neck.  Columbus and 
      Wichita SEE this.  Columbus heroically DIVES BETWEEN Little 
      Rock and Bubbie.  Bubbie BITES HIS NECK INSTEAD.

      Bubbie pulls back, and her DENTURES come out, clamped 
      harmlessly onto Columbus s shirt collar.  Little Rock grabs 
      B&P s PORTRAIT off the wall and SMASHES it over Bubbie s 
      head.  It remains there like a necklace.

      Pee-Paw grabs Wichita by the HAIR.  So she grabs HIM by the 
      HAIR... only it comes right off - a TOUPEE!  Wichita, too, is 
      in trouble.  Columbus DIVES and KNOCKS Pee-Paw off, when:

                                    TALLAHASSEE (O.S.)
                    Pee-Paw!  Bambi!

      B&P look up to see the INTIMIDATING FIGURE of TALLAHASSEE 
      standing tall inside the door:  world s finest ZOMBIE-KILLER.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Bubbie.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Right.  I love you two old birds.  
                    Don t make me do this.

      ANGLE ON:  A METAL TIRE-JACK in Tallahassee s HAND.  Pee-Paw 
      abandons Wichita.  Bubbie abandons Little Rock.  They step 
      toward Tallahassee aggressively.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (genuinely upset)
                    Please!

      Pee-Paw BELLOWS and SPRINTS at Tallahassee.  Bubbie, too.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Fine, you get the horns.

      Tallahassee SWINGS from his HEELS with the TIRE-JACK, like 
      BABE RUTH, or PAUL BUNYON, beating the living shit out of 
      these blue-hairs.  It s AWESOME to behold.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (anguished)
                    I m very!
                          (BAM!)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                    TALLAHASSEE (CONT'D)
                    Very!
                          (BAM!)
                    Sorry!
                          (BAM!)

      B&P lie STILL on the floor.  Tallahassee, chest heaving, bows 
      his head in sorrow... and BRUSHES BUBBIE s HAIR OVER HER EAR.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    They were too good for this world.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    There are 2 more angels in heaven.

      But as Tallahassee TURNS, B&P s eyes OPEN.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (points frantically)
                    Pee-Paw and Boobie!

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (corrects him)
                    Bubbie!

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Right!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (irritated)
                      Seriously?


      EXT.  R.V. PARK - DAY

      We re OUTSIDE the R.V. for a quiet beat.  Suddenly... SMASH!  
      PEE-PAW flies THROUGH the FRONT WINDSHIELD onto the pavement.  
      A beat.  BUBBIE soars after him.  THUNK.

                                    TALLAHASSEE (O.S.)
                    Why me?!


      INT.  R.V. - DAY

      The OTHERS watch TALLAHASSEE START up the R.V. and RUN BUBBIE 
      and PEE-PAW OVER.  SQUISH.  They go under the FRONT wheels.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Wait for it.

      A long pause.  Then SQUISH.  The BACK wheels.  Tallahassee 
      engages reverse.  SQUISH... they go under the back wheels 
      again.  A long PAUSE.  And SQUISH.  The FRONT wheels.                                                                                    32.

                          (bows head, a beat)
                    There s nothing more romantic than 
                    an old couple dying within a few 
                    minutes of one another.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s because you smashed their 
                    heads in with a tire-changing jack.

                                    WICHITA
                    And ran them over with an R.V.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (solemn)
                    I know.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    A close second, actually...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      EXT.  HILL - DAY

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    ...to Sean Kerrigan of Elberta, 
                    Michigan.

      An  Indiana Jones -esque THEME SONG kicks in as SEAN 
      KERRIGAN, a small-town hick, SHOVES against... ...one of 
      those big orange UNION 76 GAS STATION BALLS, poised at the 
      top of a HILL.  The ball ROLLS down, picking up speed, on the 
      HEELS of a ZOMBIE, like Indiana Jones in  Raiders.  

      Unlike Indiana, the ZOMBIE gets SQUASHED.  Right in our LAP.


      INT.  R.V. BEDROOM - DAY

      COLUMBUS walks back into the R.V. BEDROOM, where he collects 
      his SHOE, puts it back on his foot, stands, and TURNS...

      ...nearly BUMPING INTO WICHITA, who FOLLOWED him into the 
      bedroom.  Her expression is one of GRATITUDE and ATTRACTION.

      She REACHES as if to brush Columbus s hair over his ear... 
      and instead REMOVES the DENTURES SNAGGED on his collar.                                                                                    33.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Thank you.

                                    WICHITA
                    Thank you.

      We PUSH IN on Columbus, lit up with... HOPE.

      INT.  R.V. - SUNSET

      The R.V. exits the park, a big  3  on the side and a piece of 
      SEE-THRU PLASTIC DUCT-TAPED into a  windshield.   TALLAHASSEE 
      drives.  LITTLE ROCK sits in front.  WICHITA and COLUMBUS 
      stand behind.  DETROIT s voice comes over the speakers.

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)
                    Don t say it.

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    We re still looking to meet that *
                    special someone.  And we just *
                    ditched our vaginas back in *
                      Burbank...*
                          (a  5  pops up)*
                    ...so we re ready to aim for that *
                    paradise on the eastern seaboard.  *
                    A place to call home.*

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)*
                    Tell ya what.  You head east.  I ll *
                    find that place, get  em to leave *
                    the light on for you.  Take care of *
                    your handsome selves.  God bless.  *
                    And thank you for using On-Star.*

      CLICK.  Our heroes smile.  Look at one another... and then 
      slowly, one-by-one... BACK UP at the ON-STAR BUTTON.

                                  LITTLE ROCK*
                     That special someone. *                                                                                    34.


                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You thinking what I m thinking?

                                  COLUMBUS*
                    Somewhere between us and the *
                    eastern seaboard.  Lies the state *
                    of Michigan.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Hear it s nice this time of year.*

      Tallahassee smiles and steers the R.V. up a FREEWAY RAMP.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Pie?

      Columbus slides the pie tin out of the ZIPLOC BAG.

                                    WICHITA
                    Don t mind if I do.

      Everyone fights for PIE.


      EXT./INT.  FREEWAY/R.V. - SUNSET

      A reprise of  Free to Be You and Me.   The R.V. ZOOMS east.  *
      The camera travels from face to face of our HEROES, purple-*
        lipped-and-teethed, happily savoring PIE and sharing LAUGHS.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                      A semi-wise man once said:  Picture 
                    you ve been dead a long time.  And 
                    God comes to you.  And says, I m 
                    gonna let you go back down to earth 
                    and live.  For 5 minutes.  But only 
                    5.  Which 5 would you choose?  
                    Here s a hint.  Don t think about 
                    the where.  Or the when.  Think 
                    about the who.

      The R.V. heads toward the beckoning HORIZON.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    This land is your land.  This land *
                    is my land.  This land is *
                      Zombieland.  Oh, and go ahead and *
                    settle your bets, that was 5 *
                    vaginas.  Next time, we ll count *
                      fuck-bombs, so bring your *
                      calculators.   Til then, this is *
                    Columbus, Ohio, saying...goodnight.*
