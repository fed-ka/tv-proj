      A MAN stands in his shower. Lets the water wash over his worn 
      face. South of 50 years old, north of 40, you can still see a 
      hint of the rugged good looks of his youth. This is WALT 
      LONGMIRE. He doesn t move, wishing he was still in bed. 

      A bar of soap sits on an exposed wooden cross beam, green 
      drywall board along the bottom. You can actually see through 
      the studs of one side of the shower and into the bedroom. 
      This shower is under repair, like the man inside -- his worn 
      leather torso shaped by plenty of hard work and scarred by a 
      few run-ins over the years.

      Close on the SCARS: A bullet wound marks his lower left 
      abdomen and lines up with the exit wound on his lower back. A 
      long, narrow scar shows where another bullet grazed his right 
      shoulder. His rib cage has been on the receiving end of 
      something sharp and jagged. Maybe a broken bottle.

      The PHONE RINGS. A loud, classic, old Ma Bell ring...Walt 
      moves his head out of the rushing water just enough so one 
      ear is in the clear to hear the machine pick up.

                                  CHEERY WOMAN S VOICE (ON MACHINE)
                    You ve reached the Longmire 
                      residence...


      As we hear the message, we see the residence: A SMALL, 
      CLUTTERED, ONE-STORY CONTEMPORARY LOG HOME. A rehab is 
      underway. Or abandoned. Hard to tell. WIRES stick out of 
      HOLES in the drywall. PAPERS. STACKS OF BOOKS. A TUBE TV. A 
      SOFA draped with a WORN INDIAN QUILT. DIRTY PLATES and EMPTY 
      RAINIER BEER CANS dot the coffee table nearby. 

                                  CHEERY WOMAN S VOICE
                    Sorry, we re not here to take your 
                    call. But please leave a message. 
                    We'll be happy to call you back.

      BEEP! Then a different, irritated female voice: 

                                  VIC'S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic...Pickup, pick up, 
                    pick up...Alright. So Billy and Bob 
                    Barnes called...


                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Said to send someone out to 
                    Pronghorn Ridge. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                                  VIC S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Branch said he s busy, and it s my 
                    day off. I really don t want to go. 
                    Walt? Damn it. 

      Vic clicks off. Walt lets the water run over him...


      We hear the BEEP of the answering machine. Another message.

                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic. Again. I tried your 
                    radio too. Is there something I 
                    should know? Did you retire and 
                    move to Boca in the middle of the 
                    night without telling anyone? 
                    Alright. I m calling you on my day 
                    off as I m driving to Pronghorn 
                    Ridge--

      We hear BOOTS CLUNK along the hardwood floors as Walt moves 
      to the kitchen. He s dressed now: faded 501 s, dusty round-
      toed ranch boots, and a clean work shirt.

                                  VIC S VOICE (CONT D)
                    I don t want to deal with these 
                    wingnuts so I expect you to get 
                    your ass out there and meet me, 
                      now...please.


      A TEAPOT WHISTLES. Walt pulls the boiling pot off the propane 
      range. The whistle fades and is replaced by the ringing 
      phone. The cheery outgoing message plays as Walt reaches up 
      to a shelf that holds a LARGE WOODEN BOX OF TEA and a BAG OF 
      GROUND COFFEE. He looks at the tea box for a beat, but grabs 
      the coffee. He scoops some into a FRENCH PRESS, then pours in 
      the boiling water. 

      Just as Walt finishes pouring, he freezes. The hair on the 
      back of his neck stands up. He stares out his kitchen window. 
      An OWL sits on a fence post, its yellow eyes staring back. 
      Walt is transfixed. Until...BEEP! 

                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic. We got a dead body.

      Walt looks toward the answering machine. Shit. Then back 
      toward the owl. But the owl is gone. Walt sighs, then pushes 
      down the plunger on the French Press.                                                                                      3.



      Walt opens his front door and exits. Now we see where Walt 
      lives: no neighbors, no homes within sight, just A GORGEOUS 
      VIEW OF A COLD BLUE WYOMING SKY AND THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS ON 
      THE DISTANT HORIZON.

      He pulls on his worn leather coat with sheepskin collar. We 
      note the SHERIFF STAR pinned to the front left pocket. He 
      plunks his hat on his head, grabs his gun then jumps down 
      from his front door. A two foot jump that will one day be 
      unnecessary when Walt puts a front porch on his home.

      As Walt walks toward his  96 FORD BRONCO, we cut to:


      THERE S A HUGE ANTLERED ELK HEAD MOUNTED ABOVE THE DOOR. THE 
      AMERICAN FLAG, THE FLAG OF WYOMING, and ROTARY CLUB PLAQUES 
      flank the entrance. People mingle and chat. Folding tables 
      are pulled together, covered in paper tablecloths, paper cups 
      of coffee, and paper plates of breakfast.

      Walt enters...He is spotted by a young guy who looks good in 
      his deputy uniform. BRANCH CONNALLY. 30. Branch stands up 
      fast, stopping his conversation with a couple of middle-aged 
      businessmen abruptly, and moves to Walt, who looks annoyed.

                                  WALT
                    Morning Branch.

                                  BRANCH 
                    Where you been Walt? People have 
                    been asking after you.

                                  WALT
                    Just out tending to the police side 
                    of the job. But happy to see you 
                    got the glad-handing covered.

                                  BRANCH
                    Can t serve the community if we 
                    don t talk to the community, 
                    Sheriff. Just here...representin . 

      Before Walt can respond to Branch...

                                    CITIZEN 1(O.C.)
                    There you are, Sheriff.

      Walt spins around to find the first of several LOCALS who 
      accost their elected official. Walt tries to maintain his 
      composure over a series of overlapping cuts...

                                    CITIZEN 1(CONT D)
                    We need to talk about the Durant 
                    Christmas decorations. Last year 
                    they were the ugliest in the state.

                                  WALT
                    Come on now. Cody s were uglier.

                                    CITIZEN 2
                    I still got raccoons in my yard.

                                  WALT
                    So do I.                                                                                    11.


                                    CITIZEN 3
                    That graffitti s bad for business. 
                    Someone has to paint over it.

                                  WALT
                    Brooks  Hardware sells paint and 
                    brushes. Aisle 4, I think.

                                    CITIZEN 4
                    Heard one of your deputies found a 
                    dead body. Is that why you re late?

      Branch eavesdrops on this exchange.

                                  WALT
                    Probably just a hunting accident. And 
                    when have you known me to be on time?

      Walt grins and goes, moves through a barrage of handshakes 
      pats on backs. Then, just as he clears them, he stops.

                                  SWEET OLDER WOMAN
                    Walter, I went to Church today...I 
                    lit a candle for her. 

      Walt doesn t know what to say. An awkward beat, then he puts 
      a hand on her shoulder and walks away, heading for the exit. 


      Originally a Carnegie Library, there s still plenty of old 
      character to the space. But it s not the bustling warren of 
      desks and support staff that we re used to seeing. This is a 
      limited operation indeed: one holding cell off to the side, 
      currently occupied by a HUNGOVER INMATE, a book-lined office 
      in the back, some file cabinets along the hall, a copier, fax 
      machine and a couple of communal desks in the main room, and 
      a ball of energy up front. 

      This is RUBY, 50, office manager/dispatch, and the oil of the 
      machine. She stands when Walt enters.

                                  WALT
                    Ruby, how we doing today?

      Ruby flips through a stack of POST-IT NOTES as she talks.                                                                                     13.


                                  RUBY
                    Someone trashed Craig Martin s pick 
                    up. Wrote all over it with spray 
                    paint. Mostly derogatory remarks, 
                    and one specific warning to women 
                    not to breed with Craig. That part 
                      I paraphrased. Doc Bloomfield wants 
                    to schedule a physical for you this 
                    week. Also Vic s wondering when 
                    you re going to send The Ferg out. 
                    And Cady wanted to confirm lunch.

      During all this, Walt has walked around the desks, right over 
      to the Hungover Inmate in the holding cell.

                                  WALT
                    Call Craig Martin. Tell him to 
                    apologize to his girlfriend.  No  
                    on the physical... 

      Walt slides the styrofoam container through the slot. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    And tell Cady we can try for lunch 
                    tomorrow. Again.

                                  RUBY
                    Why don t you call her, Sheriff. 
                    She s your daughter. 

                                  WALT
                    She likes you better.

      Walt turns to a male deputy at a desk. This is THE FERG, 28. 
      Built like a brick shithouse, but his face is all puppy-dog: 
      loyal, eager to please, and, while able to learn complex 
      tricks, probably not getting into Mensa. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Is The Ferg dressed for the 
                    elements today?

                                  THE FERG
                    I got some capilene in my car. 
                    Where am I going?

                                  WALT
                    Pronghorn Ridge trailhead. Vic s 
                    there. She ll fill you in.

                                  BRANCH
                    Ferg, I ll go with you.                                                                                    14.


                                  WALT
                    No Branch, you re staying here. Our 
                    victim had a 12 gauge Mossberg. See 
                    if he had it registered. Then I 
                    need you to check and see if he had 
                    any hunting licenses.
                          (hands Branch some notes)
                    Those are the plates on all the 
                    vehicles out at Pronghorn Ridge. 
                    Tell me who owns em. Find the 
                    drivers, ask them if they had any 
                    contact with the Barnes boys, the 
                    victim, or if they heard any 
                    gunshots.

                                  BRANCH
                    It s hunting season. Everybody 
                    hears gunshots.

                                  WALT
                    Also call out to the Lazy J Ranch, 
                    see if they ve had any problems 
                    with their sheep, neighbors or 
                    ranch hands.

      Walt finds a large stainless steel coffee travel mug, fills 
      it, then heads out toward the front doors.

                                  RUBY
                    Where you going?

                                  WALT
                    Going to drop the victim off at the 
                    hospital so Doc Bloomfield can get 
                    an autopsy going. Then I m going to 
                      Wheatland.

                                  RUBY
                    That s a five hour drive.

                                  WALT
                    That s where the victim s from. 
                    This kind of news is best not 
                    delivered over the phone.

                                  THE FERG
                    You re going to notify next of kin?

                                  WALT 
                    Ferg. Why are you still here?

      Ferg scrambles to his feet.                                                                                    15.


                                  BRANCH
                    Hey Walt, that s a long ass 
                    drive...I could do that for you--

                                  WALT
                    You could. But then you wouldn t be 
                    doing what I asked you to do.

      Walt exits. Ruby, Branch and The Ferg share a concerned look. 

                                  THE FERG
                    He hasn t done a notification in a 
                    while.

                                  BRANCH
                    He hasn t done much in a while.


      Walt drives through The Big Empty -- the long, straight, flat 
      highway, heading for Wheatland, Wyoming. 

                                  RUBY (V.O.)
                    Maybe we should all spend a little 
                    less time wondering about the 
                    Sheriff and more time doing what he 
                    asked us to do.

      On the seat next to Walt: the wallet photo of the victim and 
      a smiling woman. Walt looks at it, then speeds off, the sun 
      falling in the sky. 


      Angle on the door. It opens. Revealing Walt, hat on.

                                  WALT
                    Are you Susan Parkford?
                          (She nods)
                    I m Sheriff Longmire. Absaroka County. 

      SUSAN PARKFORD (40) pretty, but it s been a few years since 
      she cared much about that, is surprised to see Walt.                                                                                    16.


                                  SUSAN
                    That s practically Montana.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah. Could I come in?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course.

      Walt enters, takes off his hat. Rubs at his nose awkwardly.

                                  WALT
                    I just have a couple of questions, 
                    if you don t mind.

                                  SUSAN
                      Um...Okay.

                                  WALT
                    Do you know where your husband is?

                                  SUSAN
                    Laramie. At the University. There s 
                      a conference. He s a high school 
                    teacher. I think he s staying at 
                    the Days Inn near campus. Is he in 
                    some kind of trouble? 

                                  WALT
                    How long s he been in Laramie?

                                  SUSAN
                    He left yesterday morning. Early. 
                    Before I got up.

      Walt looks around the small, neat home. It s a well-lived in, 
      homey place. Photos of Susan and Grant. A FLY-TYING RIG on a 
      small desk by the window.

                                  WALT
                    He a fisherman?

                                  SUSAN
                    No. Well, a little bit. But that s 
                    mine. I tie flies and sell em to an 
                    outfitter in Jackson Hole. A little 
                    extra spending money.

                                  WALT
                    You or your husband hunters?

                                  SUSAN
                    What exactly is going on here?                                                                                    17.


                                  WALT
                    Ma am, do you have any idea what 
                    sort of business your husband might 
                    have up in Durant?

                                  SUSAN
                    Durant? No. Now please. Tell me 
                    what is going on.

      Walt puts his head down. His head stays down.

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    Mr. Longmire, sir, you re making me 
                    real nervous...

      Walt finally lifts his head. He tries to pull it together, 
      and does long enough to croak...

                                  WALT
                    I have some very bad news.

      Walt s mouth opens to say more, but he says nothing. He takes 
      a breath. Tries again. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Your husband...

      The rest of the words choke in his throat. He can t finish.

                                  SUSAN
                    What is it? What is it? Please God, 
                    tell me. What s happened? Tell me, 
                    tell me.

      His eyes starting to tear, Walt tries one more time. 

                                  WALT
                    I m sorry Mrs. Parkford but...

      Again, he stops, eyes welling. He looks at the floor.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    He s gone. Your husband is gone. 
                    He s dead, ma am.

      The woman bursts into tears.

                                  SUSAN
                    No! No!

      Walt is just frozen, breathing unevenly. He s unable to offer 
      Susan any comfort as he s too busy trying to hold back his 
      own tears. The sound of her shouting blends into...                                                                                    18.


      The ROAR of a Ford Bronco engine...


      On Walt, pushing 95 mph on the speedometer. Still agitated, 
      he tries to find a smooth breath inside somewhere.

      Ruby s voice comes over the radio, but garbled: 

                                  RUBY
                    Walt, pick up, -- there? Vic needs 
                    to ---- you. Found ---.

                                  WALT 
                    Ruby, say that again, over.
                          (no luck)
                    Ruby? Ruby?

      Frustrated by the radio, Walt hangs it up, hard. He looks 
      back at the road. And sees something --

      A SIGN. Just off the highway. We see what Walt sees:

       BRANCH CONNALLY FOR SHERIFF.  

      It features a large photo of the Deputy Branch Connally.  
      Looking serious, yet friendly.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Son of a...

      But before he can finish the thought, he s snapped out of it 
      by the LOW BLAST OF AN 18-WHEELER SEMI S AIRHORN.

      Walt looks up to see said semi heading straight for him. 
      Instinctively he throws the wheel, sending the Bronco off the 
      highway, over the bumpy shoulder and finally down a berm.

      Walt s Bronco KEELS OVER AT 80MPH, hard and loud, and slides 
      on its passenger side. 

      WE GO INSIDE: Walt gets BUCKED around. His seatbelt strains 
      to hold him in place. Anything not nailed down RICOCHETS 
      around inside the Bronco. Walt s bright eyes narrow. We see 
      what he sees, and it is approaching fast--

      A JAGGED ROCKY WALL of a ditch. SLAM. The screen goes black. 
      And we re left wondering if maybe it s time to start worrying 
      about Walt after all...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO


      Walt hangs in the driver s seat, breathing heavy, strapped in 
      his seatbelt suspended the 6 ft above the passenger window, 
      looking down at the ground below...Walt s seatbelt will not 
      release. It s jammed...Walt digs in his coat pocket and pulls 
      out a BONE-HANDLED CASE FOLDING KNIFE with his right hand 
      that is bleeding from a GASH. BLOOD on the metal side of 
      Walt s radio tells us that may have been the cause.

      Walt unclicks the knife with his teeth, then cuts through the 
      seatbelt strap on his shoulder. Ffft...the tough fabric 
      breaks and gravity takes over. BANG, BOOM, BASH. He lands on 
      the passenger door below. Walt sucks up the pain.

      Walt rubs his injured bloody hand and wrist (his shooting 
      hand). Over his head, the radio mic dangles from the curly 
      cord, irritating the hell out of Walt. He sees the photo of 
      Parkford and his wife. Grabs it. Tucks it in his pocket.


      Walt enters, sees the owner, DAVE ESTES (40s) talking with a 
      CUSTOMER COUPLE. Dave is a solid, no-nonsense salesman. 
      Tourists think he s Indian. He s not. He s Hispanic. Dave 
      nods hello to Walt and then turns back to the couple he was 
      chatting with and hands them a card.

                                  ESTES
                    If you re interested in that rug, 
                    give me a call. You won t find one 
                    like that anywhere else.

      The couple exits, and Estes gives the BIG GUY HELPER (who s 
      been waiting off to the side) a nod. Estes and the helper 
      fold the rug, Estes turns to Walt.

                                  ESTES (CONT D)
                    When the economy tanks, first thing 
                    people give up is art and antiques. 

      The helper lifts the big rug over his shoulder and takes it 
      to the backroom.

                                  ESTES (CONT D)
                    So how can I help you today, 
                    Sheriff?

                                  WALT
                    I m looking for a Sharps rifle.

                                  ESTES
                    Hmmm, an original? I don t have 
                    any. Not right now. I come across 
                    them from time to time. This for 
                    hunting? Collecting? Or just to 
                    hang over your fireplace?

                                  WALT
                    Depends.                                                                                    25.


                                  ESTES
                    Because I do have a Henry  Yeller-
                    Boy  rifle and a Colt 396, needs 
                    some TLC though. Both used at 
                    Little Bighorn. If that interests 
                    you?

                                  WALT
                    Bet you got Custer s mustache back 
                    there, too. Nah. Mainly interested 
                    in the Sharps. And the names of the 
                    buyers and sellers. Sheriff 
                    business. 

                                  ESTES
                    Ah. Got it, well, I ve only seen a 
                    few in the last couple months. 
                    Charles Burnett sold me a Sharps 
                    back in the summer, but he bought 
                    it back a few weeks ago. His 
                      grandfather apparently was not too 
                    happy with Charles selling it 
                    without asking. It s sad. I have 
                    people come in here, whites, 
                    Cheyenne, Crow, all kinds, selling 
                    off family heirlooms to make ends 
                    meet. I m afraid some of the money 
                    doesn t go to paying bills if you 
                    know what I mean.

                                  WALT
                    I do. Any other names come to mind?

                                  ESTES
                    I file all the guns I buy or sell 
                    with ATF. You know what pain in the 
                    asses they are about registering 
                    firearms. You can call them. Or I 
                    can check my files?

                                  WALT
                    I was hoping you could save me a 
                    phone call. By the time I hang up, 
                    I ll have a Federal agent sitting 
                    in my office. And they don t tend 
                    to want to leave right away.

                                  ESTES
                      I understand. I ll check my office 
                    if you don t mind waiting.

                                  WALT
                          (smiles)
                    I m very good at waiting.                                                                                     26.


      Estes exits. Off Walt -- looking at an INDIAN LEDGER DRAWING 
      OF A BUFFALO HUNT hanging on the wall.


      Walt drives. Vic rides shotgun, holding up a bag containing 
      the pants.

                                  VIC
                    They were a good 75 yards from the 
                    victim. Even further from where the 
                    slug was found. And they were 
                    nowhere near the trailhead or any 
                      campsites. 

                                  WALT
                    Sounds like they might not be 
                    related to our murder.                                                                                    27.


                                  VIC
                    Except look at them. They re in 
                    good enough shape that they clearly 
                    haven t been sitting out there for 
                    months -- they even smell like 
                    cigarette smoke. Problem is, 
                    they re Wranglers...pretty common 
                    pants and a pretty common size. 34-
                    32. They wouldn t fit you, Walt.

      Walt is taken by something though: the belt buckle. And 
      almost swerves off the road when he looks at it...

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                      Whoa...you alright?

                                  WALT
                    Sorry. It s just...that buckle. Let 
                    me see it.

      Vic holds the wheel as Walt inspects the buckle for a beat... 

                                  VIC
                    You recognize it?

                                  WALT
                    Maybe. But I can t think of why. 

      Walt takes back the wheel, drives onward. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    My memory s slipping. Guess I gotta 
                    start writing more stuff down.

      Walt hands Vic the list that Dave Estes gave him earlier.

                                  VIC
                          (reads)
                    Lonnie Little Bird. Charles 
                    Burnett. Jefferson Sand.

                                  WALT
                    They re all Cheyenne and they ve 
                    all bought Sharps rifles from Dave 
                    Estes in the last year. That s the 
                    gun that killed Parkford. Estes 
                    printed out a picture for us too.

                                  VIC 
                          (re: Sharps rifle photo)
                    In a world where you can buy an 
                    AK47 off the internet, why use an 
                    antique like this?                                                                                    28.


                                  WALT
                    Might be old, but it still does the 
                    job.

                                  VIC
                    Any of these guys connected to 
                    Grant Parkford?

                                  WALT
                    Don t know. That s why I want to 
                    talk to them.

                                  VIC
                    And you think the tribal police are 
                    gonna help us do that?

                    I like to think that when there s a 
                    murder involved, they ll put aside 
                    petty personal issues and help us 
                    find a killer.

                                  VIC
                    They might not think that you 
                    putting their Police Chief in 
                    prison is exactly petty.

                                  WALT
                    He s the one who decided to run an 
                    extortion racket. Not me.


      Walt and Vic enter. Walt s pensive. Vic is pissed off.                                                                                     30.


                                  VIC
                    How could you just stand there and 
                    take that? That son of a bitch 
                    better not step off the Rez.

                                  WALT
                    For the last time, leave it alone. 
                    No point making things worse. He 
                    had to get his anger out of his 
                    system. Sooner he does that, sooner 
                    we can get back to a little 
                      cooperation...

      And then Branch approaches from his desk, all pep and 
      enthusiasm. Vic watches the following intently. 

                                  BRANCH
                      Okay...now it wasn t easy, but I ve 
                    tracked down all the vehicles 
                    parked at Pronghorn Ridge. Aside 
                    from the victim s SUV, and the 
                    Barnes  truck, there were two other 
                    vehicles: one belonged to a pair of 
                    hikers. The other belongs to Scott 
                    Miller. His wife says he s hunting 
                    elk up the mountain. Been gone two 
                    days and she expects him back 
                    tomorrow. Around dinner time.

                                  VIC
                    Well aren t you the eager little

                          (hands Walt a photocopy)
                    I thought you might ask that. Also, 
                    the weather service called back, 
                    told me the snow came on pretty 
                    sudden around 3:30-4 am yesterday, 
                    so Parkford was probably shot 
                    before then. When it was still 
                    clear skies and a full moon. 

                                  VIC
                    Given where we found the slug, 
                    whoever shot Parkford would have 
                    had a nice silhouette and a clear 
                    line of sight.                                                                                    31.

                    I talked to Jake Hicks from the

                    heard of the victim. And... Um... 
                    speaking of the victim... After you 
                    left, I remembered something. I was 
                    looking up gun registrations and it 
                    hit me. Parkford came into the 
                    station a couple months ago. 

                                  WALT

                    the name immediately. It s not like 
                    you showed me a picture of the guy. 
                    But I did remember it and I m 
                    telling you now. Maybe if we had a 
                    more up-to-date computer system 
                    around here...

                                  WALT
                    Why? Why, Branch? Why did the 
                    victim come into the station.

                                  BRANCH
                    Some friend of his, a woman named 
                    Lynn Stillwater, was looking for 
                    her missing daughter. Parkford was 
                    helping out. He brought a photo of 
                    the missing girl. Her name s Lilly.

      Branch hands him the photo of a 10 year-old girl: Lilly.

                      Everything I could, but Parkford 
                    wasn t a relative. Couldn t file a 
                    missing persons claim, and he said 
                    the missing girl was from the Rez, 
                    so it was a tribal police problem. 
                      I forwarded the info on to them.

      A bustling dive bar filled with a mix of MINERS blowing off 
      steam and CASINO PLAYERS drowning their sorrows. 

      A BUSBOY grabs empty plates and beer glasses from a table and 
      carries them toward the kitchen as Walt enters. Walt sees 
      Henry behind the bar (Henry s the Handsome Cheyenne from 
      earlier) talking to a PAIR OF ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. Walt makes a 
      bee-line for him. 

                                  WALT
                    Hey Henry. I need a favor.

                    doesn t want to leave her sister, 
                    and I was just saying how my best 
                    friend is single, employed and 
                    almost as charming as me.

                                  WALT
                    Will you ladies excuse us?

      The women leave. Henry sighs as he turns to Walt.

                                  HENRY
                    Gotta get back on the horse, Walt.

                                  WALT
                      Appreciate the advice, but that s 
                    not what I m here for.

      Off Henry, intrigued...


      Not much to her name, and what she has is a bit frayed, but 
      it s arranged nicely. Like Lynn herself.

      Walt bandages his wound, looks at the sleeping dogs lying on 
      the cold floor. 

                                  LYNN
                    Did you find her? Did you?

                                  WALT
                    Not yet.

      Walt opens up Parkford s file to refer to his notes. Lynn 
      sees the photo of Lilly inside. Shakes her head.

                                  LYNN
                    Well how can you with that photo? 
                    That s old. Lilly s 16 years old now.

      Walt takes this in as Lynn goes to a drawer, brings over a 
      framed photo of Lilly, clearly older in this one. A sweet 
      looking 16. 

                                  LYNN (CONT D)

      She glares at Walt. Henry tries to play the diplomat.

                                  HENRY
                    You said 3 months. Is that how long 
                    Lilly has been gone?

                                  LYNN
                    Yes. 3 months ago we had a stupid 
                    fight and she stormed out.

                                  LYNN
                    Once. Right after she left. She 
                    called and said she was staying with 
                    a friend. An older girl who left the 
                      reservation two years ago. Lilly 
                    said everything was okay so I 
                    dedided to give her a few days to 
                    calm down. But then she called me 
                    again. She sounded different. 
                    Scared. Said she wasn t coming back.

                                  WALT
                    What do you know about the girl she 
                    was staying with? 

                                  LYNN
                    I can t find her anywhere. But I 
                    talked to others about her. They 
                    say she s into drugs. And they say 
                    she s a...prostitute. My boyfriend 
                    says he s heard Lilly is doing that 
                    too. But I don t believe it.                                                                                     36.

                       jurisdiction  issue. That I should 
                    talk to your office.

                    tend to listen to other white

                    far away?

                                  LYNN
                    Because Grant is Lilly s father.
                          (off Walt s expression)
                    He didn t tell you that? 

                                  WALT
                    He spoke with one of my deputies.

                                  LYNN
                    You know things are bad when the 
                    only person you can count on is 
                    someone you haven t seen in 17 
                    years. But I knew I could count on 
                    Grant. He s a good man. Maybe the 
                    only one I ve ever known.

                                  WALT
                    Why would Grant give us such an 
                    outdated photo of Lilly?

                                  LYNN
                    It s the most recent one he has. 
                    Every year I sent him a photo on 
                    Lilly s birthday. And he d send a 
                    check. Then one year, the photo was 
                    returned with no forwarding address. 
                    And there were no more checks. I 
                    could have used that money. I could 
                    have made things better for Lilly.

                    It s not easy raising a girl all 
                    alone.

                                  WALT
                    Well I m sure your boyfriend helps 
                    out a little.

                                  LYNN
                    Charles? He was no help. More like 
                    having another kid in the house. And 
                    I should have said  ex-boyfriend.  

                                  WALT
                    Charles. That wouldn t happen to be 
                    Charles Burnett, would it?

      Lynn nods. On Walt, thinking: Charles Burnett. Walt stands.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Ms. Stillwater, I m very sorry 
                    we ve been so slow to get involved. 
                    But now we are, and we ll do what 
                    we can to find your girl.

                                  LYNN
                    Thank you. And when you see Grant, 
                    tell him thank you. I know it s too 
                    hard for him to come here.

      Henry looks at Walt...is he going to break the news to her?

                                  WALT
                    I ll tell him.

      Walt exits. Off Henry, watching his friend go...


      Walt rides shotgun. Henry drives.

                                  HENRY
                    You should have told her Grant 
                    Parkford was dead.

                                  WALT
                    Lynn s not legally related to him, 
                    so I m not obligated to tell her. 
                    Besides, she might be involved. Or 
                    her boyfriend. Charles Burnett.

                                  HENRY
                    What you did is dishonest.                                                                                    38.

                    Sometimes to do my job you can t be 
                    as forthcoming as you d like to be. 
                    You have to see how people react. 
                    Be patient. And if that helps me 
                    figure out who killed Parkford and 
                    where Lilly is, so much the better. 
                          (beat)
                    We pretty much swept the hookers out 
                    of Absaroka last year. You heard 
                    anything new about prostitution in 
                    the county or on the Rez?

                                  HENRY
                    Not my thing. Never had to pay for it.

                                  WALT
                          (nods, then a long beat)
                    Have I lost a step?

                                  HENRY
                    What?

                                  WALT
                    I just had to ask you about the 
                    state of the sex trade in my own 
                    county.

                                  HENRY
                    You are an optimist. You do not 
                    like to think about the depravity 
                    of human kind. And also, yes. You 
                    have lost a step.

                                  WALT
                      I wouldn t say I m an optimist. Up 
                    until an hour ago, I thought Grant 
                    Parkford was some guy having an 
                    affair. Never occurred to me he was 
                    doing something...heroic.

                                  HENRY
                    Heroic?

                                  WALT
                    Trying to save his daughter from 
                      prostitution? Seems honorable.

                                  HENRY
                    You think 16 years of abandonment 
                    by her father might have something 
                    to do with her getting into 
                      prostitution in the first place?                                                                                    39.


      Henry s truck pulls into The Red Pony parking lot.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah, the guy screwed up, but isn t 
                    it better that he tried to make up 
                    for it?

                                  HENRY
                    Maybe. But just because a man 
                    decides to make up for all his 
                    mistakes in one day doesn t mean 
                    the rest of the world is going to 
                    be so quick to forgive him.

      Walt nods. Gets out of the truck. A waning moon shines down 
      as Walt walks across the parking lot towards his Bronco.


      Walt sleeps on a cot. Ruby approaches, then clangs a metal 
      water bottle along the bars.

                                  RUBY
                    Wake up. You have a visitor.


      CADY LONGMIRE (27). Dressed a bit more professionally than 
      most of the folks in Durant, Cady sits in her dad s chair.

                                  WALT
                    Hey, punk. What re you doing here 
                    so early?

                                  CADY
                      Everything okay, Dad? You cancelled 
                    lunch and dinner.

                                  WALT
                    I didn t cancel dinner. We never 
                    had that planned. How about some 
                    breakfast at the Busy Bee right 
                    now? 

      He turns to exit, indicating she should follow...

                                  CADY
                    I have to be in court.

                                  WALT
                    So no breakfast.

      Walt turns back. As he does, Cady notices his injuries.                                                                                     40.


                                  CADY
                    What happened to you?

                                  WALT
                          (holds up his hand)
                    Dog bite.

                                  CADY
                    This job. You ve got to be more 
                    careful.

                                  WALT
                    You might not have to worry about 
                    that much longer. Branch Connally s 
                    decided to run against me, so I 
                    might be out of a job soon enough.

      Walt stops. Notices that Cady is holding the wooden box of 
      tea we saw earlier in Walt s kitchen. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Where did you get that?

                    From your house. I stopped by last 
                    night to check on you. The place is 
                    even more of a mess. I started to 
                    clean up...but then I saw this.
                          (re: the wooden box)
                    You ve got mom s ashes in the

                                  WALT
                    I wasn t drinking.

                                  CADY
                    And then you don t even tell 
                    anybody about getting in a wreck? 
                    It could ve been a lot worse, dad. 
                    I really think you need to talk to 
                    someone.

                                  WALT
                    I talk to people all day long, 
                    Cady. What I could really use is a 
                    break from all the talking.

                                  CADY
                          (re: wooden tea box)
                    You need to deal with this, Dad. 
                    People are asking me where they can 
                    visit Mom. Scatter her ashes. Put 
                    them in an urn at a mausoleum. Put 
                    her name on a freaking bench, but 
                    deal with it. Because I m not going 
                    to watch you just wallow in this 
                    for another year.

      Through the office window, Walt sees Dave Estes enter and 
      move to Ruby. Phew. A way out of the conversation. Walt picks 
      up the tea box and clears a path for Cady to get to the door. 

                                  WALT
                    You re gonna be late for court.

      Cady reluctantly exits, kisses Walt on the cheek, then nods 
      as she crosses paths with Estes.

                                  ESTES 
                    Hey Cady...
                          (no response, so...)
                    Hey Walt. I went back five years 
                    into my records and found more 
                    Sharps rifle buyers and sellers. 

      He gives Walt the list.

                                  WALT
                    Thank you, Dave.

      Estes lingers. Staring at the wall.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Is there something else?                                                                                    42.

                    Those sconces. Would you consider 
                    selling them? 

                                  WALT 
                    They re not mine to sell. 

                                  ESTES
                    I ll give you 800 each. A lot more 
                    for the ceiling fixtures. I heard 
                    you re having budget issues with 
                    the county...

      Walt is saved from haggling by Ruby. 

                                  RUBY
                    Walt. You better get over to the 
                    Qwik Stop. It s Vic.


      Charles Burnett, handcuffed, in a chair across from Walt.

                                  WALT
                    Do you think you ve calmed down 
                    enough to answer some questions?

                                    CHARLES
                    Long as you keep that lady out of 
                    my sight.

      Walt nods to Vic, still pissed off, who obediently melts back 
      into the bullpen area. She sits at her desk. Walt continues.

                                  WALT
                    So. You were Lynn Stillwater s 
                      boyfriend? 

                                    CHARLES
                    For a while. She dumped me. That 
                    chick is high-maintenance, and I 
                    wouldn t put up with her bullshit. 

                                  WALT
                    What bullshit exactly? 

                                    CHARLES 
                    She cried a lot. Always complaining 
                    about money. Blaming her problems 
                    on other people. Usually me. 

                                  WALT
                    Did you know Lilly?

                                    CHARLES
                    Not really. She was never around. 
                    Stayed out late. Got into trouble. 
                    I tried to use a little discipline, 
                    but she didn t want to hear it.

                                  WALT
                    Lynn said you think Lilly is 
                    involved in prostitution.                                                                                    44.


                                    CHARLES
                    I ve heard some rumors.

                                  WALT
                    From who?
                          (Charles shrugs)
                    You familiar with a man named Grant 
                    Parkford?

                                    CHARLES
                    Hell yeah. The great white hope. 
                    The asshole abandons her with a 
                    baby, and 16 years later, she still 
                    talks about him like he s a hero.

                                  WALT
                    Just so you know, he s dead now. 

                                    CHARLES
                    He the guy who was in that hunting 
                    accident the other day?

                                  WALT
                    Dave Estes tells me you bought a 
                    Sharps rifle off him last month. 
                    Now I don t like to stereotype, but 
                    you don t strike me as the kind of 
                    guy who goes antiquing...

      Now Charles realizes what he s really suspected of.

                                    CHARLES
                    I didn t kill Parkford. 

                                  WALT
                    Then you won t mind us taking a 
                    look at your Sharps rifle.

                                    CHARLES
                    No way.

                                  WALT
                          (calls across the room)
                    Ferg. Lock this man up.

                                    CHARLES
                    I didn t do a thing to Parkford! 
                    You can t lock me up for that!

                                  WALT
                    I m not. I m locking you up for 
                      assaulting Deputy Moretti at the 
                    Esso.                                                                                    45.


                                  VIC
                    What the hell s the Esso?

                                  WALT
                    Oh. The Qwik Stop. It used to be an 
                    Esso station.
                          (Walt stops, thinks, then)
                    You decide to let us take a look at 
                    that Sharps of yours, we can talk 
                    about negotiating the charges.

      Walt heads for Vic s desk. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic, give me those pants.

                                  VIC
                    If I had a dime for every time a 
                    man said that to me...

                                  WALT
                          (ignores the inuendo)
                      I remember why the belt buckle on 
                    the pants looks so familiar: It s 
                    from the old Open 9 Ranch.

                                  VIC
                    Never heard of it.

                                  WALT
                    You wouldn t have. It got sold 
                    about twenty years ago. And they 
                    changed their name.


      Walt, Vic, Caleb and Garrett sit around a table in a large 
      ranch kitchen. Caleb s arrogance has largely vanished.

                                  CALEB
                    I m telling you. I don t know how 
                    my pants got out there. Maybe one 
                    of my friends was pranking me...

                                  WALT
                    There s a man dead and a girl 
                    missing.

                                  WALT (CONT'D)
                    And for some reason you were in 
                    such a hurry to get away from 
                    Pronghorn Ridge that you left 
                    without your pants. I m not leaving 
                    here without an explanation.

                                    GARRETT
                    Caleb. You answer the sheriff s 
                    questions or I ll take you to jail 
                    my own self.

      Caleb looks at his hands. Takes a breath, then...

                                  CALEB
                    I was out there trying to get laid.

                                  WALT
                    Who were you there with?

                                  CALEB
                    Nobody. I mean, I went there alone.

                                  VIC
                    Just you and a herd of soft, 
                    compliant sheep...

                                  CALEB
                    Huh? No. That s where the, y know, 
                    girls were. You know. The girls... 
                    you pay to...you know...

                                  WALT
                    You mean prostitutes? Caleb, there 
                    aren t any prostitutes anywhere 
                    near Pronghorn Ridge.

                                  CALEB
                    Well not now. They moved the RV.

                                  WALT
                    The RV...?

                                  CALEB
                    Yeah. They move around so folks 
                    like you can t bust em. 

                                  WALT
                    So you were with a prostitute in an RV.

                                  CALEB
                    Yeah. But we didn t do anything. I 
                    mean, we were starting to kinda get 
                    into it when this big guy busted 
                    in.

                                  CALEB (CONT'D)
                    I was like,  hang on, dude.  But he 
                    threw me out the door without my 
                    damn pants on.

                                  WALT
                    Can you describe the big guy?

                                  CALEB
                    Big. Darkish hair I think. I was 
                    drunk. I didn t get a look at him.

                                  WALT
                    How about the girl? You spent a 
                    little more quality time with her. 

      Caleb hesitates. But a look at his dad tells him to 
      cooperate. Caleb pulls out a cellphone. He scrolls, finds 
      what he s looking for and holds it up for Walt to see. 

                                  CALEB
                    My friends wanted proof that I did 
                    the deed. 

      They compare the cellphone photo to mom s photo. It s Lilly.

                    You say this RV moved around so 
                    folks like me can t find it. How do 
                    folks like you go about finding it?

                                  CALEB
                    Uh...I don t know...

                                  WALT
                    The girl in this photo. The one you 
                    paid to have sex with. She s 16 
                    years old. That s statutory rape in 
                    the state of Wyoming.

                                  CALEB
                    But I never even had sex with her!

                                    GARRETT
                    Answer the damn question! 

                                  CALEB
                    If you want to find out where the 
                    RV is, you just talk to the Indian

      Vic and Walt look at each other. Henry?

      Henry uses the CLAW END OF A HAMMER to bust A HOLE in the 
      drywall behind the bar. He pauses and looks at the hole, 
      disappointed. This hole joins six other holes on the wall. 

      Walt enters with a dark expression. Henry notices, but he s 
      too frustrated and too focused on his task. He hammers again. 

                                  WALT
                          (watches his friend, then)
                    What the hell have you gotten 
                    yourself into, Henry?

                          (not turning around)
                    I can t find the junction box. 
                    Guess I drywalled over it.

                                  WALT
                    That s not what I m asking about.

                            demeanor)
                    Well then I guess you better tell 
                    me what you are asking about so I 
                    can give you a better answer.

                    Are you running some kind of escort 
                    service out of this bar?

                    to crack a smile, Walt. Then I m 
                    gonna have to assume that you re 
                    not kidding.

                                  WALT
                    I asked you a very simple question.

                                  HENRY
                    No. You asked me a very confusing 
                    question.

                                  WALT
                    Really?  Cause I just talked to a 
                    young man who told me some inside

                    Said if you wanted female company 
                    in Absaroka County and you were 
                    willing to pay for the pleasure, 
                    you should go to the Red Pony and 
                    talk to the Indian.

                                  HENRY
                    So 38 years, then.
                          (off Walt s confused look)
                    We ve known each other for 37 
                    years. So 38 years must be how long 
                    you have to be Walt Longmire s 
                    friend before he trusts you.

                                  WALT
                    I am trying to find the person who 
                    murdered Grant Parkford, and I m 
                    pretty sure whoever that is will 
                    lead me to that missing girl...

                                  HENRY
                    Well you better get going then.

      Henry turns and swings the claw hammer at the wall. A little 
      harder this time. Walt exits. After he does, Henry stops his 
      work. He turns and looks at the door, thinking...


      Walt enters. Vic and The Ferg sit at a desk cataloging 
       evidence,  mostly WET TRASH from the crime scene. 

      Walt keeps walking. He stops at the door to his office. It is 
      covered with Post-it notes. He starts to read one when...

      CLICK. The sound of a rifle being cocked. Walt turns quickly. 
      It s Branch. Proudly holding an OLD RIFLE just like the one 
      in the photo Estes gave them. A box of shells sits on the 
      desk beside him. 

                                  BRANCH
                    I managed to get my hands on 
                    Charles Burnett s gun by talking to 
                    the tribal police. They were happy 
                    to help. I served a search warrant 
                    and got the rifle, plus a box of 
                    old black powder shells.

      Walt yanks the rifle out of Branch s hands, examines the 
      rifle. Then cocks it. Looks in the breech.

                                  WALT
                    This is not the murder weapon.                                                                                    51.


                                  BRANCH
                    How do you know? We didn t even get 
                    a chance to run ballistics tests...

      Walt grabs a box of shells from Branch...And loads the 
      Sharps. Walt aims across the room and PULLS THE TRIGGER. 
      CLICK. Nothing. Walt strides towards the holding cell. 

                                  WALT
                    There. We just did a ballistics 
                    test. If you don t clean these 
                    rifles that use black powder 
                    shells, the black powder corrodes 
                    the metal. This weapon s a mess. It 
                    doesn t even have a firing pin.

      Walt points out the missing pin, then hands the rifle through 
      the bars to Charles. Who can t believe what he just saw. Vic 
      stifles a laugh. Enjoys the look on Branch s face.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Unlock him, Ferg, and see him to 
                    the door.

      The Ferg gets up, follows orders...Walt exits to his office. 
      Branch stands there, stunned and pissed. 


      Walt at his desk, stares at the old photo of the girl, Lilly. 

                                  BRANCH
                          (enters)
                    You didn t have to do that.
                          (Walt just listens)
                    You didn t have to make a big deal 
                    out of it in front of everybody.
                          (Walt nods, maybe)
                    Y know, Walt, I haven t made a big 
                    deal over you not showing up for 
                    work. Calling in sick. Or just 
                    sitting in here reading a book 
                    while the rest of us cover for you. 
                    Never thought it was necessary to 
                    make a big deal about that.

                                  WALT
                    Sounds like you re already writing 
                    negative campaign ads.
                          (Branch looks confused)
                    I saw the sign, Branch. Nice photo.                                                                                    52.


                                  BRANCH
                          (a beat, busted)
                    They weren t supposed to go up  til 
                    I talked to you.

                                  WALT
                    You really think you re the man for 
                    this job, Branch?

                                  BRANCH
                    I ll leave that up to the people. 
                    But given a choice between some 
                    fresh thinking, and a tired, 
                    absentee sheriff driving around 
                    with Budweiser cans all over the 
                    floor of his truck, I like my odds.
                          (off Walt s stare)
                    I heard about your little accident.

      Walt stands. Goes to his bookshelf. Looks. As he does...

                                  WALT
                    I m sorry I embarrassed you back 
                    there, Branch. But before you go 
                    spreading any accusations, consider 
                    this. Every man that s ever had a 
                    beer with me will tell you the same 
                    thing. I drink Rainier. Always 
                    have. Always will. Those Bud cans? 
                    I picked em up cause I hate looking 
                    at litter. Everyone knows that too.
                          (finds a paperback)
                    Hound of the Baskervilles. Sherlock 
                    Holmes. If you re gonna be sheriff, 
                    you gotta brush up on your 
                    detective work.

      A PO d Branch looks at the book. But before he can respond--

                                  SUSAN
                    Excuse me?

      The widow, Susan Parkford, stands in the doorway. Off Walt s 
      surprised look...

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    Am I interrupting? I m sorry. You 
                    told me to come down and, um --

                                  WALT
                    Oh yes, I m sorry, official ID, 
                    yes. Please sit down.                                                                                    53.


      Branch sets the Holmes book down on Walt s desk and leaves, 
      forces a smile to Susan as he goes. Looks genuine.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Can I get you something? Coffee?

                                  SUSAN
                    No, thank you. I just want to see 
                    the body.

                                  WALT
                    Yes, of course. But I also need to 
                      apologize.

                                  SUSAN
                    For what?

                                  WALT
                          (shuts the door)
                    For the other day...I know what 
                    it s like to lose someone...this is 
                    the one year anniversary of my own 
                    wife s passing. The day I visited 
                    you. I tried to put that out of my 
                    mind, but then you opened the 
                      door...and I smelled perfume. 
                          (off her confused look)
                    Jo Malone?
                          (she nods, that s right)
                    That s what my wife wore. Anyway, I 
                    only hope I didn t make the 
                    situation worse.

                                  SUSAN
                          (getting the apology)
                    It couldn t be any worse...I have 
                    no idea what my husband was doing 
                    in the middle of nowhere. I don t 
                      know...anything about why he s 
                    dead. Is there anybody who saw him 
                    before he died? Anything to help me 
                      understand what happened?
                          (summons the courage)
                    Was he having an affair? I can take 
                    it. Knowing is better than not 
                    knowing, please...

                                  WALT
                    He wasn t having an affair. But I 
                      discovered something else. Your 
                    husband, long before he met you. Or 
                    even knew you. He had a daughter. 
                    She s gone missing and Grant was 
                    trying to help find her.                                                                                    54.


                                  SUSAN
                      A daughter? Grant had a daughter?

                                  WALT
                    Your husband was just a man. And 
                    we re all idiots. We make mistakes, 
                    and we don t like people knowing 
                    about our mistakes. But Grant was 
                    one of the good ones. He was trying 
                    to make it right. And he was trying 
                    to do it without hurting you.

      Susan tries to process all this. Her head is spinning.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Mrs. Parkford, I swear, I m gonna 
                    find out who did this to your 
                    husband.

      Susan nods, absently, then turns to Walt.

                                  SUSAN
                    Does it ever stop hurting? 

      Without realizing it, Walt s hands have found the wooden tea 
      box that Cady brought in. The one with his wife s ashes.

                                  WALT
                    Not really. I guess the only way it 
                    could stop hurting is if you could 
                    forget about  em. And that s the 
                    rub.  Cause I don t want to forget 
                      anything...


      Bob and Walt are LAUGHING. Bob much more than Walt. The 
      Rainiers have had their effect.

                                  WALT
                          (as the laughter dies)
                    So Bob...you and your son. You 
                    weren t going hunting the other 
                    day, were you?
                          (Walt dead serious)
                    I know about the mobile brothel 
                    that was parked out there. 

                                  BOB
                    What are you--

                                  WALT
                    Bob. There s no crime in being an 
                    idiot. But lying about it can be a 
                    problem.

                                  BOB
                    Okay, okay, we really intended to 
                    go hunting, but when we saw the RV 
                    we changed our plans...We came back 
                    to town, got some booze and hit the 
                    ATM, then went out to spend a 
                    little time with the ladies.

                                  WALT
                    How did you know just from looking 
                    at the RV that it was a brothel?

                                  BOB
                    Cause we know that RV. Got a big 
                    ol  green stripe across the side. 
                    And when it s not out working, it s 
                    parked here.

                                  WALT
                    Who owns it?

                                  BOB
                    I don t know.
                          (Walt s stare, c mon now)
                    Cheyenne kid. Name s Avo. 

                                  WALT
                    Can you show me where Avo s parked?

                                  BOB
                    Nah. He hasn t been here for a 
                    couple days.                                                                                    56.


                                  WALT
                    Any idea where I might find him?

                                  BOB
                    He s usually working. He s a busboy 
                    at the Red Pony. 

      Off Walt...shit. The Indian at the Red Pony. 


      Walt enters, in a hurry, right up to the female BARTENDER.

                                  WALT
                    Henry around?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Nope. Took off a few hours ago.

                                  WALT
                    What about Avo? The busboy.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Called in sick last few days.

                                  WALT
                    Can I borrow your phone?

      Bartender hands him his cell. Walt dials. A beat.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic. Call the highway patrol, set 
                    up some road blocks. We re looking 
                    for an RV and a 21 year-old 
                    Cheyenne named Avo.


      Avo enters, shuts the door fast, and turns to find: Walt. 

      Walt sits atop his sleeping bag, calm as can be, pointing a 
      gun straight at Avo. Avo freezes.

                                  AVO
                    You re early.

                                  WALT
                    Old Indian Trick, Avo. Surprise is 
                      a powerful weapon. Speaking of 
                    which, would you mind telling me 
                    why you came 3 hours early to your 
                    own meeting? And if you can tell 
                    me, unarmed, I d appreciate that.

      Avo slowly pulls out the revolver tucked in the small of his 
      back. Sets it down.

                                  AVO
                      Sheriff...I didn t kill that guy. 
                    You gotta help me.

                                  WALT
                    To protect and serve. Now, sit. 
                    Let s talk. 

      Nervously, Avo sits. Walt continues to point the gun at him.

                                  AVO
                    The dead guy...I met him. A couple 
                    times. He came into the Red Pony. 
                    Two weeks ago. Real intense. Said 
                    he was looking to get laid. 

                                  WALT
                    And everyone knows if you want to 
                    get laid, you talk to the Indian at 
                    the Red Pony. What d you do?                                                                                    59.


                                  AVO
                    I sent him to the girls. That was a 
                      mistake...I heard later he freaked 
                    out when he got to the RV. 
                      Yelling...waving a gun around. So 
                    when he came back the other night, 
                    I was like  no way, man.  

                                  WALT
                    He came back after causing a scene 
                    like that?

                                  AVO
                    He apologized and said he was upset 
                    the first time cause what he was 
                    really looking for was an Indian 
                    girl. Guess that s his thing. 
                    Wanted to poke a Pocahantas. 
                    Anyway, I didn t want this crazy 
                    guy having a problem with me, so I 
                    told him where to go, but right 
                    away I called it in. I said  look 
                    out, crazy man s coming. Better 
                    move the RV.  I didn t know he was 
                    gonna kill him. I swear.

                                  WALT
                    Who is  he ?
                          (off Avo s silence)
                    Avo, whoever  he  is is trying to 
                    frame you. Now I know you can t 
                    afford an RV. I know you re not 
                    running a prostitution ring. And 
                    Henry tells me you re no killer. 
                    But you re in this deep now, and 
                    the only way I can protect you is 
                    if you tell me who you re working 
                    for.

                                  AVO
                    I don t know, man. I...

      SFX: BANG!

      AVO S BLOOD SPRAYS ON WALT S FACE -- as the echo of a rifle 
      shot fills the air. Avo crumbles to the floor, a small 
      explosion through his abdomen and jacket. 

      Walt is stunned for a beat, then adrenaline and instinct take 
      over...Walt scrambles to the window...peeks up at the high 
      ground of the hill...a black puff of rifle smoke 75 yards 
      away. A figure steps through the black smoke. We can t see 
      the face, but the man is holding a rifle with a large scope 
      on it. Reloading. Moving in. Awwwwww shit.                                                                                    60.


      Walt moves over to the bleeding, dying Avo.

                                  AVO (CONT D)
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry.

                                  WALT
                    Who s out there? Who is it?

                                  AVO
                    I m so sorry. 

      Avo ain t going to make it. And just stares dead at Walt.

      Walt scrambles to the door. He reaches for the handle...

      POV: THROUGH THE RIFLE SCOPE, looking back at the shed. We 
      see the door open, and a form starts to emerge...

      BANG! A splintering of wood on the shed s door jamb...


      Vic goes inside and finds Lilly. We don t hear the words, but 
      we can see that Lilly is scared, and Vic says something to 
      comfort her and calm her.

      CUT BACK TO WALT, CLIMBING INTO HIS TRUCK...THEN FORWARD TO:


      Walt gets in, puts the staple gun down right next to -- The 
      tea box from earlier. Walt looks down at the box. Election 
      signs and wooden stakes on the floor.

                                  WALT
                    Well, honey. I ve let a lot of lot 
                    of things slide...and I don t know 
                    if it s too late to make up for it. 
                    But looks like we re running again.

      And as Walt pulls away, the Elk pay no attention to the man 
      speeding down the wide open road, across the Wyoming horizon.


                                      END OF SHOW
