The sun is beginning to rise yet the city is still asleep as 
Adam drives to his office building parking lot entrance.



News vans and reporters stand outside the building along with 
several ANTI-DEATH PENALTY PROTESTORS vs. PRO-DEATH PENALTY 
PROTESTORS with signs:  REMEMBER THE BUTLERS   and  IF
BANKOWSKI WAS BLACK HE D BE DEAD BY NOW. 



A distant suburb of Pennsylvania. Christine parks and walks 
to the porch of a lower middle class home in a lower middle 
class neighborhood. Christine rings the bell. A WOMAN IN HER 
LATE FORTIES - cheap clothes, home colored hair - opens the 
door and is immediately put off by Christine:

CHRISTINE
Hello. I m Christine Rosa from the 
Innocence Project. I called Mr---

BARBOTTI S DAUGHTER
DAAAAAD!

They stand in silence for a moment. The dowdy daughter 
resenting the young, professional Christine.  BARBOTTI - late 
60 s, retired photographer - appears.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     10


CHRISTINE
Mr. Barbotti? I called from the--

BARBOTTI
Wait.

He exits OS. Again the awkward silence between daughter and 
Christine. Until Barbotti appears with a MANILA ENVELOPE. 

BARBOTTI S DAUGHTER
These pictures could cause a lot of 
trouble, right? I don t think you 
should give them away for nothing. 

CHRISTINE
Well, technically they re the 
property of the police department 
where your father worked, so...

BARBOTTI S DAUGHTER
Yeah so my father could get sued 
giving them to you. He should be 
compensated.

BARBOTTI
Go make lunch!
(She exits OS)
Sorry. My daughter s desperate to 
inherit something when I die.

CHRISTINE
Thank you so much for finding them.

BARBOTTI
To tell the truth, I always 
wondered why nobody asked for them 
sooner.

Christine notes this remark.

Christine is driving through the neighborhood of Port 
Richmond: working class, primarily Polish neighborhood - home 
to the Polish underworld, the Kielbasa Posse. She drives up 
and parks in front of a row of lower income housing. She 
walks to one house, holding a piece of paper. She rings the 
bell. A door of bars protects the front door.

A BLACK WOMAN, 20 s, holding a crying baby answers the door.

CHRISTINE
Hi. I was looking for Dora 
Bankowski s house. This is the last 
address my office had for her. I m 
with Social Services.

BLACK WOMAN WITH BABY
Dora? She moved uptown a while ago.

CHRISTINE
How long?

BLACK WOMAN WITH BABY
I m here almost six years now.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     25


CHRISTINE
Do you know where she moved?

BLACK WOMAN WITH BABY
I think on Salmon St. somewhere.

Christine comments on the crying baby, sympathetically:

CHRISTINE
Aww. Is she teething?

BLACK WOMAN WITH BABY
Her molars. You have kids?

Christine hesitates a split second but shakes her head NO.

CHRISTINE
Would you have a phone number for 
Dora? I hate to bother you.

BLACK WOMAN WITH BABY
Come in.

Christine enters. She coos to the baby.

CHRISTINE
Oooh, don t cry sweetie. It hurts, 
I know.



Christine has parked on Salmon St. - a residential area of 
attached houses, though still working class. She walks up the 
stoop and finds the name beside the door: BANKOWSKI. She

The entire Powell clan is gathered for their weekly family

over one another. Billie helps prepare dinner with her mother-
in-law Grace and her sister-in-law Angela. Brothers Tyrone 
and Jamie watch a sports game. The kids are running around.

Camera arrives on the scene which interests us the most: 
Through an open door, We See into Rodney s study; Adam sits 
before his father for a private discussion and advice.



Establishing shot.



Christine walks to her car. She seems to be in control. She 
tries to unlock her door but drops her keys. She tries again 
but she s shaking. Suddenly, she begins to break down and 
cry. The experience with Jared, her past rushing in on her 
(as we will discover)...

Christine leans against the car, sinking to the ground, 
hiding herself as she cries. Alone and vulnerable, like a 
little girl.



END OF ACT THREE                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     38


ACT FOUR



Establishing shot.



Both Pro and Anti-death penalty demonstrators have tripled in 
size outside of SCI. Police keep the angry protestors from 
interacting with barricades on either side of the entrance.

Clark is driving into SCI, through the protestors, thinking: 
Public outrage is growing. How bad will it get?



Christine quietly unlocks a back door into the house.



Pro and anti-death penalty protestors grow in size.

Demonstrators - both for and against the execution of Jared 
Bankowski - are shouting to be heard, holding candles or 
flashlights - overseen by Prison Guards. TV REPORTERS are 
covering the story as it happens.



Mobs of reporters are outside the prison FRONT ENTRANCE.

AT THE SIDE ENTRANCE, PROTECTED BEHIND LOCKED GATES:

in her fifties, thin, strong, as if  - TERRY S MOTHER, RUTH
she holds all her sorrows tightly inside of her. She waits by 
a Police Car with Prison Guards. She sees her son:                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     54


TERRY KAMINSKI is escorted out of the prison s side entrance, 
surrounded by Prison Guards, carrying his few belongings. The 
Reporters burst into a cacophony of questions, trying to get 
cameras on Terry s short walk to the Police car. 

Terry approaches his mother. There is an awkwardness. Ruth 
throws her arms around her son. Terry doesn t know how to 
respond. The Prison Guards quickly usher them into cars.



A crowd of reporters, on-lookers and protesters have gathered 
around the Kaminski home as the Police car and their Police 
escorts, pull up to the curb.

Police shield Terry and Ruth as they exit the car and enter 
their house. 



An enclosed backyard, small, high stone U-shaped wall.

NATHAN KAMINSKI - a muscular, middle aged man, ex-contractor 
and builder - sits in a lawn chair listening to his IPOD. We 
hear the music of Sarah Vaughn singing  IT NEVER ENTERED MY 
MIND . He is a fierce, stern looking man. Angry. Unforgiving. 
In the BG: Ruth appears in the back doorway, calling MOS, for 
 Nathan.All we hear is Sarah Vaughn s song.                   untitled lagravenese/goldwyn     55


Terry sees his father, refusing to turn his back to greet his 
son. Terry expected his father s dismissive, disapproving 
homecoming. (Nathan still believes Terry is guilty). Terry 
exits back into the house. Ruth maintains a flicker of hope.



Terry Kaminski is covered in a hoodie,  wandering around his 
old neighborhood. The streets seem deserted until Terry sees 
some Youths coming his way. He pauses and makes himself 
hidden. He doesn t want to be noticed. When they pass he 
continues walking - needing to be out of his house - outside 
anywhere, until he hears a VOICE O.S.;

ADAM (O.S.)
Terry Kaminski?

Terry stops and turns to see Adam Powell standing by his car.

ADAM
Remember me? I put you in prison.

Terry doesn t know whether to be angry or afraid.

TERRY
They let me out! There s nothing 
you can do til the re-trial. 

ADAM
I know. It s my job to put you back 
inside. And I m very good at my 
job.

TERRY
So what you are doing here?

ADAM
(Beat)
I need you to help me.

Terry is completely confused. But Adam clearly has a plan.

                    

                       THE END.
