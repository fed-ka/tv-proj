      to a 60 s Motown beat. Black and white faces stream into 
      their shifts at auto plants.

      Super: Detroit Michigan, U.S.A. Population: 1,670,144

      We cross the Detroit River high above the Ambassador Bridge 
      to find - 

      Windsor. The 60 s rock is replaced by static as if an 
      invisible hand is changing the station on a radio tuner. A 
      different period tune is cued up. Slower - a ballad.

      Super: Windsor Ontario, Canada.  Population: 97,210.

      Windsor is slower in every respect. Smaller, sleepier.

      We move down the riverbank to find a low-rise apartment 
      building with a window on the top floor, facing the river.

      INT. BEN S BEDROOM - DAWN (NOVEMBER 1963)22

      The music shifts from score to source and hides BG, like a 
      radio in the next room.  A woman s arm reaches across a man s 
      shoulder. Lips touch, part, then meet again in a deep kiss.

    A young man rolls on top of a young woman. She s beautiful, 
      fine-featured. This is KATIE, 26. Katie giggles as the MAN 
      gathers up the crisp white sheet that covers them, and snaps 
      it into the air.

      UNDER THE COVERS - We get our first good look at him: dark, 
      handsome. Meet BEN, 29. Golden, morning light leaks through 
      the gaps in the sheet, as the two move about the bed. 

                                  KATIE
                    Let s stay here forever.

                                  KATIE 
                    Let s pretend.

      Katie moves, and the sheet flies up on one edge, letting the 
      light swarm in -- bright, insistent, painful...and blinding.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     2.


      INT. BEDROOM - MORNING (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)33

      The same room -- but different. Greyer. Dingier. 

      IN THE BED-- BEN (BENJAMIN) FORD, late 60 s, rolls over, 
      alone. His tired eyes flutter open; face creased with a 
      lifetime s worth of experience.

      ANGLE ON The floor, as feet slip into slippers.

                                  NARR (V.O.)
                    When you re old, you re invisible.

      Benjamin shuffles toward an expensive armoire. An unsteady 
      hand reaches in to select a shirt. There s a picture tucked 
      in there: Katie and Ben, c. 1963. 

                                  NARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Being invisible is worse than being 
                    dead. All around you there s a 
                    vibrancy and color. And you re not 
                    part of it. Not anymore.

      He glances out the window at present-day Detroit: a polluted 
      skyline with derelict buildings, the Ambassador Bridge  
      choked with trucks and cars.

      As Ben shuts the armoire we catch a glimpse of another 
      picture -- a more modern woman, pretty, late 20 s, holding a 
      baby in her arms. 

      INT. BEN S KITCHEN - MORNING (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)44

      Benjamin sits at the table. A copy of THE WINDSOR STAR spread 
      out before him, beside a mug of coffee. He s circling 
      something in the paper.

                                  NARR (V.O.)
                    You go through the motions. The 
                    rituals. Not a life, just a 
                    routine: lather, rinse, repeat.

      ANGLE ON - THE PAPER-- Benjamin s circling obits. The toaster 
      POPS. As Benjamin turns toward the sound, we re back in...

      INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (NOVEMBER 1963)55

      WITH KATIE, as she sets freshly-popped toast down in front of 
      Ben. Katie s in a white blouse and a short skirt. Ben wears a 
      suit, and reads a copy of THE DETROIT NEWS. A picture of JFK 
      adorns the front page. Katie picks up another newspaper...THE 
      WINDSOR STAR, and waves it at him.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     3.


                                  KATIE
                    Why do you get two papers? You 
                    never have time to read one.

                                  BEN
                    You gotta know the story on both 
                    sides of the river. 
                          (reading)
                    Birdman of Alcatraz died.

                                  KATIE
                    I liked that movie.

                                  BEN
                      I remember.

      Katie sits down and grabs some toast off Ben s plate.

                                  KATIE
                    You hated it.

                                  BEN
                    They expect me to feel sorry for 
                    some killer in Leavenworth just 
                    cause he was nice to birds? No 
                    sale.

                                  KATIE
                    It was about redemption.

                                  BEN
                    You re nice to birds. You didn t 
                    kill anybody. I like you better.

      Katie smiles. A puckish, wicked smile.

                                  KATIE
                    I like Burt Lancaster. 

                                  BEN
                    He s old enough to be your father.

                                  KATIE
                    He s got a nice smile.

                                  BEN
                    He s fifty. That s old.

                                  KATIE
                    You re old.

                                  BEN
                    Ouch.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     4.


      He grabs the unfinished toast back - and pops it in his 
      mouth. Katie laughs, mock anger.

                                  KATIE
                    So what do you want to do tomorrow 
                    night?

                                  BEN
                    Just dinner. Something quiet.

                                  KATIE
                    You re turning thirty. We should 
                      celebrate.

                                  BEN
                    You re there. That s enough.

                                  KATIE
                    Where s that cab? I m gonna be 
                    late.

      Katie removes a folded blue jacket, and hat from the chair. 
      We hear a DOOR BUZZER. We see Katie put on the blue jacket, 
      and pin on a pair of WINGS.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    There it is. How do I look?

      Ben just stares. He s head over heels. She kisses Ben.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)
                    Mmm. Should have had more toast.
                    I love you. See you tomorrow 
                      afternoon. 

      She picks up a small suitcase, and goes out the door.

      WITH BEN - as he walks to the counter sipping coffee.

                                                                          MORPH TO:

      EXT. RIVER CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)77

      CLOSE ON A sign which reads,  CITY of WINDSOR, DETROIT RIVER 
        RECLAMATION 

      We move off the sign to see a couple of large cranes and 
      heavy equipment.

      A TRUCK drives by and as it passes we CUT

      CLOSER, to a pile of sludgy dirt being dredged up. The silty 
      sand trickles down onto the exposed earth.

      A LONGSHOREMAN stops, and looks down to see

      HIS POV - out of the pile of sludge, we can make out details 
      of two bodies wrapped in canvas and chains. We see a skull, a 
      bony hand...weathered scraps of a polyester uniform, and a 
      couple of items that glint in the sun -- (a cigar tube and a 
      nametag.)  

      INT. BEN S KITCHEN - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)88

      CLOSE ON - A cup, as it tumbles to the floor -- coffee spills 
      out, and the cup shatters as it hits the ground.

      ANGLE on Benjamin, as he lies beside the broken cup -- passed 
      out on the floor.

      INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)1111

      We re in a high end meeting room, some sort of wine-and-
      cheese meet and greet.

      IN A CORNER, A MAN kisses a woman s neck.  She s pretty, 
      business like - early to mid 30 s. He s about the same age, 
      with a kind of rough edge to him.

      (The audience might recognize her from the OTHER picture in 
      Ben s armoire, or they may not.) In any case, this is 
      KATHLEEN McNEAL, and her husband, BRETT.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Mmm. What brings this on?

                                  BRETT
                    You leaving work early. It s hot.

      She slips out of the clutch.

                                  KATHLEEN
                          (laughing)
                    Brett, there are people around.

                                  BRETT
                    It s a faculty meet and greet. 
                    It ll be the biggest thrill they 
                    get all week.

      She grabs his hand and steers him toward the centre of the 
      room. As a SERVER passes, he grabs a little glass of wine.

      A BANNER at the front of the room reads:  CUBA Si! U of 
      Windsor welcomes Cuban-Canadian Business.

                                  BRETT (CONT D)
                    Why d you want to come, anyway? We 
                    never go to these things.

      Kathleen straightens Brett s shirt, and looks over his 
      shoulder to

      A GROUP OF PEOPLE -- three or four people surround a MAN who 
      we can t really see. 

                                  KATHLEEN
                    I told you.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     7.


                                  BRETT
                    No, you mumbled something, and 
                    changed the subject.

      KATHLEEN S POV --  The group around the man thins a bit as 
      people move off. Kathleen smiles at Brett.

                                  KATHLEEN
                      Inscrutability is one of my most 
                      attractive features. Lipstick? 

      She smiles, showing Brett her teeth.

                                  BRETT
                    You re golden.

      Kathleen walks away. Brett watches her sashay, admiringly.

      WITH THE OLDER MAN,

      Holding court to a group of two or three people. He talks 
      with a trace of an accent. This is RAFAEL PADRON.

                                  PADRON
                      Canada-Cuban trade hit seven 
                    hundred million last year. And not 
                    just the tourism: there s mining, 
                      medical...

      Kathleen inches closer to Padron, as he speaks. 

                                  PADRON (CONT D)
                    Your American friends across the 
                    river are locked out of all of it, 
                    thanks to their relic of a foreign 
                    policy; which does my country great 
                    harm.

      Kathleen moves smoothly to Padron s right elbow.

                    You need a lot more capital.

      Padron turns to face Kathleen. He takes her in.

                                  PADRON
                    Yes.

                    to the 20th.   You saw my speech?

      Kathleen offers her hand and they shake.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Kathleen McNeal, Mr. Padron. 
                            (conspiratorially)
                    Don t tell anyone, but I work over 
                    there. Other side.

      They both reach for, and exchange cards.

                                  PADRON
                    I m glad you came to see me. I 
                    don t get --over there --much.

                                  KATHLEEN
                      I understand. I may have something 
                    for you.
                          (reads the card)
                    This is a direct number?

      Padron nods. Kathleen walks away.

                                  KATHLEEN (CONT D)
                    I ll be in touch.

      Padron watches her go. That was very interesting.

      WITH BRETT, who hands Kathleen a glass of wine.

                                  BRETT
                    I feel used.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Don t. Now we can grab more wine -- 
                    and did I see I something dead and 
                    yummy on a stick going around?

      She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a Blackberry (a 
      monochrome 850 model.) She reads it.

                                  BRETT
                    The office?

                                  BRETT
                    Sure. Sure. Go.

      Kathleen kisses Brett and leaves. Brett downs the glass of 
      wine.

      INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)1212

      Benjamin Ford is sitting on a table, as a DOCTOR shines a 
      LIGHT into his eye.  We can see that Benjamin s head was 
      bandaged.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Okay. Now follow the pen.

      He holds a pen up. Ben s eyes track it. 

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    Good.
                          (beat)
                    And you re sure -- no headaches. No 
                    strange smells?

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Nope. Fit as a fiddle.

      The DOCTOR glances at Ben. Ben looks to him -- a moment 
      between them. Kathleen picks up on it.

                    Well?

      Benjamin gestures to the Doctor:  I don t care.  The Doctor 
      picks up the chart and reads.

                                  DOCTOR
                    This would be the fifth episode.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Probably a good idea. When we re 
                    done here, I ll send you down to 
                    two, and they ll schedule him.

                    They cut it up in front of me. 

      Kathleen s look says: why am I learning all this at once? The 
      Doctor looks more sympathetic to Benjamin.

      ON STAGE, A thin, dark, intense man of about 33 appears. DEL 
      MURPHY has the look of a man who s seen & tried just about 
      everything.

      one in the nightclub, seemingly, who finds Del funny.

      ONSTAGE, Del knows he s dying. From behind, we watch as he 
      turns ever-so-subtly away from the audience. His face falls, 
      and he makes a decision.

      Show s over, and the place is mostly empty. Del joins Ben at 
      the bar. He signals the bartender for a drink, then lights up 
      a non-filtered cigarette. Del exhales a huge cloud of smoke.

                                  BEN
                    They liked the airplane bit.

      while splitting his attention on the failure on the stage.

      On the ground floor is a TV STOREFRONT, hawking the latest in 
      Black & White sets. 

      INT. AMBASSADOR INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)2121

      The office is a couple of rooms -- two desks in a main office 
      and a ring of three offices. Just as you enter the door, 
      there s a desk where a pretty African-Canadian woman, JESSIE 
      PREACHER, 25, sits.  

      As Ben enters and hangs up his coat, Jessie gets up and comes 
      straight for him.

                    chase a rabbit round a track? 

      Ben crosses to his office, Jessie following.

      Ben stops and turns over an envelope. He pulls out a card. 
      Jessie half-smiles.

      INT. AMBASSADOR INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)2424

      As Jessie and Ben are walking out a large man, ANGELO 
      SARTELLI, early 50 s, enters with his coat over his arm, a 
      little worse for wear, and traces of darkness under his eyes. 

                                  ANGELO
                    Hey partner...special day.

                                  BEN
                    Angelo, you look like you got hit 
                    in the face with a bat.

                                  ANGELO
                    Never. Not unless you re doin  the 
                    swingin, Slugger.

      Angelo heads toward his office.  Ben calls after him as 
      Jessie patiently waits beside him by the door.

                                  BEN
                    You ever gonna let me forget that? 
                    I was twelve.

                    with you later this afternoon?

                    I got a couple of things I need to 
                    talk to you about.  About the 
                    business.

                                  ANGELO
                    Benny, I always got time for you.

      He disappears into his office.

      INT. MAPLE LEAF DINER - WINDSOR (NOVEMBER 1963)2525

      Ben and Jessie are both drinking coffee, in silence, post-
      lunch.

      AT ANOTHER TABLE

      A MAN and a WOMAN glare at them -- a white man and a black 
      woman sharing a meal. Ben stares them down til they look 
      away.

                                  JESSIE
                    So what do you think?

                                  BEN
                    What do you want to wade into all 
                    that for, Jessie? It s talking to 
                      lowlifes...sifting through garbage.

                                  JESSIE
                    I ve seen you do it for two years. 
                    I see you work both sides of the 
                    bridge. I d like to learn. From 
                    you.

                                  BEN
                    You got a good head for figures. If 
                    you wanted to take an accounting 
                    course, I m sure we--

                                  JESSIE
                    That s not what I want, Ben.

                                  BEN
                    I m just not sure it s a good idea.

      Jessie sits back.

                                  JESSIE
                    You don t think it s a good idea. 
                    Or Angelo doesn t think it s a good 
                    idea?

      Before Ben can answer, From OFF -- there s a 
        crash...someone s dropped a plate.         "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     19.


      NEAR THE DOOR

      The STARING WOMAN from the table bursts into tears.  Her 
      husband comforts her. There s a WAIL from OFF.

                                  JESSIE (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

      INT. AMBASSADOR INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)2626

      Ben and Jessie enter. Three people are clustered around the 
      small black and white TV, including Angelo and another 
      investigator. Everyone s shocked. 

                                  ANGELO
                    I can t believe the bastards 
                    actually shot him.

                                  JESSIE
                    How bad is it?
                          (then)
                      Shhh...wait...

      Angelo changes the channel. We re now watching CBC and images  
      of JFK and JACKIE arriving in Dallas.

      INT. BEN S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)2727

      Benjamin places a pair of pants into a suitcase. We can see 
      other clothes in the case.  Kathleen leans against the 
      kitchen counter.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    It s not my favorite solution 
                    either, Dad. But the Doctor said 
                    you needed to be watched.

      Ben doesn t answer. He keeps crossing back and forth to the 
      bedroom, as he continues packing the suitcase.

                                  KATHLEEN (CONT D)
                    You passed out.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    A couple times.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Five. Five is not a couple.

      Kathleen looks down at the counter. It s kind of dirty.

                                  KATHLEEN (CONT D)
                    This place needs a good scrub and a 
                    new coat of paint.

      A CELL PHONE rings.  Kathleen answers it.

                                  KATHLEEN (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?
                          (beat)
                    Okay, Siobahn, play me the message.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Those things give you cancer.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Cheery thought.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    My brain s fine, Katie.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Don t call me that.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Sorry. Kathleen.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     21.


      ON KATHLEEN, as she listens to her message, she spies 
      something on the counter ... four or five identical 
      envelopes. They read  NOTICE OF EVICTION. 

      She hangs up the phone.

                                  KATHLEEN
                          (holding them up)
                    What are these?

      Benjamin stops in the middle of the room. Caught. He s 
      holding several pairs of boxer shorts.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Oh. Those.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    My God, Dad -- it doesn t go away 
                    if you just ignore it.

      There s a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Kathleen goes to answer it as 
      Benjamin keeps packing.

      When she opens the door, she reveals two MEN standing there. 
      One is good looking, East Indian. The other is white. They re 
      dressed in off-the-rack suits, and hold up badges.  We ll 
      come to know these two as DETECTIVE SINGH and DETECTIVE 
      LEWIS.

                                  SINGH
                    Benjamin Ford?

      Benjamin looks up from his suitcase.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Yes?

                                  SINGH
                    I m Detective Singh, Windsor 
                    Police, and this is Detective 
                    Lewis.  Can we talk?

                                  KATHLEEN
                          (surprised)
                    Dad?

                                  LEWIS
                    It s about Katie Wilson.

      Benjamin s face falls. Kathleen looks confused.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     22.

                    One s been positively 
                      identified.... Mr. Ford?

      BEN S POV -- We see the concerned, silent, and distorted 
      faces of Singh, Lewis, and Kathleen. The POV seems to be 
      listing, all slow -- color draining from the frame... There 
      is no sound, only the voice...

      INT. BEDROOM - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)2828

      We see a flash of Ben and Katie in bed, (a la the Teaser.)

      Katie kisses Ben on the lips, in her stewardess uniform.

      INT. AMBASSADOR INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)3030

      Ben, Angelo, and Jessie are glued to the pictures on the TV, 
      repeating the same CBC news over and over.

      Jessie is openly crying. Angelo holds up a bottle -- whiskey. 
      She takes a bit more in a glass. Angelo lights up a smoke.

                                  ANGELO
                    You wanna know who did this?

                    Get out of here. 

                                  ANGELO

                    So Johnson s President? Where would 
                    he be, right now?

                                  BEN
                    I don t know.

                                  JESSIE
                    Why do you Americans do these kinds 
                    of things -- what is wrong with--

      Ben shakes his head, and Jessie stops.

      As they walk away, we glance off a few other people milling 
      through the terminal:

      -A retired man with a camera, snapping pictures of his wife.

      -A man in a dark trenchcoat, walks with a woman dressed in 
      the same uniform as Katie. He bumps into GEORGE, and the TWO 
      MEN LOCK EYES.

      George walks in the other direction, and takes one last look -
      - as Katie and Nick recede in the distance.

      INT. BEN S KITCHEN - NIGHT3939

      Ben opens the door to his apartment and steps inside. He 
      turns on the light.

      BEN S POV -- He s surprised to see DEL sitting there, along 
      with JESSIE. There s a cake on the kitchen table. It says, 
       Happy 30th, Ben. 

      There s a bottle on the table too. No one yells  surprise.  
      Ben points to the bottle.

                                  BEN
                    You better hand that over.

      INT. KITCHEN - LATER (NOVEMBER 1963)4040

      Del pours himself another drink, and slices himself a piece 
      of cake.  The cake has been picked over.

                                  DEL
                    She went to a lot of trouble. It s 
                    the least we can do.

                    already, right? It s been hours.

      Jessie doesn t know what to say.

      Jessie walks over and clears plates from the table.

                                  JESSIE
                    So you re saying President Johnson 
                    did it? Del, they got the guy.

                    listen to a word he says.

                    find her. Staying here is making me 
                    crazy.

                    What if she comes here?

      INT. KATIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT (NOVEMBER 1963)4141

      The door opens and Ben enters. Del follows. There s no one 
      inside. He walks to a table. There s mail on the table.

      The place is spartan. One makeup table, pictures of Ben and 
      Katie propped up in the edge of the mirror.  

                                  DEL

                    All her clothes. They re gone. That 
                    doesn t make sense.

      Ben feels under the bed...no suitcase.  He looks around the 
      room.

      ON THE FLOOR

      By the wastepaper basket, like it just fell down -- a bag.

      Ben pulls something out of the bag. It s a wrapped gift.  
      There s a receipt in the bag. He pulls it out and reads it.

      INSERT

      The receipt: hand written, with a Dillard s logo, the address 
      of the store in Dallas, and today s date: November 22, 1963.

      Kathleen peeks through a door...

      HER POV-- We see BENJAMIN, asleep in a guest bed.

      INT. MCNEAL KITCHEN - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)4343

      Kathleen walks back in and pours a coffee. Her HUSBAND, 
      BRETT, is stirring sauce in the pot. 

                                  KATHLEEN
                    He judges me, Brett. I swear 
                    sometimes that s all he does.

                                  BRETT
                    No one judges you, Kath. You beat 
                    them to it.

                                  KATHLEEN

                    So who was this woman?

                    I don t know. But she s been there 
                    a long time. He kept talking about 
                    a ring.

                                  BRETT

                    know more about her than him. He 
                    never mentioned any of this.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    I guess I just like my buried past 
                    a little less...dramatic. You re 
                    okay with him staying?

                                  BRETT
                    He s your father, Kath.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    So he tells me.

                                  BRETT
                    Okay. So he s difficult. But if 
                    push comes to shove, I m fairly 
                    sure I can take him.

                    ...I love you, Ben.

      Ben stands at the front counter in front of a Desk Sergeant. 

      A sign on the wall says DETROIT POLICE. Behind the desk there 
      are several UNIFORMS and civilian personnel clustered around 
      a black and white television.

                                  BEN
                    Her name is Katie Wilson.

                    Look around, pal. Things are a 
                    little messed up right now.

      Ben glances at the wall. Below a US flag and a MAP of the 
      Detroit area, there s a picture of Kennedy. There s a candle 
      in front of it, on the counter, burning in tribute. There s a 
      picture of Pope Paul VI beside it, and a rosary hanging off 
      the picture.

                                  BEN
                    Yeah. I know.

      A COP walks by and touches the picture as he continues down 
      the hall.

      Ben walks away from the desk. A DETECTIVE approaches the 
      Sergeant. This is DETECTIVE BARNES.

      Ben and Jessie slide into a booth, and Ben slaps down an

                    Everybody loves Katie. A friend of 
                    hers got transferred to head 
                    office. She got me this.

      Jessie opens the envelope, and pulls out a bunch of pages.

                                  JESSIE
                    These are the flight logs.

                    So. What does the side door tell 
                    you?

      Ben puts his head in his hands.  Jessie reaches out her hand 
      to touch his head -- then thinks better of that.

                    She s my fiancee.

      Now it s Jessie s turn to bristle. She turns toward Ben -- 
      she didn t know they were engaged.

      Brett. Kathleen takes her father s arm as they walk toward 
      the gravesite.

      Benjamin looks off toward the side, where a copse of trees 
      dot the cemetary landscape.

      BEN S POV -- He sees a WOMAN in a yellow dress darting 
      between the trees and the gravestones.

      Ben is sitting down -- his family beside him.

                    Appearing again at the wrong time.

      There are no other mourners.  A priest stands in front of a 
      freshly dug hole, with a casket looming over it.

                                  PRIEST
                    In the name of the Father, the Son 
                    and the Holy Ghost...

      The sound drops out, and Ben s left staring at the casket.

                    If you reappear too soon, you find 
                    yourself naked. Out there with no

      The CASKET looms large in our view, as we

      INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY (NOVEMBER 1963)5959

      We see ANOTHER CLOSED CASKET. There s a photo on top of 
      CAPTAIN GEORGE McCARTHY, in his pilot s uniform.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     43.




      AT THE BACK

      Jessie stands next to Ben. They regard the room. The wake is 
      thinning out -- just a few stragglers left: a couple of women 
      with swept up hairstyles and long skirts. A couple of men 
      with brushcuts, looking like analysts from the Rand 
        Corporation.  

      A tired looking woman of 50 sits by herself, weeping into a 
      kerchief.

                                  BEN
                    Captain George McCarthy.

                                  JESSIE
                    We shouldn t be here.

                                  BEN
                    He threw himself out a window, 
                    Friday night.

                                  JESSIE
                    Maybe he was hiding something. 
                    People hide things.

      Pointed. Ben checks her. She s talking about him.

                                  BEN
                    We still talking  bout the Captain?

                                  JESSIE
                    You re acting like this is just 
                    another case.

      Ben stops moving and stares at Jessie.

                                  BEN
                    It s not. But I give into that, and 
                    then what? How does that help 
                    Katie?

                    You found all this how?

                    Does Captain George sound to you 
                    like a man filled with a life-
                    ending despair?

      Ben finds himself positioned close to the widow, MRS. 
      MCCARTHY. He kneels down.

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry, Mrs. McCarthy. Ben Ford. 
                    My fiancee flew with George.

                                  MRS. MCCARTHY
                    What was her name?

                                  BEN
                    Katie Wilson. She said your husband 
                    was a good pilot.

      That brightens Mrs. McCarthy somewhat.

                                  MRS. MCCARTHY
                    That terrible day. With the 
                      President. I went down the street. 
                    Jenny s husband Bill was into it. 
                    He was in Knights of Columbus. He

                    I was only gone an hour.

      Jessie can t take it anymore. She exits. Ben looks like he s 
      close to tears himself. 

      INT. FUNERAL HOME HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS (NOVEMBER 1963)6060

                                  BEN
                    You said you wanted to be an 
                      investigator.

                    Maybe I was wrong.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     45.


                                  BEN
                    You can t give up because you don t 
                    like where a trail leads.

      Jessie slows to a stop at the end of the hallway.

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    Working the case is what I know. 
                    But my head...isn t screwed on 
                    straight right now. You re helping.

                                  JESSIE
                    What are the chances that these 
                    things are all a coincidence?

                                  BEN
                      I wouldn t take that bet.

                                  JESSIE 
                    So what the hell s going on, Ben?

                                  BEN
                    They flew in Friday. From Dallas.

      A beat. Ben lets that sink in.

                                  JESSIE
                    I know you re upset, but-- what 
                    you re suggesting--
                          (then)
                    You re starting to sound like Del.

                                  BEN
                    I know Katie didn t run off with a 
                    pilot. I don t care what Delgado s 
                      reputation is. Now we find his co-
                    pilot, a guy who had everything to 
                    live for committed suicide. The 
                    same night?  No. No.

      Something occurs to Ben. He looks toward a PHONE BOOTH, 
      behind them at the hallway s end.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Do you have a nickel?

      Jessie reaches into her purse and pulls one out.  

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    Call this number.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     46.


      As Jessie steps into the phone booth, and picks up the 
      receiver, Ben pulls out a piece of paper and reads it.

                                  BEN (CONT'D)

                                  JESSIE
                    What s this for?

      She dials the number.

                                  BEN
                    There was one other stewardess on 
                    the flight crew with Katie. Sheila 
                    Wilkins.

                                  JESSIE
                    It s ringing.
                          (beat)
                    Hello, May I speak to Sheila, 
                    please?

      A few seconds pause. Jessie s eyes become saucers.

                                  JESSIE (CONT'D)
                      I understand.  Sorry.

      She hangs up - and exits the booth, a little unsteadily. She 
      turns around. The world seems to be closing in on her.

      Ben seems very far away. She takes a step, and suddenly...

      ...her heel breaks. She almost goes down, but Ben s there to 
      catch her.

      He guides Jessie over to a parked car, she leans against it.

                                  BEN
                    Calm down. 

      Jessie looks up with a face of abject fear.

                                  JESSIE
                    There was a car accident. Saturday

      INT. DEL S CLUB- NIGHT (NOVEMBER 1963)6262

      Empty. Ben sits down beside Del, who smokes and drinks at he 
      bar. He looks spent -- poured out.  Del slides over the 
      bottle.

                                  BEN
                    I want you to tell me everything 
                    you know about JFK. The crazier the 
                    better.

      EXT. CEMETARY - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)6363

      As before, with the priest doing the service.

                                  PRIEST
                      ...through valley of the shadow of *
                    death, I shall fear no evil...

      The voice fades to a dull drone, and Ben looks up and notices

      IN THE DISTANCE

      By the cars -- two COPS (Lewis and Singh) wait. They re 
      taking pictures.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     48.


      TIME CUT TO

      The Casket is in the ground. Everyone s standing. Ben throws 
      the first clump of dirt down, then stands off to the side.

      Kathleen follows...Then Brett.

      Ben looks up, and feels the sun on his face.  The cemetary is 
      peaceful, and green.  He looks off and sees...

      BEN S POV--It s KATIE, dressed in that yellow dress -- as 
      beautiful as the day he last saw her.  Beside her is 
        HIMSELF...YOUNG BEN, Age thirty. They re holding hands.

      INSERT

      A hand reaches inside a pocket, and pulls out a SMALL RING 
      BOX.

      Ben stands above Katie s grave with the ring he never got a 
      chance to give her.

      He bends his broken, tired, old-man body down, and tries, as 
      gingerly as possible, to lay the ring box to rest in Katie s 
      grave.

      It s not a particularly graceful attempt. He s too old, and 
      too stiff.  He falters.

      Kathleen steps forward to try and steady him. Angrily, he 
      waves her off. Brett, gently, takes her shoulder and gets her 
      to step back.

      Ben tries again. The ring tumbles into the grave, landing on 
      top of the casket.

                                  BRETT
                    Let s give him some space.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     49.


      Brett and Kathleen walk away.  Ben stares down at the ring in 
      the grave. When Ben looks up again, he sees...

      An Old Man with a cane is talking to Brett and Kathleen. (OLD 
      DEL, 70s.)

      EXT. CEMETARY GROUNDS  - DAY (JUNE - CONTEMPORARY)6464

      Ben catches up to Kathleen, Brett, and the Man.

                                  OLD DEL
                    Benjamin Ford, I presume.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    You look like hell.

                                  OLD DEL
                    I m thinking of getting a piercing. 
                    Chicks love that.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Why d you come, Del?

      As we get a good look at Old Del Murphy, we can see he s 
      withered -- with a face that seems to indicate a life lived 
      hard at every turn, and a voice that gives  gravelly  a new 
      measure.

      (NB: By the end of the scene, the audience should clue in 
      that OLD DEL, not Ben, has been narrating.) Kathleen reacts 
      to the name with shock.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Del? Del Murphy?

                                  OLD DEL
                    Hey Sweetheart. You got big.

                                  BENJAMIN
                          (to Kathleen)
                    Give us a minute.

      Kathleen nods. They walk toward the car. 

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    You really need that thing?

                                  OLD DEL
                    No. I m just lazy. 

      Del pulls out a pack of smokes and offers one to Ben.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     50.


                                  BENJAMIN
                    What are you, high?

                                  OLD DEL
                    No. That stuff will kill you.
                          (beat)
                    Am I supposed to believe that s 
                    your real hair color?

      Ben doesn t answer,but he does crack a smile

                                  BENJAMIN
                          (beat)
                    You still looking for Mercury?

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT D)
                    Every night.

      Brett lifts up Hunter. Both old men look toward Ben s family.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT D)
                    Del. 

                                  OLD DEL
                    Yeah.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    She can never know.

                                  OLD DEL
                    Yeah.
                          (re: the approaching cops)
                    What are you going to do about 
                    them?

                                  BENJAMIN
                    What do you think I m going to do?
                          (beat)
                    I m going to lie.

      From high above, we see Benjamin and Del, two frail old men 
      surrounded by the dead. Detectives Singh and Lewis shake 
      hands with Ben.
