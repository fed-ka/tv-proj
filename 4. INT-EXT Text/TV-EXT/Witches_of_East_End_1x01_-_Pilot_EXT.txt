A rocky beach, eerily beautiful, empty, foggy, desolate.  
BILL and MAURA THATCHER, 50s, emerge from the mist, walking 
their dog along the water.  Bill points to a BREATHTAKING 
MANSION on its own little island, just off the coast.  Small 
water taxis with lantern string lights bob in the distance, 
taking well-dressed laughing revelers toward the mansion.

BILL
Guess my invitation got lost in the 
mail.

MAURA
It s disgusting, what they ve done 
to that place...

BILL
My dear, they ve restored it.  And 
I hear they did a spectacular job -- 
even opened up the old catacombs...

MAURA
It wasn t theirs to restore!  It 
belonged to the town.  It still 
does.  That deal wasn t even legal.

BILL
Dash Gardiner would beg to differ.

MAURA
Dash Gardiner isn t even from here!  
Dash Gardiner fired you from your 
post after thirty years of faithful 
service, for no reason whatsoever!  
Dash Gardiner can bite me!

Bill smiles and hugs her, glad to have her on his side.

BILL
An occupied house doesn t need a 
caretaker, darling.

MAURA
Well I still don t like him, and I 
don t trust him.  And he s marrying 
that little hussy Freya Beauchamp-

BILL
(amused)
Hussy?2.



MAURA
It s the nicest word I could think of.

They giggle to themselves, as a figure emerges from the fog: 
JOANNA BEAUCHAMP, late 40s, but somehow ageless.  She s 
 glides. she -- walk just doesn t She  otherworldly. ethereal,

(CONT D) MAURA
(whispers to Bill)
Do you think she heard us?  Talking 
about her daughter?

Bill just shakes his head, indicating they should shut up.

BILL
Evening Mrs. Beauchamp.  Headed off 
to the engagement party?

Joanna just stares at them coldly as she passes, HER EYES ARE 
DEEP SHINING EMERALD GREEN.  The DOG barks at her, scared.

MAURA
(whispers to Bill)
she? isn t Friendly,

Bill and Maura keep walking.  We follow Joanna. She stops in 
her tracks with a sly smile, Bill and Maura are behind her, 
walking away, their backs to her.  She turns to look at them, 
and her face SUBTLY MORPHS into something inhuman, evil, 
demonic.  She stares at them for a beat, then heads toward 
them with dark purpose...


A BLACK CAT trots quickly through the cobblestone streets of 
this quaint little town.  You wish you lived here!  The cat 
wears a BEJEWELED COLLAR, which hangs loosely around its 
neck.  It runs fast and with purpose, crosses the street and-

WHAM!  IT S HIT BY A CAR!  OH NO!

The car screeches to a stop, a FRANTIC WOMAN gets out, runs 
to see the poor cat she hit-

 AND BLOODIED LIES -BUTWOMAN NAKED A ALL: AT CAT A NOT IT S 
DEAD ON THE GROUND!

The LOOSE BEJEWELED COLLAR is now a NECKLACE around her neck.  
We recognize her face, from the photo Ingrid saw at the party 
 the in Ingrid with was who woman the She s  night. last
 she s now And  picture.DEAD.  The frantic driver SCREAMS-


JOANNA exits the house.  She sees her NEIGHBOR in the yard 
next door: the MAN raking leaves, Joanna waves at him as she 
gets in the car, he waves back.  She backs out of the 
driveway, drives away... A beat.  And then...

JOANNA, dressed in slightly different clothes, walks up her 
driveway... what the hell??  She s got a grimly determined 
expression, she glides almost supernaturally.  HER EYES ARE 
ONCE AGAIN THAT STRANGE SHADE OF SPARKLING EMERALD GREEN. 
There is definitely something DIFFERENT about her.  Almost 
 who Joanna, isn t who person a person, different a she s like
Joanna. )  Evil her call (let s her like exactly looks merely

HER NEIGHBOR looks up, sees her, confused.  He waves but she 
ignores him.

Evil Joanna approaches the back door.  She takes a KEY shaped 
like a SKELETON and MADE OUT OF BONE, and opens the door.


Meanwhile, Joanna, the real Joanna, pulls back into the drive 
in her car, and jumps out, in a hurry.  Her NEIGHBOR stares, 
confused.  She waves at him-

JOANNA
Forgot my supplies!  Can t teach 
 em! without class

Joanna rushes toward the house...23.




Joanna opens the door-


Joanna climbs the porch to find THE WOMAN IN THE NECKLACE AND 
LAB COAT.  Joanna is surprised but not surprised to see her.

JOANNA
Wendy.  You don t look so good.

WENDY
I died this afternoon.  Sorry my 
perfect. isn t hair

JOANNA
What are you doing here?

WENDY
That s the welcome you give the 
sister you haven t seen in over a 
hundred years?

Joanna sighs, unlocking the door.

JOANNA
How much money do you need...?

WENDY
Actually, I came here to save your 
life.

Joanna eyes her, sees that she s serious.

JOANNA
Come on.  I ll get you some clothes.

Wendy follows her inside.

FREYA RUNS BAREFOOT down a dock in a flowing white nightgown, 
her hair wild and loose.  A romantic/sexy song, full of 
yearning, plays on the soundtrack, as she heads toward a COOL 
YACHT-Y BOAT.  

KILLIAN emerges from below deck, as if he expected her, she 
LEAPS onto the boat, into his arms, immediately they re 
kissing. It s passionate, tortured.

KILLIAN

They keep kissing each other all over the face and neck.

FREYA
So did I.

Killian pulls her nightgown tenderly over her head.  She 
stands before him naked.  He looks like he wants to weep. 

(CONT D) FREYA
Why do you look so sad?

KILLIAN
Because I ve waited four hundred 
years for this, and it s not even 
really happening.
