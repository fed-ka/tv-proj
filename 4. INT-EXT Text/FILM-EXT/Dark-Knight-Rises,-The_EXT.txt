Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent.
GORDON
But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his
friend. And it will be a very long
time before someone inspires us the
way he did.
Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
eulogy.
I believed in Harvey Dent.
And we FADE TO BLACK.
CUT TO:
Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are -
An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
vehicle.
The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
Man.
2.
CIA MAN
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
briefcase.
DRIVER
He wasn't alone.
CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
Pavel.
CIA MAN
You don't get to bring friends.
DR. PAVEL
(SHAKEN)
They are not my friends.
DRIVER
Don't worry, no charge for them.
CIA MAN
Why would I want them?
DRIVER
They were trying to grab your
prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
mercenary. The masked man.
CIA MAN
(EXCITED)
Bane?
The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.
CIA MAN
Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.
The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.
The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
looming over it, dangerously close...
5.
The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
side...
Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
unnaturally.
The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.
The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
swinging out as the tail explodes.
Drifting over the vast city...
MAYOR (V.O.)
Harvey Dent Day may not be our
oldest public holiday...
...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...
MAYOR (V.O.)
But we're here tonight because it's
one of the most important...
...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...
8.
MAYOR (V.O.)
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime and, yes,
ultimately, his sacrifice, have
made Gotham a safer place than it
was at the time of his death, eight
years ago...
...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.
MAYOR
This city has seen a historic
turnaround. No city is without
crime. But this city is without
organized crime because the Dent
Act gave law enforcement teeth in
its fight against the mob. Now
people are talking about repealing
the Dent Act. And to them I
say...not on my watch.
Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event.
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
in spirit...
High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.
MAYOR (O.S)
Now I'm going to give way to an
important voice...
Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.
CONGRESSMAN
Commissioner.
GORDON
Congressman.
CONGRESSMAN
Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
these things?
Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
cuts in.
9.
FOLEY
No one has. Not in years.
MAYOR (O.S)
He can tell you about the bad old
days, when the criminals and
corrupt ran this town with such a
tight grasp that people put their
faith in a murderous thug in a mask
and a cape. A thug who showed his
true nature when he betrayed the
trust of this great man - (Turns to
picture of Dent.) And murdered him
in cold blood.
The Congressman watches a tray of canaps breeze past, then
grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.
CONGRESSMAN
Sweetheart, not so fast with the
chow.
MAID
(turns, tight smile)
Shrimp balls?
The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.
MAYOR (O.S)
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent...
CONGRESSMAN
Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
We're gonna be here all night.
GORDON
Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
so simple, Congressman.
MAYOR (O.S)
But I'll let him tell you himself -
Commissioner Gordon?
Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
speech. Thinks.
GORDON
The truth...?
INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
Gordon's son with a handgun.
10.
Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
I have written a speech telling the
truth about Harvey Dent...
Gordon folds up his speech.
Maybe the time isn't right...
Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
mutters under his breath.
CONGRESSMAN
Thank Christ for that...
GORDON
Maybe right now all you need to
know is that there are a thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
direct result of the Dent Act.
These are violent criminals,
essential cogs in the organized
crime machine that terrorized
Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
all I should say about Harvey
Dent's death is this...it has not
been for nothing.
The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
Foley.
GORDON
The second shift reports in?
FOLEY
On your desk. But you should put in
some more time with the Mayor -
GORDON
That's your department.
Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.
CONGRESSMAN
Anyone shown him the crime stats?
FOLEY
He goes by his gut, and it
continues to bother him, whatever
the numbers.
CONGRESSMAN
Must be popular with the wife.
11.
FOLEY
Not really. She took the kids and
moved to Cleveland.
CONGRESSMAN
He'll have plenty of time for
visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
spring.
FOLEY
Really? He's a hero.
CONGRESSMAN
War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
smart, the job's yours.
Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.
15.
MAID
Can I have a ride?
The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.
CONGRESSMAN
You read my mind.
Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.
YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
Sir?
A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.
BLAKE
I didn't want to bother you up
here, but they're looking for you.
GORDON
What's the problem, son?
BLAKE
Congressman Gilly's wife's been
calling. He hasn't made it home
from the Wayne Foundation event.
GORDON
That's a job for the police?
BLAKE
Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
I've only logged half a dozen
arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
the streets you cleaned 'em good.
Pretty soon we'll be chasing
overdue library books.
Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.
BLAKE
But here you are. Like we're still
at war...
GORDON
Old habits.
17.
BLAKE
Or instinct.
GORDON
What's your name, son?
BLAKE
Blake, sir.
GORDON
You have something you want to ask
me, Officer Blake?
BLAKE
It's that night. This night, eight
years ago. The night Dent died.
GORDON
What about it?
BLAKE
The last confirmed sighting of the
Batman. He murders those people,
takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
Dent's neck...then just vanishes?
GORDON
I'm not hearing a question, son.
Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.
BLAKE
Don't you want to know who we was?
Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
his fingers across its rusted shell.
GORDON
I know exactly who he was. (Turns
to Blake.) He was Batman.
Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.
GORDON (O.S.)
Let's go see about the
Congressman's wife...
18.
Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.
DWP MAN
They wash up a couple times a
month. More when in gets colder -
homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
We had to pull him to clear the
basin, but other than that we
didn't touch him...
21.
They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.
ROSS
What?
BLAKE
Name's Jimmy. He's at St.
Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys
home where I...I coach some ball.
Blake looks up at the shabby building.
Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.
BLAKE
I'm sorry.
Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.
BLAKE
What was he doing in the tunnels?
MARK
Lot of guys been going down the
tunnels when they age out. Say you
can live down there. Say there's
work down there.
BLAKE
What kind of work are you gonna
find in the sewers?
MARK
More than you can find up here, I
guess.
Blake considers this. Troubled.
The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
weapons.
Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.
SELINA
There's a man in there - he's
bleeding!
BLAKE
It's okay, Miss. It's okay.
Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
truck and into the night.
26.
The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
race around a corner into a smaller passage.
A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
jumps out, gun drawn.
The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
The passage is empty.
The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -
GORDON
Manhole!
He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.
GORDON
You three, down with me. You two,
head down to cover the next exit -
SWAT
Where -?
GORDON
Get the DWP down here, now!
Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...
Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.
COP
Where's the DWP guy?
BLAKE
They went down there?
FOLEY
(shaking his head)
And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole.
Blake pushes forward.
BLAKE
Come on, we gotta get down there -
COP
That was a gas explosion, kid -
BLAKE
Gas? This is a sewer!
FOLEY
No one goes in there till we know
what's down there.
28.
BLAKE
We know what's down there, sir. The
Police Commissioner!
FOLEY
Somebody get the hothead out of
here. And get me a DWP guy!
Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.
Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...
Moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown.
MIRANDA (V.O.)
Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr.
Wayne was trying to do...
Wayne drops three floors...
Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.
Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
pulls out. Checking his tracker.
Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...
PAPARAZZI
Another stiff too old to climb out
of his sports car.
PAPARAZZI 2
No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
where you been hiding?
Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
- a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.
WAYNE
I'm not sure if my assistant put me
on the guest list -
GREETER
Right through here, Mr. Wayne...
41.
Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.
WAYNE
I must have lost my ticket -
VALET
Your wife said you were taking a
cab home, sir.
WAYNE
My wife?
Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the
engine.
Police vehicles screech into the narrow street -
construction vehicles are blocking. Blake argues with a
burly Construction Worker.
BLAKE
Move it, now! We've got a
situation.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Where can I move it?!
BLAKE
That way!
Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.
51.
BLAKE
Get in your vehicle and stay there!
Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance.
The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic.
SECURITY CHIEF
You've gotta get in there!
FOLEY
This is a hostage situation -
SECURITY CHIEF
It's a robbery! They've got direct
access to the online trading desk.
FOLEY
I'm not risking my men for your
MONEY -
SECURITY CHIEF
It's not our money, it's
everyone's!
ALLEN
Really? Mine's in my mattress.
SECURITY CHIEF
If you don't shut these guys down,
the stuffing in that mattress might
be worth a whole lot less, pal.
FOLEY
Cut the fiber line - shut down the
cell tower. That'll slow them down.
Allen shouts at his men.
ALLEN
Get the barriers up - no more in
and out on this street!
Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the
street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope.
Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people...
SNIPER
I've got something -
The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and
leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering.
Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase.
The bikes weave through traffic, Traders strapped to the
back, facing backwards - screaming, ties flying in the wind.
A cruiser falls in behind.
ROOKIE COP
Shoot the tires!
A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way.
VETERAN COP
No shot!
Foley is barking into his radio.
FOLEY
Back off, back off! They've got
hostages!
53.
The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie
Cop looks up into his rear-view.
ROOKIE COP
What's going on with the lights?
The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are
dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the
darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die...
And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -
VETERAN COP
It can't be...
ROOKIE COP
The hell was that?!
VETERAN COP
Oh boy. You're in for a show
tonight, son.
Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees
streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up.
The engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting
for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! - Food
Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as
BATMAN races by on the Bat-Pod.
Foley rushes to Blake's cruiser.
FOLEY
Let's roll, they've spotted the
Batman!
The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass.
54.
Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a
rifle-shaped device. A tone builds - he aims it at the bike
and fires.
Janitor's bike sparks and dies. Sirens as Cops move in,
Another bike splutters and dies - the Hostage breaks for
cover.
Batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an
overpass. He holsters his EMP rifle and guns the Bat-Pod.
All around the city, cops mobilize - cars, vans, choppers...
Bane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man. Shoeshine
Man glances inside his pack - signals '2'. Bane turns, sees
darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage,
lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Man's bike. Bane
peels off - Batman stays on Shoeshine Man.
Bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the Batman.
He jumps up onto a concrete barrier, then down to the mouth
of an outflow pipe. He glances at the entire Gotham Police
Department descending on one man. Disappears into the pipe.
Shoeshine Man glances into his pack - the program beeps,
finished. He looks back to see the Bat-Pod racing at him,
ducks as it comes alongside...riderless. Shoeshine Man looks
up, confused. WHUMP! His hostage is ripped off the bike by a
low-flying dark shape.
Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks,
rolls off dazed. Batman grabs him.
BATMAN
WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?!
Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer
from his pack. The screen reads:
APPLICATION COMPLETE
Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens
everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He
jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of
thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in.
57.
POLICE VOICE
(OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!
Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic. An empty car
transporter is below the on-ramp... Batman fires the cannons
at the transporter, the near ramp crashes down, and Batman
roars towards it - mounts it and jumps onto the on-ramp...
Thousands of police jockey to pursue the Batman as he races
back into the downtown area.
The Bat-Pod tears along, pursued by a phalanx of cruisers,
choppers overhead. More cops appear at the far end of the
boulevard.
The Bat-Pod executes a ninety-degree turn, flipping over as
it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley.
Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley. Blake
arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck. Foley
swaggers out.
FOLEY
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen...
Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from
the alley that none of the cops have heard before...
VETERAN COP
You might have the wrong animal
there, sir -
Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of
the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor
downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground.
The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham
PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.
BLAKE
Are you sure that was him?
Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.
...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
the side of the building.
61.
Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.
CATWOMAN
Where is it?
DAGGETT
The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
and date of birth and within a
couple hours that person ceases to
exist in any database? Little too
good to be true.
CATWOMAN
You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
prototype stage -
DAGGETT
That's why I bought them. But they
had nothing. It was a gangland
myth.
Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
Daggett by the throat, threatening him.
CATWOMAN
Stay back!
They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
onto his gun.
CATWOMAN
I'm not bluffing!
VOICE (O.S.)
They know...
All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.
BATMAN
They just don't care.
As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.
62.
CATWOMAN
You've got to be kidding.
BATMAN
No guns. No killing.
CATWOMAN
Where's the fun in that?
As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
the far edge.
BATMAN
Come on!
Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
hisses shut, taking bullets from above.
CATWOMAN
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men -
BATMAN
This isn't a car.
Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.
The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.
CATWOMAN
See you around -
Batman steps down after her.
BATMAN
You're welcome.
CATWOMAN
I had it under control.
63.
BATMAN
Those weren't street thugs - they
were trained killers. I saved your
life. In return I need to know what
you did with Bruce Wayne's
fingerprints.
Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
CATWOMAN
Wayne wasn't kidding about a
'powerful friend'. I sold his
prints to Daggett. For something
that doesn't even exist.
BATMAN
I doubt many people get the better
of you.
CATWOMAN
Hey, when a girl's desperate...
BATMAN
What were they going to do with
them?
CATWOMAN
I don't know. But Daggett seemed
pretty interested in that mess at
the stock market.
Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.
BATMAN
Miss Kyle -?
But she is gone.
So that's what that feels like.
A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.
MIRANDA
You brought me out here to show me
a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?
FOX
Bear with me, Miss Tate.
They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.
Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
BLAKE
When you began...why the mask?
WAYNE
To protect the people closest to
me.
BLAKE
You're a loner with no family.
WAYNE
There are always people you care
about. You just don't realize how
much until they're gone. (Collects
himself.) The idea was to be a
symbol. Batman could be anybody,
that was the point.
BLAKE
It was damn good to see him back.
WAYNE
Not everybody agrees.
BLAKE
They'll figure it out in the end.
WAYNE
Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
BLAKE
Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
of tunnel records and a flashlight.
I could use some help.
WAYNE
(THINKS)
You know what? Drop me in Old
Town...
Blake drops Wayne off.
WAYNE
Don't wait. I'll get a cab.
77.
BLAKE
You got money?
WAYNE
(smiles, sheepish)
Actually, no.
Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.
Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.
MIRANDA (O.S)
Nobody's answering.
Wayne turns to find Miranda there.
WAYNE
No. I'm on my own now.
MIRANDA
Do you have keys?
Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
WAYNE
Never needed them...
She takes his hand.
MIRANDA
Let's find a window.
The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.
Blake's cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
Nothing.
Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.
BLAKE
(INTO RADIO)
Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him
I've got a line on the
Congressman's kidnapping.
Blake pulls out to follow.
A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
up at the formidable grey building.
91.
SWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels...
A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing
boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of
Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking
weapons, using flashlights...
The Mayor, flanked by Security, talks to a crowd of
Reporters.
REPORTER
We're seeing literally thousands of
police heading into the sewers -
MAYOR
A training exercise, that's all. If
you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid
City.
The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...
Blake is on the phone.
BLAKE
I've been to half Daggett's cement
plants, logged locations they've
poured for underground
construction...
97.
GORDON (O.S.)
Anything strange about the
pourings?
Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.
BLAKE
Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
know anything about civil
engineering.
GORDON
But you know about patterns. Keep
looking.
Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.
Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.
WORKER
Boss is about to leave.
Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.
BLAKE
Hey.
The Driver turns.
BLAKE
That was you outside the stock
exchange, right?
DRIVER
When?
BLAKE
When? When half the city's cops
were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck shut them
out.
DRIVER
Oh yeah. You're that cop -
BLAKE
Detective, now.
Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...
BLAKE
And as a detective...I'm not
allowed to believe in coincidences
ANYMORE -
Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires
behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
gasping, kneels beside the Driver.
BLAKE
What were you doing?! What?!
The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.
99.
BLAKE
Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth
Street plant with two dead
witnesses and a lot of questions.
Call me -
Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some
empty barrels...
Commissioner, they've got
Polyisobutylene here... (Looks
around.) And motor oil. They
weren't making cement, they were
making explosives -
Blake grabs his carts - scanning the pattern of the dots -
realizes.
BLAKE
Oh, God.
Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard.
Blake is driving furiously, shouting into the radio -
BLAKE
Patch me into Foley!
DISPATCH
(OVER RADIO)
Foley's overseeing the operation -
BLAKE
They're heading into a trap!
Foley, concerned, takes the radio from a colleague.
FOLEY
Foley.
BLAKE
It's a trap! Pull everyone out!
Bane's been pouring concrete laced
with explosives -
100.
FOLEY
Where?
BLAKE
There's a ring around the tunnels -
they're gonna blow it and trap the
cops underground!
Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel.
FOLEY
Pull out! Pull 'em out!
The crowd goes wild as a Receiver catches - starts a run -
the Mayor looks on, suddenly confused.
As the Receiver sprints for the end zone, the field behind
him DROPS away in smoking ruins, swallowing Players...
The crowd is not cheering but SCREAMING... The Mayor's box
EXPLODES...
101.
The Receiver, nearing the touchdown, glances back - sees
Armageddon - the entire field is now a smoking mass of
rubble, but for one strip of turf...Mercenaries pour out of
the tunnel, creating a gauntlet...
Blake's cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt. An
eruption TOSSES Blake's cruiser onto its roof.
All bridges, except the Gotham Bridge, suffer controlled
demolitions.
Blake squeezes out of his cruiser, reaches in for the radio.
BLAKE
Foley?
FOLEY
(OVER RADIO)
Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the
city's down in those tunnels!
BLAKE
(REALIZES)
Not every cop...
Blake pulls the shotgun from his cruiser - flags down a car.
102.
Blake drives, swerving around dazed and terrified people.
Flames and smoke billow from the sewers.
Blake races up to the hospital entrance.
Mercenaries pull the glowing core onto the field.
BANE
This is the instrument of your
liberation...
The Mercenaries thrust Dr. Pavel to his knees before Bane.
BANE
Identify yourself to the world.
DR. PAVEL
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear
physicist.
Bane turns Dr. Pavel's head for the cameras.
F-22's streak over the river, sizing up the island.
Bane rests his powerful hand on Dr. Pavel's shoulder.
BANE
Tell the world what this is.
DR. PAVEL
A fully primed neutron bomb. With a
blast radius of six miles.
BANE
And who can disarm this device?
DR. PAVEL
Only me.
BANE
Thank you, Doctor.
Bane snaps Dr. Pavel's neck in front of the world.
BANE
The bomb is armed, the bomb is
mobile, the identity of the
triggerman is a mystery. One of you
holds the detonator - we come not
as conquerors, but as liberators to
return control of this city to the
people. At the first sign of
interference from the outside world
or of people attempting to flee,
this anonymous Gothamite, this
unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.
For now, martial law is in effect.
Return to your homes, hold your
families close, and wait. Tomorrow
you claim what is rightfully yours.
Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men.
Mercenaries hold the bridge. A tank rolls across from the
mainland, soldiers behind. The Lead Mercenary uses a
bullhorn.
LEAD MERCENARY
Tanks and planes cannot stop us
detonating our device. Send an
emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.
A Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge.
CAPTAIN
How many of you are there, son?
(Nothing.) You don't have enough
men to stop twelve million people
leaving that island.
LEAD MERCENARY
We don't. But you do.
CAPTAIN
Why in the hell would we help you
keep your hostages?
LEAD MERCENARY
If people start crossing this
bridge Gotham gets blown to hell.
The Captain considers this. Troubled.
As night falls the F-22's peel away from the fire-ringed
city. The voice of the President echoes across the
airwaves...
PRESIDENT
(OVER RADIO)
The people of our greatest city are
resilient. They have proven this
before, they will prove this
again...
106.
Three camouflage Tumblers roll down the deserted street.
A crowd of news crews has gathered. Guards in the towers
look down, apprehensive. The Tumblers roll up, stopping in
front of the gates. Bane emerges from the lead Tumbler.
BANE
Behind you stands a symbol of
oppression. Blackgate Prison...
Bane holds up a photo of Harvey Dent.
BANE
Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and
over you, as a shining example of
justice and good...
Bane sets fire to the picture of Dent...
108.
BANE
But they supplied you a false idol.
A straw man. To placate. To stop
you tearing down this corrupt
city...
Bane drops the burning picture.
BANE
Let me tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. In the words of
Gotham's Police Commissioner, James
Gordon...
Bane unfolds the pages of Gordon's undelivered speech...
BANE
'The truth about Harvey Dent is
simple in only one regard - it has
been hidden for too long. After his
devastating injuries, Harvey's mind
has recovered no better than his
mutilated face. He was a broken,
dangerous man, not the crusader for
justice that I, James Gordon, have
portrayed him to be for the last
eight years. Harvey's rage was
indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He
held my family at gunpoint, then
fell to his death in the struggle
over my son's life. The Batman did
not murder Harvey Dent - he saved
(MORE)
109.
BANE (CONT'D)
my boy. Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes, so that
I could, to my shame, build a lie
around this fallen idol.'
The crowd is silent, stunned, as Bane continues to read.
BANE
'The things we did in Harvey's name
brought desperately needed security
to our streets... But I can no
longer live with my lie. It is time
to trust the people of Gotham with
the truth, and it is time for me to
resign.'
Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd.
Do you accept this man's
resignation?
Individuals in the crows start shouting 'Yes!'
BANE
Do you accept the resignation of
all the liars?! All the corrupt?!
More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!'
110.
Bane signals a Tumbler - its turret turns to the prison
doors.
BANE
We take Gotham from the corrupt.
The rich. The oppressors of
generations who've kept you down
with the myth of opportunity. And
we give it to you, the people.
Gotham is yours - none shall
interfere. Do as you please...
The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell.
(MORE)
111.
BANE (CONT'D)
But start by storming Blackgate and
freeing the oppressed... Step
forward, those who would serve...
Bane's men surge through the burning gates...
As Mercenaries shoot open locks, people storm into expensive
apartment buildings overlooking the park...
BANE (V.O.)
The powerful will be ripped from
their decadent nests...
Wealthy people are herded onto the street by Mercenaries...
BANE (V.O.)
Courts will be convened...
Moving in on the bright glow of the core...
BANE (V.O.)
This great city will endure...
Close enough to see the flickering digits of its
countdown...
BANE (V.O.)
Gotham will survive.
Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck.
Snow blankets the street. A Tumbler carves tracks as it
patrols the deserted street. Blake peers from behind a
parked car - he is crouched, feeding a kite string down a
storm drain.
Blake winds the string, picks up a jerrycan, hurries off.
Supply trucks await inspection. Mercenaries open an
18-wheeler - check boxes of rations...wave it on...
The 18-wheeler pulls up. A line of Gothamites waits
patiently along the sidewalk.
Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn.
GORDON (V.O.)
They keep it on a truck - it must
have a lead-lined roof. They move
it constantly.
CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)
But you know the truck?
121.
GORDON (V.O.)
They've got three of them. The
routes don't vary much.
Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger
counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers
stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.
Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank.
122.
Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...
Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.
129.
BLACKGATE INMATE
Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
you're dead in minutes.
STRYVER
Has anyone made it?
The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.
Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.
FOLEY'S WIFE
Jim. He's not here -
Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.
GORDON
You're sending your wife to the
door when the city's under
occupation?!
Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.
FOLEY
Wait in the kitchen, honey.
GORDON
What did you do, bury your uniform
in the backyard?
FOLEY
Jim, you saw what they did to those
Special Forces.
GORDON
You forgotten all the years we went
out on patrol with every gangbanger
wanting to plant one as soon as our
backs were turned?
FOLEY
This is different and you know it.
These guys run the city - the
government's done a deal with them
-
GORDON
Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a
vice. That's not a deal -
FOLEY
You move against Bane, the
triggerman's gonna hit the button -
131.
GORDON
You think he's given control of
that bomb to one of 'the people'?!
You think this is part of some
revolution? There's one man with
his finger on the button - Bane.
FOLEY
We have to keep our heads down
until they can fix this. If you
still had family here maybe you'd -
GORDON
This only gets fixed from inside
the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
I'm not asking you to walk down
Grand in your dress blues. But
we've got to do something before
this maniac blows us all to hell.
FOLEY
I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -
GORDON
Keep your head down? What's that
gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
blows?
FOLEY
You don't know that's going to
happen.
Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.
MIRANDA (O.S)
I hear you're looking for men,
Commissioner.
Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.
MIRANDA
How about me, instead?
GORDON
Miss Tate, I can't ask you -
MIRANDA
My company built it.
GORDON
Bruce Wayne built it.
132.
MIRANDA
And he wanted to destroy it. It was
me who didn't listen. Please.
Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.
GORDON
Let's go.
A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.
GANGBANGER
You steal from us, you little
bastard?
They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
Selina catches the apple.
SELINA
You boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking
politely.
Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.
SELINA
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.
KID
Now you're gonna take it.
Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.
SELINA
Just tax.
She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.
WAYNE (O.S.)
Pretty generous, for a thief.
Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
but weathered. Beard, work clothes.
133.
SELINA
You came back. I thought they'd
killed you.
WAYNE
Not yet.
SELINA
If you're expecting an apology -
WAYNE
It wouldn't suit you. I need your
help.
SELINA
And why would I help you?
Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.
WAYNE
For this. The 'Clean Slate'.
SELINA
You're gonna trust me with that?
After what I did to you?
WAYNE
I admit I felt a little let down.
But I still think there's more to
you. In fact, I think for you -
(indicates USB) this isn't a tool,
it's an escape route. You want to
disappear. Start fresh.
She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.
SELINA
Start fresh? I can't even get off
this island.
WAYNE
I can give you a way off. Once
you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
need you to find out where they're
holding him. Then take me in.
SELINA
Why do you need Fox?
WAYNE
To save this city.
134.
SELINA
Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
like it this way.
WAYNE
Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
bomb's going off.
SELINA
Get your powerful friend on the
case.
WAYNE
I'm trying. But I need Fox.
Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.
GORDON
Stay further up the block. (Points
at Men.) They're gonna cross the
street and try and slow the truck
down. As it approaches, hit this
button. If the needle hits two
hundred - give me the signal and I
mark the truck. Okay?
BLAKE
(OVER RADIO)
Heads up.
Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men
walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
locator at the lower part of the truck...
Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.
GORDON
Got it.
They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.
MERCENARY
Commissioner Gordon, you're under
arrest.
135.
GORDON
On whose authority?
MERCERNARY
The people of Gotham.
Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
the other Cops being rounded up and led away...
The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.
FOX
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
CATWOMAN
He should be so lucky.
And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.
Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.
FOX
She fly pretty well?
WAYNE
Even without the autopilot...
FOX
Autopilot? That's what you're there
for.
Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.
BATMAN (O.S.)
Light it up.
139.
Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a
BAT...
A Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back.
MERCENARY
Sir?
Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.
MERCENARY
You think it's really him?
BANE
Impossible...
Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is
Blake...
Batman hands Gordon a metal box.
140.
BATMAN
This blocks the remote detonator
signal to the bomb. Get it onto the
truck by sunrise. They might hit
the button when it starts.
GORDON
When what starts?
BATMAN
War.
Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.
BLAKE
You missed a spot.
Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.
BATMAN
If you're working alone, wear a
mask.
BLAKE
No one cares who I am.
BATMAN
The mask is not for you. It's to
protect the people you care about.
BLAKE
Huh. And you always seem to know
where those people are. How is
that?
BATMAN
I lost someone once. Since then I
break into their homes when they're
sleeping and implant a tracking
device on the back of their neck.
Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
Blake a mini-mine.
141.
BATMAN
On three - one, two, three -
They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
the blasts barely move any rubble.
BLAKE
No offense, but you got anything
bigger in that belt?
BATMAN
That's to warn the men on the other
side.
Batman disappears into the shadows.
BLAKE
But how do we -?
KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.
BLAKE
Okay.
Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
glad to be alive and carrying guns...
BLAKE
What now?
BATMAN
All-out assault on Bane...but you
need to get the people you care
about across the bridge.
BLAKE
Why?
BATMAN
In case we fail. Lead an exodus
across the bridge. Save as many
lives as you can.
BLAKE
Don't you need me here?
BATMAN
You've given me an army. Now go.
Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.
142.
BLAKE
Thank you.
BATMAN
Don't thank me yet.
BLAKE
I might not get a chance later.
Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.
Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...
Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.
CATWOMAN
Oh, you shouldn't have...
She hops on, feeling the controls.
BATMAN
The mid-town tunnel's blocked by
debris, but the cannons give you
enough firepower to make a path for
people.
Catwoman marvels at the controls...
BATMAN
To start it, you -
VARROOOM!
CATWOMAN
I got it.
BATMAN
We've got forty-five minutes to
save this city -
CATWOMAN
No, I've got forty-five minutes to
get clear of the blast radius,
because you don't stand a chance
against these guys.
143.
BATMAN
With your help I might.
She shakes her head.
CATWOMAN
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm
gone.
He looks at her.
BATMAN
There's more to you than that.
She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.
CATWOMAN
Sorry to keep letting you down.
He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
Come with me. Save yourself. You
don't owe these people anymore -
you've given them everything...
BATMAN
Not everything. Not yet.
Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
bike and takes off.
Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.
The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
building, forming up into an opposing line.
A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
until two Tumblers arrive.
VOICE
(OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED
UPON.
The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.
144.
FOLEY
There's only one police in this
city.
He steps forward. The line follows.
Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.
BANE
Open fire.
The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into
the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -
WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.
Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel
blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.
Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous.
GORDON
Come on, come on...
Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and
right. A space clears - he is face the face with the
Batman...
BANE
You came back. To die with your
city.
BATMAN
No. I came back to stop you.
145.
Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.
Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.
The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,
blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back - empty. No
bomb. Wrong truck.
GORDON
That's impossible... Come on! Cut
over to Fifth!
They sprint for the next parallel avenue...
Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the
street.
BLAKE
Knock on doors, spread the word -
the bomb's going to blow! Get out
by the South Street tunnel, or over
the bridge! Do two blocks, then get
back to the bus!
The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
bus.
Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler
roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.
146.
Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street.
His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the
back. The truck accelerates - Gordon drops, hanging on to
the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on...
A light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on -
Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers
pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars,
cops.
Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's
Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way.
Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off,
marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A
Uniform shouts through the loudhailer -
UNIFORM
Stay there! What are you doing?!
BLAKE
(PULLS BADGE)
Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys
to safety -
UNIFORM
Safety?! You're gonna get us all
killed. Anyone crosses this bridge
they blow the city -
151.
BLAKE
It's gonna blow anyway. We need
this bridge open right now.
UNIFORM
No one leaves the island. Orders -
BLAKE
Whose orders? Bane's?
UNIFORM
Police Department's.
BLAKE
Haven't you heard the shooting? The
Batman's battling it out with Bane
-
UNIFORM
The Batman's dead. Look, Officer -
BLAKE
It's Detective -
UNIFORM
Well, Detective, you take one more
step, we have to shoot you. Two
more steps, we have to blow the
bridge.
BLAKE
(to the boys)
Wait for me back at the bus.
The Boys walk back down the bridge...
Talia's convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each
flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down...
Catwoman roars down the steps on the Bat-Pod.
Blake turns back to the Uniform.
BLAKE
Your orders are out of date! The
situation's changed! Listen, I'm a
cop like you. And I'm walking out
there. Please don't shoot me.
Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...
The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the
ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear
of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the
junctions, trying to force the convoy east...
The Tumbler's gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. She
swerves to avoid heavy fire.
Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots.
UNIFORM
Son-of-a-bitch! (To his partner.)
Blow it! Before he reaches the line
-
His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -
UNIFORM
Get down! We're blowing the bridge!
As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him
blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.
153.
The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge
crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the
air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to
take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away...seven
minutes.
The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap.
BLAKE
You idiots! You sons of bitches!
You're killing us!!
Blake races back. Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle,
PRAYING -
BLAKE
Father! Get the boys on the bus -
FATHER REILLY
But there's nowhere to go, son.
154.
The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it
into a hard right turn...
Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it
again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the
black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both
vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel.
Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to
expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.
GORDON
Give me a hand!
The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
and grab the core but it is too hot.
Let's get a cable on it and drag it
out! Come on, we're almost there -
Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
Dying.
TALIA
Fox showed me how to operate the
reactor core. Including the
emergency flood -
Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.
TALIA
There is no way to stop this bomb.
Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
Batman.) My father's work is done.
Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
attach a hoist from the Bat.
GORDON
What're you doing?
BATMAN
Two minutes. I can fly it out over
the bay...
Catwoman is at his side as he works.
CATWOMAN
Rig it out to fly over the water,
then bail -
156.
BATMAN
No autopilot.
She takes this in. He stands to face her.
CATWOMAN
You could've gone anywhere. Been
anything. But you came back here.
BATMAN
So did you.
CATWOMAN
I guess we're both suckers.
She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
to the Bat, Gordon alongside.
GORDON
So this is the part where you
vanish, only this time you don't
come back?
Batman opens the canopy.
Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus.
BLAKE
Come on! On the bus!
FATHER REILLY
What're you doing?
BLAKE
Protection from the blast -
FATHER REILLY
It's an atom bomb -!
Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.
BLAKE
You think they need to hear that in
their last seconds? You think I'm
going to let them die without hope?
157.
Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm.
GORDON
I never cared who you were -
BATMAN
And you were right.
GORDON
But shouldn't the people know the
hero who saved them?
BATMAN
A hero can be anyone. That was
always the point.
Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
Anyone. A man doing something as
simple and reassuring as putting a
coat around a little boy's
shoulders to let him know that the
world hadn't ended...
The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers
-
INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
loving.
Gordon looks up to the cockpit -
GORDON
Bruce Wayne?
- but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
tunnel mouth.
The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
there's no power to get over it.
Blake shouts into the bus -
BLAKE
Heads down! Heads down, now!
158.
FATHER REILLY
Blake, they need to make their
peace.
Blake turns to him, furious.
BLAKE
They're children! They have no
peace to make -
An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
startled, turns to the children on the bus.
Get down! This is it!
The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
Blake.
LITTLE BOY
No. That's Batman!
Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
of the river...the bay...the ocean...
Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
- wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...
As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.
GORDON (V.O.)
'I see a beautiful city and a
brilliant people rising from this
abyss...'
Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.
GORDON (V.O.)
'I see the lives for which I lay
down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy...'
Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
there, whose face we do not yet see...
159.
GORDON
'I see that I hold a sanctuary in
their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations
hence. It is a far, far better
thing that I do, than I have ever
done...'
Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
'It is a far, far better rest that
I go to than I have ever known.'
Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
Alfred. Tears streaming.
Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
Thomas and Martha Wayne.
ALFRED
I'm so sorry. I failed you. You
trusted me, and I failed you.
And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.
Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side.
GORDON
Can I change your mind about
quitting the force?
BLAKE
No. What you said about structures.
About shackles. I can't take it.
The injustice. (Gestures at
gardens.) I mean...no one's ever
going to know who saved an entire
city.
GORDON
They know. (Off look.) It was
Batman.
160.
Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue
being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in
granite. We move in on the stone face...
VOICE (V.O.)
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to
reflect his more modest estate...
Movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the
house, watched by a solitary figure. Alfred.
LAWYER (V.O.)
- to settle the estate's accounts.
The remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...
Different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house.
LAWYER (V.O.)
And that they shall be used for one
purpose, and one purpose only...
A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children
towards the house. The children look up at the house,
wide-eyed.
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.
A sign reads:
THE MARTHA AND THOMAS WAYNE HOME FOR CHILDREN
Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper
with coordinates, on top of some climbing rope and shackles.
Blake gets out of the car with the bag. Follows the GPS into
the trees.
163.
Alfred, paper under his arm, heads to his usual table. Sits.
WAITER
Lei e solo?
ALFRED
Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.
Blake finds a large waterfall... He checks his GPS,
confused. Stares at the waterfall. Reaches for the climbing
gear...
Gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest
reports...
As Alfred sips his drink, he glances up at a couple at the
next table. Strangers. Alfred looks back down...
Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening
them. He stops. Sees something. The searchlight...fixed.
Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat
symbol... He looks up into the night...
Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,
seeing...across the tables, a familiar couple... Bruce
smiles at Alfred, who nods. Bruce turns back to the pretty
brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.
