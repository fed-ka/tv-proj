      The ALARM CLOCK blares -- even though it s 3 A.M. TWO FIGURES 
      are asleep in bed, their clothing scattered around the room. 
      A woman s HAND shuts off the ALARM. 

      Charleston sits up. Healthy now. A small SCAR visible on her 
      bare stomach. She snags her smart phone. 50 new messages. 100 
      new emails. 

      She scans them quickly as she rises. Grabs a glass of water 
      from the cluttered night table. Drinks -- SPITS it out -- NOT 
      water. 

      She grabs some clothes, disappearing into the bathroom to 
      brush her teeth. 

                                  CHARLESTON (O.S.)
                    Hey, I gotta go to work. Lock the 
                    door when you leave, okay? 

      The CAMERA lands on a PICTURE on the wall: an EIGHT YEAR OLD 
      CHARLESTON and her DAD, smiling like it s the best day ever.

                                  CHARLESTON (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And don t use my shampoo, it s 
                    forty bucks a bottle.                                                                                      2.


      She emerges in pants and a bra.  Moves to the bed, slipping 
      on a shirt. The man, SCOTT, (35) is still asleep. 
      Unacceptable. She pinches his butt. He jumps. Satisfied, she 
      kisses him.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    Call me next time you re in town.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if I want to call before?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Restrain yourself.

      Over this we hear the ROAR of a motorcycle and CUT TO:


      Charleston crosses the CIA SHIELD. Badges the guard. Steps 
      onto:                                                                                      3.



      The doors start to close -- BAM -- a hand stops them. Then 
      Lucas gets on.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks. 

      The doors close. They start up.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    That s a nice bike. You don t see a 
                    lot of old school Triumphs around. 

      She gives him nothing.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    I m Lucas by the way--

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I know. The newest member of my 
                    briefing team.

                                  LUCAS
                    Right. And I m very excited to have 
                    been given the opportunity --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Save it. You weren t my choice. 
                    Director Ross picked you. I wanted 
                    Mitchell.

                                  LUCAS
                    Oh. Well... As long as we re being 
                    honest, I was advised against 
                    taking the job because of your 
                      reputation.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    As a bitch?

                                  LUCAS
                    No. As a perfectionist with 
                      impossible expectations.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Why didn t you listen?

                                  LUCAS
                    I thrive in adversity. So I hear 
                    the President hand-picked you to be 
                    his be his briefer. Lotta pressure.                                                                                      4.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    The President relies on me to 
                    distill a 68 billion dollar 
                      intelligence budget and the work of 
                    two hundred thousand operatives 
                    down to a top ten list of the most 
                    critical threats facing our nation. 
                    If I make a mistake, it leads on 
                    CNN. How s that for adversity?

      OFF: Lucas...


      Open air. People move with purpose despite the hour. 

      Standing around a work table are: BRETT WELKER (37) a single 
      linguist -- EARL DREW (46), loves B movies and cyberwarfare -- 
      GRACE HOUGH (32) Middle East expert, slightly wounded. They 
      are examining satellite imagery.

                                  GRACE
                    You re wrong.

                                  BRETT
                    I m not wrong.

                                  EARL
                    He s definitely not wrong.

                                  GRACE
                    Please. He s always wrong.

                                  BRETT
                    About Afghan tribal relations 
                    maybe, but not fake boobs.

      REVEAL: They are looking at a Keyhole satellite photo of a 
      Mid-East presidential compound. An attractive young ARAB 
      WOMAN in a negligible bikini is emerging from the pool. The 
      clarity (and cleavage) are impressive.

                                  EARL
                    What do you think the Crown Prince 
                    will do when he finds out his 
                      daughter s getting nasty with the 
                    Defense Minister?

                                  GRACE
                    It s not rocket science. The guy 
                    keeps a secret torture museum.                                                                                       5.


                                  BRETT
                    If he Iron Maiden s Farashi, it 
                    could destabilize the whole region.

                                  EARL
                    We should put together scenarios 
                    for Charleston -- Brett?

                                  BRETT
                    On it. But I ll need these for 
                      reference.

      He grabs the photos as MILES SINGH (26), Charleston s 
      intrepid assistant, approaches. Brett holds up a photo as 
      they cross.

                                  BRETT (CONT D)
                    Real or fake?

                                  MILES
                          (please)
                    Fake.

                                  BRETT
                          (to Grace)
                    See? Not wrong. 

      He disappears. We STAY with Miles as he moves to the elevator 
      bank. Reaches them as the doors open, birthing Charleston and 
      Lucas.

                                  MILES
                    Good morning. The USS Missouri -- a 
                    Virginia class ballistic missile 
                    submarine -- suffered an engine 
                    fire an hour ago in the East China 
                    Sea. It is currently dead in the 
                    water. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Do the Chinese know?

                                  MILES
                    Not yet. 

                                  LUCAS
                    They won t stay in the dark long.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I want boat specs and a full 
                    personnel roster. And wake someone 
                    up in the China Group to give me 
                    likely scenarios. This just jumped 
                    to the front of the book.                                                                                      6.


                                  MILES
                    Don t forget you re getting a psych 
                    profile on the Foreign Minister of 
                    Turkey at eight.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Tell me it s not from Swenson.

                                  MILES
                    It s from Swenson.

                                  LUCAS
                    What s wrong with Swenson?

      Instead of answering, Charleston hands her bag to Miles. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I need to check the overnights.

      She leads Lucas into:


      Massive and hi-tech, filled with screens and work stations 
      that are segregated into sections -- Asia, Near 
        East/Terrorism, South America, etc. TWO DOZEN ANALYSTS and 
      OPERATIONS OFFICERS fill the space. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Our Op Center. I m sure it s 
                    similar to the one at NCTC.

                                  LUCAS
                    Ours is bigger.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yeah. But we got the machine that 
                    goes ping.

      They land in front of AL SILVA (46), folksy, unflappable.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    Lucas Wright, this is Al Silva, 
                    Senior Duty Officer. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Nice to meet you.

                                  AL SILVA

                    Anything new on North Korea?                                                                                      7.


                                  AL SILVA
                    Negative. Missile test is still 
                    scheduled for Monday, but you know 
                    how impulsive Doc Leader can be. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Is the book entry up to date?

                                  AL SILVA
                    As of twenty minutes ago. Anything 
                    changes I ll let you know.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    What about the Missouri?

                                  AL SILVA
                    Navy s playing it close to the 
                    vest, but repair work is underway. 
                    Are you up to speed on the internet 
                    slowdown?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Confined to Europe. 

                                  AL SILVA
                    Yes and no. The cause seems to be a 
                    damaged deep sea fiber optic cable. 
                    But it turns out that cable also 
                    runs a significant amount of 
                    traffic for SIPRNet --

                          (alarmed)
                    Any indication it s terrorism 
                    related?

                                  AL SILVA
                    No. Most cable damage is caused by 
                    seismic activity.

      An ANALYST waves Al over.

                                  AL SILVA (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.

      He moves away.

                          (troubled)
                    If a group like Al-Qaeda figured 
                    out how to disrupt the Defense 
                      Department s classified internet, 
                    we d be in serious trouble.                                                                                      8.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    Sure, but we ve had zero chatter 
                    about that happening. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Doesn t mean it s not worth 
                    pursuing.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    And there are people looking into 
                    it as we speak. Listen, it s 
                    natural for your terrorism 
                    expertise to color how you see the 
                    world, but to be an effective 
                    member of my team, you need to keep 
                    an open mind.

      Al waves them over.

                    You need to see this. A video just 
                    posted to a terrorist chat room 
                    we re monitoring.

      ON SCREEN: A video plays of a squalid AFRICAN REFUGEE CAMP. 
      An American doctor -- who we will come to know as DR. SILAS 
      WOLFE (38) -- is treating an AFRICAN BOY at an OUTDOOR TRIAGE 
      AREA. Wolfe wears a CHICAGO CUBS Jersey under his white coat.

                                  DOCTOR WOLFE
                    Okay, show me where it hurts.

      The boy points to his stomach. As the doctor examines him, 
      Charleston spots a battered sign on the wall.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    The Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. 
                    Home to over half a million people. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Do you recognize the Doctor?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No. But he s American.
                          (off Lucas)
                    Only a native could love the Cubs.

      ON SCREEN: An OFF-CAMERA NOISE causes the CAMERA to WHIP 
      around, catching the arrival of TWO BATTERED LAND ROVERS. A 
      dozen ARMED MEN emerge. REFUGEES panic -- turn to run -- 
      several are SHOT down. 

      The armed men approach Doctor Wolfe -- he steps forward -- 
      putting himself in front of the terrified boy.                                                                                      9.


                                  DOCTOR WOLFE
                    What do you want?

      BAM -- the LEADER brains him with the butt of his rifle. 
      Wolfe goes down. Two men grab him and drag him to an SUV. 

      The Leader notices the (unseen) camera man -- raises his gun -
      - BRRP -- the CAMERA falls sideways -- lands on the ground -- 
      showing the Leader s feet as he approaches. 

      As he picks up the camera we get a good look at his face, 
      then the screen goes BLACK --

                                  AL SILVA
                    That is not what we needed today.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Imagine how he feels.

      A MULTI-FLOOR TRACKING SHOT...

                    Our kidnapped doctor is Silas 
                    Wolfe, thirty-eight, a cardiac 
                    surgeon from Chicago, with a wife 
                    and six year old daughter.

      - An NGA rep charges through a door into a ROOM full of 
      SATELLITE IMAGERY -- focused on Africa --

                                  BRETT (V.O.)
                    He s volunteered for Doctors 
                    Without Borders for the last four 
                    years, mostly in East Africa.

      - MONITORS shows biographical information on Wolfe and his 
      circle -- An FBI rep hard at work with CIA counterparts --

                                  CHARLESTON (V.O.)
                    Any idea why he was abducted? 
                    Beside being American?

      The CAMERA passes up through BLACK, emerging into:


      The morning meeting is underway. The Briefing Team has 
      wheeled their chairs into the hall, joined by support staff.


                                  BRETT
                    Not yet. FBI is digging into his 
                      background, but right now it seems 
                    like a case of wrong place, wrong 
                    time.

                                  EARL
                    Might explain the fragmentary intel 
                    NSA picked up out of Somalia last 
                    week about a mystery event.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Where are we with the kidnappers?

                                  BRETT
                    Could be bandits or local militia. 
                    Could be Al-Shabbab.

                    The working group is looking at a 
                    screen capture of the ring leader, 
                    while we run facial recognition.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Any indication what they re 
                    planning to do with the good 
                    doctor?

                                  LUCAS
                    Sell him or kill him. Al-Qaeda 
                    would love to get their hands on an 
                    American like Wolfe. There s a good 
                    chance our kidnappers might trade 
                    Wolfe to the mothership for a pile 
                    of cash. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Let s have CTC contact British 
                    liaison. The Brits have good reach 
                    in Kenya, I m betting they can add 
                    to the conversation. 
                          (then)
                    All right, I brief the President in 
                    ninety minutes. I need answers in 
                    sixty.

      The meeting begins to break up. Miles approaches.

                                  MILES
                    Director Ross wants to see you.

      OFF: Charleston, this can t be good...


      DIRECTOR SPENCER ROSS (52) sits behind his desk, reading a 
      classified file. He s a shrewd operator, and a force to be 
      reckoned with.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (appearing in the doorway)
                    You re here early.

      He waves her in.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    I thought I told you to drop the 
                    narco connection from yesterday s 
                    brief. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                      I couldn t. POTUS was expecting to 
                    see it.                                                                                     12.


                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                      Charleston, I m your boss.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yes, sir. And POTUS is yours.

      He studies her for a moment.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    You re not very political, are you?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Thank you, sir.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    It wasn t a compliment. Now what s 
                    this I hear about an American being 
                    abducted overseas?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    A doctor in Kenya. We re into it.  
                    Right now, it s too soon to tell 
                    whether it s actionable.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                      Regardless, I want it left out of 
                    today s briefing. The President has 
                    a lot on his plate. We need him to 
                    focus on North Korea. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Anything else?

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Yes. The Turkish Foreign Minister 
                    is coming by here before his 
                    meeting with the President. I need 
                    someone to do a show and tell on 
                    the latest Syria developments.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I ll have Grace do it. 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Have Lucas join her.

      He goes back to his file, finished with her. She doesn t 
      leave. Annoyed, he looks back up.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS (CONT D)
                    Something else?                                                                                    13.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    I should be the one picking the 
                    members of my team. 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    First of all, it s not your team. 
                    It s mine. And secondly, I needed 
                    someone you couldn t bully. Lucas 
                    Wright has excellent credentials. 
                    He s the analyst who found the 
                    Russia connection in Qatana. So 
                    play nice.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yes, sir. But Mitchell would ve 
                    been a better fit.

      She walks out. OFF: Ross...


      Lucas enters with Miles to find a box waiting on the desk.

                                  MILES
                    I had your stuff brought up from 
                    the second floor.

                                  LUCAS
                    Awesome. Thanks.

      He starts to unpack.

                                  MILES
                    A word of advice? Charleston s not 
                    a big fan of personal memorabilia. 
                    She thinks it can be distracting.

                                  LUCAS
                    Good to know.

      He unpacks a candid PHOTO of him with his large family (four 
      brothers, three sisters) and puts it on his desk. 

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    So who should I talk to about the 
                    SIPRNet slowdown?

                                  MILES
                    Did Charleston ask you to run it 
                    down?

                                  LUCAS
                    We discussed it.                                                                                    14.


                                  MILES
                    Talk to Bishop down in IOC.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks.


      Charleston is looking at a rundown on the USS Missouri. She 
      finds a note in the file. Checks her watch. Picks up the 
      phone. As she dials, we hear HEAVY METAL and CUT TO:


      DR. KENNETH SWENSON (41) slightly mad scientist, looks up as 
      Lucas enters.

                                  LUCAS
                    Hi. Lucas Wright.

                                    SWENSON
                    Ken Swenson.

                                  LUCAS
                          (sits)
                    So you ve done a psych profile of 
                    the Foreign Minister of Turkey.

                                    SWENSON
                    Yes. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Why?

                                    SWENSON
                    We do one for every foreign envoy 
                    that meets with the President. They 
                    can be quite useful in 
                      statesmanship.

                                  LUCAS
                    Strengths and weaknesses?

                                    SWENSON
                    Yes. And predilections.                                                                                    18.


                                  LUCAS
                    Is that like when a guy s got a 
                    thing for feet?

                                    SWENSON
                    Do you have a thing for feet, 
                    Lucas?

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (entering)
                    Don t answer that. You do not want 
                    Dr. Swenson inside your head.

                                    SWENSON
                    She s upset because I suggested 
                    that her desire to please the 
                    President is rooted in her father 
                      abandoning her at an early age.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Ken, how d you like to spend the 
                    rest of your career analyzing 
                    shepherds in Turkmenistan? 

                                    SWENSON
                    I m allergic to wool.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Then I suggest you do your job.

      He slides a report across the table.

                                    SWENSON
                    According to my analysis, Foreign 
                    Minister Ahmet Gezman is an 
                    assertive narcissist, with a high 
                    IQ and domineering personality -- 
                    as well as an unabashed womanizer 
                    with mistresses spread throughout 
                    the country. He is unrefined, 
                      unpredictable and a daredevil. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Define daredevil.

                                    SWENSON
                    He once wrestled a bear --

                                  LUCAS
                    Cool. What kind?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Not important.

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT'D)
                    So you re saying Gezman s not your 
                    typical foreign head of state.

                                    SWENSON
                    He s the love child of Vladimir 
                    Putin and Cassanova.

      The door opens revealing Miles.

                                  MILES
                    Sorry, but there s new intel on the 
                    Doctor.

                          (to Swenson)
                    Excuse us.

      She and Lucas steps out into:


      As soon as they clear...

                                  CHARLESTON
                    You went down to IOC.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah. I just --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Save it. These few hours before I 
                    brief the President are crucial. I 
                    can t have you running around, 
                    chasing hunches.

                                  LUCAS
                    If it makes you feel any better, 
                    you were right. All signs point to 
                    natural causes. 

      They enter the BULLPEN where Brett and Grace are waiting.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Which is what they told you when 
                    you called, five minutes before I 
                    went down there.

      Before Charleston can reply --

                                  BRETT
                    We ve got some clarity on who took 
                    Doctor Wolfe.                                                                                    20.


      As they talk we go into BOOK MODE, cutting to stylized 
      visuals of the intel being discussed -- where what we don t 
      know is out of focus or blank -- and what we do know gets 
      erased or altered when new information changes our 
      understanding. 

                                  GRACE
                    Facial recognition got a match. His 
                    name is Jacob Mungai. He s ex-
                    military turned terrorist. 

      BOOK MODE: JACOB MUNGAI stands center screen. Around him are 
      out of focus figures.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    What s his affiliation?

                                  GRACE
                    A Somali source claims Mungai has 
                    links to Al-Ittihaad al-Islami. 

      BOOK MODE: The figures around Mungai come into focus, wearing 
      green fatigues, faces hidden beneath red and white head 
      scarves. A LIST flows down the right side of the screen, 
        highlighting their activity for the last twelve months.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (unimpressed)
                    We ve used this source before. His 
                    intel s almost always wrong.

                                  GRACE
                    Nairobi station agrees. According 
                    to their research, Mungai s got a 
                    cousin in Al-Shabbab. They think 
                    Mungai started his own splinter 
                    cell, trying to make a splash so 
                    the big boys will notice him.

      BOOK MODE: red scarves become black, bandoliers of bullets 
      criss-cross the figures. INTEL on Al-Shabbab replaces AIAI.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Any clue where they took Wolfe?

                                  BRETT
                    Satellite imagery was able to track 
                    the abduction vehicles across the 
                    border into Somalia...

      BOOK MODE: FOOTAGE from a satellite picks up the two Land 
      Rovers from the abduction video.                                                                                    21.


                                  BRETT (CONT D)
                    ... Where they entered the Bosaso 
                    slum in Kismayo. 

      The vehicles enter a sprawling slum.

                                  GRACE
                      Unfortunately, they must have 
                    switched cars out of our sight, 
                    because we lost them.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Do we have any operators in the 
                    area who could effect a rescue if 
                    we can find him again?

      A look between Grace and Brett.

                                  GRACE
                    Yes and no.

                                  BRETT
                          (off Charleston)
                    There s a Special Activities team 
                    two hours away. 

                                  GRACE
                    But they re already on a 
                      kill/capture mission. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Who s the target?

                                  BRETT
                    Talal Abdal-Fattah.

      We see this land on Charleston.

                                  LUCAS
                    That s huge. He s been a ghost 
                    since he blew up our Embassy in 
                    Bangkok.

      OFF: Charleston, we FLASH TO:

      THE BLOODY BACKSEAT

      Charleston wracked with pain -- BLACK SMOKE filling the sky 
      behind them --

      BACK TO SCENE

      Charleston snaps back to focus.                                                                                    22.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    Which means that operation is 
                      inviolate. Are there any other 
                    options in the region?

                                  GRACE
                    Closest other personnel are a 
                    minimum twelve hours out.

                                  EARL
                          (approaching)
                    We don t have twelve hours. The NSA 
                    just intercepted a cell phone call 
                      referencing the doctor --  The 
                    match will be televised at ten. 

                                  LUCAS
                    What does it mean?

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (checks her watch)
                    That they re going to behead Doctor 
                    Wolfe in about eight hours.



                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    23.


                                        ACT TWO


      Charleston is in back, a locked briefcase containing the Book 
      in her lap. She looks at her watch -- conflicted -- then --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I need to make a stop.


      Porter climbs in, hands Charleston an envelope.

                                  PORTER
                    This is what we ve got on Mungai. 
                    There s a safe house in Bosaso. We 
                    think that s where Dr. Wolfe is 
                    being held.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Thanks, Porter.

                                  PORTER
                    Please. You rescued me from an 
                    extremely indelicate situation in 
                    Bangkok. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    We got good intel out of that 
                    hooker. And I witnessed first-hand 
                    the perils of vajazzling.  

                                  PORTER
                          (laughs)
                    Still seeing Nolan?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    When we re in the same city.                                                                                    24.


                                  PORTER
                    How often is that?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Almost never. 

                                  PORTER
                    I must say, I was surprised to get 
                    your call. Given the Agency s 
                    strict rules.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    A man s life is at stake.

                                  PORTER
                    Indeed. Take care.

      He gets out. Shuts the door. 

                                  DRIVER
                    White House now, ma am?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yes, please.

      The driver pulls out. Over this we hear KNOCKING and CUT TO:


      Lucas stands in the doorway. Brett is filling out paperwork, 
      while Earl and Grace work on laptops.

                                  LUCAS
                    Got a second?

                                  BRETT
                    Sure. Just filling out a close and 
                      continuing.

                                  LUCAS
                    I ve never actually had to do that. 
                    The sheltered life of an office 
                    analyst I guess.

                                  BRETT
                    Trust me. It s a pain. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Gotta love working for an 
                      organization that literally governs 
                    your contact with foreigners.                                                                                     25.


                                  GRACE
                    Lucky for Brett, one night stands 
                    are fine. 

                                  EARL
                    Long as your partner isn t Russian, 
                    Chinese, Cuban or a member of the 
                    Axis of Evil.

                                  LUCAS
                    They should make a calendar -- 
                    Girls of the Axis of Evil.

                                  BRETT
                    I d buy it. I m a sucker for a 
                    hottie with a Kalashnikov.

                                  GRACE
                    Why doesn t that surprise me? Men 
                    think girls with guns are hot, 
                    until one starts threatening to 
                    shoot you in the junk because 
                    you ve been hooking up with your 
                    trainer at a seedy motel. Then 
                    suddenly we re the problem --

      She breaks off, seeing the way they re looking at her.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                      Hypothetically.

                                  LUCAS
                          (breaking the moment)
                    Right. So call me crazy, but I got 
                    the sense earlier that Charleston 
                    has some pretty serious history 
                    with Abdal-Fattah.

                                  EARL
                    That s one way of putting it. 

                                  BRETT
                    She was in the Bangkok Embassy when 
                    he blew it up. 

                                  GRACE
                    It was her first overseas station. 
                    She lost four pints of blood by the 
                    time they got her to the hospital.

                                  LUCAS
                    No wonder his kill team s off 
                    limits.                                                                                    26.


      Miles appears in the doorway.

                                  MILES
                    Sorry to interrupt, but the Foreign 
                      Minister s here.

                                  GRACE
                    Show time.


      The tiny bakery adjacent to the White House kitchen is 
        Charleston s secret place. She s greeted warmly as she 
      enters. MICHAEL GILANI (34), sophisticated, second generation 
      Persian, offers her a plate of pastry. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Pecan tassie?

      Charleston takes a bite. Swoons a little.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    God, I ate so many of these before 
                    my cotillion, I could barely fit in 
                    my dress. My mother had to shove me 
                    in. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oh, I m going to need to see 
                    pictures of that. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Never gonna happen. How s the 
                    President today?

                                    MICHAEL
                    So far, so good. But rumor has it, 
                    he had a fight with the First Lady 
                    last night.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    About?

                                    MICHAEL
                    The anniversary. She thinks 
                    anything they do will feel 
                      political.                                                                                     27.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    She s still upset Adam s death 
                    became part of the campaign. And 
                    the fact that the sympathy vote is 
                    what likely won him the election is 
                    just awful irony.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I can t imagine. Losing your son is 
                      a parent s worst nightmare. 

      Before Charleston can reply, the phone RINGS.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                          (answering)
                    Bakery.
                          (listens)
                    Yeah. She s here... I ll tell her.
                          (hangs up)
                    That was Mike at the gate. Director 
                    Ross just arrived. 
                          (off her surprise)
                    Are you in trouble?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Always. It s how I know I m doing 
                    my job.

      She turns to go, then turns back to SNAG the rest of the 
      pastry. Over this we hear:

                                  GRACE (PRE-LAP)
                    Is this your first time briefing a 
                    head of state?


      Grace and Lucas cross the lobby, heading for an entourage 
      that includes AHMET GEZMAN (50), the Turkish Foreign 
      Minister.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yep. Anything I need to know? 

                                  GRACE
                    It s pro forma. We tell him a bunch 
                    of stuff he already knows, makes 
                    him feel important. It ll be over 
                    in twenty minutes.

      They reach Gezman and his security detail.                                                                                    28.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Mr. Foreign Minister, I m Grace 
                    Hough. This is Lucas Wright.

      The Foreign Minister shakes Lucas  hand. Kisses Grace s.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                      A pleasure.

      He s a handsome man and a shameless flirt. 

                                  GRACE
                    If you ll come with us. 

      His security team starts to follow.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Just you, sir.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Of course. 

      He motions for his team to stay behind. Puts a hand on her 
      back as they walk.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN (CONT D)
                    So tell me, Grace. Have you ever 
                    been to Turkey?


      Charleston enters. The President s Secretary, ELIZABETH (37) 
      is at her desk. A SECRET SERVICE AGENT stands outside the 
      Oval Office.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Morning, Liz. I think the 
                      Director s joining us.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I just heard that. I ll tell the 
                    President you re here.

      She heads into the Oval Office.

      Charleston notices the TELEVISION is playing a story about 
      Doctor Wolfe s abduction. It cuts to an interview with 
      Wolfe s wife, FIONA. His daughter, HANNAH, stands next to 
      her, tears in her eyes. Charleston turns up the volume. 

                                  FIONA
                    -- I know he wants to help, but 
                    it s so dangerous. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    And every time he goes -- I get so 
                    worried -- and now -- I don t want 
                    my daughter to grow up without her 
                    father --

      We see this land on Charleston. The moment is broken by 
      Ross s entrance.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Vultures. Preying on that woman s 
                    pain for ratings.

      Charleston mutes the television.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Sir, I didn t know you were coming 
                    to the briefing. 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    I was in the neighborhood.

      They both know he s lying.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (reappearing)
                    The President s ready for you.

      With a last look at the tv, Charleston heads:


      PRESIDENT TOM WHEELER (65) steps forward to greet them. He s 
      distinguished and energetic, with an easy charm. It s clear 
      Charleston has a much warmer relationship with him than the 
      Director does.

                                    SPENCER
                    Good morning, Mr. President.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Spencer, I didn t know you d be 
                    sitting in. Keeping an eye on our 
                    girl, here?

                                    SPENCER
                          (yes)
                    Of course not.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Charlie, we need to have words. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yes, sir.                                                                                    30.


                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    You know how much I value the 
                    little sleep I get. And yet you 
                    recommend that movie --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Don t tell me. You re seeing 
                      poltergeists in the Lincoln 
                    Bedroom.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Are you mocking me?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Wouldn t dream of it, sir.

      They settle onto the couch. Charleston unlocks her briefcase. 
      Hands the President THE BOOK. It s a next-gen tablet inside a 
        carbide-leather case. He puts his THUMB on the biometric 
      lock. It opens revealing the tablet -- fully interactive with 
      graphics and embedded video. 

      He scans it while Charleston talks.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    At 0600 Korean Standard Time, the 
                    USS Missouri suffered a fire in its 
                    engine room while deep inside 
                    Chinese waters. The cause was a 
                    faulty battery installed during the 
                    boat s recent retrofitting. As of 
                    twenty minutes ago, they had managed 
                    to restore limited power and are 
                    making for international waters. 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    We dodged a real bullet here, sir.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Thank God. Cause starting a 
                      thermonuclear war would definitely 
                    affect my re-election chances.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    On board the submarine is a North 
                    Korean asset who the Missouri had 
                    just picked up. He has classified 
                    intel on the NK missile program.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                          (surprised)
                    Why haven t I heard about this 
                    before now?                                                                                    31.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    I only found out about it this 
                    morning.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                          (to Ross)
                    Whose fault is that?

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    No one s, sir. The Asset made 
                    contact yesterday morning. The 
                    exfil had to be put together 
                    extremely quickly.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    We have Agency personnel waiting on 
                    the USS Eisenhower to debrief him.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    I want an update every hour. 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Yes, sir.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    What s next?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Foreign Minister Ahmet Gezman --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Gezman sits across from Grace and Lucas who are mid-
      presentation. 

                                  LUCAS
                    -- recent uptick in terrorist 
                    attacks, which we believe indicates 
                      a strengthening of Al Qaeda s 
                    operation inside Syria --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                          (to Grace)
                    Tell me about yourself, Grace. Are 
                    you married?

                                  GRACE
                    No -- Well, I was -- 

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    What happened? An affair?                                                                                     32.


      Lucas sees Grace s discomfort.

                                  LUCAS
                    Mr. Foreign Minister, if I may 
                    continue --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Either way, he s a fool to leave 
                    such a beautiful woman --

                                  GRACE
                    Who said he left me?
                          (off Gezman)
                    I m sorry --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Don t be. I love a woman with 
                    passion --

                                  GRACE
                          (annoyed)
                    Sir, please -- we re trying to 
                    brief you on the U.S. mission 
                    against Abdal-Fattah -- 

      Lucas reacts to the revelation. 

                                  LUCAS
                    Grace.

      She realizes her mistake. Pales.

                                  GRACE
                    I mean Al Qaeda --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                          (suddenly focused)
                    You have a bead on Abdal-Fattah?

                                  GRACE
                    No -- I mean --

                                  LUCAS
                    Will you excuse us for a moment?

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Of course.

      Lucas leads Grace into the hall.


      As soon as the door is closed --                                                                                    33.


                                  GRACE
                          (horrified)
                    I can t believe I just did that.

                                  LUCAS
                    It s okay --

                                  GRACE
                    No, it s not. Gezman s got family 
                    ties to Abdal-Fattah. The second he 
                    walks out of here, he could pick up 
                    the phone and blow our operation --

                                  LUCAS
                          (knows she s right)
                    We can t let that happen.

                                  GRACE
                    How the hell are we going to stop 
                    it? 

      OFF: Lucas...


      The briefing is wrapping up. 

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Okay, you ve made your point. I ll 
                    wait until the tests come back.

      He shuts the Book and hands it back to Charleston.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER (CONT D)
                    But I want a heads up on what we 
                    learn from that asset as soon as 
                    he s debriefed. Is that it?

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Yes, sir.

      He starts to rise. Charleston hesitates.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Actually, sir, there s one more 
                    thing that should be on your radar. 

      She s conscious of the way Ross is staring at her.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    An American doctor was abducted in 
                    Kenya by a new terror cell trying 
                    to make their bones. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    34.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    They re planning to execute him in 
                    a little under seven hours.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Do we know that, or just think it?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    We know it, sir. And we have a 
                    possible location. But it s 
                    unlikely we can get a rescue 
                    together in time.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Can Kenya help? I ll call Bensouda.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    He won t go into Bosaso with 
                    anything short of a battalion.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    All right. Keep me posted.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Thank you, Mr. President.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Thank you, sir.

      They head for the door. As they reach it, Charleston 
      hesitates, struggling.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Is there something else?

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    No, sir.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I m sorry, sir, but there is. We 
                    have a team in place that could 
                    rescue the doctor.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Charlie --

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (ignoring him)
                    But they re about to execute a 
                      kill/capture mission of a high 
                    value target -- Talal Abdal-Fattah.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Sir, Fattah s a senior member of Al-
                    Qaeda. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    35.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS (CONT'D)
                    He was behind the bombing of our 
                    embassy in Bangkok two years ago. 
                    If we pass up this chance to get 
                    him, we might not get another.

      The President weighs this. Looks to Charlie.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    What do you think?

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Sir, opinion is not Charlie s job. 

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    And yet, I m asking for it.

      He looks back to her.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (can t believe she s 
                            saying it)
                    I think we have an obligation to 
                    consider using the team to rescue 
                    Doctor Wolfe.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    All right. I want formal 
                      recommendations in two hours. 
                    Including one from Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yes, sir.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Thank you, Mr. President.

      Dismissed, she and Ross head into:


      Ross is steaming.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    What did I tell you -- ?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Sir, given recent developments, I 
                    felt --

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    I don t care. You were given a 
                    direct order. 

      He walks away. Charleston stares after him --                                                                                    36.


                                  ELIZABETH
                      Charleston, there s a call for you.

      Charleston moves to pick up the phone.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Hello?

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      Lucas is on the wall phone outside the door to the conference 
      room, now flanked by TWO SECURITY OFFICERS. Inside, Gezman 
      bangs on the door, the noise (and his voice) muffled by the 
      room s soundproofing.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Unlock this door right now.

                                  LUCAS
                    It s Lucas. We got a problem.

      OFF: Charleston...

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    37.


                                      ACT THREE


      Charleston stands with Lucas and Grace. Gezman can be seen 
      pacing inside.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    What the hell were you thinking?

                                  GRACE
                    It s my fault --

                                  LUCAS
                    I m the one who called security.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Great. So you can both go down for 
                    starting an international incident 
                    with a member of NATO.

                                  LUCAS
                    What should I have done? He walks 
                    out the door, and his first phone 
                    call alerts Abdal-Fattah to our 
                      operation.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    And you think you can imprison the 
                    Foreign Minister of Turkey here 
                      indefinitely? Cause I m pretty sure 
                    someone will notice.

                                  GRACE
                    Charlie --

      Charleston puts up her hand, stopping Grace. She stares at 
      the two of them, then at the pacing Foreign Minister.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Shit.

      She moves to the door. Steps:


      Charleston nods to the Security Officer.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Give us a minute, Vince.

      As Vince steps outside --                                                                                    38.


                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    Mr. Foreign Minister, first off, 
                    I d like to apologize for the 
                    conduct of my associates --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    I demand you let me out of here 
                    right now.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I m afraid I can t do that.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    You can and you will --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Let s cut the posturing. During the 
                    course of your briefing, we 
                    revealed the existence of a covert 
                    operation against a senior member 
                    of Al Qaeda. If I let you walk out 
                    of here, there is a risk -- however 
                    small -- that you will alert him of 
                    that operation --

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    That s ridiculous --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, I d 
                    make myself comfortable. You re 
                    going to be here a while. 

      As he starts to protest, Charlie exits --


                                  GRACE
                    How d he take it?

      Charleston look is all Grace needs to know.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (to Lucas)
                    Call the President s Secretary and 
                    tell her that we ve taken the 
                    Foreign Minister off his schedule.

                                  LUCAS
                    I should tell the Director --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No. That s the last thing you 
                    should do. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT'D)
                    I ll handle Ross if it comes to 
                    that. Right now, we need to buy 
                    ourselves a few hours.

                                  LUCAS
                    Copy that.

      He heads up the hall. She turns to Grace.

                                  GRACE
                    I screwed up.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yes, but that fact doesn t help us 
                    right now. In almost every known 
                    case of survival against all odds, 
                    the survivor never stopped to 
                    wonder  why did my plane crash?  Or 
                     why did I live while others died?  
                    They put aside emotion and focus 
                    only on survival. And that s what 
                    we re going to do. Which means I 
                    need you to go down to the lobby 
                    and tell Gezman s security detail 
                    that he s going to be here for the 
                    rest of the day. And you re going 
                    to do it with a smile on your face.

                                  GRACE
                    What do I say if they ask why?

      Charleston thinks, then reaches out and unbuttons Grace s 
      blouse, exposing a healthy dose of cleavage.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Tell them the Foreign Minister 
                    asked you to clear your afternoon 
                    for a more in-depth briefing. 

                                  GRACE
                    Got it. 
                          (then)
                    Thank you.

      Grace heads off. Charleston turns to see Brett coming her 
      way. She moves to intercept him.

                                  BRETT
                    What s going on? Why the security?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Not important. What do I need to 
                    know?                                                                                    40.


                                  BRETT
                    Nairobi station put a local on 
                    Mungai s safe house. He confirms 
                    that the Doctor is inside. How did 
                    you get the location?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    It came through British 
                      Intelligence.

                                  BRETT
                    I didn t see the flash cable.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Not sure we got one.

                                  BRETT
                    I can check --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No. I ll take care of it. You pull 
                    together everything we ve got on 
                    Wolfe. The President wants opinions 
                    on whether we should abandon the 
                    Fattah op to rescue him.

                                  BRETT
                          (surprised)
                    Who s stupid idea was that?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Just get it done.

      He walks away, replaced by Miles.

                                  MILES
                    They need you in the CTC.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (surprised)
                    Those guys don t normally invite 
                    outsiders in.


      High-tech. Smaller than the main Operations Center. The 
      personnel skew heavily female. Charleston enters. The energy 
      is hostile. These people are invested in bagging Abdal-
      Fattah. Group Chief, MEGAN BELLA (43), approaches. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Megan.                                                                                    41.


                                  MEGAN
                          (curt)
                      Charleston, I ve got somebody that 
                    wants to talk to you.

      She leads Charleston over to a monitor to find John Nolan 
      looking back at her from a MILITARY HANGAR in East Africa. We 
      recognize as the driver from Charleston s nightmare. A TEAM 
      OF SEALS is visible behind him, prepping equipment.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (surprised)
                    Nolan.

      It s clear there s a spark between them. But there s also 
      complicated history.

                                  NOLAN
                    I wanted to hear it from you. Are 
                    we getting pulled off Fattah? 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    It s a fluid situation --

                                  NOLAN
                    I can t believe you advised the 
                    President to abandon the op --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I didn t advise anything --

                                  NOLAN
                    A dozen people died, and you were 
                    almost one of them. There s no way 
                    saving this one guy outweighs 
                    taking down a terrorist with that 
                    many bodies on him. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Don t lecture me, Nolan. I m the 
                    one Fattah blew up. And for the 
                    record, all I said to the President 
                    was that rescuing an American 
                    citizen at least deserved a 
                      conversation before we condemned 
                    him to die. 

      A hard moment, then she softens.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    Look. Abdal-Fattah is going to 
                    happen. I m the only one talking 
                    about the doctor.                                                                                    42.


                                  NOLAN
                    Doesn t matter. The President 
                    trusts you. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    He trusts the Director --

                                  NOLAN
                    Bull. Ross doesn t have your 
                      relationship with the President, or 
                    your field experience -- and Ross 
                    resents you for it. You need to 
                    watch your ass around that guy.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I don t need you to protect me.

                                  NOLAN
                    You need somebody, cause you do a 
                    crap job of it yourself.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Look, I gotta go. Get ready to rock 
                    and roll. Cause no matter what 
                    happens -- you guys are getting 
                    dirty tonight. 

      She disconnects the feed. Over this we hear A GIRL S LAUGHTER 
      and CUT TO:


      Charlie is watching home video of Doctor Wolfe tossing his 
      infant daughter up in the air. Miles appears in the doorway.

                                  MILES
                    It s time to go.

      Charleston shuts off the video. Picks up a file.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Do I have the breakdown on terror 
                      recruiting at Wolfe s refugee 
                    camps?

                                  MILES
                    It s in there. What are you going 
                    to tell the President?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Honestly, I don t know.                                                                                    43.



      Filled with the President s NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, including 
      Director Ross. Charleston enters, feeling out of place among 
      the high-powered officials. She spots Ross talking to a 
      GENERAL. The two look over at her -- and it s clear they were 
      talking about her. 

      Then the doors open and the President enters. Everyone rises.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    I m faced with a hell of a Sophie s 
                    choice here. Protect the homeland, 
                    or save an American life.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Sir, my recommendation has not 
                    changed. Getting Abdal-Fattah has 
                    to take priority. We have credible 
                    intel pointing to an upcoming 
                    attack. If we don t stop Fattah 
                    now, we won t get another chance 
                    before he strikes.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    What about Wolfe? Is he just out of 
                    luck? 

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    The good of the many, sir.

      Wheeler nods. He doesn t like it, but he knows it s true.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Everyone agrees?

      Head nods and  yes, sirs  -- except from Charleston.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER (CONT D)
                    Charlie, you don t?

      All eyes turn to her, including those of Ross. She knows she 
      should tow the line. Can t.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Sir, first let me be absolutely 
                    clear. I want to put Abdal-Fattah 
                    in the ground as much as anyone in 
                    this room. But Mr. President, I was 
                    always taught that rescuing a U.S. 
                    citizen trumps killing an enemy. To 
                    do otherwise is not a sign of 
                    strength, but rather disregard for 
                    the Americans that we serve.                                                                                     44.


                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    Mr. President --

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Let her finish.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    It s true that Abdal-Fattah has 
                    killed dozens. But Dr. Wolfe has 
                    saved three times that many, and 
                    he ll save ten times more. In 
                    addition, I believe that the rescue 
                    of Doctor Wolfe will prove to be an 
                      operational bonanza for the CIA. 
                    Not only will it give us critical 
                      information on the cell that 
                    abducted him, but there is a strong 
                    reason to believe that Doctor Wolfe 
                    will be able to provide intel on 
                    terrorist recruitment at several 
                    other refugee camps --

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    What are you basing that on? 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    My experience.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    You want the President to abort a 
                    vital operation based on your gut.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No, I want him to do it because 
                    it s the right thing to do. 

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    All right. Enough. 

      The President pauses, feeling the weight of this decision. 
      Then:

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER (CONT D)
                    Go get the Doctor. 

      He rises to leave. The General picks up a secure phone.

                                    GENERAL
                    WHIPLASH is a go. This is a Title 
                    50 operation, OPCON goes to 
                    Langley, TACON to JSOC forces 
                    forward. Lethal force is approved.

      Under this, Ross turns to Charleston.                                                                                    45.


                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    When Abdal-Fattah kills again, 
                    those bodies will be on you.

      He walks away. OFF: Charleston...

                    Oh, I forgot, Brett gave me a note 
                    for you.

      He hands her the folded note. She opens it --  I know how you 
      got Wolfe s location  -- Lucas sees this land on Charlie.

      They move into...


      As soon as they re inside.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    There wasn t time to go through 
                    proper channels --

                                  BRETT
                    So you decided to put the President 
                    at risk --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Don t be dramatic --

                                  BRETT
                    Don t be naive. By interacting with 
                    Porter, you opened yourself up to 
                      manipulation by a foreign 
                      intelligence service --                                                                                    48.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    Britain s our closest ally --

                                  BRETT
                    So what? You think they wouldn t 
                    kill to have an  in  with the 
                      President s ear? For God s sake, 
                    the President plucked you out of 
                    the Company doghouse and made you 
                    the most important person in the 
                    Agency. And this is how you repay 
                    him? By putting him in jeopardy?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I repay him by giving him the one 
                    thing he needs above all else. The 
                    truth. You got a problem with that, 
                    the Director s office is down the 
                    hall.

      She walks out. OFF: Brett...


      ON SCREEN the team moves into the maze of alleys.

      Charleston slips back inside the room, moving to the front.

                                  OPERATIONS OFFICER
                    Alpha One, take your next left. 
                    Target is two blocks to the East. 
                    Be advised recon element has eyes 
                    on target site.

                                  NOLAN
                    Copy that.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:                                                                                    49.



      FLASHBANGS -- GUNFIRE -- YELLING -- TERRORISTS DIE --

      Then the last door is kicked in revealing DR. WOLFE --

      AND A DOZEN OTHER PRISONERS.

      Shock ripples through the CTOC --

                                  MEGAN
                    Who the hell are they?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I don t know. There was no intel on 
                    other captives.

      The SEALS quickly secure the room.

                                  NOLAN
                    What s your mother s maiden name?                                                                                    50.


                                  DOCTOR WOLFE
                    Shuman. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Doctor Wolfe, we re here to take 
                    you home.

                                  DOCTOR WOLFE
                    What about the others?
                          (off Nolan)
                    I won t leave without them.

                                  NOLAN
                    That s gonna be a problem.

      IN THE CTOC:

                                  CHARLESTON
                    What s wrong?

                                  OPERATIONS OFFICER
                    They don t have room on the 
                    choppers for all those people.

      ON SCREEN: Nolan activates his comm, looks into someone s 
      helmet cam.

                                  NOLAN
                    Command, we are evacing the 
                    hostages. I m going to walk out 
                    with Kaller and Abrams.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No --

                                  OPERATIONS OFFICER
                    Roger that, Alpha one. Reserve 
                    chopper will meet you at rally 
                    point. Good luck.

      OFF: Charleston, heart in her throat...

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    51.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Right where we left off. 

      ON SCREEN: The hostages are hurried out the BACK DOOR where 
      the Blackhawks are touching down --

      But we re FOCUSED ON ANOTHER SCREEN. Watching as Nolan and 
      TWO SEALS exit a different door. 

      DRONE POV: Nolan and the SEALS exit the building. Nolan s 
      face is clear as they move up a darkened street.

      Charleston watches -- 

      PREDATOR DONE VIEW: Nolan, Kaller and Abrams near an 
      intersection. 

      AROUND THE CORNER: A PICK UP TRUCK is coming towards them on 
      the cross street -- armed men sitting in the back.

                                  OPERATIONS OFFICER
                    Alpha One, you got company. 

      Nolan and the SEALS go to ground as the truck nears the 
      intersection.

                                  DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                    Command, I am ready to engage. Just 
                    say the word.

      The Operations Officer looks at Megan. She nods.

                                  MEGAN
                    Take  em.

      ON SCREEN: A FLASH whites out the screen as a Hellfire 
      Missile destroys the truck.

                                  DRONE PILOT (V.O.)
                    Target destroyed.

                                  OPERATIONS OFFICER
                    Alpha One, you have clear sailing 
                    to the rally point. Reserve Chopper 
                    is five seconds away.

                                  NOLAN
                    Copy that, Command. Good shooting.                                                                                    52.


      Nolan and the SEALS hustle for the descending chopper -- 
      Charleston turns away, allowing herself a moment of relief. 
      Over this we hear:

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    Praise for President Wheeler 
                    tonight as the world learns of the 
                    rescue of Doctor Wolfe, and a dozen 
                    European aid workers, previously 
                    thought to have been killed during 
                    recent fighting in the region.


      Charlie, Lucas, Brett, Grace and Earl watch the news.

                                  NEWS ANCHOR
                    The daring rescue inside a Somali 
                    slum was carried out by U.S. 
                    Special Forces just before dawn --

      Miles approaches the group. Hands Charleston a note. She 
      reads it. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                      Abdal-Fattah s gone. 

      They knew it was coming, but it doesn t hurt any less.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                          (to Lucas)
                    Time to pay the piper.

      She turns to go.

                                  LUCAS
                    You want company?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No. I got this.


      Foreign Minister Gezman looks up as the door opens and 
      Charleston enters.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    You re free to go. I apologize for 
                    the inconvenience.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                      Inconvenience? I was held hostage. 
                    Wait until the President hears 
                    about this.                                                                                    53.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    I was thinking you could forget 
                    about the whole thing instead.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                          (laughs)
                    You re insane --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Maybe. I mean sure you could cause 
                    a giant stink and get me and my 
                    people fired, maybe even arrested. 
                    Or we could turn this into 
                    something that will benefit you, 
                    and quite possibly your entire 
                    country.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    What kind of nonsense is this?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Not nonsense. We just rescued a 
                    dozen aid workers from Somalia, 
                    including a nineteen year old woman 
                    from Istanbul. If a story were to 
                    surface that the Turkish government 
                    played a critical part in the 
                      operation, you would become a hero 
                    to your people, and quite possibly 
                    increase the odds of your country 
                    finally being invited into the EU.

      Gezman takes this in, the politician in him clearly seeing 
      the upside.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    And my meeting with the President.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Tomorrow morning before you leave. 

      A moment, then he smiles.

                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    You have yourself a deal. How about 
                    a drink to celebrate. At my hotel 
                    perhaps?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I m sorry. The Agency forbids 
                    personal contact with foreign 
                    agents.                                                                                    54.


                                    FOREIGN MINISTER GEZMAN
                    Too bad. 

      He heads for the door.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Oh -- one more thing...

      He turns in the doorway.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    If you happen to talk to Abdal-
                    Fattah, tell him we re coming for 
                    him. 

      A moment, then Gezman turns and walks away with CIA Security. 
      OFF: Charlie...


      Charleston packs her bag. Lucas pokes his head in.

                                  LUCAS
                    So is every day like this?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No. Some days are busy. 

      They share a smile.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                    Have a good night.

                                  LUCAS
                    You too.


      Grace and Brett ride down in silence. He looks over at her.  
      Looks away. DING. The doors open. They step into:


                                  GRACE
                    Good night.

      As she starts to move away --

                                  BRETT
                    He s an idiot.
                          (off her)
                    You re smart, and you re funny, and 
                    you have a good heart. Not to 
                    mention you re a total babe.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                  BRETT (CONT'D)
                          (shit)
                    I m sorry. That was out of line--

                                  GRACE
                          (smiles)
                    No. That was perfect. Thanks.


      Charleston and Nicole are at a table.

                                  NICOLE
                    Looks like you had quite a day.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    You don t know the half of it.

                                  NICOLE
                          (off her)
                    You okay?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Yeah. Today just brought up some 
                    stuff that took me by surprise. 

      Her phone RINGS, breaking the moment.

                                  CHARLESTON (CONT D)
                          (answering)
                    Hello?

      OFF: Charleston...


      President Wheeler sits at the counter eating a pie. 
      Charleston appears in the doorway behind him.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Good evening, Mr. President.

      He turns to see her.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Charlie. What are you doing here?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    A little bird told me you were in 
                    here mainlining sugar.

      He cuts her a piece. Hands it to her.                                                                                    56.


                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER (V.O.)
                    You did good work today. It took 
                    guts to stand up in a room full of 
                      heavyweights and tell them 
                    something they didn t want to hear. 

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Thank you, sir.
                          (off his distraction)
                    Are you all right?

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    The anniversary s coming up.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I know.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    I never told you -- the week before 
                    he died, Adam came by the house. He 
                    was in one of those introspective 
                    moods --

                                  CHARLESTON
                      I remember those. He had about nine 
                    in the year we dated.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                    Before he left, he told me you were 
                    the one that got away.

      We see this land on her.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I -- I don t know what to say.

                                  PRESIDENT WHEELER
                          (with kindness)
                    Good night, Charleston.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Good night, sir.

      As he walks out, we CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON Director Ross. (We don t know who he s talking to 
      just yet.)

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS
                    She has too much influence over the 
                      President. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                  DIRECTOR ROSS (CONT'D)
                    She s clouding his judgment,  
                    steering him towards idealism, 
                    making him forget his friends. I 
                    put you on the briefing team to 
                    collect evidence against her. And I 
                    expect you do that. Do I make 
                    myself clear?

      And now we see who he s talking to: Lucas.
