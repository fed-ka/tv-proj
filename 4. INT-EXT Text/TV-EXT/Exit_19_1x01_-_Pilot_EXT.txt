      Gloria sees a smiling, pretty WOMAN in her mid-thirties.                                                                                          3.

                                      KATIE
                    Good morning. -- I'm Katie Silvers. 
                    We live over there...

      She points catty-corner to a perfectly finished, beautifully
      landscaped home across the street.  Gloria just stares at
      her, as if perplexed why this woman would be visiting.

                                      KATIE (CONT'D)
                          (gives another hint)
                    My daughter, Olivia, is in Nick's class.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh, hi... Welcome to the neighborhood.

      Gloria shakes Katie's hand.  

      Katie's quest for perfection is only matched by her love of
      family and her desire to be liked.  

                                      KATIE
                    Actually we've lived here for nine years.

      She smiles like it's a simple misunderstanding.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh.  My bad.  I'm kinda new at this
                    talking to the neighbors thing. 
                    We've only been here --

                                      KATIE
                    -- Three months... I remember when
                    the trucks came.
                          (again, she smiles)
                    Of course, I met your brother a while
                    ago when he lived here with his wife. 

      Katie tries to peek around Gloria into the house.  Rather than
      invite Katie in, Gloria closes the door behind her and heads
      toward the trash cans down at the curb. 


      This is our first look at the house from the outside.  Not
      as well manicured as Katie's, but it's a nice, middle-class,
      two-story in a quaint, Long Island neighborhood.  Like the
      interior, it has potential, it just needs a little love.   

                                      GLORIA
                    If this is a Scout, carpool or PTA
                    thing, my brother Davey, runs point
                    on most of that stuff. 

                                      KATIE
                    You're a police detective, right?                                                                                        4.

                                      GLORIA
                    Is there a problem?

      Gloria puts the plastic bag into the trash can.

                                      KATIE
                    Well.... Yes.  There've been several
                    thefts in the neighborhood.
                          (glances around)
                    Some of us on the block thought you
                    might be able to help...

                                      GLORIA
                    Okay... What's been stolen?

                                      KATIE
                    Gnomes. 

      Gloria stares at her. 

                                      GLORIA
                    Gnomes?

                                      KATIE
                    At least mine was a gnome.  But we're
                    missing all kinds of lawn ornaments --
                      flamingos, geese...

                                      GLORIA
                    I see... 
                          (then)
                    I gotta be honest, gnomes are a little
                    outside my jurisdiction.

      Gloria turns and faces her.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Now if you find a severed head, give
                    me a call. -- I've had a lot of success
                    with severed heads. 

      They stare at each other for a beat, like two ethnographers,
      studying the rituals of neighboring tribes.  Then, Gloria's
      cell phone rings.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Nice meeting you. 

      Gloria answers her phone,

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Sheppard!

      And heads back into her house.  SCORE KICKS IN and we MONTAGE
      Gloria into:                                                                                        5.


      CLOSE ON -- GLORIA: driving through the Village of
        Lindenhurst.  Quintessential Americana... Neighborhood shops
      and stores opening for the day... A MAILMAN talking to a MOM
      on the sidewalk..., 

      KIDS getting on a schoolbus... an ELDERLY WOMAN walking her
      TEENY DOG... 


      High and wide.  Gloria driving across the steel bridge.  It's
      a lovely, cumulous cloud kind of day.

      CLOSE ON -- GLORIA: as she crosses over the murky green East
      River and into Manhattan.  She loves this drive.  This city. 
      It's as if Dorothy gets to commute between Kansas and Oz.


      Quick shots of Gloria driving through crowded Manhattan
      streets.  Music cuts out hard as:


      Gloria SLAMS her car door and heads toward a crime scene in
      this sketchy, urban park.  We notice she's wearing an elegant,
      long coat.  She loves this coat and almost always wears it
      on the job.  She feels strong and invincible in it. 

      CAMERA LEADS HER as she passes a few SQUAD CARS, the M.E.s
      VAN, and a HANDFUL of COPS.  One of the UNIFORMS lifts the
      POLICE TAPE as Gloria flashes her badge. 

      Gloria sees some people, including a MEDICAL TECH huddled
      around the sprawled body of a DEAD MAN.  A woman, next to
      the body, spots Gloria and hurries toward her.  

      Her name is, DETECTIVE MICHELLE DULCETT.  She is a voluptuous
      black woman in her early thirties.  Her well-tailored pants
      suit flatters, rather than diminishes her physique.  Brooklyn
      born and raised, there is nothing that intimidates her. 
      Except, on occasion, Gloria.

                                      MICHELLE
                    You want the bad news or the worse
                    news?

                                      GLORIA
                    You know me.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Okay, the worse news is that Van
                    Stone's been assigned lead Detective
                    on the case.                                                                                          6.

      Gloria glances around looking for him.

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm sure in one of our past lives we
                    did something to deserve him...
                          (then)
                    And the bad...?

                                      MICHELLE
                          (indicating the dead man)
                    You're looking at it. 

      They step closer to the Dead Man as Gloria slips on latex
      gloves.  The Man is white, mid-fifties, sharp suit.  Blood
      has pooled out of the back of his head and there is more
      blood splattered on the nearby bench.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    Phillip Campbell.  He's kind of a
                    big deal.  Hedge fund guy.  

                                      GLORIA
                    Aren't all those guys big deals?

                                      MICHELLE
                    Yeah, but Campbell's the mayor's
                    hedge fund guy.  Lots of pressure
                    from downtown to tie this up fast.

      Gloria glances around.  Notices a derelict swing set.  A
      DRUNK passed out on a bench.  A CHURCH across the street.

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess
                    he doesn't live or work around here.

                                      MICHELLE
                          (confirms)
                    Other end of the island.

      Gloria bends down for a closer look at Campbell as the MEDICAL
      TECH collects evidence nearby.

      GLORIA'S POV -- CAMPBELL: she spends a moment drinking in
      the details: clean shaven, expensive haircut, designer tie...
      even in death she can see he was handsome.

      CLOSE ON -- CAMPBELL'S HAND:  as Gloria examines it.  Three
      fingers are grotesquely bent backward.

                                      GLORIA
                    He had a briefcase or bag or something
                    he didn't want to give up.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Yeah. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        7.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    He either got pushed, or fell and
                    cracked his skull open on the bench
                    there.  Doesn't seem premeditated.
                          (then)
                    Van Stone said we should investigate
                    under the theory of --

                                      GLORIA
                    -- A mugging gone bad?         

      Michelle nods.  Gloria pulls back the man's coat sleeve
      revealing an EXPENSIVE WRIST WATCH.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Call me crazy, but when I mug a guy,
                    I take his 30,000 dollar watch.

      She looks over at the Med Tech.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    He still have a wallet on him?

      The Tech nods.  Gloria and Michelle exchange a look.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay, worst mugger ever.

                                      MICHELLE
                    It happens. 

      The Med Tech pulls the WALLET out of a zippie bag and hands
      it to Gloria.  She flips through it, notices a:

      CLOSE ON -- A PSYCHIC'S BUSINESS CARD: MADAME NATALIA.  

      Gloria shows it to Michelle.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know dudes saw psychics.

                                      GLORIA
                    Creepy, right? -- Like a guy in a
                    nail salon. 

                                      MICHELLE
                    Or a back waxer....

      Gloria tucks the card back into the wallet.  Michelle scans
      the area.  Has her theory.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    Y'know, Glo, I feel dirty saying it,
                    but I think I'm with Van Stone on
                    this one.  Some meth head probably
                    grabbed the briefcase, tried to bolt
                    and Campbell fought back.                                                                                         8.

                                      GLORIA
                    Maybe... Or the thing in the briefcase
                    was what he was after.

      Michelle shoots Gloria a look.

                                      MICHELLE
                    You know, I hate when you say "maybe"
                    like that.  

                                      GLORIA
                    Why's that?

                                      MICHELLE
                    Because it doesn't mean, "maybe", it
                    means, you have a different theory
                    and you think everyone else is wrong.

      Gloria stands up.  

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm just wondering what Campbell was
                    carrying that was worth dying for
                    and why he was hanging out in a park
                    at the ass end of the island?    

                                    VAN STONE (O.S.)
                    I don't care why.  I just care we
                    catch the dirtbag who killed him. 

      Gloria looks over as DETECTIVE JOE VAN STONE steps up.        
      Van Stone has the vanity and bitterness of a man who feels
      he is a giant trapped in the body of a tiny man.  He glances
      at his watch, as if Gloria's late.

                                    VAN STONE (CONT'D)
                    Nice of you to show up, Shepherd.

      She leans close to Michelle and forces an open-mouthed breath.        
      Michelle scrunches her nose.

      Gloria starts rummaging through her bag in front of an

      building.  Gloria chomps her mint.

      Gloria nods in agreement.  The two women turn and enter the

      Gloria and Michelle exit the building.  Head back up the

      Ramon releases a little smile.  Michelle smiles back.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Hey, Romeo.

      The vibe is palpable.  

                                      GLORIA
                          (enough)
                    Show us what you've got.


      STYLIZED PIECES OF WHAT GLORIA DESCRIBE: we'll use this device
      in series as she puts things together. 

      Moyers glances nervously around as Campbell hurries away
      from the church carrying a leather briefcase. 

                                      GLORIA (V.O.)
                    If Moyers knew Campbell was going to
                    get the money blessed, he could have
                    been waiting in the park.  

      Moyers jumps out.  The two men struggle.

                                      GLORIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Figured he's grab and go.  Didn't
                    expect Campbell to fight back.

      Moyers shoves Campbell.  Campbell falls, splits his head
      open on a sharp iron corner of a bench.

                                      GLORIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Campbell split his head open, died,
                    and Moyers took the bag of cash.

                                                                                BACK TO:                                                                                        43.


      QUICK CUTS OF THE CITY.  Thomkins Square Park, skyscrapers,
      a quaint street in the West Village takes us to: 


      Michelle strides along a sidewalk.

                                      MICHELLE
                          (into her phone)
                    Don't go all, "told you so", but I
                    found your psychic. -- Campbell was
                    set up.  See you back at the station.

      Off Gloria:

      Gloria and Michelle walk up the block.  Gloria is cocooned
      in her coat.  

                                      MICHELLE
                    Wow...

                                      GLORIA
                    Yep.... Not my finest hour.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Van Stone's not gonna forget that. 
                    He'll have you written up.

      She glances over at Gloria.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    How come everybody can be wrong,
                    except you?

                                      GLORIA
                    I've been wrong. 

                                      MICHELLE
                    But not about Campbell's wife?

                                      GLORIA
                    Not about the wife.  It's too
                      convenient.  I buy the mistress, I
                    buy the girlfriend, but not the wife. 
                    And certainly not with a confession.

      Gloria shakes her head in disgust.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Van Stone sitting in there, taking
                      whatever's handed to him...

      She stops walking.  Turns to Michelle.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Moyers is dead.  The one person who
                    could finger her is out of the way. 
                    Why confess?  Why say it's me, if
                    I've gotten away with it?

                                      MICHELLE
                    But isn't the wife the one who's
                    into all that astrology, psychic
                    stuff?  Maybe she felt guilty 'cause
                    it got him killed.                                                                                         50.

                                      GLORIA
                    I don't see Phillip Campbell telling
                    his wife that his business was in
                    trouble, and I sure as hell don't
                    see her giving him money advice.

      They turn and enter a large WESTSIDE TOWNHOUSE.
