  INT.  LECTURE HALL -- DAY11

  CLOSE UP

  A coin tumbles in the air -- in SUPER SLO-MO

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Chance.  Lady luck.  Randomness.  
                Humans have a hard time 
                  understanding it.

  NORMAL SPEED -- the COIN lands in the palm of a hand.  Heads.

  WIDER TO REVEAL

  CHARLIE -- (with coin) lectures a large class of undergrads. 
  (note:  more than 23, but less than 40)

  Charlie turns and projects a POWERPOINT SLIDE:  TWO GRAPHIC 
  IMAGES of DOTS.  Image  A  is full of clumps and groups of 
  dots.  Image  B  dots are spread out evenly. 

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                  Raindrops fall randomly.  Which of 
                these two most resembles raindrops 
                on a sidewalk?  Raise your hands.  
                A?  (No hands.)  B?  (All hands.)  
                Wrong.  Your brain misperceives 
                evenness as random, and wrongly 
                assumes groupings are deliberate.  

  Charlie writes 4-25 on the board.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Anybody here born on this day?

                              STUDENT
                Yeah, that s my birthday.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    2.

  A sound of surprise from another kid in the room.

                              CHARLIE
                And it s yours too, isn t it? Yeah, 
                I saw from the class files that two 
                of you have the same birthdate. 
                Doesn t that seem like quite a 
                  coincidence? What are the odds?  

  Charlie turns and writes out the odds on a clear board.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                Pretty good, actually. Out of 365 
                possible dates, with a group of 30 
                people, there s almost a 71 percent 
                chance two will share a birthday.

  He turns to the class again.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                People don t understand random 
                chance, so they often make 
                  irrational decisions.  They re 
                afraid to work in high-rise 
                  buildings, or to live in an 
                  earthquake area. They spend money 
                on lottery tickets.

  Charlie puts up a slide of a TABLE showing causes of death 
  ranked by probabilities.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                  A mathematical assessment of chance 
                events tells us we re far more 
                likely to suffocate in bed than be 
                killed in a terrorist attack.  Ten 
                times more likely to die from 
                alcohol than from an earthquake.  
                And it s 10 times more likely we ll 
                be killed driving to buy a lottery 
                ticket-- than it is that we ll win 
                the lottery.

  EXT.  LA FREEWAY -- DAY22

  Miles of four lane traffic.  We find and follow a Mini-van.

                              PETE  (O.S.)
                That was a weird movie-- 





                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    3.

                              JEFF (O.S.)
                Yeah, from the reviews I was 
                  expecting more of a comedy.

                              ANDY (O.S.)
                  I thought it was pretty good.

                              PETE (O.S.)
                  Teenagers like boring movies.

                              ANDY (O.S.)
                You only like cartoons. 

                              PETE (O.S.)
                No, I just don t like boring movies 
                about people in looooove.

  INT.  FAMILY MINI-VAN - DAY33

  JEFF KINKIRK (42) drives.  His oldest son, ANDY (14) in the 
  seat next to him.  His younger son, PETE (9), in the back.

                              ANDY
                Dad, can we go for ice cream?

                              JEFF 
                We should be getting back home--

                              PETE
                Come on, it s on the way.  Kind of. 

                              JEFF
                Not at all, actually -- but -- 

                              ANDY
                You know you want to.

  Jeff starts angling the car toward the on-ramp--

                              JEFF
                Okay, if you put it that way--

                              PETE 
                Yea, Dad! 

  Jeff grins at Pete in the rear view mirror.

  The BACK WINDOW SHATTERS.  Like an EXPLOSION.

  Andy whips around, sees Pete frozen in horror, eyes on his 
  father.  Andy turns to see Jeff slouch on the wheel, blood 
  pours down his neck.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    4.

                              ANDY 
                Dad!  What s wrong?!

  The van veering off the EXIT RAMP.  Andy grabs the wheel, 
  lurches it back into the lane.  Pete screams in terror.  Andy 
  slides his left foot over.

  EXT.  FREEWAY OFF-RAMP - DAY44

  The mini-van nearly side-swipes a sedan as it angles onto the 
  breakdown lane, rolls to stop.

55INT.  HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - DAY  

  MARLA KINKIRK and her two sons, with DON and DAVID. 

                              MARLA 
                They said he was shot.     

                              DAVID
                We think that s what happened.  Is 
                there anyone who would want to harm 
                your husband?

                              MARLA 
                No -- no one.

  Don kneels down in front of the two boys.

                              DON
                Hey.  I m Don.  I m with the FBI.

  Andy puts a protective arm on Pete s shoulder. 

                              DON (CONT D)
                How you guys doing?

                              ANDY
                Do you know who did it? 

                              DON
                We re working on it.

                              MARLA
                I heard on the news there s been 
                attacks, on the freeways. 

                              DAVID
                That s true, but we don t know if 
                those incidents are related to the  
                attack on your husband. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    5.

  Marla sees an ER DOCTOR coming, stands. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                Mrs. Kinkirk, your husband is 
                stable.

                              MARLA
                Thank God. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                There s issues we need to discuss --

                              DAVID
                Excuse us.

  David and Don start to move away.

                              MARLA
                Please -- stay.

  The doctor glances at the boys.  Don sees, pulls them aside. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                      (sotto, to Marla)
                Your husband has sustained a 
                gunshot wound to the head.

  Marla puts an arm on David s arm to steady herself.

                              ER DOCTOR (CONT D)
                Luckily, the bullet did not 
                  penetrate far, it s lodged in the 
                right occipital lobe.  Our 
                  neurosurgeon is confident he can 
                remove it without further damage.  

  Don with the boys.  Decides to level with them.

                              DON
                What do you remember?   

                              ANDY
                I heard a loud crash from the back, 
                I turned and Pete was scared--

                              PETE
                From the noise, and then I saw the 
                blood.

                              ANDY
                I looked where Pete was looking, I 
                saw Dad was hurt.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    6.

  The memory shakes both of them -- 

                              DON
                Just before the crash, did you see 
                any particular cars you remember?

  Andy shakes his head -- 

                              PETE
                I don t know but -- I think maybe 
                there was a white truck.  I didn t 
                see who was driving it.

  Don glances at Andy.

                              ANDY
                Sorry, I didn t see it.

                              DON 
                All right.  What happened then? 

                              ANDY
                  I grabbed the wheel and -- I just 
                tried to keep us from crashing.

                              DON
                That was good thinking. 

  Pete s about to cry.  Andy squeezes his shoulder.  He keeps 
  his voice as calm as he can to ask --  

                              ANDY
                Is Dad going to be okay?

                              DON 
                Yeah, he ll be fine. And we ll find 
                the guy who did this.

  David and Don walk away from the hospital.

                              DAVID
                We got seven freeway attacks in 
                eight weeks.  Four people dead.

                              DON
                Five, if this guy dies.

  His voice tight, face tense.

                              DAVID
                Don, something wrong?  

                              DON
                I lied to those two kids.

                              DAVID
                You made them feel a little better, 
                that s all. It s a rough time.   

                              DON
                I told them everything ll be fine,  
                life will go back to normal.             

                              DAVID
                And they need to be able to believe 
                that, just to keep going.  

  He stops, looks at David.  

                              DON
                But it doesn t ever go back.  Their 
                lives will never be the same again. 

  And he walks on, leaving David looking after him.

                Seven freeway attacks in two 
                months.  We looking at a serial?

                              MEGAN
                If so, it s atypical.  All the MOs 
                are different.

  Colby indicates a series of PHOTOS from previous attacks.

                              COLBY
                Previous attacks were with a wrist 
                rocket, thrown rock, brick, tire 
                iron, golf club, and a rifle shot.  
                Now a handgun at close range.

                              MEGAN
                The victims don t fit a profile.

                have a bunch of copycats.

                              CHARLIE
                Or maybe there s no pattern at all.

                              MEGAN
                That s what I m saying, Charlie.  
                There is no pattern.

                              CHARLIE
                Actually -- a single assailant or a 
                bunch of copycats both imply a 
                pattern.  What I m suggesting is 
                that the grouping of these 
                  shootings might be random.

                              COLBY
                Seven completely unrelated attacks?     

  Charlie digs into his satchel.  Pulls out an MP3 player.

                              CHARLIE
                Consider -- this music player has a 
                shuffle function, uses an algorithm 
                to play songs in a random order.  
                But when people listen to a random 
                shuffle, they perceive patterns.  
                But it s all coincidence.

                              MEGAN
                People swear their MP3 s like to 
                play certain songs. I know mine has 
                a thing for ZZ Top.

                              CHARLIE
                Right, because humans perceive 
                patterns that aren t there. 

                              MEGAN
                      (thinking it out)
                So every few years we get a cluster 
                of violent freeway incidents --  

                              DAVID
                They seem related, but it s chance.

                              CHARLIE
                That s the idea.

                              DON
                Unless we find evidence to the 
                  contrary, let s investigate these 
                as individual crimes.       NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    10.



88EXT.  FBI PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER  

  Megan walks with Don.

                              MEGAN
                I get the concept of random 
                  clusters, but road rage is 
                  associated with certain factors, 
                none of which we see in these 
                cases.     

                              DON
                Factors like what, hot weather? 

                              MEGAN
                Also bad traffic, racial conflict, 
                near accidents.  Stuff that makes 
                people tense and angry.       

                              DON
                You re saying these incidents 
                aren t typical.   

                              MEGAN
                That s right.  Another thing --  
                the younger boy, Pete, said he 
                thought he saw a white pickup?  Now 
                he says maybe the same truck drove 
                by his house that morning.

                              DON
                Lot of white pick-ups in Los 
                Angeles.

                              MEGAN
                He says both had bobble-head Hula 
                dancers on the dash.

                              DON
                How sure is he?

                              MEGAN
                He s nine and he s been 
                  traumatized.  But it raises the 
                  possibility someone was stalking 
                Jeff Kinkirk, that he wasn t a 
                random victim.

                              DON 
                Let s hit from both sides.  Get a 
                list of white pickups from the DMV, 
                work it with David and Colby.

                The wife says her husband had no 
                enemies.  If the kid s right and 
                somebody was stalking the guy, 
                maybe she s hiding something.

  LARRY S walking out carrying a coffee, runs into AMITA.

                Larry, got a minute? 

                              LARRY
                I have the eight and a half that it 
                takes me to walk to my office.  If 
                that s not enough, we could choose 
                a longer route, maybe stop to 
                  contemplate the turtle pond -- 

                              AMITA
                Or we could just keep talking at 
                your office. 

                              LARRY
                A less scenic choice, but okay.

  They walk along --

                              AMITA 
                I m finding it a little strange, 
                being a professor after being a 
                student for so long.

                              LARRY
                Oh my dear, we ve all been there.

                              AMITA
                Feels like I should be going to 
                  lectures, not giving them.  I run 
                into former teachers everyday, some 
                of them act like nothing s changed. 

                              LARRY 
                This is why people usually leave 
                the school where they earn their 
                  doctorate to teach elsewhere.  But, 
                  I understand CalSci made an offer 
                you couldn t refuse.

                been better off on the East Coast.

                              LARRY
                  Geography s hardly the issue.  You 
                yourself must embrace your new 
                role.  Only then will others begin 
                to see you differently.

                              AMITA
                Wow.  Even for you, Larry, that was 
                  profound.  Feel like I should be 
                  snatching a pebble from your hand 
                or something.  

                              LARRY
                You caught me just as the 
                  caffeine s kicking in.

                I ve checked 177 so far.  But I m 
                looking at some other factors.   

                              DAVID
                Weather, employment, traffic, time

                              MEGAN 
                But here s the thing.  None of 
                these attacks can be linked to the 
                typical causes of freeway violence. 
                Like bad traffic, hot weather --

                              DAVID
                I see what you re saying.  At least 
                some should have typical causes. 

                              MEGAN
                Exactly -- traffic disputes, 
                domestic violence, car jackings.  
                With witnesses, and victims who 
                know why they were targeted.   

                              COLBY
                Instead we got -- invisible 
                  assailants and no motives.

                too random -- to be random?

                See, I used computational geometry 
                to reconfigure the mall s 
                  landscaping.  You should be able to 
                get 20-30 percent more green space.

                              ALAN
                That ll make the client happy. I 
                was going to push everything back 
                two feet, but it d cut into the 
                usable retail space.

                No, I believe there s lots of 
                special people out there. What 
                makes a relationship work is what

                              MEGAN
                How you doing, Alan.  Sorry to 
                  interrupt, but -- 
                      (to Charlie)
                Can something be too random?

                              CHARLIE
                  Something can be a little random -- 
                or very random.  But, no, not too 
                random.  Why?

                              MEGAN
                We assume these freeway attacks are 
                a random series of events.  But 
                none of them can be linked to the 
                usual causes of freeway violence.

                              ALAN
                Like road rage, that sort of thing? 

                              MEGAN
                Yes.  About 70 percent of highway 
                assaults stem from arguments 
                between drivers, particularly when 
                one or both parties suffers from 
                  something called Intermittent 
                  Explosive Disorder.

                              ALAN
                I think in my day we called that 
                having a screw loose.

                              MEGAN
                Yeah, as a matter of fact my dad 
                kinda had a screw loose.  But, 
                  explosive rage is a little more 
                serious.  People can erupt into 
                  uncontrollable violence over 
                  practically nothing.

                              CHARLIE
                I gather that none of these attacks 
                stem from traffic disputes.  What 
                are other common causes?

                just haven t been able to detect?

                              CHARLIE
                That s Hidden Variable Theory.  The 
                idea that nothing in the world is 
                ever really random -- because 
                there s always some influence or 
                force we can t detect.

                              ALAN
                And is that theory a good one?

                              CHARLIE
                Einstein believed it in 1935, but 
                it proved not to be true, at least 
                in the way he thought.  Most 
                  scientists now believe that God 
                does play dice with the universe.

                              MEGAN
                Still, it s weird none of these 
                attacks are typical, not one.  

                              CHARLIE
                Weird, yes, unlikely yes.  
                  Impossible? No. The thing about 
                random sequences, they can look 
                pretty strange.

  EXT. HIGHWAY TUNNEL ENTRANCE -- DAY2020

  A car sits wrecked -- a CINDERBLOCK embedded in the 
  windshield.  Blood spattered on the dashboard and seat.   

  Cops and emergency personnel work the scene.  EMTS roll a 
  gurney with a body bag as David and Colby walk up to examine 
  the wreckage.

                              DAVID
                Victim was a 28 year-old computer 
                tech.  Died instantly.  

                              COLBY
                The killer had to haul the cinder 
                block to the top of the entrance, 
                time the drop to hit a car.  And 
                avoid witnesses.

                Took work and planning. Doubt it

                I spent the weekend at Politzer s 
                and he completely disassembled my 
                11d supergravity theory and here I 
                am -- in 10 dimensions with two p-

                  magnetically charged respectively 
                to the C-field...

  Charlie sees Larry s couch.  Sheets, blankets and a pillow.

                  decorating issues, appliances.  I

                Speaking of Megan, she came by the 
                house, wanted to know if a sequence  
                can be too random. (smiles)  Funny.

                              LARRY
                I fail to see what s funny about 
                her question.

                              CHARLIE
                Too random?  As in excessively 
                random?

                simple affirmative or negative. Was

                              LARRY
                Is she concerned that all of the 
                attacks have different MOs?

                              CHARLIE
                Yes, but-

                  different methods, is it possible 
                that Megan finds the improbability

                              CHARLIE
                Larry, I can roll a pair of dice 
                eight times, never get the same 
                result twice and that s still in 
                the realm of random.

                              LARRY
                True.  But something that doesn t 
                repeat is not by definition random.

  Charlie looks up, alarmed, jumps off the couch.

                I have my moments.  I was looking 
                for related attacks that didn t 
                result in serious injuries.  

  They flip through the photos.

                              COLBY
                Objects used included a rock, large 
                marble.  Lead weight.  Steel pipe.

                              DAVID
                No injuries, so no police report.  

  Charlie comes in.

  Charlie pulls out the MP3 Player again.

                Remember the shuffle mode?

                              DAVID
                Right, patterns that aren t there. 

                              CHARLIE
                It s controlled by an algorithm 
                that creates a random order for the 
                songs.  But it s not really random. 
                The algorithm won t repeat a song.  

                              MEGAN
                So the freeway attacks -- the lack 
                of repetition is deliberate?  
                That s what I ve been saying.

                              DAVID
                These attacks could be the work of

  Megan leads Charlie up to the PLASMA, turns it on.

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                Here s five new incidents.

                Five?  I didn t hear about that on

                              DAVID
                These are cases that haven t been

                Let s look at them placed 
                  chronologically with the others.

  Megan punches in data.  Five new incident dates appear on a 
    TIMELINE/CALENDAR for the attacks.

  Charlie studies the timeline. 

  CHARLIE VISION:

  Dates start to group and block into sequences. A numerical 
  pattern emerges.

  RETURN TO SCENE:

                That s a fairly regular pattern,

                  I thought so.  Guys, I m gonna call 
                this one, 99 percent sure. The 
                varied methods show an attempt to

                              CHARLIE
                Which is in itself a pattern.

                But what the perpetrator can t 
                disguise is the intensity of his 
                need, which compels him to act at 
                regular intervals.  And because the 
                  compulsion is growing, those 
                  intervals are shorter and shorter.  

  She turns to them, decisive --

                first hand next time you play poker 
                as you are of being a victim of the

                It s more complicated for traffic.  
                But we can use partial differential 
                  equations to calculate optimum

                No, Larry, even the FBI can t stop

  Amita suppresses a smile as she tries to concentrate.

                Anything interesting?

                              AMITA
                I loaded the data into the modeling 
                  software.  Should give a clear 
                graphic of traffic flow after the 
                attacks.  I ll put it on the LCD.

  Larry and Charlie turn to the 40 inch LCD monitor.  GRAPHIC 
  ANIMATION of FREEWAY and SURFACE TRAFFIC springs to life.  
  The animations are looped and play over again.

                  I compressed the time -- so 30 
                minutes plays out in 30 seconds.

  Larry and Charlie step closer -- watching the eerie flow of 
  traffic -- represented graphically in a computer animation.

                Look at the flow, optimized in one 
                  direction.  All the cross streets 
                are backing up.  Play another one.

  Amita types -- and new animation of a different area appears.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                There it is again.  According to 
                the time code, it s right after the 
                shooting one.

                              AMITA
                It s like someone opened an escape 
                valve for the traffic coming off 
                the freeway.

                              CHARLIE
                More like an escape route.

  PUSH IN TIGHT on the ANIMATION and we cut to--

  EXT.  STREET - NIGHT3232

  A car idles in the middle of a lane.  A car comes up behind 
  it, honks.  Then pulls around.  Another car pulls around.

  An LAPD officer pulls up, his floods light up the vehicle. 

  A WOMAN behind the wheel. The Officer steps out, Maglite in 
  one hand, the other rests on the butt of his gun.

  He walks up to the drivers window.  Flashes the light on the 
  woman.  She stares straight ahead. 

                              LAPD OFFICER
                Ma am?

  No response.  He taps the window with the flashlight.

                              LAPD OFFICER (CONT D)
                Ma am.  Roll down your window.

  The officer releases the gun leather on his holster.  Steps 
  around to shine his light more directly on her face.

  Gets a good look at a bullet hole through the windshield.  
  And the bloody hole in the woman s forehead.

                That was Krager s boss, city 
                manager for Bellhaven.  He said 
                that two years ago a neighborhood 
                submitted a petition for a light at 
                a blind intersection.  Krager s job

                accident for assault, though the

                              DON 
                His life was destroyed.  He might 
                blame Carol Krager, the woman who 
                didn t approve the stop light that 
                might have prevented the accident. 

                              COLBY
                But she wasn t the first victim.  
                Why kill other people first?  

                              MEGAN
                Maybe his first victim set him off 
                some other way.  Once he got 
                started, he went back to Krager.

                No, because I have anger and 
                impulse problems.  It comes with 
                the frontal lobe damage.  I m

  A white pickup parked along the overpass.  MITCHELL MACKENZIE 
  gets out of the drivers side, goes to the back.

  A HULA DANCER sways on the dashboard. 

  MacKenzie s sad, intense.  He pulls a tarp off something in 
  the pick-up s bed.  It s a rock the size of a small suitcase.  
  MacKenzie starts to pull on work gloves.

  Ahead of him, an LAPD cruiser approaches the bridge.  
  MacKenzie pulls the tarp back over the rock, jumps in the 
  truck and guns the engine.

  He drives forward, at the police car, just as it slides 
  across the road to block his path.  The truck SLAMS into the 
  cruiser, then immediately drops into REVERSE.

  Coming the other way, two dark FBI SEDANS.  MacKenzie drops 
  it into drive and burns rubber toward an opening.

                Get on the ground, now!

                                MACKENZIE
                I m only doing what s right!  

                              COLBY
                Get on the ground.  Do it now.

  MacKenzie obeys.  David and Colby are on him, cuffing him.

                                MACKENZIE
                Good people hurt and killed, and 
                those responsible just walk away.   

  They pull him to his feet.

                                MACKENZIE (CONT D)
                Somebody has to pay.  That s all I 
                do, I make things right.    

  INT. EPPES HOUSE -- NIGHT4949

  Alan comes in from the hallway into a dark living room.  
  Somebody s there, sitting in a chair.

  Alan switches on a light, finds Don, drinking a beer. 

                              ALAN
                Donnie, why you sitting in the 
                dark? 

                              DON
                Thinking about the case. 

                              ALAN
                Thank God you caught the guy.

                              DON
                After he killed five people.  
                Injured a half dozen more. And 
                  tomorrow, I got two dozen new cases 
                and it all starts up again.

                              ALAN
                You ve have tough cases lately. You 
                should some time off. 

  Don shrugs away the suggestion. 

                              ALAN (CONT D)
                It s not good to get like this.

                              DON
                Dad, I m always like this.

                              ALAN
                Donnie, listen to me--

                              DON 
                      (gently cuts him off)
                I m sorry, it s just been a long 
                day.     

  The door opens, Charlie comes in.  Carrying a satchel. 

                              CHARLIE 
                Hey, I found something interesting 
                I want you to look at.

                              DON
                      (forced casual)
                What s that, Charlie?

                              CHARLIE
                You know how I thought the freeway 
                attacks were a random series--

  As he talks, he gets some paperwork out of his satchel.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                They weren t.  MacKenzie was behind 
                all of them.  But he didn t 
                actually start the sequence. 

                              DON
                How do you mean? 

                              CHARLIE
                  A hit-and-run driver started it 
                when he struck MacKenzie. A head 
                injury left him unable to control 
                his rage and impulses.

    CONTINUED:4949


                              ALAN
                But Charlie, he s still responsible 
                for his own actions.

                              CHARLIE 
                Of course. But the driver who hurt 
                him was never apprehended.  He got 
                away with it.

  He puts papers on the table, Don picks up an ACCIDENT REPORT. 

                              DON
                  MacKenzie s accident report.
                Where d you get all this?

  He starts going through paperwork Charlie s brought -- 

                              CHARLIE
                Megan called the CHP for me.  I 
                thought you might want to take a 
                look at it.

  Don s studying the papers.  He doesn t see --

  Charlie meet Alan s eyes.  Charlie gives his father a small 
  quick smile. 

  Alan realizes what Charlie s trying to do.

  Charlie turns back to Don.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                I d could work on this with you.

                              DON 
                Tire treads, paint and metal 
                evidence -- there s a lot here.

                              CHARLIE
                Got to be a way to narrow down a 
                suspect list.

                              DON
                Yeah, I think you re right --

  Don and Charlie bend over the papers, talking intently.

  Alan s watching, concern etched on his face.
