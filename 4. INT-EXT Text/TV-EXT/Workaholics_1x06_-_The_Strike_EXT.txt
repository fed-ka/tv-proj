      see the guys in Christmas sweaters, scarves, earmuffs, etc.  
      A MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in shorts and a tee shirt opens the 
      door.

                    Are you drunk?  Why are you singing 
                    Christmas carols in the middle of 
                    July?

      ALICE is at her desk on the PHONE.  The guys, still bundled 
      up in Christmas garb, give a slight knock on the open door 
      and come in.

                    Alice, since we are your top

                    year with no time off or any

                    Which we don t even mind because we 
                    love working for such a multi-

                    But we were wondering if we could 
                    get a couple of days off to 
                    celebrate Half Christmas.  A 
                    tradition in the Holmson-DeMamp-

                    It started in July four years ago 
                    when Blake here went out to buy a 
                    keg, but returned with a keg full 
                    of eggnog.  It s become a super 
                    deeply religious tradition.

                                  BLAKE
                    The eggnog was on sale.  Probably 
                    because it d been there since 
                      Christmas.

                                  ADAM

                    What kind of work do you do?

                    We re tele-marketers.

      Her smile quickly turns to a SCOWL.

                    You fucking cocksuckers!  I m on 
                    the fucking Do Not Call List, but 
                    you faggots keep fucking calling 
                    me!  Fuck you and your fucking 
                    religion.  

      She SPEEDS OFF tossing a PLASTIC BAG out her sunroof at the 
      guys.  The bag skids past them splattering DOG SHIT.

                    I may not agree with her actions, 
                    but the lady does have some hard

      Anders has come out to talk to Adam and Blake, still in 
        strike/party mode. 

                                  ANDERS
                    Alright guys.  I got some bad news. 

      Adam does a SPIT TAKE with kegnog. 

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    Dude, I didn t even tell you what 
                    the news is.

                                  ADAM
                    That s my new strike thing.  It s 
                      hilarious.  S go again.

                    You ve been replaced by two massive 
                    choads.

      Adam ACTUALLY CHOKES a little on his kegnog this time.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    But listen, come back inside and 
                    just beg Alice for your jobs back.

                                  BLAKE
                    How could she replace us?  We re 
                    only striking!

                                  ANDERS
                    Well, she s for real and you re

                    Geniuses, I m trying to help you

                    You want to be unemployed?  Fine.  
                    Blake, I don t wanna hear about it 
                    when you can t pay rent or run out 
                    of beer money.  And Adam, don t 
                    come crawling into my bed the next 
                    time you have a night terror.

                                  ADAM
                    It was worse than a night terror, 
                    it was a sleepmare!  I was blowing 
                    Nic Cage, but it was weird because 
                    Nic Cage looked like my dad!

                                  BLAKE
                    So you weren t just blowing your

                    No, Blake, my dad s not gay.  
                    Anyshoot, Ders is a real bonehead, 
                    but he might just be right.  We are 
                    not striking hard enough.

                    Lemme clear things up.  The strike

                    Adam, I ve got this.  We just want

                    Well, we have not contacted him as

                                  BLAKE
                    Sorry, Ders.  Trix are for kids... 
                    and union workers.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah.  Maybe you should stop and 
                    get some food at  Traitor Joe s. 

      Anders stares daggers.  Blake and Adam hi-five.


      Adam and Blake get out, and immediately stand right in front 
      of Ders  car.  Other strikers from the office join behind 
      them.  SOME are wearing Christmas clothing.

                                      ADAM/BLAKE/EVERYONE
                    Scab!  Scab!  Scab!

                                  BLAKE
                    Turn your vehicle around, sir!

                                  ADAM
                    Don t let this commie bastard cross 
                    this picket line!

      The crowd descends on Ders  car, chanting at him.  He s 
      forced to get out and make it on foot.

      BLAM!  He gets nailed in the back with white liquid.  REVEAL 
      Adam pumping kegnog frantically to be thrown at Ders.

      Ders runs for the door, but soon everyone is throwing kegnog 
      at him.  He shouts back to Blake and Adam.

                                  ANDERS
                    You proud of yourselves?  Filthy 
                    animals!

                                  BLAKE
                    I wish we didn t have to do this 
                    Ders!  It breaks my heart.  On Half 
                    Christmas Eve, of all days. 
                          (then)
                    FIRE IN THE HOLE!

      Blake whips another cup of kegnog at Ders, who just barely 
      ducks inside.


      Ders hands Adam and Blake some envelopes.

                                  BLAKE
                    So this is how you re going to play 
                    it, huh?

                                  ANDERS
                    What did you expect would happen?

      Adam opens the envelope. 

                                  ADAM
                    Guess we know what kind of friend 
                    you are. 

                                  ANDERS
                    Guess so.

      As Ders walks away.

                                  BLAKE
                    Thanks a lot!


      REVEAL Karl on the roof, dumping ashes from the grill onto 
      the cars below.  Then he hoists up the still frozen TURKEY.

                                  KARL
                    FUCKING SCABS!!!

      Karl chucks it and it lands on a car.  The alarm SOUNDS.

      ... and THE LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y BOOK closes shut.
