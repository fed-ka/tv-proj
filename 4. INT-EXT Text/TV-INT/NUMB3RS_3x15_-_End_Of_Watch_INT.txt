                just because we found a badge 
                doesn t mean there even is a body.

                Look for abnormal erosion in the

                  Apparently a driving range he 
                worked on has become an eyesore, 
                  literally.

  Off Millie --


  Liz reads a file to David.

                              LIZ
                  Preliminary Coroner s investigation 
                indicates Everett had a single 
                gunshot wound to the head.  
                Fracturing indicates it was 
                probably at close range.

                              DAVID
                So this was an execution.

  As Walker and Don enter.  Photos of Everett and Bradley up.

                                WALKER
                Which is exactly what I ve been 
                telling you people from the get-go.

  Don sees Liz there.  They exchange a look.

                                WALKER (CONT D)
                Calvin Bradley somehow got hands on 
                  Everett...
                      (turns to 1990 photo)
                ... Walked him to the construction 
                site and put one in his dome.  Then 
                dumped the body in a ditch and 
                waited for a construction crew to 
                seal his tomb.

                              LIZ
                Maybe.  But can you prove it?

                                WALKER
                I ll get Bradley to do that for me.

                What makes you think he ll give us 
                  a statement now?

                                WALKER
                1990, I didn t have a body.  
                Bradley knew that.  Now I do.   


  Don is getting a cup of coffee.  Liz enters.

                              LIZ
                Walker s got Bradley tried and 
                  convicted.

                              DON
                Yeah.

  A beat.

                              LIZ
                So what s going on, everything 
                okay? 

                              DON
                I don t want to really talk about 
                it.

                              LIZ
                  I understand.  
                      (then)
                Maybe talking s not what I had in 
                mind.

  Don smiles.

                              DON
                This sexual harassment?

                              LIZ
                Uh-huh.

  An ND FBI Agent enters...  Without missing a beat.

                              LIZ (CONT D)
                So I ll have OSS pull any 
                  additional files on Bradley.

                              DON
                Yeah, do that.

  She walks away...  Behind the ND Agent s back, puts her

  -- David and Liz race inside...

                              DAVID
                FBI...

  But they re a step behind Walker.  They find Bradley sitting 
  at his computer.

                What the hell s going on?

                                WALKER
                      (yanks him up)
                Long time Calvin, get your ass up.

                              BRADLEY
                You have a warrant?

                              DAVIDSON
                Yeah, here s our warrant.

  And Davidson face plants Bradley on the desk.

                                WALKER
                Been a while but somehow I think 
                you know what this is about.  

  Davidson speed cuffs him, hard -- Bradley wiggles...

                              DAVIDSON
                Ain t payback a bitch?


  Don and David interrogate Calvin Bradley.  

                              BRADLEY
                You see me here with no lawyer  
                because I have nothing to hide.

                              DON
                You got that wrong, Calvin.  I 
                think you have plenty to hide...

                              BRADLEY
                  Seventeen years, nothing changes.  
                And you people wonder why we don t 
                want to help the cops.

  Don then slaps a photo of Everett s body/grave on the table.

                              DAVID
                We found him.

  Bradley looks up at David and Don.

                              DON
                You know who that is, right?  
                That s Officer Everett.

                              DON
                And disappeared two weeks later.

                              BRADLEY
                I have nothing to do with this.

                              DAVID
                We have statements from witnesses 
                saying you threatened Everett s 
                life.

                              BRADLEY
                I was young.  I was a hot head.  I 
                said some things I didn t mean.

                              DON
                His car was found less than a block 
                from where you lived --

                              DAVID
                ... You ve spent more time in a law 
                library than we have, Calvin.  So 
                you know that car gives you 
                  opportunity and that your brother s 
                death gives you motive. 

                              BRADLEY
                My little brother was shot down 
                like a dog.  Police didn t 
                  investigate.  You guys didn t care. 

                              DON
                C mon.  Your brother was a drug 
                dealer.  He ran with one of the 
                most violent gangs in the City. 

                              BRADLEY
                You make it sound like Stephon had 
                  a choice.  Like any of us did.  
                      (a beat)
                Young man had only one choice: to 
                live or die.

                              DAVID
                Is that what you told Everett when 
                you pulled the trigger?

  Door starts to open, Walker with a head of steam...Don blocks 
  his path and pushes him back out --


  Don, David with Walker, furious paces back and forth. 

                              DON
                Hold it...

                He wants to desecrate the memory of 
                one of my men.  Lemme get a piece

                              DON
                Can t do it.

                  I understand how you feel, but it s 
                not gonna happen.

                                WALKER
                Before Everett disappeared he was 
                worried about retribution.  He d  
                heard things on the street.

                I ve been running it down for 17 
                years.  Now the man who killed him

                Stephon Bradley.

                Bradley.

                              LEIGH
                That s his way of saying he was 
                upset.  Case you didn t notice, 
                 Lt. Walker  doesn t express 
                himself very well.  Emotionally, I 
                mean.

  Megan smiles.

                Truth is, the shooting changed my

                No.  He wouldn t do that...  Leave 
                us, leave his son.

                I m sorry to put you through this. 
                We just need to be sure. 

  Off Leigh --


  Charlie and Amita input data.  Box of LAPD files spread out.  
  A gang map of Los Angeles is on Charlie s laptop (AV cart).

                              AMITA
                Amazing.  In 1977, fewer than five 
                hundred people were murdered in 
                L.A.  By 1985 the number doubled.

                              CHARLIE
                There must be a causal explanation 
                for these statistics.

                It was the introduction of mass 
                drug sales by the gangs.  Fights 
                over street corners... territories 
                shifting led to more killings.
                      (feels his eyes)
                What?

                              CHARLIE

                I can t believe she told you.

                              CHARLIE
                She assumed I already knew, which -- 
                I gotta be honest -- should have 
                been a pretty safe assumption.  Why 
                didn t you tell me?

                              AMITA
                  I thought you d be disappointed.

                There s a lot of heavy hitters to 
                deal with.  It can be pretty 
                  intimidating, maybe not for you --

                Tell me about it.

                              MEGAN
                All I can really say is that  
                Walker was right about one thing.  
                Stephon Bradley s shooting was on 
                  Everett s mind before he died.

  Before they can go any further...Walker charges for them, 

                                WALKER
                Suicide?  You told Everett s wife 
                that he killed himself?

                              MEGAN
                I never said that.

                whoever we think needs to be talked 
                to.  Now I understand how you feel--

                              WALKER
                You don t understand anything.  You 
                have no idea what it was like back 
                then.  It was a war.  Cops died 
                trying to take back our streets.  
                One of them was Everett.

                              DAVID
                Did you know Officer Everett was 
                killed with his own gun? 

                                WALKER
                What?

                              DON
                  Ballistics matched the bullet in 
                his skull to the same weapon he 
                used to kill Stephon Bradley.

  Walker takes only seconds to absorb, then defends,

                                WALKER
                So Calvin Bradley got Everett s 
                gun, then used it to kill him.  So 
                what?
                      (off group)
                His body was buried.  Remember?

                Like I said, construction crew 
                could have buried a body and never 
                even known it.

                              WALKER
                What?  Are you writing Calvin 
                Bradley s closing argument?

                The gang case last year...  my 
                guiding principle was their

                      (then)
                In my file notes, there were gang 
                members who spent their life living 
                in a ten block radius, their turf.

  RESUME SCENE

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                Same thing with gangs.  Calvin 
                Bradley was a member of the Bixel 
                Street Family,
                      (points)
                This is the area they controlled in 
                1990.  
                      (then)
                  Everett s body was found here.  In 
                an area controlled by a gang named 
                the 18 Street Mexicali.

                                WALKER
                18 Street Mexicali s and BSF were 
                rivals.

                              CHARLIE 
                Correct.  So factoring in 
                  territorial gang shifts, I couldn t 
                find a single safe passage --

  Over gang map a series of red lines from BSF area to 18 
  Street Mexicali.

                              DON
                -- for Calvin Bradley to have 
                traveled from his gang s turf to  
                the rival gang s turf in order to 
                murder Officer Everett.

                Well, for one thing, they re not

                If Everett was killed in their 
                  territory, someone in 18 Street 
                Mexicali knew about it.  Maybe even 
                did it.

                              WALKER 
                We had a snitch inside, Jimmy 
                Lopez.  He was hop head, but gave

                You can kill a man without ever

                              LOPEZ
                No offense but when it came to 
                killing cops, gang-bangers can find 
                pretty common ground.

                found, 18 Street Mexicali

  BURN IN:  Don and David talk.

                              DAVID
                If Charlie s right, Everett was 
                heading to IA and was killed before 
                he got there.

                              DON
                No way that s just a coincidence.  

                              DAVID
                Okay, so why s he going to IA?

                              DON
                Everett pulled the trigger in the 
                Stephon Bradley shooting, right?  

                              DAVID
                But a shooting board called it a 
                good kill.

  They move into the War Room --

  events with Megan and Liz.

                              DON
                Why?

                              WALKER
                Because three days before Everett 
                shot Stephon Bradley he was picked 
                up by Homicide.  They wanted him 
                for a series of murders.

                against dirty cops.

                If he was, and Bradley was about to 
                rat him out, Everett would have 
                motive to kill him.

                found him at his girlfriend s 
                house.  Everett covered the back, 
                Bradley tried to bolt...  Everett

                I don t understand, Lopez was clean 
                for years. 

                              MEGAN
                Maybe the pressure of being 
                  questioned by you guys pushed him 
                over the edge...

  Walker examines photos.  CU of Lopez s arm.

                  Toxicology report shows a mixture 
                of heroin, strychnine, and powdered 
                milk.

                Nice little cocktail.

  David continues to stare at the report.

                              MEGAN
                What?  

                              DAVID
                I was just thinking, drug dealers 
                tend to be consistent in the way 
                they cut their drugs.

                              WALKER
                You re right.  It s a signature -- 
                a brand.  Helps them sell it on the 
                street.

                              DAVID
                So maybe we give the tox report on 
                Lopez s O.D. to Charlie...

                He can compare the drugs that 
                killed Lopez to other O.D. s in the 
                  Coroner s database.

  Charlie stops short.  A thought registering...

                Yeah well Millie says you can learn

                              CHARLIE
                There were no matches to current
