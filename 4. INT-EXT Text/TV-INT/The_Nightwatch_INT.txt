      Kay turns from the window, sips at the tea, looks at the 
      room - the radio is on  The U.S. Secretary of State, George 
      C. Marshall today outlined an economic recovery plan for 
      Europe  -

      The place seems unloved, packing cases stacked in a corner - 
      not so much a home as an anonymous sanctuary - 



      - A threadbare waiting room.  Mismatched sofa and chairs, 
      outdated READERS DIGESTS. SEVERAL PEOPLE sit waiting.  A 
      YOUNG MAN in a DE-MOB suit with only one arm; ANOTHER, 
      pallid and haunted, smoking a ROLL UP. A COIFFURED WOMAN - 
      thirties - sliding them dismayed looks.

      A GIRL behind a desk.  VIV - 27 years old, a splash of red 
      lipstick, matching nails. Her somewhat pin-up appearance 
      masks an inner disappointment she can t yet acknowledge.

                                  BRYANT (O.S.)
                    Too flighty. I had a belly full 
                    of that with the last girl -



      A lack lustre room, shelves of FILES alphabetically marked, 
       MALE A - H.   FEMALE H - M . HELEN sits behind the desk - 
      25 years old.  Her blonde English Rose beauty masks a 
      gnawing uncertainty about her - a girl who is still work in 
      progress. A MAN sits opposite her - de-mob suit and 
      Brylcreem hair.  His name is BRYANT. He is leafing through 
      details of potential DATES and their PHOTOGRAPHS.

                                  HELEN
                    Try to keep an open mind, Mr. 
                    Bryant.

                                  BRYANT
                    Open wallet you mean.  Remember 
                    that WAAF you fixed me up with? 
                    Whenever we passed a jewellers 
                    shop she just happened to turn 
                    her ankle.

      Helen constrains impatience, brings out another PICTURE -

                                  HELEN
                    New in last week.  Enjoys 
                      dressmaking, walking and -

                                  BYRANT
                    - No-one in spectacles.  No 
                    visible defects, I said. 

      Helen s face -

                                  HELEN (O.S.)
                    It s like he thinks finding the 
                    perfect woman is his reward for 
                    doing his bit in the war -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       3.



      A FIRE-ESCAPE GANTRY outside the office window - Viv and 
      Helen sit dangling stockinged feet, sharing a cigarette.  

                                  VIV
                    What about our Forest Hill lady?

                                  HELEN
                    He s after someone younger. 

                                  VIV
                    Aren t they all?
                          (then)
                    I had one this morning. Ex-RAF, 
                    married the girl next door, comes 
                    home to a peroxide blonde chasing 
                    anything in trousers.

                                  HELEN
                    War changes people. Not always 
                    for the better.

      She says it like a statement of fact. A reflective silence 
      now: the sound of banging and reconstruction beyond-

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    What is it they re building over 
                    there anyway?

                                  VIV
                    More shops I think. Or offices.

                                  HELEN
                    ...You know what I wanted to be 
                    before the war? A stable girl! 
                    Can you believe it? Ever since I 
                    was a kid, it s all I wanted to 
                    do.  I had an imaginary horse 
                    called Fleet - I used to trot up 
                    and down the road making clippety 
                    clop noises. 
                          (then)
                    God knows what Freud would make 
                    of it.

      They laugh: Helen stubs out her cigarette.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Our two oclock will be along.  
                    Better see if we ve got anyone 
                    suitable.

      She s about to climb back through the window - 

                                  VIV
                    FOREVER AMBER is on at the Odeon.  
                    We should go one evening.  
                                  (MORE)                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       4.

                                  VIV (CONT'D)
                    I ll bring my brother, he could 
                    do with a night out. 
                          (then)
                    - And you can bring your chap. 
                    About time I got to meet him.

      A flicker in Helen s face - quickly camouflaged.

                                  HELEN
                    Sounds like fun.

      She swiftly clambers through the window.  Viv sits a 
      moment, cigarette in hand.   O.S. the sound of a wolf 
      whistle  Need some company up there, love?  

      Viv, smiling, momentarily gratified: but the moment passes - 
      her smile fades - a strangely haunted look replaces it.



      A WOMAN hammers at a TYPEWRITER, cigarette in mouth, myopic 
      focus there. 31 years old, an artisan Lauren Bacall look to 
      her. This is JULIA. The TELEPHONE rings, she picks up.  

                                  JULIA (INTO PHONE)
                    Yep?

      - Helen in her office - her manner falsely bright.

                                  HELEN (INTO PHONE)
                    Did you kill off Mrs. Rattigan 
                    yet?

                                  JULIA (INTO PHONE)
                    I opted for Nurse Malone instead.

                                  HELEN (INTO PHONE)
                    ...It must feel - what s that 
                    word - omnipotent?  Killing 
                    someone on a whim that way.

      Her eager tone makes her wince: Julia also.

                                  JULIA (INTO PHONE)
                    - The Radio Times are running a 
                    piece about my broadcast this 
                    week.  Can you pick up a copy on 
                    your way home?

                                  HELEN (INTO PHONE)
                    Of course. 

        A constraint in her suddenly - like a coiled spring.

                                  JULIA (INTO PHONE)
                    I should get on. ...Was there 
                    something you -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       5.


                                  HELEN (INTO PHONE)
                    - Just wanted to hear the sound 
                    of your voice.
                          (then)
                    As ever.

      She disconnects.  Julia s face - a thread of disquiet 
      there. She resumes typing -



      Locks of hair, dropping onto a mosaic carpet - beyond, dark 
      furniture, flock wall paper, GAS LAMPS exuding flickering 
      fish tail flames, memorabilia of George V1 - 

                                  VIV
                    Sit still, I ll have your ear 
                    off.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Bossy boots.

      Her brother sits in a chair, (aged 23) a tea cloth over his 
      shoulder while she cuts his hair. Deceptively boyish, a 
      sweet nature often tormented by disconcerting desires.  
      Myriad CLOCKS start to CHIME one after another.

                                  VIV
                    Don t they drive you mad? 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Barely notice them now.

      The door opens, MR. MUNDY shuffles in bearing a plate of 
      SANDWICHES.  Late sixties, hollow features, thinning hair, 
      a shrewd perspicacity to him.  

                                  MUNDY
                    Thought we d treat ourselves to 
                    tea in the parlour this time.  
                          (to Vivian)
                    Fish paste alright, dear?

      She smiles weakly: he gives her the creeps. He exits. 

                                  VIV
                    Helen and I are talking about 
                    going to the cinema one night.  
                    ...Helen from work?  You should 
                    come along. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    This isn t you trying to match 
                    make I hope?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       6.


                                  VIV
                    She s already got a chap.  We can 
                    have a bite after. Do you good to 
                    have some fun for once. 

      He doesn t respond. She snips on a moment.

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    You re done.

      He crosses to a mirror to check the cut. She watches him.

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    You belong at home with Dad and 
                    me, Duncan.  Not in this 
                      ...museum.

      He meets her eyes in the mirror.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you think if we keep having 
                    this conversation, it will come 
                    out the way you want?

                                  VIV
                    Can you not even visit? Show your 
                    face once in a -

                                  DUNCAN
                    - I can t go back to that house!  
                    You bloody know why!  

      This is laced in panic.  A thumping at the door breaks the 
      moment.  Duncan opens it.  Mundy enters with a tea tray.

                                  MUNDY
                          (to Viv)
                    Mats and cosy, Duncan?

      He sets down the tray. Duncan crosses to a SIDEBOARD. He 
      pulls out two TEA COSIES, one shaped like A CAT the other A 
      THATCHED COTTAGE. He displays them -

                                  DUNCAN
                    Cat or cottage?

                                  MUNDY
                    The cat, why not?

      Viv, watching their interaction: it s hard to decipher her 
      expression.  They sit at the table: Mundy reaches out a 
      hand, Duncan grasps it.  Viv, a stab of disquiet - Duncan 
      reaches for her hand, she realizes it s to say Grace.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       7.


                                  MUNDY (CONT D)
                    We thank for you the gift of the 
                    food, Oh Lord and we will keep in 
                    mind that lust and covertness are 
                    powerless in the face of your 
                      forgiveness.  Amen.
                          (then)
                    Shall I be mother?



      Darkness - a key in the door.  Kay enters, snaps on a 
      light. She drops something on the table - THE RADIO TIMES -



      Julia, reading THE RADIO TIMES in the bath - sauna-like 
      heat, tiles trickling with condensation. She and Helen are 
      at opposites ends.  Julia smokes a cigarette as she reads -

      Helen lies watching her. Her gaze drifts down at their 
      legs, entwined under the water.

                                  HELEN
                    ...Our legs are all mixed up. You 
                    can t tell which belongs to who.

      Julia, intent on reading.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Can I see?

      Julia passes the RADIO TIMES - Helen studies the PICTURE of 
      her in it - 

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    You look so glamorous.  

                                  JULIA
                    You re biased.

                                  HELEN
                    So I should hope.  

      She reaches for the soap - leans to massage Julia s breasts 
      until they are covered in a froth of lather.  Julia, 
      arching in pleasure - Helen soaps her under her arms - 
      works down to massage her hands - finger by finger -

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Do you think it s wrong, being so 
                    happy when there s been so much 
                    suffering in the world?  

                                  JULIA
                    All the more reason not squander 
                    it.

        A sensitized beat.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       9.


                                  HELEN
                    Do you think I do squander it?

      Julia meets her eyes.

                                  JULIA
                    I think you feel you ve forfeited 
                    the right to be happy, to atone 
                    for past sins. 

      Helen, this impacts. She opts for mischief to deflect: 
      flicks water at her. 

                                  HELEN
                    How about present sins?

      She knows Julia finds such girlish antics irresistible.  A 
      brief tussle ensues -

                                  JULIA
                    Stop!  Behave!

                                  HELEN
                    Not until you say it. You know 
                    I ll make you eventually. 

                                  JULIA
                      I concede!  ...I love you. 

                                  HELEN
                    You better.

      Her lips hungrily seek Julia s -



      - Sunlight splintering through trees - Viv gazing up at 
      them as Reggie s sports car races down country roads - 

      She s striking in a floral cotton dress, a silk scarf tied 
      beneath her chin. He puts his hand on her knee, slides it 
      up her thigh.  She playfully slaps it away, gazes back up 
      at the awning of trees overhead -



      Reggie s car, halted at lights.  He, his composure 
      restored. He glances at Viv -

                                  REGGIE
                    Prezzie for you ...

      He gestures to the glove box. She takes out a TIN OF 
      PEACHES.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Peaches for a peach.

      She musters a smile. The lights change. Reggie is about to 
      pull off when A FIGURE strides into the road ahead.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oy, watch it, Mister!

      The FIGURE glances towards the car - it s Kay.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oops.  Miss I should say.

      Viv, skewing to look back at Kay as they drive off -

                                  VIV
                    Stop the car!  ...Stop!

      He brakes in alarm. She scrabbles for the door handle -

                                  REGGIE
                    What is it?

                                  VIV
                    I know her!  I m sure I do!

      She s out of it, doubling back after Kay -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       14.



      A canopy of shadow. Viv, mounting the stairs of a modest 
      semi detached.  The door to her father s bedroom is ajar.  

      She looks within: he s in bed asleep, mouth agape, snoring.



      The tinkle of A MUSIC BOX as Viv opens it - her bedroom 
      more that of a teenager: chintz and soft toys, posters of 
      ELIZABETH TAYLOR and CARY GRANT.  

      - She pulls folded tissue paper from THE MUSIC BOX.  A ring 
      shaped like a SERPENT is inside it.  She slides it onto her 
      finger, rotates it so it looks like a wedding band  - meets 
      her mascara streaked eyes in the mirror -



      Falling light - an EDWARDIAN BUILDING split into flats.

      A WOMAN walks approaches - early thirties, a tumble of red 
      hair: once a head turner but an unkempt abstraction about 
      her now. This is NANCY.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       15.


      She s about to mount the steps to the FLATS - halts.  A 
      FIGURE sits there - it s Kay - Nancy halts in recognition - 

                                  NANCY
                    Glory be. Finally.

                                  KAY
                    ...Better late than never.

      A beat.

                                  NANCY
                    Two years late.  I swore, if you 
                    ignored my last letter, it would 
                    be the last I d send.  I d give 
                    you up as a lost cause.

      She steps forward, opens her arms -

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Tardy bitch.

      Kay concedes to the embrace - she is unused to human 
      contact - but cannot help reciprocating -



      - Chaotic clutter: dead fire in the grate, dying flowers - 
      where was once there was elegance is now a debris of OLD 
      PAPERS, BOOKS, MAGAZINES, discarded piles of CLOTHES lying 
      where they were dropped. Kay, her gaze drifting over it 
      all, then resting on A CARDBOARD BOX in a corner, a stack 
      of EMPTY LIQUOR BOTTLES in it. 

      Nancy is preparing GIN and TONICS. She s an expert: it s 
      her choice of a velvet anaesthetic. 

                                  NANCY
                    Remember those lethal Gin Slings 
                    Lauren used to make?  After two 
                    shots you could barely see 
                    straight.  Happy days, eh?

      Kay s gaze drifts to a PHOTOGRAPH of a young RAF AIRMAN, 
      then over to a box stacked with empty GIN BOTTLES. 

      Nancy carries the drinks over. 

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Chin, chin.

      Kay mutely toasts her.  Her hand holding the glass is 
      shaking.  Nancy catches this - their eyes meet.

                                  KAY
                    I look like hell, I know.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       16.


      Nancy wisely makes no comment on this.

                                  NANCY
                    ...So spill.  What s been going

                                  KAY
                    Not much.

      Nancy waits for more..

                    - I got left some money - my aunt

                    lady of leisure.  Until the well 
                    runs dry anyway.

                                  NANCY
                    You didn t fancy running the shop 
                    yourself?

      Kay wordlessly dissents -

                                  KAY
                    Anywhere. Wherever.

      She rises, ambles round the room: Nancy watches her, trying 
      to fathom the change in her. THE RADIO TIMES is among the 
      debris.  Kay flips it open, THE PICTURE of JULIA is there.

                                  KAY  (CONT D)
                    Did you hear it? An interview on 
                    the Home Service on her latest 
                    book.

      Nancy dissents, watching her, gin in hand, letting this 
      play out.  Kay picks up a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH - she and Nancy 
      in AMBULANCE AUXILIARY uniforms - youthful and laughing - 
      sisters in arms -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    My God, look at us!  ...Look at

      She studies PHOTOGRAPH more closely -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       17.


                                  NANCY
                    You were the bravest person I 
                    knew. 

      The simplicity of this disquiets Kay.

                                  KAY
                    I think now it s easy to be brave 
                    in war time.  

      A moment before she speaks again -

                    back to that night.  I try to

                    matter - but I always end up back

                    You dare run out on me now.

      She rises, takes Kay s gin -

                    You re human, Kay, join the

                    Not enough Gin is the problem.  
                    Must be losing my touch.

      She goes to replenish it.  Kay s gaze once more rests on 
      the PHOTOGRAPH of she and Nancy in uniform, laughing into 
      camera - 

      Bygone days.



      The familiar yellow door of the INTRODUCTION AGENCY.

      Fraser enters the WAITING ROOM.  Viv glances at him,

      He meets her eyes, goes.  She, disquiet escalating.



      Oil cloth table cloths, Bentwood chairs. A doting HUSBAND 
      and WIFE at a table, spoon feeding A BABY.

      Viv, nearby watching.  The sight compels her. Fraser joins 
      her with two TEAS.   He sees the ring on her finger.

                                  VIV
                    ...Maybe he went to Mundy s 
                    because he had nowhere else to 
                    go. He couldn t come home.  Never 
                    return to the scene of the crime  
                    - isn t that what you cons say?

                    Why are you so angry?

      She can t answer this. She just sits, twisting the ring.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    It can t be what you want,  
                    seeing him working in that dump 
                    of a hotel, living with Mundy in 
                    that peculiar way?

      She s still wary of his motives: he senses this.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Sharing a cell like we did...    
                    The truth is I wasn t always as 
                    kind to him as I should have 
                    been.  
                          (then)
                    I want to do right by him now if 
                    I can.  I need to do that.

      She, conflicted again: he senses this.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    ...I used to watch you, in that 
                    visiting room.  When you walked 
                    in, it was like in the Wizard of 
                    Oz - you know - when it suddenly 
                    goes from black and white into 
                      Technicolour?

                    Just for a few minutes, things 
                    didn t seem so utterly bloody 
                    bleak.   

      A charged look between them suddenly.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       25.

                    I d like to call you sometime. 
                    May I?

      She, confliction there again. He senses this then 
      realization dawns -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    There s someone else, of course. 

      He picks up her hand, looks at the RING.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    As if I d ever get that lucky.

      He kisses her hand: their eyes lock again.  He goes. She, 
        unexpectedly bereft, looking at the RING again -



      - The dank bowels of the PEDESTRIAN SUBWAY - Viv walking 
      through it. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE walks a distance ahead -  

      Viv, recognition dawning -- she hastens her pace -

                                  VIV
                    ...Hello?  Wait - please!

      The FIGURE rounds a corner and is lost to her -



      The table, set for dinner.  Helen sitting there, smoking a 
      cigarette, muted agitation there, foot jiggling. TWENTY 
      QUESTIONS is playing on the radio -

      She looks over at the clock: 9:15pm.  She crosses to the 
      OVEN, pulls out a SHEPHERDS PIE. It s hotter than she 
      thought, it scalds one of her hands.  She plunges it under 
      the tap.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       27.



      Helen mooches in, crosses to Julia s desk, her injured hand 
      wrapped in a dish cloth.  An ASHTRAY laden with dog ends on 
      the desk.  Helen extracts one - Julia s lipstick is on it.  
      She raises it, wipes the lipstick over her lips, savouring 
      the taste of Julia on it.

      She catches sight of JULIA S DIARY - reaches for it - opens 
      it on the current date.  The word URSULA is written there. 
      Her expression alters at the sight.  She is about to 
      replace the diary when she knocks over a MUG of coffee, 
      drenching the typed pages of Julia s book.

                                  HELEN
                    Oh no - please God no!

      She tugs off the dishcloth - frantically mops the stained 
      pages -



      Helen, now asleep on the sofa.  O.S. The sound of the front 
      door: footsteps.  A swish of a coat - Julia enters.  She 
      halts, looks down at Helen; it s hard to decipher her 
      expression.  Helen rouses, blinks awake.

                                  HELEN
                    ...There you are.  I waited 
                    supper for you.

      She rouses, sits up - 

                                  JULIA
                    I went to a concert.

      She crosses to her desk, sees the debris of COFFEE SOAKED 
      PAPERS there.  

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    ...What the hell s happened here?

                                  HELEN
                    It was an accident... I m so 
                    sorry. I ll retype it for you at 
                    the weekend, I will.   

      She watches helplessly as Julia uses blotting paper to 
      salvage the pages.

                                  JULIA
                    God, what a mess -

      Helen, culpability there - she deflects.

                                  HELEN
                    What was it - the concert?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       28.


      Julia - without looking up - continuing mopping the pages.

                                  JULIA
                    Mozart.

      Helen regards her a moment.

                                  HELEN
                          (flat)
                    You were with Ursula, weren t 
                    you?

      A fatigued beat from Julia.

                                  JULIA
                    Fine. It s her birthday, she had 
                    a dinner party, she asked me to 
                    help her with it. Satisfied?

                                  HELEN
                    Then why lie? 

                                  JULIA
                    ...I knew if I told you we d end 
                    up having the same tedious 
                      conversation we always do. 

      This stings Helen. 

                                  HELEN
                    You wonder why I get jealous. I m 
                    bound to, aren t I?  When you re 
                    so secretive and...

      Julia doesn t respond.  To Helen her silence is like a trip 
      wire into self loathing.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Don t you think I hate myself too 
                    when I get like this with you?  
                    Act like this?

                                  JULIA
                          (weary)
                    I don t hate you, Helen.  
                          (beat)
                    Though you seem intent on pushing 
                    me there.

      She exits - on Helen -



      Julia, collecting MILK from a fridge for a hot drink.  
      Helen enters. She watches Julia wistfully, yet infused with 
      antagonism which she doesn t fully understand.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       29.


                                  HELEN
                    ...I suppose there were others 
                    like her there.

                                  JULIA
                    You mean like us?  Yes, as a 
                    matter of fact.
                          (then)
                    As it happens she invited you 
                    too.  I told her you were 
                      unavailable.

      Helen s face -

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Because you still can t cope with 
                    being around queers, can you?  
                    You just can t deal with it.

                                  HELEN
                    That is not true!

                                  JULIA
                    So why is it I never meet your 
                    friends?  Or you never want to 
                    meet mine?

      Helen can t answer this.  Julia spoons COCOA into a mug -

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    When I do go out, do anything on 
                    my own - I have to come back to 
                    another of your inquisitions.  
                    Because apparently I m so bloody 
                      irresistible that even if a girl 
                    isn t a raving lesbian when she 
                    meets me, she will be by the time 
                    I ve got my hands on her.

                                  HELEN
                          (quiet)
                    You know why I do it. Because I m 
                    afraid you no longer love me.  
                          (then)
                    If you ever did. It wasn t just 
                    about revenge.

                                  JULIA
                          (anger spilling)
                    God, must it always come back to 
                    that?!

      She flings a TEA SPOON into the sink - gathers herself. 

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    ...We can t go on like this,  
                    Helen.  
                                  (MORE)                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       30.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Torturing each other, punishing 
                    each other over the past.

      Helen, laced in dread.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    You need to find a place of your 
                    own.  Sort out who you are, what 
                    it is you want.  

      She starts to go -  Helen grabs her hand -

                                  HELEN
                    It s you I want!  

      Dropping to her knees -

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Remember when we met?   You loved 
                    me then! I can be that person 
                    again - I can!  I want to be that 
                    person!

      Julia, reluctant compassion there now.  She gently pulls 
      Helen to her feet, exits.

      Helen sinks to the table, etched in self loathing.  A 
      CARVING KNIFE is there: volcanic despair engulfs her. She 
      snatches up the KNIFE, places her scalded hand flat on the 
      table, closes her eyes, plunges the knife straight down on 
      it in defiant nihilism.    

      She opens her eyes. The knife missed her hand, to cleave 
      into the table between her fingers.  



      More COCOA being into hot milk. Duncan, stirring it: 
      scrupulous precision in this -



      Flickering GAS-LIGHT: a symphony of ticking CLOCKS.  Mundy 
      at the table: he has disembowelled one of the clock, it s 
      mechanical intestines laid neatly on a newspaper as he 
      strives to repair it. His glasses give him a strange, fish 
      eyed look. Duncan enters with the hot chocolate. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    One sugar, just as you like it.

      He sets it down, turns to go.  

                                  MUNDY
                    Sit a minute?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       31.


      Duncan hesitates, complies.

                                  MUNDY (CONT D)
                    How was your day?

                                  DUNCAN
                    The usual.

                                  MUNDY
                      ...Nothing more from Fraser?

      Duncan dissents.

                                  MUNDY (CONT D)
                    We re better off without him lad.

      He hands over a YELLOW DUSTER -

                                  MUNDY (CONT D)
                    Dial needs a bit of clean if 
                    you ve a mind.  

      He means the CLOCK FACE - Duncan picks it up, rubs at it 
      with the duster.  He glances at Mundy, stooped over the 
      disembowelled CLOCK - screw driver in hand - 

      Duncan, as if time has stopped for him also -



      - The only illumination is naked light bulbs.  This is a 
      waiting area where the AMBULANCE CREW wait for orders.  
      Rows of camp beds against a wall, a cooking area, a 
      primitive PARAFFIN heater. Beyond an OFFICE with a RADIO 
      COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.  

      A GIRL kneels on the floor, fresh faced, early twenties.  
      This is O NEIL.  She s cutting a dress from a paper 
      pattern.   A driver, HUGHES, sits darning a sock.  Beyond 
      other CREW members reading, knitting or dozing.  

      Kay enters, see her properly now; a vibrant vitality there - 
      a far cry from the woman we saw before. She is wearing THE 
      SERPENT RING.  A WOMAN swings out of an OFFICE, clipboard 
      in hand - late thirties - a Teflon coated officer - BINKIE. 
      Kay halts beside her -

                                  KAY
                    ...Two walking wounded, one 
                    fatality, one still unaccounted 
                    for --

                                  NANCY
                    - Spent bloody hours digging 
                    around looking for him --

      Binkie logs this on her clipboard - returns to the OFFICE -

      Kay flops exhaustedly onto a camp bed - Nancy does the same 
      nearby.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       33.


                                  KAY
                    So much for a quiet night. I had 
                    in mind a couple of fractures, 
                    maybe a nice old lady with a 
                    broken ankle -

                                  HUGHES
                    A nice young lady you mean.

      Kay winks at Nancy, glances at the sock Hughes is mending.  

                                  KAY
                    Women s work, Harry.  People will 
                    talk.  

                                  HUGHES
                    You d know all about that.

                                  KAY
                          (unruffled)
                    Sticks and stones. I ve heard it 
                    all, lived to tell the tale. 

      O Neil, stooped over her pattern, a stab of embarrassment 
      there; an edgy undercurrent beneath their banter.

                                  HUGHES

                    He started it, Mummy.

      A sudden explosion nearby silences them.  A mist of dust 
      and plaster falls, cups and sauces rattle on shelves, the 
      light flickers. O.S a PHONE RINGING from the office beyond.  

                                  HUGHES
                    Here we go.  Stand by your beds.

      - BINKIE swings in from the OFFICE -  

                                  BINKIE
                    You re up, Hughes.   Brandon 
                    Place corner of Levington Street -

      Hughes and O Neil scramble for helmets and coats -  Kay 
      lights a cigarette, shakes her hair loose - lies back on 
      her bunk -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       34.


                                  BINKIE (CONT D)
                    Don t get too comfortable, 
                    Langrish. Night s not over yet.

      She bustles off. Kay, cigarette in hand - gazing up at the 
      naked light bulb above her - O.S. the echo of disembodied 
      voices -



        Institutionalized ambience - it s visiting time - Formica 
      tables, PRISONERS on one side, RELATIVES the other.   
      UNIFORMED GUARDS observing. Duncan is at a table, (aged 20) 
      Viv (aged 24) and his FATHER opposite.  An edgy tension 
      about Duncan, picking at the Formica, eyes cast down. See 
      Duncan s father properly: amiably decent.  His son 
      perplexes him; he tries too hard to disguise this.

      Fraser is beyond with his parents: awkward in Burberry and 
      tweeds: Fraser s gaze drifts speculatively over to Viv.   

                                  MR. PEARCE
                    I suppose you don t hear much of 
                    the bombs down in your shelter?

                                  DUNCAN
                    We re not allowed in the 
                    shelters. Only the guards are.  

      Pearce, disquieted: he catches sight of Fraser, deflects.

                                  MR. PEARCE
                    Your cell mate, isn t it? The one 
                    who was at university? -  
                          (to Viv)
                    You can tell just by looking at 
                    him he doesn t belong here.

      Duncan bridles at this:

                                  DUNCAN
                    Meaning I do?

                                  VIV
                    He didn t say that, Duncan.

      A strained hiatus: Viv can feel Fraser s gaze on her. 

                                  MR. PEARCE
                    I thought the chap at the end was 
                    due for release?

      He s looking at a tattooed MAN with his elderly mother. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    They re letting him out next 
                    week, to go into the army.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       35.


                                  MR. PEARCE
                    Good on him! 

                                  DUNCAN
                    So there s no shame in the army 
                    making you into a murderer? So 
                    long as it s for King and Country 
                    it s ok to have blood on your 
                    hands -

                                  VIV
                          (sotto)
                    - For heaven s sake, Duncan!

      Pearce, steely resentment there now.

                                  MR. PEARCE
                    You want to talk about shame?  
                    Wait until you re out of here and 
                    you can t walk down the street 
                    without people pointing at you, 
                      whispering about you and that boy-

                                  DUNCAN
                    - If you re so ashamed why bother 
                    coming to see me?

                                  MR. PEARCE
                          (simply)
                    You re my son.

      This impacts on Duncan, he stoops in sudden distress - 

                                  MR. PEARCE (CONT D)
                          (awkward)
                    No need for that. Be a man, eh?

      Duncan sits, head bowed.  Viv takes out a handkerchief, 
      passes it: her hand briefly grazing his in comfort -

      Fraser, catching this, his gaze resting on Viv again - she 
      seems to compel him.


      EXT TUBE STATION LONDON - EARLY EVE - 19444949

      PEOPLE arriving to take shelter from the bombs. Mostly 
      WOMEN, the ELDERLY and CHILDREN, carrying blankets, pillows 
      and cushions.   

      Viv and her father approach, halt outside the TUBE.  He, 
      drained with emotional exhaustion.  

                                  PEARCE
                    I suppose we should count our 
                      blessings. At least he s safer 
                    where he is than at the front -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       36.


                                  VIV
                    - Not that safe. Pentonville got 
                    hit by an incendiary bomb the 
                    other week, didn t it? 

      Pearce, disquieted again: 

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    I go this way, Dad.

      Pearce, puzzled -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    Dinner with Betty from work? I 
                    told you, remember?
                          (quickly)
                    - Don t wait up!

      She swiftly kisses him, goes.  He stands disconsolately, 
      heads into the TUBE.



      Dank floral wallpaper. A single bed, a threadbare 
      eiderdown, a wardrobe, a hand basin in the corner.  

      The sound of a key in the door: Viv enters.  She stands, 
      regarding the room, it wasn t what she was expecting -



      A dimly lit bar, a few tables, a scattering of GUESTS. The 
      shimmer of optic lights from the bar. 

      Viv, now in a devastating silk LILAC dress, coiffured and 
      made up, at a table keeping a tense eye on the door, 
      reading A NEWSPAPER - the headline  ALLIES LAND AT ANZIO  

      Reggie enters, heart stoppingly handsome in his ARMY 
      UNIFORM.  He crosses, orders a GIN and TONIC. A moment 
      later he eases into a table near Viv.  

                                  REGGIE
                    Evening.

      He tugs out his CIGARETTE CASE, proffers it.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       37.


                                  VIV
                    I don t, thank you.

                                  REGGIE
                    Mind if I do?

      She dissents, reverts to her paper.  He glances round the 
      bar, puffs on his cigarette: his gaze returns to her. 

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Let s hope we get a break 
                    tonight, eh?

      She looks at him.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    No air raids.

      She nods.  She discards the paper, picks up her bag.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                      ...Something I said?

                                  VIV
                    I have an appointment.

                                  REGGIE
                    Lucky chap.

      She briefly meets his eyes.

                                  VIV
                    Good night.

      She starts to go - she left her ROOM KEY on the table.  

                                  REGGIE
                    Oh Miss?

      He holds out the key.   Their eyes briefly engage again.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    My lucky number.

      She takes the key, goes.  Reggie scans the bar again, 
      reaches for her discarded newspaper.



      Viv, pacing agitatedly. She halts to check the seams of her 
      stockings. There s a knock at the door. She composes 
      herself, opens it.  Reggie darts inside.

                                  REGGIE
                    Bloody chamber maid s on the 
                    prowl - had to play hide and seek 
                    to avoid her -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       38.


      He tugs her to him, starts to nuzzle and kiss her.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oh my glorious girl -

                                  VIV
                          (a smile)
                    -  It s my lucky number.   You 
                    always have to spice it up, don t 
                    you?

      He wrenches off his jacket - glances around the room -

                                  REGGIE
                    Jesus, what a dump! I should have 
                    come ahead, checked it out - I 
                    just thought it would be a change 
                    from our Paddington one - 

      He takes out a WHISKEY FLASK, collects a TOOTH GLASS from 
      the basin, slops some in -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    After the war when I m on a 
                    decent wage again - it ll be the 
                    Ritz all the way for us!  You 
                    wait and see -

                                  VIV
                    All that counts is we re 
                    together, nothing else matters.

      He meets her eyes, unable to believe his good fortune -

                                  REGGIE
                    - Oh I have something for you! 
                    Not much but -

      He opens a folded handkerchief, inside is a wilting bunch 
      of DAISIES.  

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    They grow in the woods by the 
                    base.  Every time I see them they 
                    remind me of you.  So unspoilt. 
                      Beautiful.

      He takes A DAISY, puts it in her hair.  

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    I m a dead man when I m not with 
                    you, my darling -

      This touches a chord in her.  He guides her to the bed, 
      begins to undress her - the bed starts noisily creaking 
      beneath them - muffled guffaws from next door can be heard -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       39.


                                  MALE GUEST (O.S.)
                    Room for another in there!

                                  REGGIE
                    Ignore it.

      He s devouring her with his lips now - the bed continues to 
      creak under them.  Mock sounds of a climactic orgasm from 
      the next room.  Aaahh - aaaahh! 

      Viv, tensing at the sound of it. 

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Bloody hell!

      He thumps on the wall.  An idea strikes Viv, she pulls the 
      eiderdown from the bed, lays it on the floor.  She kneels 
      on it, her hand outstretched to Reggie.  He joins her 
      there. The breathless disrobing continues - 

      O.S. The wail of AN AIR RAID WARNING.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Please God not now!  

                                  VIV
                    Ignore it.

      Their eyes lock.  They are consumed in erotic need again - 
      he slides her hand into his open fly -

                                  REGGIE
                    For you, my love.  I just wish to 
                    God I had more to give you.

      She kisses him - their passion escalating - as he thrusts 
      inside her, Viv catches sight of a DUST BALL under the bed - 

      - Nearby is the crushed DAISY from her hair -



      TWO AMBULANCES driving down an uncannily deserted street -
      O.S. the clatter of AK-AK GUNS - the ominous drone of ENEMY 
      AIRCRAFT.  Search lights sweep the sky. 

      Kay is at the wheel of the first ambulance, Nancy beside 
      her. Nancy is navigating with a street map and a torch.  
      Both wear helmets, their hair tucked inside them.

                                  NANCY
                    I booked us into the Grand at 
                    Brighton for his next leave - I d 
                    say for a second honeymoon except 
                    we never got to have a first one - 
                          (flinching)
                    Oh Jesus!                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       40.


      A shower of INCENDIARY BOMBS descends ahead, detonating 
      into fire bombs as they hit the ground.  Kay swerves to 
      avoid them - she slams on the brakes.  

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Come on, Kay - not again!

      But Kay is already signalling to Hughes in the second 
      ambulance to slow down.

                                  KAY
                          (shouting)
                    Go on ahead - we ll catch you up!

      She scrambles out of the ambulance - darts to a pile of 
      SANDBAGS, drags one over - drops it onto a fizzing, 
      frothing incendiary - 

                                  NANCY
                          (resigned)
                    Hells bells!

      She gets out - the two of them haul more sandbags to 
      extinguish the shoal of smouldering incendiaries littering 
      the street.  RESIDENTS appear out of the dark to help, zig-
      zagging around the street like crazy Whirling Dervishes - 



      Light splaying from the NAKED LIGHT BULB - the blur of CREW 
      MEMBERS beneath, playing chequers, knitting, reading. 

      Kay sits crossed legged on her bed rolling a CIGARETTE, she 
      looks up to see Binkie planted there -

                                  BINKIE
                    I hear you ve been up to your 
                    heroics again, Langrish.

      Beyond, Hughes listens to the exchange.

                                  BINKIE (CONT D)
                    Putting out incendiaries?  How 
                    many times, it s not our 
                      responsibility.

                                  KAY
                    So what, we just drive by, let an

                    done it this week?

      The CREW exchange looks.  Hughes puts up a hand, O Neill 
      hesitantly follows.

      O Neill, braces in dread.  Kay, catching this.

                                  KAY
                    I ll go with Hughes.

      Binkie glances at her, then at O Neill. She hands the PAPER 
      WORK to Kay, exits.  Kay catches O Neill s eye.  She mouths 
       thank you  to Kay 



      Hughes at the wheel, Kay clambers in, he fires the engine:

                    Maybe you are a bloody hero, 
                    letting O Neill off the hook that

      He flicks her a wry look - shoves the ambulance into gear - 



      The dawn chorus O.S.  Duncan, restlessly alert in the 
      bottom bunk. Fraser is asleep in the bunk above him.

      Duncan tenses as suddenly Fraser s hand flops down, to hang 
      inches from his face. Duncan gazes at it a moment, 
      cautiously extends his own hand.  He halts it an inch away 
      from Fraser s finger tips in untouching contact.

      The sound of footsteps halts him, he withdraws his hand, 
      closes his eyes. The METAL OBSERVATION SLIT in the door 
      slides open.  A PRISON GUARD peers through it.  It s MUNDY.

                                  MUNDY
                          (sotto)
                    Okay in there?

      Duncan doesn t reply. The SLIT closes.  Duncan opens his 
      eyes: Fraser s hand still dangles beside him.  So near, yet 
      so far.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       43.



      Kay at the kitchen table nursing a Gin, a fatigue about her 
      more than just physical. She raises the glass to her lips 
      but her hand is shaking too much to drink.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      Kay in front of a mirror.  She extends a shaking hand, 
      focuses on it until it steadies. She picks up a pair of 
      kitchen scissors, unpins her hair, letting it cascade 
      around her shoulders.   

      She raises the scissors -



      A glimmer of light through the BLACK OUT curtains.  A 
      FIGURE lies asleep in the bed. Kay enters, now naked.  Her 
      hair is cut short like a boys.  

      She slides into bed, takes off her wrist watch and SERPENT 
      RING, places them on the bed table.  The figure in the  bed 
      rouses - it s HELEN, now aged 22.  She blinks awake, gazing 
      at Kay s shorn hair -

                                  HELEN 
                    ...What on earth have you done to 
                    yourself?

      Kay, just lying there: she s trembling again. Helen - 
      compassion there now - folding her into her arms - 

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Why do you have to out there 
                    every night?  No-one would think

      They just lie, Helen holding her in comfort.

                    You should get some sleep.

      She draws Helen to her - kisses her - consumed not just by 
      desire but the need for human contact -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       44.



      A FROSTED GLASS DOOR -  HOUSING DEPARTMENT on it. A 
      cacophony of TYPING and ringing PHONES beyond.  

      Helen approaches up the corridor, enters.  Through the gap 
      in the door see a familiar figure there busy typing - VIV; 
      other TYPISTS at their desks behind her. 

      Viv exchanges a nod of greeting to Helen as she passes - 
      she picks up her bag - exits -



      A shuttered cubicle door, the sound of retching.  Viv 
      emerges, crosses to the basin, splashes water on her face.   

        Apprehension grips her.  She cups her breasts in her hands, 
      squeezes them, winces in pain.  

      She meets her dread fuelled gaze in the mirror -



      Ricochet of voices, the clatter of cutlery.  Duncan is 
      walking with his tray down the aisle between tables of 
      PRISONERS.  A peroxided rouged transvestite sits with 
        TRANSSEXUALS and GAYS.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       48.

                    Lobster Thermidor?  Beef

                    Shift up ladies, make room for 
                    her.

      Duncan clenches in humiliation, walks on.

                                  AUNTIE VI (CONT D)
                    Oh, I ve just been cut, my dears!

                    rest of us.

      Duncan spots a vacant seat near Fraser, slides into it.  
      Fraser is vigorously debating with other PRISONERS. 

                                  FRASER
                    ..  Give a man a decent job, a 
                    decent home, he d get the point 
                    of pacifism soon enough -

                                  PRISONER #1
                    - Or he d want to fight to 
                    protect what he s got.

      Duncan, gazes at Fraser, awed at his erudite argument and 
      his sheer physical presence - 

                                  FRASER
                    So explain why most conscientious 
                    objectors are professional middle 
                    class?  ...My tribunal was 
                    stuffed with them.  Barely a 
                    working man among us.

      He catches sight of Duncan, fixed on him -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    So where are you on pacifism, 
                    Pearce? 

                                  DUNCAN

                    There you are. The less we think

      Mundy is approaching up the aisle between the tables -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Mr. Mundy!  Help us out here?

      Mundy halts by their table.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Enlighten us, why the prison

                    newspaper or listen to the 
                    wireless, anything which might 
                    actually inform or educate us?

                                  MUNDY
                    You know why, lad. Because 
                    hearing about the outside world 
                    just stirs you all up -

                                  FRASER
                    - In other words, denying us the 
                    right to have opinions makes us 
                    easier for you to manage?  

                                  MUNDY
                          (mild)
                    You have a grievance, Mr. Fraser, 
                    take it up with the Governor. 
                    Better yet, Mr. Churchill.

      He moves off, halts beside Duncan, his hand resting briefly 
      on his shoulder. 

                                  MUNDY (CONT D)
                    Alright, son?

      Duncan, aware of Fraser and others watching: he nods, eyes 
      averted.  Mundy moves on.

                                  FRASER
                    Give me an honest sadist than a 
                    hypocrite like him any day.

      Duncan flashes him a look.

                                  DUNCAN
                    He s better than most of them.  
                    And kinder.

                                  FRASER

      Duncan, stung.

                    It s not me who s like him, 
                    Pearce.

      Their eyes meet.  Duncan s gaze shifts to Auntie Viv at her 
      table across the aisle.  She blows him a kiss -  causing 
      nearby prisoners to snigger -

      Duncan, flushed in humiliation. 



      - Duncan, entering his cell.  He flings himself onto his 
      bunk, fighting emotion, He grabs his pillow, buries his 
      face in it -

      She rattles out, Lauren picks up the Gin jugs, exits also.  
      Helen and Kay start to set glasses onto a tray.

      them - the PIANO falters to silence.  Kay runs out -



      - Nancy is standing stricken in the hall, a crumpled 
      TELEGRAM is in her hand.

      GUESTS, grouped in the sitting room doorway watch her in 
      dread.  Kay pushes through them, reaches, takes the 
      telegram - scans it.

      Peter Carmichael has been killed in action. 

      Kay, seared in compassion - pulling Nancy into her arms as 
      shuddering grief engulfs her.   Helen, watching - 



      Helen, soberly regarding her reflection in the mirror. She 
      smooths her hair - pinches her cheeks.  

      A stab of disquiet there as to why she s doing this -



      Viv, in a bathrobe.  She turns on the hot tap in the bath.   
      She opens the MEDICINE CUPBOARD - pulls out a bottle of 
      CASTER OIL.  She braces herself - gulps it down.  A SMALL 
      bottle of GIN is in her robe pocket.  She takes a gulp of 
      this also.  She adds a slosh into the steaming bath for 
      good measure.

      She discards the robe, puts a foot into the bath.  It s 
      scalding hot.  She recoils, steels herself, gingerly lowers 
      her foot again, gasping as pain engulfs her -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       56.



      Viv, back in her robe, her hair wrapped in a towel.  She s

      An echo chamber of a corridor - A GUARD patrols down it.  
      O.S. PRISONERS shouting a chorus of lewd obscenities -



      Duncan, in his lower bunk, Fraser above him listening to 
      the lewd symphony of voices -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       57.


      CHORUS:  We saw your twat, Chase! And it was as black as a 
      hat!   She can t answer, she s got her gob round Evan s 
      knob!   And Seymour is doing her from the rear!     My turn 
      after her, Chase!    Suck my cock, Chase! 

      Suddenly, a soaring soprano voice rises above the crescendo 
      of obscenities - singing  I dream of Jeannie with the light 
      brown hair.   The prisoners fall silent, listening -

      Duncan, unshed tears there at its simple beauty.  Fraser 
      above him, moved also.   The voice falls silent.

                                  FRASER

      Fraser above him as he masturbates, the creak of the bed 
      springs.  The escalating rise of his breathing - 

      Duncan raises his hand - slides his fingers to cling into 
      the bedsprings above him as they jolt and quiver under 
      Fraser s weight.  Duncan slides his other hand under the 
      blanket - starts to pleasure himself in sync with Fraser -

      Finally Fraser shudders and climaxes - Duncan too reaches 
      orgasm - inadvertently emitting a gasp as he comes -

      Helen, asleep in bed: innocent child-like beauty about her.  
      Kay has just come back from work, she sits on the bed, 
      gazing at her.  Helen rouses, opens her eyes.

      on the cover.  She leans, pushes the BOOK under the bed out 
      of sight.

      Viv, nervously perched on the dentists chair. Through the 
      rippled glass door, she can see the Reggie talking to Imrie 
      in the waiting area. 

      She glances around the room: trays of instruments, drills, 
      bottles of GAS, pictures showing teeth and pink gums: she 
      can see money change hands through the rippled glass. 

      Imrie enters.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       60.

      She complies, lies back in the dental chair, fighting 
      apprehension.  He pulls on rubber gloves, inserts a hand 
      into her vagina. She fixes on the ceiling above her.  An

                    I must ask, when you leave, to 
                    put a handkerchief over your 
                    mouth.  Give the impression you 
                    were here for dental work? The

      Duncan, tears there suddenly. Mundy draws him inside, 
      closes the door. Duncan sits, fighting distress.  Mundy 
      gets out a cigarette, lights it, passes it over.

                          (then)
                    For my wife. ...Hurry, please!

      He disconnects:  his hand holding the phone is clammy with 
      sweat.



      Viv, barely conscious.  Reg beside her, holding her hand.  
      He raises it to his lips, kisses it, tears in his eyes now -



      Helen, in the RED PYJAMAS, lying on the bed, a half eaten 
      sandwich beside her.  She s reading Julia s book.  She 
      flips to the cover and the picture of JULIA - arrested by 
      it -



      Helen, a resolve about her now, by the hall TELEPHONE: 
      TELEPHONE book is there.  She locates Julia in it - 

      - Confliction briefly in her face -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       64.



      A pallid, sweat drenched Viv, drifting in out of 
      consciousness.  Kay and Nancy stooped over her, checking 
      blood pressure, preparing bandages to stem the bleeding.

                                  KAY 
                    Can you tell us your name, love?

      Viv, trying to focus on her voice -

                                  VIV
                    Pearce.  Vivian ...

                                  NANCY
                    How long have you been bleeding 
                    this way?  

                                  VIV
                    .. Reggie - where s Reggie?

                                  KAY
                    Is he your husband?

                                  VIV
                    No - Yes, my husband yes!  

      Kay and Nancy exchange a look -

                                  KAY
                    How far along was the baby, 
                    Vivian?

      Viv, struggling to sit up -

                                  NANCY
                    You must lie still -

                                  VIV
                    - Where is he?  Why isn t he 
                    here?  ..Reggie! 

      Another look between Nancy and Kay -



      Viv, now delirious, strapped onto a stretcher, Kay, 
      crouched beside her as the ambulance sways and veers -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       65.


                                  VIV
                    At the hospital, if they send for 
                    the police? Don t tell them my 
                    real name! Tell them I m Mrs. 
                    Harrison?  

                                  KAY
                    ...Why would they send for the 
                    police?

                                  VIV
                    Getting rid of the baby - they ll 
                    know it s an abortion, won t 
                    they?

      Kay s face - Viv grips her hand -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    - My father can t know!  Not 
                    after what my brother did!  He 
                    must never know!

      Kay, trying to keep up with all this -  

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                          (panicked)
                    The ring!  It s gone!  
                          (then)
                    We have to find the ring! They ll 
                    know I m not married without it!

      Kay s face -


      EXT/INT AMBULANCE - CASUALTY HOSPITAL - - NIGHT 19449696

      The AMBULANCE now outside the CASUALTY ENTRANCE - Kay, 
      quickly folding Viv s coat onto the stretcher - she leans 
      to whisper to Viv -

                                  KAY
                    Vivian? We re at the hospital - 
                    listen to me!  

      Viv tries to focus on her - 

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    I ve made a tear in your coat, 
                    put your ration book in it - they 
                    won t find it there ...  You re 
                    Mrs. Harrison just like you said - 

                                  VIV
                    I have no ring!

      Kay takes off her SERPENT RING, slides it on her finger, 
      rotates it so the plain underside is visible.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       66.


                                  KAY
                     ...Let me do the talking. Leave 
                    it to me, ok? -

      Viv grips her hand. The doors swing open, an ORDERLY and 
      NURSES are there -

                                    ORDERLY
                    What have we got tonight? 

                                  KAY
                    Mrs. Harrison - miscarriage with 
                      complications. She s had a fall, 
                    lost a lot of blood.
                          (to Viv)
                    You re safe now.

      Viv reluctantly releases her hand - her stretcher is 
      hustled off. Kay - unexpectedly moved by her plight -  

      O.S. the desolate wail of an AIR RAID WARNING -



      The demolished contours of the church, only the TOWER is 
      undamaged. The floor is strewn with rubble and the 
      shattered remains of stained glass.

      Julia and Helen walk up the aisle to sit in one of the 
      pews. 

                                  JULIA
                      Christopher Wren built it too, 
                    after the Great Fire.  His 
                    daughter Jane helped him design 
                    the tower.  

      They sit, gazing up the tower above them.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       69.


                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                      I remember the night Kay met you. 
                    It s like its scored into my 
                    brain.

      Helen flashes her a look.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    She always wanted a wife. Someone 
                    she could look after - protect. 
                    Someone innocent and...  Not 
                    cynical and opinionated like me.
                          (then)
                    When she came home that night, 
                    told me how she met you, I knew 
                    she d found what she was looking 
                    for.  
                          (a different tone)
                    That we were over.

      Helen, trying to fathom this -

                                  HELEN
                    But it was you who left her for 
                    someone -

                                  JULIA
                    Is that what she told you?

                                  HELEN
                    She never talks about it.  Except 
                    that what you had was a .. a  
                       misaffection.   

                                  JULIA
                          (an edge)
                    Is that what she calls it.

      Helen, still trying to compute this -

                                  HELEN
                    She still wears the snake ring 
                    you gave her - she wears it every 
                    day -

                                  JULIA
                    It s just a piece of jewellery to 
                    her.  Of no more significance 
                    than I was. 

      Helen s face. A sudden explosion causes them to recoil - 
      clasp hands.  Julia: a kind of challenge there -

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Are you frightened yet?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       70.


                                  HELEN
                          (meeting her eyes)
                    Not of the bombs.

      Another explosion rocks the church - dust and debris 
      cascade from the shattered roof -

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Now I am!

      Julia laughs - grabs her hand - they run to shelter in a 
      vaulted corner of the CHURCH - beyond the deafening rattle 
      of ACK-ACK guns - the drone of AIRCRAFT -

      They move together to kiss - passion escalating between 
      them - Helen halts her - 

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Tell me this isn t about 
                    punishing Kay for what she did to 
                    you?   
                          (beat)
                    ...It s real?

      Julia puts a finger over her lips - the question goes 
      unanswered - they sink into the shadows - grappling inside 
      each other s clothes -

                                  JULIA
                          (sotto)
                    Now we re invisible again.



      - Kay and Nancy entering from a shift. A scattering of the 
      CREWS. Hughes and Binkie, huddled talking.  At the sight of 
      Kay,  Hughes and Binkie abruptly halt talking - 

                                  KAY
                    ...What?

                                  BINKIE
                    We just got word, Rathbone Place 
                    has been hit.

      Kay s face -

                                  HUGHES
                    Section 58 are on their way. 
                    They ll keep us posted.

                                  BINKIE
                    Helen will be down in the 
                    shelter, won t she?

                                  KAY
                    She never uses the damn shelter!                        THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       71.


      She swings round to Nancy -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    Give me the keys!

      Nancy looks at Binkie - who signals dissent -

                                  HUGHES
                    Section 58 will report back 
                    directly they -

                                  KAY
                          (urgent: to Nancy)
                    I have to go her!

      Nancy, briefly conflicted - she lobs the keys over.  Hughes 
      dives - catches them - Kay fixes on him -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    Give them to me.

                                  BINKIE
                    There s nothing you can do, Kay! 

      Kay launches herself at Hughes - suddenly they re rolling 
      on the floor - she clawing at him for the keys - Nancy - 
      confliction there again as she watches -

                                  BINKIE (CONT D)
                    Stop, Kay! For God s sake!

                                  HUGHES
                    It s section 58 s call. They ll 
                    deal with it -

      Kay continues to grapple with him - 

                                  HUGHES (CONT D)
                    You know the drill - it s not our 
                    bloody call!  You want to be 
                    thrown out of the service?  Is 
                    she worth that?

      Kay suddenly raises a fist - punches him - he releases the 
      keys - she s scrambles to her feet - she s out of there -



      Fraser, agitatedly peering out of the barred window - 
      Duncan in his bunk.  The desperate chorus of PRISONERS 
      beyond -  Mundy!  Griggs!                        THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       72.


      I ll get you for this!    Unlock this bloody door!   In 
      God s name, have pity!    Help us - someone help us - let 
      us out!  

                                  FRASER
                    I swear they re getting closer!

      Duncan, tensely listening in his bunk.  Fraser scrambles 
      into his own bunk: puts his hands over his ears to block 
      out the frantic screams from prisoners and detonating bombs- 

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    - Me and my pacifism!  When it 
                    comes to it, I m just a bloody 
                    coward like anyone else!
                          (then)
                    Oh God - oh shit!

      A deafening crash of a bomb nearby - he suddenly clambers 
      from his bunk, gets into Duncan s. They lie huddled in the 
      bunk, Duncan holding Fraser as they listen to the havoc and 
      destruction beyond the prison walls - Fraser trying to 
      distract himself from his terror -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Talk to me - keep talking!

      An explosion causes them both to flinch -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Tell me about the boy, about what 
                    happened -    

                                  DUNCAN
                          (reluctant)
                    ...His name was Alec. He lived 
                    across the road from me. 

                                  FRASER
                    They catch you at it, did they - 
                    the police?  Was that it?

                                  DUNCAN
                    That s not how it was. 

      Another, louder explosion halts him - the stutter of ACK-
      ACK - the crash of bombs - the terror fuelled screams from 
      the prisoners -

      The boys cling together in the bunk - brothers in arms -



      Pools of shadow - A DOUBLE BED - Kay sits on the edge of 
      it, sewing a button on her AMBULANCE UNIFORM. Julia sits in 
      a CHAIR nearby, smoking.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       74.


                                  JULIA
                    I was born at night, Kay, but not 
                    last night.   
                          (then)
                    You volunteered again didn t you? 

      Kay s face is her answer.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    You just can t keep away from 
                    that damn place!  No, wait, how 
                    obtuse of me! It s not the place, 
                    is it? It s you out there, doing 
                    your superhero bit-
                          (beat)
                    Unless it s me you want to get 
                    away from?

      Kay has finished sewing on the button: she puts away the 
      sewing equipment -

                                  KAY
                    I m not one of your fictional 
                      creations, Julia. I don t exist 
                    just to do your bidding.

                                  JULIA
                    Fine!  Go save the world, do what 
                    you must.  

      She stubs out her cigarette, constraining emotion. 

                                  KAY
                    I don t begrudge your writing do 
                    I?  Why do you this for me?

                                  JULIA
                          (a different tone)
                    I m just afraid one night you 
                    won t come back.

                                  KAY
                    I always do, don t I?

      Kay picks up her HAT and GREATCOAT - crosses, drops a kiss 
      on Julia s head -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    I m indestructible, don t you 
                    know that yet?

      She heads for the door.  Julia suddenly speaks again -

                                  JULIA
                    It s the war that s doing it. 
                    Pulling us apart like this.  
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       75.

                                  JULIA (CONT'D)
                    We were alright before, weren t 
                    we?

      Kay, a stab of unease in her face, quickly disguised.

                                  KAY
                    Check the black-out before you 
                    turn in.

      She quickly goes.  A moment later, the thud of the FRONT 
      DOOR closing - Julia s face. 

      - O.S. the rattle of a train -



      Viv (now aged 21) approaching up the corridor. A bunch of 
      RAF AIRMEN in the train corridor ogling her.  She squeezes 
      passed them, one offers her some chocolate -

                                  AIRMAN
                    Can I tempt you, love?

                                  VIV
                    Watching my figure.

                                  AIRMAN
                    You re not the only one.

      She continues on her way: the AIRMEN appreciatively eyeing 
      her. She reaches the TOILET - pushes open the door - REGGIE 
      peers out at her - strikingly handsome in his UNIFORM -

                                  REGGIE
                    Is the Guard about?

      She, puzzled.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    ...The ticket inspector?

      She dissents. He steps out, checks the corridor. She slides 
      passed him into the toilet -



      Viv, pulling the toilet flush. She turns to wash her hands - 
      a sudden urgent knocking on the door -

                                  REGGIE (O.S.)
                    Miss?  Miss!

      Viv inches open the door - a panic laced Reggie is there -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       76.


                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    He s coming - the guard!  I ve 
                    lost my ticket you see and -

      Distantly the sound of the GUARD  Tickets please! 

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    - Let me in with you?  Just until 
                    he s gone by?

      Her face -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    I go to the front next week. I ve 
                    only 24 hours leave - I lost five 
                    of them waiting for the bloody 
                    train!  If he throws me off I ve 
                    had it!

      Viv, conflicted now - O.S.  Tickets please!  She makes a 
      decision, pushes open the door - Reggie squeezes inside.  
      They stand crushed together in the swaying confined space.  
      A knock on the door - GUARD (O.S.) Ticket please!

                                  VIV
                    One minute!

      She gets out the ticket, stoops to slide it under the door.  
      A moment later it slides back, a hole punched in it. Guard - 
       Thank you, Miss .

      Reggie retrieves the ticket in relief.

                                  REGGIE
                    You are heaven sent, you know 
                    that?

                                  VIV
                    Glad I could help.

      She reaches to open the door for him -

                                  REGGIE
                    One more minute, eh?  Make sure 
                    the coast is clear?

      She, wary now -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    You really are the most gorgeous 
                    creature I ve ever set eyes on 
                    ...   Just let me enjoy it a 
                    moment longer?

                                  VIV
                    That line usually works for you, 
                    does it?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       77.


      He smiles, proffers her a cigarette -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    Try anything - I ll scream blue 
                    murder.

      He crosses his heart.  She takes a cigarette, he lights it. 
      In spite of herself, she is intrigued by him.

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    ...Are you spending your leave in 
                    London?

                                  REGGIE
                    My wife just had a baby.

      Her disappointment surprises her.

                                  VIV
                    ...Boy or girl?

                                  REGGIE
                    Girl.  We already have a boy.  
                    You might say we ve the set now.

      They stand inches apart, swaying as the train clatters on - 
      a strange nihilism in him now -

                                  VIV
                          (curious)
                    Does it scare you, going to the 
                    front next week? 

                                  REGGIE
                    Maybe if I stop to think about 
                    it.  The home front is no picnic 
                    either. Every time I go back, I 
                    dread it more. I know it ll end 
                    up like always.  Minutes after 
                    stepping through the door, my 
                    wife and I will be arguing again.
                          (then)
                    My son barely knows who I am.   
                    He s the reason we had to tie the 
                    knot in the first place - marry 
                    in haste, etc.    
                          (rueful)
                    You think it s a line too, don t  
                    you?  The misunderstood husband, 
                    all that.

      His despair touches her. The train suddenly lurches, 
      throwing them together.  Viv, clutching him for support - 
      she recovers her poise, dunks her cigarette in the basin, 
      she puts her hand out in awkward formality -

                                  VIV
                    Good luck, at the front I mean.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       78.


      He takes her hand - sudden cogency in him now.

                                  REGGIE
                    The memory of this will keep me 
                    going there.  That just once, I 
                    got a break.  I got to spend a 
                    few precious minutes with the 
                    most gorgeous girl who ever drew 
                    breath.
                          (beat)
                    I can die a happy man. 

      Viv, moved by this. He reaches for the door - on impulse 
      she restrains him.

                                  VIV
                    Maybe one more cigarette?

      He scrambles to produce them - lights it for her - unable 
      to believe his good fortune. 



      O.S. the drone of an AIR RAID WARNING. Duncan in his 
      pyjamas, (now aged 17) unbolting the kitchen door:  Alec 
      enters - 19 years old, edgy, unkempt: more than a touch of 
      mania about him -

                                  ALEC
                    My papers came - this is it, 
                    Duncan!  

      Duncan s face.  

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    I m to report to some training 
                    place in Salisbury. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Mine aren t through yet!

                                  ALEC
                    They ll come soon enough.  
                    ...When I told my father I wasn t 
                    going, I thought he d tear my 
                    bloody head off!  He locked me in 
                    my room, I had to shin down the 
                    drain pipe to escape!

      He starts to pace.

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    I said to him, they re bloody 
                    quick enough to send you to war - 
                    they don t tell you about the gas 
                    Hitler uses to fry your brains do 
                    they?

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    What happens if they catch you, 
                    like what they do to the Jews and 
                    queers in those ghettoes?

      He pulls out a letter -

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    I wrote the letter like we 
                    planned -
                          (reading)
                     To whom it may concern  -  I was 
                    going to put  to Mr. Churchill  
                    but this way it s to Hitler and 
                    Mussolini too, see?
                          (reading)
                     We the undersigned do not 
                    undertake this deed lightly.  We 
                    are two young people who choose 
                    to die to save others. We would 
                    rather take our own lives than 
                    collude in the waste of war  -

      He hands the letter to Duncan.

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    They ll have to take notice of a 
                    gesture like that, won t they?  
                    We might even end the war!

      Duncan, intoxicated by his resolve -

                                  DUNCAN
                    When do we do it?

                                  ALEC
                    Now, tonight.  No point in 
                    putting it off -

                                  DUNCAN
                    - We ve not planned how yet -

                                  ALEC
                    - What are the options? How about 
                    gas?

                                  DUNCAN
                    That could take hours - suppose 
                    Viv comes back before we... Or my 
                    father wakes up?

                                  ALEC
                    - I know - rat poison!  

      He crouches, rifles in a cupboard under the sink -

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    There s only bleach.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       80.


                                  DUNCAN
                    The pain will kill us! 

      They look at each other, burst into hysterical giggles.  
      Alec spots the LAUNDRY PULLEY above them.

                                  ALEC
                    I ve got it, we ll hang 
                      ourselves!  We can use that!  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Will it take our weight?

      Alec tugs it down, they lie over each end, their feet off 
      the floor.

                                  ALEC
                    Perfect! ...We ll need belts or 
                    ties - something for a rope!



      The two BOYS, A WHISKEY BOTTLE now in hand, creeping 
      through the silent landing, muffled hysteria there still.  
      Pearce s bedroom door is ajar: they can hear his snoring.

                                  ALEC
                    He sounds like a Messerschmitt!

      They double in laughter - like the boys they still are-



      Duncan routing through a drawer for ties.  Alec checking in 
      another drawer - a roll of excitement propels them helped 
      by the whiskey -

                                  ALEC
                    Think of it!  We ll be heroes.  
                    It won t just be in the papers, 
                    poets will write sonnets in our 
                    memory!  Kids will learn about us 
                    in school!
                          (then)
                    Look at this, Duncan! - This is 
                    just the bloody job!

      He s brandishing a rusted CUT THROAT RAZOR in the drawer -  

                                                                          CUT TO:

      The two boys now in suits, in front of the mirror, licking 
      down their hair, knotting their ties-

                                                                          CUT TO                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       81.


      - The SUICIDE NOTE now pinned on the bed head.   The two of 
      them lie side by side on it, they gulp the last of the 
      whiskey. Alec opens the razor - Duncan glances at it.

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    We ll do it at dawn.  First bird 
                    song we hear, that s the cue, ok?
                          (then)
                    I ll go first, directly I ve done 
                    it, you take the razor, do it 
                    too.
                          (beat)
                    We must make a good job of it.  
                    Helping someone top themselves, 
                    they throw away the key.

      Duncan s face - they lie a moment.

                                  DUNCAN
                    ...What do you suppose happens 
                    when you die, Alec?

                                  ALEC
                    There can t be a God or he d have 
                    stopped the war, wouldn t he?

                                  DUNCAN
                    If there s no God then there s no 
                    heaven or hell...

                                  ALEC
                    If there is a place you go, we ll 
                    be there together, just like 
                    always. 
                          (sudden)
                    Bugger this waiting lark - let s 
                    get on with it!

      He clasps Duncan s hand.

                                  ALEC (CONT D)
                    You re the best you are, Duncan! 

      He raises the razor - Duncan - frozen in disbelief -

      The suicide note above the bed - a plume of BLOOD cascades 
      over it - 



        A distraught Viv, opening the front door.  HUGHES and A 
      FEMALE CREW MEMBER are there. Beyond, the strobe of POLICE 
      LIGHTS.

                                  VIV
                    This way -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       82.


      She leads them to the stairs: glimpse Mr. Pearce sitting in 
      the living room in his dressing gown, ashen and dazed - A 
      UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER is there -



      A POLICE OFFICER opens the door to Viv, who enters with 
      HUGHES and COLLEAGUE - they halt in the door way.  The 
      blood drenched corpse of Alec on the bed. 

      Duncan sits in a corner, he too is spattered in blood, 
      rocking to and fro, moaning in anguish. 

      He meets Hughes  eyes - stricken in culpability -



      The empty station - most of the CREWS are out on calls.  
      Kay and Nancy are on their beds, Nancy is painting her 
      nails, Kay doing a crossword. 

      Binkie enters -

                                  BINKIE
                    You re up, girls.  Guest house in 
                    Jocelyn Street - half a dozen 
                    guests trapped inside -

      Kay and Nancy haul themselves from their beds -



      Darkness, punctuated by the eerie luminous TORCH LIGHTS - 
      RESCUE WORKERS and POLICE RESERVES in the partly demolished 
      reception area - Nancy and Kay enter - 

                                  NANCY
                    Where do we start?

                                  KAY
                    I ll take the basement.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       83.



      Darkness - a helmeted RESCUE WORKER picking through debris.  
      Kay enters the basement, swings her torch over the wreckage 
      of ceiling plaster and beams. 

                                  KAY
                          (to RESCUE WORKER)
                    Anything?

      He dissents: she clambers piles of rubble, halts, hearing a 
      sound - shouts to the RESCUE WORKER - they feverishly tug 
      aside debris to reveal Helen, wearing only a torn 
      nightdress - deathly pale - covered in a film of plaster, 
      buried to her waist in bricks and mortar.  A BEAM is 
      pinning her legs -  

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                          (to RESCUE WORKER)
                    We need help lifting it off her -

      He goes.  

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                          (to Helen)
                    Can you move your legs?

      She pushes aside more rubble - she can see Helen s feet 
      protruding from under the beam.

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    Wriggle your feet for me?

      Helen complies. 

                                  HELEN
                    I could murder a cigarette.

                                  KAY
                    There might be gas. 

      She s taking Helen s pulse now - Helen blinks up at her -

                                  HELEN
                    Are you a doctor? 

                                  KAY
                    Just a dab hand at First Aid.

                                  HELEN
                    I went out with a doctor once.  
                    Well, nearly - he was a medical 
                    student.  It didn t work out.

      Her thinking is fragmented, dislocated -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       84.


                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Why is it we can t love the 
                    people we ought?  

      The question resonates with Kay. A shower of dust cascades - 
      Helen flinches in fear, grips Kay s hand.

                                  KAY
                    Don t worry, I won t let anything 
                    happen to you. ...Just be brave a 
                    bit longer?  

      She holds a flask of water for Helen to sip.

                                  HELEN
                    You re the one who s brave.  
                    Doing this job.

                                  KAY
                    It s easier being out in thick of 
                    things than cowering in some 
                    shelter.  
                          (beat)
                    And at night where there s a raid 
                    on, when no-one s about and the 
                    streets are empty - it s like the 
                    whole city belongs to you.  
                          (then)
                    ...You re protecting it. 

      She tips water onto a handkerchief to wash the grime from 
      Helen s face, starting at her brow, working downwards, over 
      her eyes, then around her nose, the groove above her lip, 
      her mouth and chin. Helen, mesmerized - 

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    There.  All clean.

      She cups Helen s face in her hands, wonderment there now. 

                                  HELEN
                    ...What?

                                  KAY
                    Nothing.  ...Sorry.

      Their eyes meet: Kay releases her as a bevy of RESCUE 
      WORKERS approach with Nancy. Helen grips Kay s hand -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    I ll be where you can see me.

      She steps aside for the RESCUE WORKERS.  She and Nancy 
      watch as the WORKERS start to hoist the beam off Helen.

                                  NANCY
                    You do realize, now you ve saved 
                    her, she s yours for life?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       85.


      Kay, fixed on the pale apparition of Helen being lifted 
      from the rubble and destruction - 

      - A Phoenix rising from the devastating ashes of war. 

      A KALEIDOSCOPE OF IMAGES as we now FAST FORWARD in time - 
      through the events of 1941 we ve just seen - further into 
      1944 - Julia and Helen in the park - Kay stomping out 
      incendiaries - Helen twirling in the RED SILK PYJAMAS - 
      Duncan and Fraser in their cell- Viv and Reggie in the 
      hotel room post abortion - Viv returning the SERPENT RING 
    to Kay - Fraser and Viv in the CAFE - solitary figure of 
    Kay walking the streets of London - Kay outside the disused 
      AMBULANCE STATION - the STACCATO IMAGES screech to a halt -

      CAPTION - 1947



      O.S. The sound of MUSIC from the RADIO. Duncan, quietly 
      descending the stairs with a SUITCASE. The PARLOUR door is 
      ajar.  Mundy is at the table mending a CLOCK, his back to 
      the door. 

      Duncan scoops up his coat, places his door key on the table-



      Duncan hoisting his SUITCASE onto the rack in a TRAIN 
      CARRIAGE. A YOUNG MAN sits opposite - their eyes briefly 
      meet.  The YOUNG MAN takes out a pack of cigarette - 
      proffers one to Duncan - who accepts it -  - 

      He looks out of the window - the YOUNG MAN is reflected 
      there - their eyes meet once again - beyond the fleeting 
      darkened landscape as he hurtles towards his future -  



      - Kay by the fire: she unbuttons her shirt: something is 
      tucked inside her bra, next to her heart: the scrap of red 
      silk from Helen s pyjamas.  She drops the scrap of silk 
      into the fire -

                                  KAY (V.O.)
                    Someone once said a happy ending 
                    depends on where you decide to 
                    stop your story.  ...Then again, 
                    it could be when you realize your 
                    story is not yet over -  
                          (beat)
                    - That you are only at the end of 
                    the beginning -

      Kay, a wry smile there as the flames ignite the scrap of 
      blood red silk - obliterating the ghosts of her past -

      She rises, moves to the PACKING CASES, starts to unpack 
      them. 




      END TITLES                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       87.
