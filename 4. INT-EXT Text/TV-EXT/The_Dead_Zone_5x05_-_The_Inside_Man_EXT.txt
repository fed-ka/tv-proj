          The dark figure of the Old Guard looks back over his
            shoulder, paranoid, as he walks along a stretch of fence
          that features vertical slots he can only partially see-
          through.  A voice stops him.  [Later we will know the
          voice belongs to Thief #1 (Brother Gregarin)]

                        You're late.

                                        OLD GUARD
                        Your note said to make sure I
                        wasn't followed.

          The Old Guard tries to get a glimpse of the man on the
          other side of the fence, but the design of the slots never
          lets him see more than a slice of eye and mouth.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN (VOICE)
                        Timing is everything with this
                        job.  Here's your gear.

          A black gym bag is pushed over the top of the fence,
          landing at the Old Guard's feet.

                                        OLD GUARD
                        Why all the mystery?

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN (VOICE)
                        We don't know you.  You don't
                        know us.  That protects everybody. 
                        Stick to the timetable.  Anything
                          changes, a lot of people are going
                        to get hurt -- starting with you.

          The VISION ENDS.


  1818RESUME JOHNNY - PRESENT REALITY

          Johnny comes out of the vision just as the Older Guard
          gets up from his chair.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        I'm going to the 'head'.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        Hurry up.  I'm supposed to be on
                        break.

          Johnny watches the Older Guard pick up the black gym bag
          and walk out.  Johnny exchanges a look with the Guard,
          who glances away, unable to make eye contact.

          Meanwhile, Purdy checks his watch.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, if you'll excuse me, I
                        have business to attend to.

                                        PURDY (CONT'D)
                        Why don't you join the others and
                        I'll catch up with you.

          Was Purdy checking his watch just a coincidence?  Johnny
          wonders if Purdy and the Guard are somehow in it together. 



          The last of the crowd spills out the main entrance of the
          auditorium, coughing but happy to see daylight.  A SIREN
          approaches in the background.


          WALT - MOVING

          From group to group, looking for J.J. - trying to stay
          calm.

                                        WALT
                        You see my boy?... blond.  Ten
                        years old.  'Bout this tall.

          People just shake their heads no.

                                        ANYBODY
                        There's another exit around back.


          PURDY - AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE

          Supervising the last of the stragglers coming out.  He
          turns to the YOUNGER GUARD.

                                        PURDY
                        Is that everybody?

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        I think so.  Can't be sure 'til
                        the Fire Department does a sweep
                        of the building.  Magruder's still
                        in there somewhere.

                                        PURDY
                        I hear sirens.  Go make sure the
                        Fire Department knows where to
                        go.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        Yes sir.

          As the Younger Guard runs off, Purdy stands with his back
          to the entrance, checking to see if anyone's looking,
          before quietly slipping back inside the building.

          A FIRE TRUCK

          Arrives, siren blaring, pulling right up to the entrance
          before killing the siren and stopping.  FOUR FIREMEN,
          helmets and breathing gear already on, hop off the truck
          and begin pushing the crowd back, setting up cones.

                                        FIREMAN #4 (MARIO THE DRIVER)
                        I need you people to back up and
                        give us room to work.  Everything
                        is under control.  Just a small
                        electrical fire.  Nothing to worry
                        about.  Back up please.

          Fireman #2 (Ivan), a huge guy built like a bouncer, throws
          the jaws of life over his shoulder, picks up a small
          generator, and leads the way into the smoking building. 
          Fireman #1 (Brother Gregarin) and #3 (THE AMAZING SVETLANA)
          unload several large rolling cases marked "haz mat" and
          begin shoving them inside the building.



          Walt, having circled the entire building looking for J.J. 
          finds himself back at the entrance near the fire truck.

                                        WALT
                                (yelling)
                        J.J.?  J.J.?

          He turns toward the entrance, and seeing the lone Fireman
          standing watch at the door, starts toward him to report
          J.J. missing.  As he passes the fire truck, something
          catches his eye.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT TWO - 4/10/05 - PINK    26.

          P.O.V. - THE FIRE TRUCK DOOR

          The decal for the Penobscot Fire Department is just a
          little crooked.  A closer inspection reveals the decal
          has been plastered over a haphazard paint job covering
          the insignia of another fire department.

          He looks again at the Fireman guarding the door, this
          time noticing something odd.  The VIEW ZOOMS IN on the
            Fireman's boots - but they aren't boots - he's wearing a
          pair of sneakers under his fireman pants.


          WALT

          Slips his cell phone out, keeping an eye on the Fireman. 
          When he dials, he gets the same jamming tone Johnny got
          when he used the phone earlier.

          Snapping the phone shut, we see a decision cross his face
          and he turns to head off around the building with purpose.



          Ivan and Svetlana exit the hall, racing right past Mario --
          who is surprised by their sudden appearance.

                                        MARIO
                        What took you so long?

                                        IVAN
                        Never mind, just keep the crowd
                        back!

          Ivan and Svetlana jump into the cab of the idling fire
          truck, leaving Mario to work the crowd.

                                        MARIO
                        Everything is under control, thank
                        you for your cooperation...

          Hearing the siren fire up behind him, he turns to run
          after the moving fire truck, barely jumping on the back
          as they roar off, leaving behind confused onlookers.          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT FOUR - 4/10/05 - PINK   55.



          Brother Gregarin rushes out of the building, only to be
          confronted by a group of armed deputies.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Don't move!  Put your hands in
                        the air!

          Gregarin hesitates, then makes a dash for freedom.  He's
          gunned down in a hail of bullets.


    69B69BRESUME SCENE

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come with me, there isn't much
                        time.  You need to do exactly
                        what I tell you.

          Gregarin nods, as they take off together.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Johnny and Brother Gregarin poke their head out the side
          door, finding the coast clear.  In the distance they can
          hear MANY WAILING SIRENS --  hopefully chasing a stolen
          fire truck.  Johnny gives Brother Gregarin his coat.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember, stay on the North side
                        of the building.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        If you ever get to the Ukraine...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to go.

          They shake hands, as Gregarin takes off into the distance.
