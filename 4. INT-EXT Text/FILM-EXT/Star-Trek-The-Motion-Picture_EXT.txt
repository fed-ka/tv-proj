In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA
APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an
Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes,
beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it
can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES
APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing
our POV, a:

KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)

In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious
LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS
a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud,
which continues to grow in size as the Klingons
approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead
ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE
OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification
emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon
language (and symbols).

The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the
bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the
steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE.

The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from
the tubes.
14
ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)
14
A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the
Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance.
15
22
Serenity here. A barren, rocky small plantoid softly
lit by the myriad stars. This is a small Starfleet
outpost, antennae sprouting everywhere. Tiny figures
(WORKERS) servicing one antenna illustrate the size
of the installation.

28
with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick, steamy
vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up
from some unseen, underground source. The CAMERA
CONTINUES MOVING through clouds.
And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange
angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend-
ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.
29
29
Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite
unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,
harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered
and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC
we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:
FEMALE MASTER'S VOICE
Spock, son of Sarek of Vulcan...
and of Amanda of Earth...
diligently you have labored for
purification of mind...
30
REVERSE ANGLE - SPOCK, VULCAN MASTERS AND RUINS
30
In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g.,
the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle
of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three
VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the
other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a
cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around
Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up
as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.
MALE MASTER
(chidingly)
Spock . . . !
Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
continues.
FEMALE MASTER
Here are these sands, our fore-
bearers cast out their animal
passions. Here our race was
saved by the first attainment of
Kolinahr.
MALE MASTER
Kolinahr: the final shedding of
all emotion.
FEMALE MASTER
You have labored long, Spock.
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic.
Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in,
intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck.
But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though
uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the
pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME
MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward.
She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a
look with the Male Masters.
FEMALE MASTER
(gestures Spock forward)
Come, give me your thoughts.
She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples
in Vulcan mind-meld position.
FEMALE MASTER
(continuing)
Our minds, Spock... One and
together....
Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels
Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long
moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and
looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she
casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
the dust.
FEMALE MASTER
(continuing; sadly)
This consciousness which calls --
it stirs your human half, Spock?
You have not achieved Kolinahr --
Your human emotions are not fully
extinguished.
(turns to the other Masters)
He will not achieve his goal with
us. His answer lies elsewhere.
The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his
disappointment evident even in his stoic features.
31
MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M. & F.P.)
31
CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-
ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his
head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face
a moment, then...
SHOCK CUT TO :

DAY (M)
From this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third
century San Francisco stretched out before us. In
the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved
Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building
serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San
Francisco.
The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying
several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply,
settles to the ground with a whisper.
34
34
The doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians
and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding
onto the platform, continuing on their respective
ways. Among the departing throng:
35
KIRK
35
in Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through
the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re-
spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his
mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac-
complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost.
CAMERA WITH HIM, to:
36
38
In f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but
perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures
in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts.
Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can
barely make out an orbital drydock.
39
CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S)

The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering
center and computer drafting office.
CAMERA MOVES IN AND CENTERS ON an outer "Travel Pod."

merest glimpse of what is inside the drydock: The
Enterprise slips INTO VIEW.

56
AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S)
56
The great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes
a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved
bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.
Small automated welding devices move along the gird-
ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares.
In other areas of metal lace structure, supplies and
equipment are being loaded onto the ship. The pod
continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all),
watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING
TECHNICIANS on the drydock. Now the pod moves toward
mating position. It closes in, secures itself to the
outer airlock.

Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open.
63
92
as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an
external view of the plantoid, and the LUMINESCENT
CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the
Klingon cruisers were attacked).
Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL, CATACLYSMIC
FORCE. The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately
the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR-
ING ENERGY, shattered structure, flying debris. And
then, all at once, there is nothing -- empty space,
Epsilon 9 is gone. We SEE only the stars; and the
mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant
sky.
(NOTE: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is
finished, not a word is spoken.)
KIRK (O.S.)
Viewer off.
93
ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK
93
as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen.
Then Kirk turns to the room as if to comment. Then he
stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what
they've just seen. Instead:
KIRK
Pre-launch countdown will
commence in forty minutes.
94
ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW
94
The scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their
minds as they gaze somberly up toward Kirk who is exit-
ing. The bridge crew follows him out. Not a word is
said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment,
then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.
95
95
Spectacular ORBIT VIEW of the giant starship in the
process of release. BEYOND US, in half light, EARTH
LOOMS HUGE. The dock welders are gone; the supply pods
float away from the ship. Little tongues of blue flame
spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.

as the large dock umbilical is released, floats free of
its starship attachment. Dock departure is imminent.

The starship within the drydock, but now the maneuver-
ing -- thrusters spurt pinpoints of BLUE-LAME. The
drydock is ready for the starship's departure -- not
a single pod or shuttlecraft in sight. The starship
looms majestically within the lacework girders.

The maneuvering jets turn off, the impulse drive glows.
The Enterprise begins moving perceptibly faster --
behind her, the drydock diminishing rapidly in size.

2.7 hours from launch...
121
THE ENTERPRISE - AFT AND AHEAD (S)
126
We SEE the WARP POWER EFFECT build up between the en-
gine "nacelles" -- then the starship makes the QUANTUM
LEAP into warp drive. The stars ahead shift, streak,
colors pulsating and changing as the shift exceeds the
wave lengths of the light spectrum -- and the stars
congeal into a MASS ahead.
127
128
Enterprise has been caught in a matter-time distortion,
sucked into a cylindrical "hole in space" (the Worm-
hole distortion), stars and planets become strange,
elongated shapes, with the Enterprise drawn deeper
and deeper into the vortex.
129
135
as the starship's photon torpedo tubes EJECT GLOWING
BALLS OF LIGHT ENERGY, which seems to float toward the
oncoming asteroid, almost too slowly. And in these
brief seconds, the asteroid hurtles at the Enterprise,
the huge pitted rock growing even larger than the ship
itself. It FILLS THE SCREEN, as the photon torpedoes
hit, disintegrating the asteroid into thousands of
fragments. Instantly, these fragments pulverize them-
selves on the ship's forward forcefield and deflector
screens. The smaller pieces burn up on impact, clearly
outlining the ship's forcefield barriers.

traveling at a rapid speed; it carries warp-capacity
nacelles which dwarf the smaller

shuttle fuselage. The CAMERA HOLD ON THE SHUTTLE
as it overtakes the Enterprise, the ENTERPRISE COM-
ING INTO VIEW, and the shuttle slowing and beginning
to move between the starship's giant nacelles.
147
147
THE ENTERPRISE AND THE SHUTTLE (S)
About the size of a fighter airplane floating in over
the vastness of an aircraft carrier. The shuttle
slows further, hovering now. Then its fuselage pod
detaches from the warp drive nacelles -- the pod
moving slowly but precisely toward the starship's
command airlock.

The WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT speeds toward the Enterprise,
which veers sharply away now -- but WHIPLASH FOLLOWS.
166
169
The SHEET OF WRITHING-GREEN ENERGY enveloping the
entire vessel, outlining it starkly. (And outlining,
too, the forcefield screens and deflectors -- batter-
ing at them, seeking some gap through which to
penetrate.)
170
177
The Cloud ever closer to the ship now, which is a mere
dot in space compared to the immensity of the energy-
seething, continuous color-exploding Cloud. And then,
suddenly, from the Cloud -- ANOTHER WHIPLASH ENERGY
BOLT. Bearing down upon the Enterprise.
178
181
The WHIPLASH BOLT streaking toward the ship.
182

as the Enterprise slowly enters deeper toward the chamber
ahead. We SEE the sheer size of the Cloud as opposed to
that of the small ship now entering unknown territory.
As the Enterprise enters the Cloud:

204
CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a
parallel--closing course -- Alien continues to GROW
IN SIZE. Although it already seems an impossibly
large vessel compared to the Enterprise, in reality
they are still tens of thousands of kilometers apart;
the incredible size of the Alien is nowhere near being
realized yet.
204A
205
The Alien Object appears A DOZEN TIMES LARGER THAN
ENTERRISE and still GROWING IN SIZE.
We begin to SEE Alien exterior detailing which had
not even been suspected at a longer distance.
The Enterprise is now quartering in toward the
Intruder, coming closer and closer. The Alien
vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more,
its exterior appears to be made of substances never
before seen by a human eye -- substances considered
possible only in the wildest flights of scientific
theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard
in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles,
crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of
shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.
205A
ANGLE ON INTRUDER
205A
This time, the Enterprise travels on away from us, as
its course takes it angling nearer and nearer the
gigantic Alien Intruder -- the Starship dwindling in
size, growing smaller, smaller, smaller... until it
is a tiny dot compared to the enormity of the Alien
vessel.
206
235
the starship being pulled toward the giant as though
on a taut cable. As we MOVE CLOSER, we SEE still more
intricate details of the incredible Alien design.
236
239
At the forward end of the giant, an odd-shapped "iris"
begins opening menacingly. And it is frighteningly
obvious that the tractor beam is pulling the Enterprise
to the opening.
240
244
Enterprise now being pulled past the opening -- into
the ship proper. Now we can SEE that the dark void
is actually a vast chamber, dimly and intermittently
lit by POWERFIELDS appearing and vanishing along the
vessel's inner walls, which are miles away in the
distance. And here and there in the chamber gigantic
ENERGY DISPLAYS erupt briefly with a certain symmetry
that suggests they must be part of V'ger's ower or
control systems.
245
246
The starship is pulled inside, the "iris" is closing
behind it.
247
350
The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
more active than anything we have previously seen.
Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema-
nate and converge there. The medium from which the
ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it
seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine-
like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the
booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in
ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:

INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER
350A
The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's
interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being
pulled toward the brain complex. All are somewhat sub-
dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but
at the same time they also realize there is no other
way. The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as,
in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew
comments:

His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his
facial features, but we can discern him struggling to
contain his feelings.
352
WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK, McCOY, AND DECKER)
352
Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk
now turning toward Spock.
KIRK
Spock... Spock...
Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary
annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted.
Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and
steps up to:
353
SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.)
353
as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from
him, clearly distracted.
KIRK
(starts)
Mr. Spock -- I think...
Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA
so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:
A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek.
Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has
also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward
Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he
addresses Spock:
KIRK
(quiet, feeling)
Not for us?
SPOCK
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then
continues:
SPOCK
(continuing)
I weep for V'ger, as I would for
a brother -- far more knowledgeable
than I -- and yet one step behind.
354
ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER
354
Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's
face compassion and understanding, with Decker step-
ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:
SPOCK
As I was -- when I came aboard...
so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
Searching. Logic and knowledge are
not enough.
McCOY
(with empathy)
Spock, are you saying that you
found, what you needed -- but V'ger
hasn't?
SPOCK
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because
of what we are planning... will not...
KIRK
(almost hard)
There is no alternative.
DECKER
(gently pressing)
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need
to fulfill itself?
SPOCK
V'ger has begun to understand the
true limits of our universe,
thereby realizing the existence
of other dimensions. To fulfill
itself it must evolve to a
higher dimension; V'ger believes
this can be achieved only by
joining with the Creator.
SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE)
Each of us, at some time in our
life, turns to someone, a father,
a brother, a God and asks 'Why
am I here?' 'What was I meant
to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its
Creator to find its answers.
355
ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER
355
as Decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en-
lightenment, as Kirk Says:
KIRK
(understanding)
'Is this all that I am? Is there
nothing more?
ON DIFALCO
reacting to the (O.S.) viewer, AD-LIBBING a terse:
DIFALCO
Captain...!
PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER
where another opening is suddenly visible -- another
chamber. But the violent and color energy effects of
the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead,
the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical,
with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we
move closer.
SPOCK
(flat)
Captain, I believe that is our
destination.
356
356
COMPLEX
This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced
throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all
ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise
continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a
small "island." Floating in the exact center of the
hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT,
with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and
COLORS. On the "island," vague at this distance, ap
pears to be a "solid" matter form.
357
359
The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" --
slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the
tractor beam. The "solid matter" in the "island" cen-
ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating
from that area. The Enterprise is now nearly at the
"island" edge.
360
382
It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant,
graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
dimension, vanishing.
383
383
The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's
massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting,
graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence
into another dimension.
And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like
point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals
there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
384
385
Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as
the starship heads out the other direction.
FADE OUT.
THE END
