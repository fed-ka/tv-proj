Dark clouds passing overhead.
The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..

AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
international TV commentators in different languages.
COMMENTATORS
...in places the track is still
dangerously wet, but following a
drivers meeting the decision has been
taken. The race is going ahead...

We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major

Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
Minute"...
Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.
NIKI
This is bullshit. We have no control
over our legacy. We cannot choose what
we are remembered for...
A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...
MECHANIC
Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
anche tu?
(Mass is going on slicks. You
want to change?)
NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.
NIKI
Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
my rivalry with this asshole. And the
1976 season.
NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...
NIKI
What about Hunt? Has he changed?
MECHANIC
No, he's going on wets.
The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..
The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.
NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..
NIKI
I don't know why it became such a big
thing. We were just drivers. Busting
each other's balls. To me this is
perfectly normal. But other people saw
it differently.

NIKI (contd)
That whatever it was between us went

Forever.
NIKI stares, then...
NIKI
Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da
bagnato.
(Then we go on wets, too.)
The ten-second board is held up.
NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
split-second, eyes staring...
NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
RPM.
NIKI
Maybe that explains the state of mind
I was in. And why it happened. The
other thing I'm remembered for.
(a beat)
On August 1st, that same year...
CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".
The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.
NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..
NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.
His arch-rival. HUNT.
But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.
NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
change tyres...
NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
one end...

JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his
battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the
mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..
NURSE
I've never been to a Grand Prix
before.
JAMES
You still haven't. This is Formula 3.
NURSE
What's that?
JAMES
A lower division. Where people like me
mess about in the hope of finding
sponsors or being talent-spotted to
race in Formula 1.
JAMES leads the NURSE into...

Bubbles, our chief mechanic.
BUBBLES

HESKETH
How do you do?
NURSE
Fine, thanks. Blimey...is everyone in

HESKETH
Glass of champagne, Nursie?
NURSE
It's Gemma. No, thanks.
HESKETH
You sure? It's Krug. Clos de Mesnil.
NURSE
It's also ten in the morning.

The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where
BUBBLES is making last minute checks...
NURSE
That's the car?
BUBBLES
That's her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the
Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.
She's no beauty. But goes like the
clappers.
An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with
yellow strips along the side and James's name in small
letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.
JAMES
Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.
The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.
She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...
HESKETH
Nothing to be worried about! Does it
before every race! Good sign,
actually. Means he's stoked!
14

JAMES continues vomiting...
JAMES (V/O)
There's a lie that all drivers tell
themselves. "Death is something that
happens to other people." That's how
you find the courage to get in the car
in the first place...
JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...
HESKETH
All right, Superstar?
JAMES
Never better, Patron.
JAMES (V/O)
Because bad things only happen to
others, right?
HESKETH
Have a gargle with this.

JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then

any moment.
HESKETH
Quick toke of this...
HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a
huge lungful from....
JAMES (V/O)
So how do you make that terror go
away? Well, booze is good for that.
And wacky baccy. But better than
everything else is...sex.
JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,
then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.
JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM
as the engine starts...
HESKETH
Ahhhh! What music! They could never
have predicted it, those pioneers that
invented the automobile that it would
possess us like this, in our
imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men
love women...but even more than that,
men love CARS...

JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already
unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in
the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".
JAMES
All bloody Goosesteppers.
16

JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.
NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second
bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No
right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.
Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..
JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to
slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...
17

HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the
sidelines...
BUBBLES
That move was suicide!
HESKETH
It was also quite brilliant!! God he's
got balls!!

JAMES carries on driving. Flat out.
But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his
car has 50 bhp more.
And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the
Englishman beaten..
JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful
madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...
...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's
car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.
NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal
spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right
way...
(CONTINUED)

...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to
change gears, and continue driving...
NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing
THE WRONG WAY on the track...
NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow,
like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...
NIKI
Umgotteswillen...
NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car,
when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.
NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....
"SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it
would have killed him instantly).
"WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...
"CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...
Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...
NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.
He rips off his helmet, furious...
And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp-
featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.
Something unmistakably rat-like about him.

JAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and
HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with
champagne..
NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and
shouts out, still incandescent...
NIKI
Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had
that corner...
JAMES
You mean the one you spun out of? And
finished facing the other way? I think
that corner had you.

JAMES
But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your
impeccable `survival' instincts...
JAMES makes chicken noises...
NIKI
Fuck you! What's your name?
HESKETH
James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it,
my little Jerry friend. Because one
day he will be World Champion.
JAMES
Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple.
"Hunt". It rhymes with....
"BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word
insult...
JAMES
...a word that happens to describe you
perfectly.
Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".
The NURSE watches NIKI go..
NURSE
Who was that?
JAMES
No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad
loser. Forget him.
NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..

AGNES
Hi. There's someone here for you?
NIKI
(prompting)
Lauda.
AGNES
(misunderstanding, speaking
louder)
SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.
She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.
AGNES
They'll be right here.
NIKI
Thank you.
A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI
watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...
NIKI
Worked here long?
AGNES
Excuse me?
NIKI
Just wondered if you've worked here
long?
AGNES
Almost eight years.
NIKI
That long? And they didn't promote you
yet?
AGNES
Yes, several times. I am the AGNES.
Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for
the receptionist, she's on her lunch.
NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to
say something when the door opens, and...
Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,
they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.
What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
What have you done to the weather?
They make her laugh. And smile.
NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
him.
As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
other DRIVERS. Intrigued.
He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.
31

The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the
car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...
STANLEY
Niki, let me introduce you to our
number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and
our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..
The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY
REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands.
STANLEY
And these are your mechanics,
reporting exclusively to you. As per
contract...
REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes
hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.
MECHANIC
You want to see the car?
32
32
NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro
sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just
above the driver's helmet...
MECHANIC
There she is. The P160..
NIKI
Same as Regazzoni's?

MECHANIC
Identical in every detail.
NIKI scrutinizes the car...
NIKI
She looks heavy. How much does she
weigh?
MECHANIC
540 kilos.
NIKI
That's crazy. Why so heavy..?
MECHANIC
It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing
weighs 190k alone.
NIKI
What horsepower are you getting out of
it?
MECHANIC
450.
NIKI
Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the
engine needs to be 20k lighter.
MECHANIC
We already tried...
NIKI
Did you use magnesium parts?
The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...
33
34
Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop
open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.
NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...
NIKI
OK. Thank you. Good night..
But they're exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.
35
35
LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...
NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-
testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and
several MECHANICS are doing the timings...
NIKI
What was his time?
STANLEY
Two minutes six seconds.
NIKI
OK. Now put him in my car, and he'll
go round under two minutes.
STANLEY
Six seconds faster? Impossible.
NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again
on the other side of the track.
NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his
eyebrow. Surprised.
36

REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.

REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.
REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car. LOUIS
STANLEY looks at the stop watch..
His expression changes.

CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by
the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.
He removes his helmet, then stops.
In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive
TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..

To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..
A helicopter comes in to land.
The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue
of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...
A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)
providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...
STIRLING MOSS
...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh
and his team of upper class
enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the
racing community, or just comedy...
They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander's
jacket reads, "Le Patron". He speaks to MOSS.
Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise,
curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..
STIRLING MOSS
It's certainly the first time I can
remember seeing a butler serving
caviar and oysters in the pits...
Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has
happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...
STIRLING MOSS
(holding ear-piece)
...reports are reaching me of a
serious accident that has just taken
place in qualifying....
All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash.
Panic breaks out.
The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the
accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.

The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies

A goldfish-bowl of blood.
It's a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even
hardened medical professionals...
JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.
But they are kept away, at a distance...
STIRLING MOSS
...it seems the driver...just twenty-
six years old....was killed on
impact...and the death toll in Formula
1 shows no sign of slowing down...

JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car. Other DRIVERS

that working out, by the way?
NIKI
Fine. How's it at the back?
JAMES
Not planning on being there for long.
NIKI
Good. Look forward to you showing me

MARLENE

No. Apart from the rear brakes are

Nothing I can do here. The car needs a

MARLENE
I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are

MARLENE gets to her feet...
MARLENE
C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll
never get out of here. We're in Italy,

MARLENE
Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it,
you're impressed..!
MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian
MEN driving the open-topped sports car..
MARLENE
Ciao, Regazzi...!
But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if
she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...
ITALIAN MAN
(in Italian)
Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?
NIKI
Yes.
ITALIAN MAN
(in Italian)
Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was
him..!!!
(blown away)
Do you need a ride?
NIKI
Yes, we do...
The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads
MARLENE's luggage inside...
ITALIAN MAN
An honour, please!!! But on one
condition..
The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear. MARLENE stares, not
understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly
gets into the car. He starts the engine.
MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with
the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..
MARLENE

MARLENE
Him? Never. Impossible!
ITALIAN MAN
Why?
MARLENE
Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are
sexy, have shirts open to here..
MARLENE indicates...
MARLENE
Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!
Like an old man!!
It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.
NIKI
No need to drive fast. It only
increases the percentage of risk.
We're not in a hurry. No one is paying
me. Right now, with zero incentive or
reward, why would I drive fast?
MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...
MARLENE
(in German)
Because I'm asking you to.
NIKI
(in German)
And do you always get what you want?
MARLENE
(in German)
Usually.
NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a
lightning double-declutch...
"SLAM", NIKI's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the
rev counter flies to the right...

The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life
as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to
breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...
NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving
between cars at twice their speed..
We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers
scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other
cars on the motorway...
His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...

Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique,
maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke

Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking
effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag.
Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI
LAUDA has become world champion...

He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is
pulled away to talk to someone else..
JAMES
Congratulations.
NIKI
Thank you.
JAMES
Though with a car like that, the rest
of us never stood a chance...
NIKI
Maybe the fact the car is so good
might have something to do with me.
JAMES
You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm
still in a Hesketh. On equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat
you, and you know it.
NIKI
Never. You might get lucky and win one
race. Maybe two. Because you're
aggressive. But in the long run, over
the course of a season, no chance.
JAMES
Why's that?
NIKI
Because you're not serious. You're
just a party guy. Which is why
everyone likes you.
JAMES
Now try saying that and tell me you're
not jealous.

NIKI
Right..
JAMES
Not even his own team-mates..
NIKI
Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't
screw up. I go to bed early. I look
after myself, look after my car. And
then, soon as the race is finished, I
go home. You should go home more
often, too. I heard you got married.
JAMES
I did.
NIKI
So where is she?
JAMES
In New York. Working.
NIKI
You know I've never seen you with her,

NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..

JAMES
Has Niki changed?
CALDWELL
No. He's going on wets.

car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black
scars on the asphalt..
JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,
but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,
gaining fast.
JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white
helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.
MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses

NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The
horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going

NIKI
Wow. It's that bad, huh?
JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.
NIKI
In the hospital I told them to tell me
straight, no bullshit - how bad it
would be. My appearance. They said
with time it'd be fine. But it won't.
I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am
going to spend the rest of my life

Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies
become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives.
THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..
The moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand.
THE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF.
188
HUNT's foot hits the floor. NIKI's foot hits the floor...
JAMES gets the better start. His car aquaplanes like crazy,
skating over the water, totally out of control...
189
CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...
CALDWELL
Hold onto it, James..!
190
Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...
The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other
cars are wrapped inside it...
But JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down..
COMMENTATOR (V/O)
It's the perfect start for Hunt!
192
JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes
again...badly...almost losing it completely...
COMMENTATOR (V/O)
Hunt turns too tightly! He almost lost
his car right there...!
197
JAMES continues to race flat out. Engine screaming. Foot to
the floor. His car aquaplanes again...almost skidding out...
199
A sign is held up as JAMES races. Lap 39.
But there are problems with the car. One of the tyres...
CALDWELL
God! His front tyre! Look! It's
completely frayed!
CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on
TV. They can see the shaking car..
COMMENTATOR
Hunt's car has problems...it's
shaking...the Englishman is definitely
getting slower...
199A
ALASTAIR CALDWELL holds up a sign....
CHANGE TYRE
COMMENTATOR
...with just a few laps to go, McLaren
are calling for Hunt to come into the
pits to change tyres...
JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...
COMMENTATOR
But Hunt is refusing! Simply ignoring
his team's orders...! He's made the
calculation that he can still hold
onto the lead...!
99
200
JAMES's car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For
refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool.
But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging...
JAMES
I'm sorry!
But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.
The world's media descends on JAMES...
MAYER
Sorry?? What are you talking about??
You did it!
(CONTINUED)
100
200 CONTINUED:
200
JAMES
What?
MAYER
You WON!!
JAMES
Rubbish!! What about Niki?? He
overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari
with a red helmet..
MAYER
That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni.
JAMES
What???
MAYER
Niki withdrew. Said it was too
dangerous, refused to drive!!
(gestures)
You're Champion of the World, kiddo!
TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his
car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.
JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.
200D
JAMES is embraced by CALDWELL and MAYER.
201
Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.
JAMES looks over to see...
NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the
ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES
surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc
MARLENE
Are you OK?
NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.
NIKI
Fine. It's just one race.
The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...
202
JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then
turns to see...
...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest
party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..
In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving
interviews again. They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI
got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came
9th...
And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the
snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.
203 A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE
203
Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative
endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.
JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.
His movie star looks make him an international STAR and
marketing man's dream.
Girls, more girls, and even more girls.

203 CONTINUED:

JAMES, dashing in a white suit, plays trumpet on the UK's most
famous talk show...
FADE TO BLACK:
204
We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.
CAPTION: "THREE MONTHS LATER"
A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.
A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy
FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...
They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,
passing other jets, when JAMES stops.
He's seen something that has caught his eye.
JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and
walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...
JAMES
I heard you were spending more and
more time in one of these...
A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's
NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a
painful sight...
NIKI
Do you fly?
JAMES
No.
NIKI
You should try it. If something goes
wrong up there, you're on the edge,
but have to stay within the rules.
Stick to regulations. Suppress the
ego. It's good discipline for the
racing.
JAMES
And there I was thinking you were
about to wax lyrical about the romance
of flight. I should have known better.
NIKI
What brings you here?
(CONTINUED)
103
204 CONTINUED:
204
JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..
JAMES
A friend's wedding. At least I think
it was a wedding. Might have been a
birthday. All a bit of a blur. How
about you? Been at Fiorano?
NIKI
Pre-season testing.
JAMES
Already? In February? You're
relentless.
NIKI
Thank you.
JAMES
I'm not sure I meant it as a
compliment.
NIKI
But it is one. Relentlessness is good.
Means you're a fighter. That you never
give up. Behind my back I know some of
you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
look like one. It's meant as an
insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are
ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But
they're intelligent. With a strong
survival instinct.
JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.
NIKI
So when do you start testing? Next
week?
JAMES
Are you mad? I didn't just win the
biggest thing of my life so I could
get right back to work.
NIKI
Why? You need to. To prove to all the
people who will always say you only
won it because...
JAMES
Because what...? Because of your
accident? Is that other people, Niki?
Or you? I won. On the all important
day when it came down to it, we raced
on equal terms in equally good cars.

204 CONTINUED: (2)
204
JAMES (contd)
You bottled and I had the guts to see
it through.
NIKI
It's true. You won that race. And
believe me if I had to lose that title
to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But
that doesn't change the fact you have
to win again.
JAMES
Why?
NIKI
Because that's what it means to be a
winner, no? It's a permanent
condition. Never stops or goes away.
It stays with you always.
JAMES
That's winning? Sounds like losing to
me. Some of life needs to be for
pleasure, Niki. What's the use of
having a million cups and medals if
you never have any fun? How is that
winning?
The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"
NIKI
You're right. I could learn from you.
In hospital the toughest part of my
treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
While doing it, I was watching
television...you winning all those
races...and I was cursing you.. "That
bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
that guy." one day the doctor said,
"Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
to have been given an enemy in life.
It can be a blessing, too." I said,
"Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends." And you
know, he's right. Look at us. We were
a pair of kids when we first met.
Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
nowhere. Now we're both Champions of
the world. Not bad.
JAMES
No, not bad.

204 CONTINUED: (3)

NIKI
So don't let me down now. I need you
busting my balls. Get back to work.
JAMES
I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy
myself first. And so should you. You
think you can?
NIKI stares. A blank look..
JAMES
See you on race day, Champ.
NIKI
You will. Champ.
JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his
laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his
eyes.
Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.
205
JAMES's plane roars down the runway and takes off into the
azure blue sky...
FADE TO BLACK:
CAPTION: "JAMES RETURNED THE FOLLOWING SEASON, BUT WAS NEVER A
CHALLENGER AGAIN. HE RETIRED IN 1979. AFTER SHORT CAREERS IN
BROADCASTING AND BUDGIE BREEDING HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.
AGED 45."
CAPTION: "NIKI LAUDA WENT ON TO BECOME WORLD CHAMPION IN 1977.
AND AGAIN IN 1984. HE NOW RUNS A SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL
AIRLINE. HE STILL CLAIMS TO HAVE NO FRIENDS."
