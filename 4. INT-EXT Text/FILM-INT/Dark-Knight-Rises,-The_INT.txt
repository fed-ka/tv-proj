Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.
The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.
CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.
CIA MAN
What are you doing in the middle of
my operation?
3.
Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
The flight plan I just filed with
the Agency lists me, my men, and
Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
you.
CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.
CIA MAN
FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)
SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.
PAVEL?!
Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.
CIA MAN
HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO
TRY NEXT?!
The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.
CIA MAN
TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE
WEAR THE MASK?!
The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.
CIA MAN
LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!
THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
Or he's wondering why someone would
shoot a man before throwing him out
of an aeroplane.
CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.
CIA MAN
Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
talk. Who are you?
THIRD PRISONER
We are nothing. We are the dirt
beneath your feet. And no one cared
who I was until I put on the
mask...
CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.
4.
BANE
Who we are does not matter. What
matters is our plan.
CIA MAN
(FASCINATED)
If I pull this off, will you die?
BANE
It would be extremely painful.
CIA MAN
You're a big guy -
BANE
For you.
CIA MAN
(UNNERVED)
Was being caught part of your plan?
BANE
Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours. We had to
know what he told you about us.
DR. PAVEL
Nothing! I said nothing!
CIA MAN
Why not just ask him?
BANE
He would not have told us.
CIA MAN
You have methods.
BANE
Him, I need healthy. You present no
such problem.
CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.
The plane lurches. The noise is building.
SERGEANT
Sir?
CIA MAN
Well congratulations, you got
yourselves caught. What's the next
step of your master plan?
BANE
Crashing this plane...
The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
above. CIA Man looks at Bane.
BANE
(RISING)
With no survivors.
A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
outside the window. Bang -
The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward.
6.
Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.
Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
by Dr. Pavel.
An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.
Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
body...
An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.
7.
BANE
Friend. They expect one of us in
the wreckage.
The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.
HOODED MAN 2
Have we started the fire?
BANE
(NODS)
The fire rises.
Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.
BANE
Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
fear...
Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.
BANE
That comes later.
Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
and we -
CUT TO:
Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.
MAID 2
They say he never leaves the East
Wing.
MAID 3
I heard he had an accident - that
he's disfigured.
The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.
ALFRED
Mr. Till, why are your people using
the main stairs?
Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.
ALFRED
Where's Mrs. Bolton?
MAID
She's up at the bar, sir. Can I
help?
Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.
ALFRED
The East drawing room. Unlock the
door, place the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.
12.
The Maid nods. Takes the tray.
Following the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the
large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it...
The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the
table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar...
Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.
ALFRED
I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
tried. He won't see you.
MIRANDA
It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
Her accent is European. Hard to place.
ALFRED
Mr. Wayne is as determined to
ignore important things as trivial
ones.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Don't take it personally, Miranda.
They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.
DAGGETT
Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
there with eight-inch nails, peeing
into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
of you to let me on the grounds.
ALFRED
The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
always a pleasure.
Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.
13.
DAGGETT
Why waste your time talking to the
man who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity
project? He can't help you get your
money back. But I can.
MIRANDA
I could try explaining that a
save-the-world project, vain or
not, is worth investing in,
whatever the return. I could try,
Mr. Daggett, but you understand
only money and the power you think
it buys, so why waste my time,
indeed?
She walks away. Daggett watches her go.
Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
something. He slowly limps into the next room...
The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
bow. Picks up his cane.
MAID
I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.
MAID
Although you don't have the long
nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
scars...
She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
WAYNE
Is that what they say about me?
14.
MAID
It's just that...nobody sees you...
Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.
WAYNE
That's a beautiful necklace.
Reminds me of the one that belonged
to my mother. It can't be the same
one - her pearls are in this safe -
He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
bureau, revealing a safe door...
- which the manufacturer clearly
explained is uncrackable.
...which swings open with an awkward creak.
MAID
Oops. No one told me it was
uncrackable.
The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.
WAYNE
I'm afraid I can't let you take
those.
She smiles at him. Moves towards him.
MAID
Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
more than I would beat up a
cripple.
She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
Of course, sometimes exceptions
have to be made.
The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...
Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.
ALFRED
Miss Tate was asking to see you
again.
WAYNE
She's very persistent.
ALFRED
And quite lovely, in case you were
wondering.
WAYNE
I wasn't.
ALFRED
What are you doing?
WAYNE
Examining print dust. We've been
robbed.
ALFRED
And this is your idea of raising
the alarm?
WAYNE
(SHRUGS)
She took the pearls. Tracking
device and all.
ALFRED
She?
WAYNE
One of the maids, perhaps you
should stop letting them in this
side of the house.
16.
ALFRED
Perhaps you should learn to make
your own bed, then. Why are you
dusting for prints?
WAYNE
I'm not. She was.
Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.
ALFRED
Master Wayne?
Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.
Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.
Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.
Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.
ALFRED
You haven't been down here in a
long time...
WAYNE
Just trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints
from the photos she handled -
Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
suspect.
- but she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints. She's good.
ALFRED
She may be. But we have the trace
on the necklace.
WAYNE
We do, so I cross-referenced the
address she went back to with
police data on high-end
B-and-E's...
Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
Selina Kyle. The databases are full
of close calls, tips from fences...
19.
Newspaper headlines appear -
THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL
HEIST.
WAYNE
She's good, but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet.
ALFRED
We should send the police before
she fences the pearls.
WAYNE
She won't. She likes them too much.
And they weren't what she was
after.
ALFRED
What was she after?
WAYNE
My fingerprints. There was printer
toner mixed with graphite on the
safe. Gives you a good pull, and
it's untraceable.
ALFRED
Fascinating. Maybe you should
exchange notes over coffee.
WAYNE
Now you're trying to set me up with
a jewel thief?
ALFRED
At this point, sir, I would set you
up with a chimpanzee if I thought
it would bring you back into the
world.
WAYNE
There's nothing out there for me.
ALFRED
And that's the problem. You hung up
the cape and cowl, but never moved
on. You won't get out there and
find a life. Find someone -
WAYNE
(BITTER)
I did find someone, Alfred.
20.
ALFRED
I know. And then you lost them.
That's part of living, sir. But
you're not living - you're waiting.
Hoping for things to go bad again.
Wayne says nothing.
Remember when you left Gotham?
Before all this. Before Batman.
Seven years you were gone. Seven
years I waited. Hoping that you
wouldn't come back.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
Every year I took my holiday. I'd
go to Florence. There's a caf by
the Arno... Any fine evening I
would sit there and order a Fernet
Branca...
INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a caf sipping his drink...
I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
that one day I'd look across the
tables, and see you. Sitting there
with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
You wouldn't say anything to me, or
me to you, but we'd both
know...that you'd made it. That you
were happy.
INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
I never wanted you to come back to
Gotham. I knew there was nothing
there for you but pain and tragedy,
and I wanted more for you than
that. I still do.
Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.
Blake is talking to Father Reilly.
FATHER REILLY
Jimmy hadn't been here for months.
BLAKE
Why?
FATHER REILLY
You know why, Blake - he aged out.
We don't have the resources to keep
boys on after sixteen -
BLAKE
The Wayne Foundation gives money
for that -
FATHER REILLY
Not for two years now.
BLAKE
He has a brother here, right?
FATHER REILLY
Mark. I'll tell him.
BLAKE
I'd like to, if that's okay.
22.
Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.
STRYVER
You brought a date?
SELINA
I like having someone around to
open doors for me.
Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.
SELINA
Right hand. No partials.
Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.
23.
STRYVER
Very nice.
He pockets the envelope.
SELINA
Not so fast, handsome. You got
something for me?
STRYVER
Oh, yes.
Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
joins them at the table. Selina smiles.
SELINA
I don't know what you're going to
do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
As Stryver checks the envelope again -
SELINA
You don't count so good, huh?
STRYVER
I count fine.
The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.
STRYVER
In fact, I'm counting to ten right
now...
Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
blinks.
SELINA
Okay, okay -
She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
SELINA
My friend is waiting outside. Just
hit 'send'...
Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.
24.
JEN
Place is a little dead.
SELINA
(takes envelope, tense)
It'll liven up in a minute, trust
me.
JEN
Everything okay?
SELINA
Great. Catch you later.
Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
SELINA
It would've been a lot easier to
just give me what we agreed.
STRYVER
We can't have loose ends. And even
in that dress, no one's going to
miss you.
SELINA
No. But my friend over there...?
Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...
SELINA
Every cop in the city's missing
him.
Across the bar, the TV on mute -
MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
Stryver looks at Selina.
STRYVER
Cute. But they're not gonna be
looking in a place like this.
SELINA
I don't know... You did just use
his cell phone.
Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs
25.
Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.
SWAT
It's alright, Miss. Just stay down
-
The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.
Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
bar, clutching his bleeding leg.
SELINA
Keep some pressure on that,
sweetheart.
She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
Moves for the door.
CONGRESSMAN
(WEAK)
Call me?
Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.
BLAKE
(INTO RADIO)
I've got the Congressman - bullet
to the leg, but he's okay.
Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
fall in behind...
27.
Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
tearing through the tunnels.
Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him
turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug.
Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.
THUG 1
This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
Jesus. It's the Police
Commissioner.
THUG 2
What do we do?
THUG 1
Take him to Bane.
The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
between two waterfalls, into -
They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...
BANE
Why are you here?
The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.
THUG 1
Answer him!
Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
29.
BANE
I'm asking you.
THUG 1
It's the Police Commissioner.
BANE
And you brought him down here?
THUG 2
We didn't know what to do. We -
BANE
You panicked. And your weakness
costs three lives.
THUG 1
No, he's alone -
Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.
BANE
Search him. Then I will kill you.
The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
the papers. Unfolds them...
As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...
THUG 2
He's dead.
Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...
BANE
Then show me his body.
THUG 2
That water runs to any one of the
outflows - we'd never find him.
Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
BANE
Give me your GPS.
Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.
30.
BANE
Follow him.
THUG 2
Follow him?
Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
Mercenary.
BANE
Track him. Make sure both bodies
will not be found. Then brick up
the south tunnel.
Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform.
BLAKE
I need to see Bruce Wayne.
ALFRED
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls. Even from police
officers.
BLAKE
And if I go get a warrant, in the
investigation of Harvey Dent's
murder? Would that still count as
unscheduled?
Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.
WAYNE
What can I do for you, officer?
BLAKE
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
31.
WAYNE
I'm sorry to hear that -
BLAKE
He chased a gunman down into the
sewers. When I pulled him out he
was babbling about an underground
army. A masked man called 'Bane'.
WAYNE
Shouldn't you be telling this to
your superior officers?
BLAKE
I did. One of them asked if he saw
any giant alligators down there. He
needs you. He needs the Batman.
WAYNE
If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
the Batman he must be in a bad way
-
BLAKE
He doesn't know or care who you
are. (Off look.) But we've met
before. When I was a kid. At the
orphanage. See, my mom died when I
was small. Car accident, I don't
really remember it. But a couple of
years later my dad was shot over a
gambling debt. I remember that just
fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
of people who know what it feels
like, do they? To be angry. In your
bones. People understand, foster
parents understand. For a while.
Then they expect the angry kid to
do what he knows he can never do.
To move on. To forget.
Wayne stares at Blake.
BLAKE
So they stopped understanding and
sent the angry kid to a boys' home
- St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
figured it out too late. You have
to hide the anger. Practice smiling
in the mirror. Like putting on a
mask. You showed up one day in a
cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
(MORE)
32.
BLAKE (CONT'D)
We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
billionaire orphan. We made up
stories about you. Legends. The
other boys' stories were just that.
But when I saw you I knew who you
really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
that look on your face. Same one I
taught myself.
Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.
BLAKE
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
believer in the Batman. Even if
you're not.
WAYNE
Why did you say your boys' home
used to be funded by the Wayne
Foundation?
BLAKE
Because the money stopped. Might be
time to get some fresh air and
start paying attention to the
details. Some of those details
might need your help.
Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away.
WAYNE
You checked that name? 'Bane' -
ALFRED
Ran it through some databases. He's
a mercenary. No other known name.
Never been seen or photographed
without a mask. He and his men were
behind a coup in West Africa that
secured mining operations for our
friend John Daggett.
WAYNE
Now Daggett's brought them here?
ALFRED
It would seem so. I'll keep
digging.
33.
Alfred turns to leave.
WAYNE
Why did the Wayne Foundation stop
funding boys' homes in the city?
ALFRED
The Foundation is funded from the
profits of Wayne Enterprises...
(Off look.) There have to be some.
WAYNE
Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
ALFRED
I'll get him on the phone -
WAYNE
No. Do we still have any cars
around the place?
ALFRED
(LIGHTS UP)
One or two.
WAYNE
And I need an appointment at the
hospital. About my leg.
ALFRED
Which hospital, sir?
WAYNE
Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.
Alfred is less excited by this part of the request.
Miranda is talking to Lucius Fox at the table.
34.
MIRANDA
I'm only asking for explanations
because I think I can help.
FOX
I'll pass along your request. Next
time I see him.
Miranda catches something in this.
MIRANDA
He doesn't talk to you either?
FOX
Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has
his...eccentricities.
MIRANDA
(RISING)
Mr. Fox, are you aware that John
Daggett is trying to acquire shares
in Wayne Enterprises?
FOX
I was not. But it wouldn't do him
any good - Mr. Wayne still retains
a clear majority.
Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
FOX
Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.
Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
FOX
What brings you out of cryo-sleep
Mr. Wayne?
WAYNE
I see you haven't lost your sense
of humor...even if you have lost
most of my money.
FOX
Actually, you did that yourself.
See, if you funnel the entire R and
D budget for five years into a
fusion project that you then
mothball, your company is unlikely
to thrive.
35.
WAYNE
Even with -
FOX
A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
Wayne Enterprises is running out of
time. And Daggett is moving in.
WAYNE
What're my options?
FOX
If you're not willing to turn your
machine on -
WAYNE
I can't, Lucius.
FOX
Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
Daggett at arm's length while we
figure out a future for the energy
program with Miranda Tate - she's
supported your project all the way.
She's smart, and quite lovely.
WAYNE
You too, Lucius?
FOX
We all just want what's best for
you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
WAYNE
I'll think it over.
FOX
Anything else?
WAYNE
No, why?
FOX
These conversations always used to
end with some...unusual requests.
WAYNE
I retired.
FOX
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.
Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
elevator.
36.
Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They
pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...
WAYNE
I figured you'd have shut this
place down.
FOX
It was always shut down,
officially.
WAYNE
But all this new stuff?
FOX
After your father died, Wayne
Enterprises set up fourteen
different defense subsidiaries.
I've spent years shuttering them
and consolidating all the
prototypes under one roof. My roof.
WAYNE
Why?
FOX
Stop them falling into the wrong
hands. Besides, I thought someone
might get some use out of them...
Wayne shakes his head.
FOX
Sure I can't tempt you to
something? Pneumatic crampons?
Infrared lenses? Least let me get
you something for that leg.
WAYNE
It's fine the use it gets these
days.
FOX
Well, then I have just the thing
for an eccentric billionaire who
doesn't like to walk...
Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
light up.
37.
WAYNE
Now you're just showing off.
FOX
Defense Department project for
tight-geometry urban pacification.
Rotors configured for maneuvering
between buildings without
recirculation.
WAYNE
What's it called?
FOX
It has a long and uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
took to calling it the Bat. And
yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
black.
Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
FOX
Works great except for the
autopilot.
WAYNE
What's wrong with that?
FOX
Software-based instability. Take a
better mind than mine to fix it.
WAYNE
Better mind?
FOX
I was trying to be modest. A less
busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
WAYNE
I told you. I retired, Lucius.
Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.
DOCTOR
I've seen worse cartilage in knees
-
38.
WAYNE
That's good -
DOCTOR
No, that's because there is no
cartilage in your knee. And not
much of any use in your elbows and
shoulders. Between that and the
scar tissue on your kidneys,
residual concussive damage to your
brain tissue and general
scarred-over quality of your
body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
cannot recommend that you go
heli-skiing. About the only part of
your body that looks healthy is
your liver, so if you're bored I
recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
Wayne.
Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -
Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...
GORDON
We were in this together. Then you
were gone...
WAYNE
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
We won.
GORDON
Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
there's evil rising from where we
tried to bury it. Nobody will
listen... The Batman has to come
back.
39.
WAYNE
What if he doesn't exist anymore?
GORDON
He must. He must.
Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.
Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.
JEN (O.S.)
I told you - money first -
YUPPIE (O.S.)
Goddammit, you took my wallet!
The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.
SELINA
Get out.
YUPPIE
She took my wallet!
Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
SELINA
Now.
She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.
SELINA
I told you not to try it with the
assholes, Jen.
JEN
They're all assholes.
40.
SELINA
Okay, the assholes who hit.
JEN
I don't know what he's so upset
about, he only had sixty bucks in
here.
SELINA
Probably the watch.
YOUNG WOMAN
Watch?
Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.
A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.
MIRANDA (O.S)
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
only concession to fancy dress.
WAYNE
Miss Tate, isn't it?
MIRANDA
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things...
WAYNE
True. Proceeds go to the big fat
spread, not the cause. It's not
about charity, it's about feeding
the ego of whichever society hag
laid it on.
MIRANDA
Actually, this is my party, Mr.
Wayne.
WAYNE
Oh.
MIRANDA
And the proceeds will go where they
should, because I paid for the big
fat spread myself.
WAYNE
That's very generous of you.
MIRANDA
You have to invest to restore
balance to the world. Take our
clean-energy project...
WAYNE
Sometimes the investment doesn't
pay off. Sorry.
42.
MIRANDA
You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
about the world doesn't spend half
his fortune on a plan to save it...
(Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
it fails that he goes into
hiding...
Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
MIRANDA
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
WAYNE
Mind if I cut in?
Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
Selina by the waist. She glares at him.
WAYNE
You don't seem very happy to see
me.
SELINA
You were supposed to be a shut-in.
WAYNE
Felt like some fresh air.
SELINA
Why didn't you call the police?
WAYNE
I have a powerful friend who deals
with this kind of thing. (Admires
her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
cat burglar.
SELINA
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
WAYNE
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
Who's your date?
SELINA
His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
diamonds behind, though. Worried
they'd get stolen.
43.
WAYNE
It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook not a social
climber.
SELINA
(flash of anger)
You think I care what anyone in
this room thinks about me?
WAYNE
I doubt you care what anyone in
this room thinks about you.
SELINA
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
don't know a thing about me.
WAYNE
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
here from your walk-up in Old Town
- modest place for a master jewel
thief. Which means either you're
saving for your retirement - or
you're in deep with the wrong
people.
SELINA
You don't get to judge me because
you were born in the master bedroom
of Wayne Manor.
WAYNE
Actually, I was born in the Regency
Room.
SELINA
I started off doing what I had to.
Once you've done what you had to
they'll never let you do what you
want to.
WAYNE
Start fresh.
SELINA
There's no fresh start in today's
world. Any twelve-year-old with a
cell phone could find out what you
did. Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.
We are the sum of our mistakes.
44.
WAYNE
Or our achievements.
SELINA
The mistakes stick better. Trust
me.
WAYNE
You think that justifies stealing?
SELINA
I take what I need to from those
who have more than enough. I don't
stand on the shoulders of people
with less.
WAYNE
Robin Hood?
SELINA
I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room.
Than you.
WAYNE
Maybe you're assuming too much.
SELINA
Or maybe you're being unrealistic
about what's really in your pants
other than your wallet.
WAYNE
Ouch.
SELINA
You think all this can last?
Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
SELINA
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
You and your friends better batten
down the hatches, because when it
hits you're all gonna wonder how
you ever thought you could live so
large and leave so little to the
rest of us.
WAYNE
Sounds like you're looking forward
to it.
45.
SELINA
I'm adaptable.
WAYNE
These pearls do look better on you
then they did in my safe...
Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
But I still can't let you keep
them.
The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.
RICH TWIT
(ANNOYED)
You scared her off.
WAYNE
Not likely.
Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the
engine.
Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back.
ALFRED
Just you, sir?
Wayne gives him a withering glare.
(MORE)
46.
ALFRED (CONT'D)
Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
little time to get back into the
swing of things.
Wayne dials his phone.
FOX (O.S.)
This is Fox.
WAYNE
Remember those 'unusual requests' I
used to make?
FOX (O.S.)
I knew it!
Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.
Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
Thermos.
ALFRED
You've got the wrong leg, sir.
WAYNE
You start with the good limb so it
learns your optimum muscle
patterns.
Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
- the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
Now we tighten it up.
Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.
ALFRED
It is terribly painful?
WAYNE
(GRITTED TEETH)
You're welcome to try it, Alfred.
ALFRED
Happy watching, thank you, sir.
Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
47.
WAYNE
Not bad -
Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
Not bad at all.
Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
Wayne across the bridge to the cube.
ALFRED
Master Wayne, if you're considering
going back out there you need to
hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
WAYNE
I'm all ears.
ALFRED
There is a prison. In a more
ancient part of the world. A pit.
Where men are thrown to suffer and
die. But sometimes, a man rises
from the darkness. Sometimes...the
pit sends something back.
WAYNE
Bane.
ALFRED
Born and raised in a hell on earth.
WAYNE
Born in a prison?
ALFRED
No one knows why. Or how he
escaped. But they know who trained
him one he did...R's al Ghl. Your
A U
mentor.
Wayne takes this in. Shocked.
ALFRED
He plucked Bane from a dark corner
of the earth and trained him in the
blackest disciplines of combat,
deception and endurance. Just like
you.
WAYNE
Bane was a member of the League of
Shadows.
48.
ALFRED
Until he was excommunicated. And a
man considered too extreme for R's
A
al Ghl is not to be trifled with.
U
WAYNE
I didn't realize I was known for
trifling with criminals.
ALFRED
That was then. And you can strap up
your leg and put the mask back on.
But it won't make you what you
were.
WAYNE
Which was?
ALFRED
Someone whose anger at death made
him value all life. Even his own.
WAYNE
If this man is all the things you
say he is, then this city needs me.
The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
ALFRED
Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
Your resources, your
knowledge...not your body. Not your
life. That time has passed.
WAYNE
I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
Alfred. And I failed.
ALFRED
You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
Batman, you can't afford to.
WAYNE
That's what you're afraid of - that
if I go back out there I'll fail.
ALFRED
No. I'm afraid that you want to.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.
49.
A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.
TRADER 2
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
TRADER 1
Wayne coming back is change. Change
is either good or bad.
TRADER 2
On what basis?
TRADER 1
I flipped a coin.
Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
there negotiating with a Trader.
TRADER 3
No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
Alright, I'll take it.
He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
face.
FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
a camera.) We need faces for
cameras.
In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
floor.
At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.
50.
In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.
Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
- clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...
TRADER 1
This is a stock exchange, there's
no money you can steal -
He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...
BANE
Why else would you people be here?
Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.
BANE
Enter your password. Or I send
these men to your home.
Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
it into the computer - figures race across the screen...
Shoeshine Man looks up from the laptop.
SHOESHINE MAN
They cut the fiber. Cell's working.
BANE
For now. How much longer does the
program need?
SHOESHINE MAN
Eight minutes.
52.
BANE
Time to go mobile.
Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack...
The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie
Cop looks up into his rear-view.
ROOKIE COP
What's going on with the lights?
The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are
dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the
darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die...
And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -
VETERAN COP
It can't be...
ROOKIE COP
The hell was that?!
VETERAN COP
Oh boy. You're in for a show
tonight, son.
The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass.
54.
Foley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command
station.
FOLEY
(INTO RADIO)
Call everyone in - every car
patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too!
Pull 'em in, close every street!
Now!
Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by.
FOLEY
I'm gonna do what Gordon never
could.
BLAKE
What's that?
FOLEY
I'm gonna take down the Batman.
BLAKE
Sir, what about the armed robbers?
Foley ignores him.
55.
A Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio.
SPOTTER
(INTO RADIO)
One bike's pulled off, no hostage -
Foley listens to the radio, hungry -
SPOTTER
(OVER RADIO)
Should we pursue?
FOLEY
Negative! Stay on the Batman!
BLAKE
But he's getting away!
FOLEY
(ANNOYED)
Who do you want to catch? Some
robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who
killed Harvey Dent?
Coverage of the pursuit blares from all the TVs, as Daggett
and Stryver watch. Tense.
TV ANNOUNCER
People aren't saying much -
frankly, they're too busy - but all
signs suggest that what we're
(MORE)
56.
TV ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
seeing is, in fact, the return of
the Batman...
Moving in on a shadow, crouched in front of Daggett's safe,
working the dial... The shadow slides up a pair of goggles
onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat
ears. It is Catwoman. She turns to the TV, watching the
pursuit.
CATWOMAN
Well, what do you know?
Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns.
Daggett angrily grabs some ice cubes for his drink.
DAGGETT
After eight years he has to pick
tonight...
STRYVER
He's drawing the cops off Bane...
Daggett watches, intrigued.
Foley shouts down the phone.
FOLEY
How did you let him go?!
COP
(OVER RADIO)
He's got a lot of firepower -
FOLEY
And you don't?! We're not letting
one nut with a bad attitude and
some fancy gadgets run this town
down, you hear me?!
COP
(OVER RADIO)
He's heading back downtown...
FOLEY
(EXCITED)
Then he's as dumb as he dresses -
close it down, gentlemen!
58.
Gordon, still hooked up to machines, watches TV. He smiles.
ANNOUNCER
(ON TV)
Police are keeping quiet about the
prospect of a return by the Batman,
but eyewitness accounts seem the
clearly suggests the type of...
59.
Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters.
STRYVER
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.
DAGGETT
What about the men they arrested?
STRYVER
He says, and I quote, they would
die before talking.
DAGGETT
(GRINS)
Where does he find these guys?
Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner
office.
Open the champagne...
Daggett comes through the door, calling back.
DAGGETT
And can we get some girls in here?
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Careful what you wish for.
Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back
slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! -
Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using
the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.
CATWOMAN
Cat got your tongue?
She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.
DAGGETT
You dumb bitch.
CATWOMAN
Nobody ever accused me of being
dumb.
60.
DAGGETT
Dumb to show up here tonight.
CATWOMAN
I want what you owe me -
Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.
DAGGETT
'I want' never gets...
Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
leg...
STRYVER
Nice outfit...those heels make it
tough to walk?
Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.
CATWOMAN
I don't know, do they?
Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.
CATWOMAN
So where is it?
DAGGETT
Where's what?
CATWOMAN
The program. The 'Clean Slate'.
DAGGETT
Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record. I don't
have it.
The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
window. He screams - they drop...
Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
Alfred brushes water off his suit.
ALFRED
Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
the neighbors you got yourself a
new leaf-blower?
64.
WAYNE
We bought all the neighbors.
Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.
ALFRED
From the look of the television
coverage, you seem to have your
taste for wanton destruction back.
WAYNE
(pulls out USB drive)
I retrieved this.
ALFRED
Shouldn't the police be gathering
the evidence?
WAYNE
They don't have the tools to
analyze it.
ALFRED
They would if you gave them to them
-
WAYNE
One man's tool is another man's
weapon.
ALFRED
In your mind, perhaps. But there
aren't many things you couldn't
turn into a weapon.
WAYNE
Alfred. Enough. The police weren't
getting it done -
ALFRED
Perhaps they would've if you
haven't made a sideshow of
yourself.
WAYNE
Perhaps you're upset you were
wrong.
ALFRED
Wrong?
65.
WAYNE
You thought I didn't have it in me.
Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
ALFRED
You don't. You lead a bloated
police force on a merry chase with
some fancy new toys from Fox. What
about when you come up against him.
What then?
Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...
WAYNE
I'll fight harder, I always have.
ALFRED
When you had something to fight
for. What are you fighting for now?
Not your life.
Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
hand.
ALFRED
Take a good look. At his speed, his
ferocity, His training. I see the
power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
see the League of Shadows
resurgent.
WAYNE
You said he was excommunicated.
ALFRED
By R's al Ghl. Who leads them
A U
now?
WAYNE
R's al Ghl was the League of
A U
Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's
just a mercenary, and we have to
find out what he's up to.
Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.
WAYNE
Trades of some kind. Coded...
The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.
66.
ALFRED
Is that -?
WAYNE
Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.
Wayne pulls out the USB, rises.
Get this to Fox - he can crack the
code and tell us what trades they
were executing.
Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.
As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls.
ALFRED
I'll get this to Fox. But no more.
Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.
ALFRED
I've sewn you up and set your
bones...but I won't bury you. I've
buried enough members of the Wayne
family.
WAYNE
You'd abandon me?
ALFRED
You see only one end to your story.
Leaving is all I have to make you
understand: you aren't Batman
anymore - you have to find another
way. You used to talk about
finishing. About life beyond that
awful cave -
WAYNE
Rachel died knowing we'd decided to
be together. That was my life
beyond this cave and I can't just
move on. She didn't. She couldn't.
Alfred considers this. Looks away.
ALFRED
What if he had? What if she wasn't
intending to make a life with you?
67.
WAYNE
She was, I can't change that -
ALFRED
What if, before she died, she'd
written a letter? Explaining that
she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
ALFRED
And what if, to spare you
pain...I'd burned that letter?
Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
WAYNE
Why would you say such a thing?
ALFRED
Because I have to make you
understand.
WAYNE
You're lying.
ALFRED
Because you are as precious to me
as you were to your own mother and
father and I swore to them that I
would protect you and I haven't.
WAYNE
You're lying!
ALFRED
I've never lied to you. Except when
I burned Rachel's letter.
Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
WAYNE
How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
ALFRED
I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
Maybe it's time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth and
just let it have its day. I'm
sorry.
68.
WAYNE
Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
world, then shake hands?!
ALFRED
No. I know what this means -
WAYNE
What does it mean, Alfred?!
ALFRED
It means your hatred. It means
losing the person I've cared for
ever since I heard his first cries
echo through this house. But it
might also mean saving your life.
And that is more important.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
say and says it quietly and calmly.
WAYNE
Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED
(QUIET)
Goodbye, Bruce.
Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.
Wayne is woken by the doorbell.
As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
gown, he can't resist one tentative.
WAYNE
Alfred?
But Alfred is gone.
Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.
69.
FOX
Answering your own door?
WAYNE
Yes. Could you decode the trades on
that drive?
Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:
BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...
FOX
I didn't need to. Page three.
Wayne turns the page:
WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...
FOX
It seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures
exchange. Verified by thumb print.
The options expired at midnight
last night.
Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.
FOX
Long term we may be able to prove
fraud, but for now...you're
completely broke. And Wayne
Enterprises is about to fall into
the hands of John Daggett.
WAYNE
The weapons - we can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences -
FOX
Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
and off the books. The energy
project is a different story.
WAYNE
Miranda Tate. We need to convince
the board to get behind her. Let's
show her the reactor -
FOX
We're meeting her there in
thirty-five minutes. You better get
dressed.
70.
Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.
FOX
Keep your hands and feet inside the
car at all times.
He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
as the office becomes an elevator into -
They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...
MIRANDA
This is it, isn't it?
FOX
The reactor is beneath the river so
that it could be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.
MIRANDA
Is Bruce Wayne really that
paranoid?
FOX
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
one.
Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
WAYNE
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.
71.
MIRANDA
No radiation, no fossil fuels.
Free, clean energy for an entire
city.
WAYNE
If it worked. It doesn't.
Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.
WAYNE
Ignition, yes. But no chain
reaction.
MIRANDA
You've built a lot of security
around a damp squib.
Nothing.
About three years ago a Russian
scientist published a paper on
weaponized fusion reactions. One
week later your reactor started
developing problems... (Looks at
Wayne.) I think this machine works.
WAYNE
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too
great.
MIRANDA
Would it make you feel better to
know that the Russian scientist
died in a plane crash six months
ago?
WAYNE
Someone else will work out what Dr.
Pavel did. Someone else will figure
out how to turn this power source
into a nuclear weapon. I need you
to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor.
MIRANDA
And to do what with it?
WAYNE
Nothing. Until we can find a way to
guarantee its safety.
72.
MIRANDA
And if we can't?
WAYNE
Decommission it. Flood it.
MIRANDA
Destroy the world's best chance for
a sustainable future?
WAYNE
If the world's not ready. Yes.
MIRANDA
Bruce, if you want to save the
world you have to start trusting
it.
WAYNE
I'm trusting you.
MIRANDA
Doesn't count. You have no choice.
WAYNE
I could've flooded this chamber any
time in the last three years. I'm
choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
that's not the easiest thing for
me. Please.
His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.
FOX
We have a board meeting to get to.
The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.
DAGGETT
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here. Highly
irregular, even if it is his family
name above the door...
All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
FREDERICKS
Bruce Wayne's family built this
COMPANY -
73.
BOARD MEMBER 2
And he himself has run it -
DAGGETT
Into the ground, sir. Anybody
disagree? Check the value of your
shares this morning. Gambling on
crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.
Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a
lot of money. He needs to leave.
FOX
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.
Wayne.
WAYNE
I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
DAGGETT
Let's get down to business.
FOX
Right away.
Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.
REPORTER
Wayne, how's it feel to be one of
the people?!
COMPANY VALET
I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork
-
Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.
BLAKE (O.S.)
Looks like you need a lift.
Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.
74.
Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.
DAGGETT
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne
board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
Was she sleeping with Wayne?
STRYVER
Not that we know of -
DAGGETT
Clearly you don't 'know of'
anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!
STRYVER
We told him it was urgent -
DAGGETT
Then where is the masked -
BANE (O.S.)
Speak of the devil...
Daggett turns. Bane is already there.
BANE
...and he shall appear.
DAGGETT
What the hell's going on?
BANE
The plan is proceeding as expected.
DAGGETT
You see me running Wayne
Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
Your stock exchange hit didn't
work, friend. And now you've got my
construction crews working all
hours around the city? How's that
supposed to help my company absorb
Wayne's?
BANE
(TO STRYVER)
Leave us.
75.
DAGGETT
You stay right there! I'm in
charge!
Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.
BANE
Do you feel in charge?
Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
DAGGETT
I've paid you a small fortune -
BANE
And that gives you power over me?
Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.
DAGGETT
What is this?
BANE
Your money and infrastructure have
been important. Till now.
DAGGETT
What are you?
BANE
Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
borrowed time you've all been
living on...
Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
hands...
DAGGETT
You are true evil...
BANE
I am necessary evil.
Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.
SCENE OMITTED
76.
Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
BLAKE
When you began...why the mask?
WAYNE
To protect the people closest to
me.
BLAKE
You're a loner with no family.
WAYNE
There are always people you care
about. You just don't realize how
much until they're gone. (Collects
himself.) The idea was to be a
symbol. Batman could be anybody,
that was the point.
BLAKE
It was damn good to see him back.
WAYNE
Not everybody agrees.
BLAKE
They'll figure it out in the end.
WAYNE
Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
BLAKE
Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
of tunnel records and a flashlight.
I could use some help.
WAYNE
(THINKS)
You know what? Drop me in Old
Town...
Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.
JEN (O.S.)
I told you, money first.
WAYNE (O.S.)
I don't think so.
Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.
SELINA
He's not a mark.
Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.
SELINA
And he doesn't have a cent to his
name, anyway.
Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
embarrassed.
SELINA
Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
it's more that you've got right
now.
WAYNE
Actually, they're letting me keep
the house.
SELINA
(SHAKES HEAD)
The rich don't even go broke same
as the rest of us, huh?
78.
WAYNE
(spots her bag)
Vacation?
SELINA
Let's just say that I've incurred
the wrath of some people less
susceptible to my charms than you.
WAYNE
My powerful friend hopes to change
your mind about leaving.
SELINA
And how would he do that?
WAYNE
By giving you what you want.
SELINA
It doesn't exist.
WAYNE
He says it does. He wants to meet.
Tonight.
SELINA
Why?
WAYNE
He needs to find Bane. He thinks
you'd know how.
SELINA
Tell him I'll think about it.
Wayne nods, starts to leave.
SELINA
Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all
your money.
WAYNE
No, you're not.
Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -
79.
Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.
FOLEY
Can we help you, officer?
BLAKE
John Daggett's body was found in a
dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
might like to know.
GORDON
Why?
BLAKE
Because Daggett's name is all over
the permits I pulled to map the
tunnels under Gotham.
Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
BLAKE
MTA maintenance, sewer
construction...
GORDON
(TO FOLEY)
Where did you get to with the
tunnel searches?
FOLEY
(TO BLAKE)
Remind me to tell the detail to
keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
We've had teams down there, but
it's a huge network -
GORDON
Get more men, work a grid. I want
him found.
FOLEY
Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
on it.
Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.
GORDON
This is good work. Lose the uniform
- you're working for me now. We
could use some hotter heads around
here.
80.
BLAKE
This could just be a coincidence.
GORDON
You're a detective now, son, you're
not allowed to believe in
coincidence anymore.
Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.
They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
rain.
MIRANDA
Fox worked the board like you've
never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
and he's not happy.
Wayne sets down the newspaper:
FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM
81.
WAYNE
Hope you don't like me for your
money.
Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
MIRANDA
Suffering builds character.
Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.
MIRANDA
I'll take care of your parents'
legacy, Bruce.
Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
MIRANDA
Who's this?
Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...
MIRANDA
Where's Alfred?
WAYNE
He left. Taking everything.
Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
MIRANDA
What's that?
WAYNE
(SHEEPISH)
I think my power's been shut off.
Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.
WAYNE
You're pretty good at that.
MIRANDA
When I was a child we had almost
nothing. But on the nights we had a
fire, we felt very rich indeed.
She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
82.
WAYNE
I assumed your family was wealthy.
MIRANDA
Not always. Not when I was young.
He traces a scar on her shoulder.
MIRANDA
An old mistake.
WAYNE
I've made a few myself.
She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
MIRANDA
More than a few... (Smiles.) We
could leave. Tonight. Take my
plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
WAYNE
Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.
Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
her for a moment, then slips out...
Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.
Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...
CATWOMAN
Don't be shy.
...Batman is there.
83.
CATWOMAN
Wayne says you can get me the
'Clean Slate'.
BATMAN
That depends.
CATWOMAN
On what?
BATMAN
On what you want it for. I acquired
it to keep it out of the wrong
hands.
CATWOMAN
Still don't trust me, huh? How can
we change that?
BATMAN
Start by taking me to Bane.
CATWOMAN
(SHRUGS)
You asked.
Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
into a service tunnel...
Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.
CATWOMAN
From here, Bane's men patrol the
tunnels...and they are not your
average brawlers.
BATMAN
Neither am I.
Catwoman swings into a -
A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.
CATWOMAN
He's behind you.
84.
MERCENARY
(SPINS)
Who?
Batman hangs upside down behind him.
BATMAN (O.S.)
Me.
Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
off his feet by darkness - he screams...
Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.
CATWOMAN
Just a little further.
A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
is deep inside.
Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.
CATWOMAN
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.
BATMAN
You've made a serious mistake.
BANE (O.S.)
Not as serious as yours, I fear.
Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.
BATMAN
Bane.
BANE
Let's not stand on ceremony here,
Mr. Wayne.
Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
his fist.
BANE
Peace has cost you strength.
Victory has defeated you.
85.
Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.
BANE
Theatricality and deception are
powerful agents...to the
uninitiated.
Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
BANE
But we are initiated, aren't we,
Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
you betrayed us...
BATMAN
Us? You were excommunicated. From a
gang of psychopaths.
BANE
Now I am the League of Shadows,
here to fulfill R's al Ghl's
A U
destiny...
Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.
Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...
BANE
You fight like a younger man.
Nothing held back. No reserves.
Admirable. But mistaken.
Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.
BANE
You think darkness is your ally.
But you merely adopted the dark. I
was born in it. Formed by it...
In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...
BANE
I didn't see the light until I was
already a man. And by then it was
nothing to me but blinding...
86.
Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
his grasp.
BANE
The shadows betray you, because
they belong to me...
Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...
BANE
I will show you where I've made my
home while preparing to bring
justice. Then...I will break you.
A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing:
Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.
BATMAN
No...
BANE
Your precious armory. Gratefully
accepted. We will need it.
Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment...
Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.
BANE
I wondered which would break first
- your spirit...
Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him
HIGH.
...or your body.
Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
with a horrific CRACK.
87.
In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
hollow eyes of his trophy...
Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.
The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
make-up.
UNIFORM
Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
ticket and identification, please.
Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.
SELINA
Would you mind?
88.
She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the
brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
head.
Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.
Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.
BLAKE
I showed your picture to the
Congressman and guess what?
SELINA
Don't tell me, still in love?
BLAKE
Head over heels. Pressing charges,
though.
Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
You've made some mistakes, Ms.
Kyle.
SELINA
Girl's gonna eat.
BLAKE
You have an appetite. Why run? You
can't hide from us with this
record.
SELINA
Maybe it's not you I'm running
from.
BLAKE
Who then? Bane? What do you know
about him?
SELINA
(QUIET)
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.
89.
BLAKE
We can offer you protection...
Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
off the tape, moves to the door.
BLAKE
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.
BLAKE
Did they kill him?
SELINA
I'm not sure.
And we -
CUT TO:
BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -
Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.
WAYNE
Why didn't you just kill me?
BANE
You don't fear death. You welcome
it. Your punishment is to be more
severe.
WAYNE
(SCATHING)
You're a torturer...
BANE
Yes. But not of your body. Of your
soul.
Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.
90.
WAYNE
Where am I?
BANE
Home.
Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
Where I learned the truth about
despair. As will you. (Rises.)
There is a reason that this prison
is the worst hell on earth...
Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
well...
Hope. Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries has looked up to
the light and imagined climbing to
freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
like shipwrecked men turning to sea
water from uncontrollable thirst,
many have died trying. I learned
that there can be no true despair
without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
its people hope to poison their
souls. I will let them believe they
can survive so that you can watch
them clamber over each other to
stay in the sun...
Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
You will watch as I torture an
entire city to cause you pain you
thought you could never feel again.
Then, when you have truly
understood the depths of your
failure, we will fulfill R's al
A
Ghl's destiny. We will destroy
U
Gotham. And when it is done...when
Gotham is ashes...then you have my
permission to die.
Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.
Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.
GUARD
We're locking her up in here?
WARDEN
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need. First
time she broke out of women's
correctional she was sixteen.
Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...
HUGE INMATE
Little closer, baby...
SELINA
Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?
Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...
WARDEN
She'll be just fine.
Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.
FOX
I don't see the need for a board
meeting on the energy project -
MIRANDA
Bruce got a lot of things right.
Keeping the board in the dark
wasn't one of them...
Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...
The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.
BANE
This meeting is called to order.
Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.
92.
BANE
Chair and President. I also need
one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
would you care to nominate?
FREDERICKS
No. I volunteer.
The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
Mercernaries round the three up.
FOX
Where are you taking us?
BANE
Where you buried your resources.
The bowels of Gotham.
Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated
position as Blake watches.
GORDON
So you think our friend is gone
again?
BLAKE
(GRAVE)
This time...he might not be coming
back.
Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.
FOLEY
Okay, Commissioner, you were right.
GORDON
What's happened?
FOLEY
Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
Enterprises board. He let most of
them go, but took three down into
the sewers.
GORDON
No more patrols, no more hide and
seek. Send every available cop
down there to smoke him out.
93.
FOLEY
The Mayor won't want panic -
BLAKE
So it's a training exercise.
Foley looks at Gordon.
FOLEY
I'm sorry for not taking you
SERIOUSLY -
GORDON
Don't apologize for believing the
world's in better shape then it
is...just fight to make it true.
Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.
GORDON
Not you. You're telling me the
Batman's gone. So you chase up the
Daggett leads, any way you can.
Blake nods.
Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.
PRISONER
He asks if you would pay us to let
you die. I told him you have
nothing.
WAYNE
Do it for the pleasure.
The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.
PRISONER
They pay me more than that to keep
you alive.
A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully
to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
Prisoners.
94.
PRISONER
He will try the climb.
Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.
Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.
WAYNE
Has anyone made it?
PRISONER
Of course not.
The Blind Prisoner barks at him.
WAYNE
What does he say?
PRISONER
He says there is one who did. A
child...
INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.
PRISONER
A child who had been born in this
hell...
WAYNE
Bane.
PRISONER
An old legend. Nothing more.
The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.
WAYNE
Don't.
PRISONER
Whatever they want you to
see...it's happening soon.
95.
Bane's men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the
debris. Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old
inventions...
Bane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant
charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane
nods at his men. The wall blows.
Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.
BANE
Turn it on.
Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.
BANE
I only need one other board member.
There are eight more waiting
upstairs.
FOX
I won't do it.
Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
MIRANDA
Alright, stop.
She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.
96.
MIRANDA
Lucius, you'll kill this man and
yourself, and barely slow them
down.
Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
is transfixed.
BANE
Do your work.
Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
Take them to the surface. People of
their status deserve to see the
next era of western civilization.
Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.
Hundreds of SWATs wade, flashlights swinging, heading
towards the center... Teams are converging from different
entry points...
Blake is on the phone.
BLAKE
I've been to half Daggett's cement
plants, logged locations they've
poured for underground
construction...
97.
GORDON (O.S.)
Anything strange about the
pourings?
Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.
BLAKE
Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
know anything about civil
engineering.
GORDON
But you know about patterns. Keep
looking.
Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.
Dr. Pavel finishes his work. Turns to Bane. Grave.
DR. PAVEL
It's done. This is now a
four-megaton nuclear bomb.
BANE
(to his men)
Pull the core out of the reactor.
DR. PAVEL
(HORRIFIED)
You can't. This is the only power
source capable of sustaning it - if
you move it, the core will decay in
a matter of months.
BANE
Five, by my calculations.
DR. PAVEL
And then it will go off.
BANE
For the sake of your family, Dr.
Pavel, I hope so.
Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the
core...
98.
Blake grabs his carts - scanning the pattern of the dots -
realizes.
BLAKE
Oh, God.
Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard.
Blake is driving furiously, shouting into the radio -
BLAKE
Patch me into Foley!
DISPATCH
(OVER RADIO)
Foley's overseeing the operation -
BLAKE
They're heading into a trap!
Mercenaries rise from a hole in the floor - Bane emerges...
The Mayor, in a corporate box, mouths the National Anthem...
The Mercenaries pull out detonators. Bane listens to the
kickoff like a hunting dog sensing the wind...decides.
BANE
Let the games begin.
The Mercenaries hit the detonators.
SWATs react - the tunnel roof behind collapses... Chunks of
concrete structure drop - thousands of police throughout
different tunnels are trapped...
Blake's cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt. An
eruption TOSSES Blake's cruiser onto its roof.
Bane steps into the smoking stadium, a gladiator walking
into the arena...TV cameras swing onto him. Passing a dead
umpire, he takes the men's headset - surveys the screaming
crowd, lifts an arm for silence, raises the mike to his
mask.
BANE
Gotham, take control of your
city...
Blake squeezes out of his cruiser, reaches in for the radio.
BLAKE
Foley?
FOLEY
(OVER RADIO)
Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the
city's down in those tunnels!
BLAKE
(REALIZES)
Not every cop...
Blake pulls the shotgun from his cruiser - flags down a car.
102.
Gordon's heart-rate monitor alarms. Gordon wakes, groggy...
Patients and Doctors crowd the entrance. mercenaries with
automatic weapons force their way in - hit the stairwell.
Blake drives, swerving around dazed and terrified people.
Flames and smoke billow from the sewers.
Two Mercenaries move room to room, searching.
Gordon pulls himself out of his bed, wheeling his IV.
Blake jumps into the corridor, gun raised. Shots echo down
the hall - Blake sprints.
Blake leaps into the room, gun high - freezes as warm metal
touches the base of his skull.
GORDON (O.S.)
Clear the corners, rookie.
Blake turns. Gordon holds his service weapon. The
Mercenaries are on the ground, dead.
GORDON
Get my coat, son.
103.
Analysts and military personnel assess the situation.
ANALYST
Satellite shows a radiation
spike...
ANALYST 2
Whatever it is...it's nuclear.
Armed Forces and Intelligence staff scramble to verify.
CIA ANALYST
Pavel was confirmed dead - plane
crash on an Agency pull-out of
Uzbekistan... But it certainly
looks like him -
He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr. Pavel. An Air
Force General rubs his chin, thinking, nervous.
104.
The General breaks the silence.
105.
GENERAL
Pull back the fighters, start
high-level reconnaissance flights.
And get the President on the line.
Wayne stares at the old TV. At his burning city.
PRESIDENT
(OVER TV)
We do not negotiate with
terrorists, but we do recognize
realities...
Wayne starts to cry.
Blake drives the deserted streets. Gordon is slumped in the
passenger seat, listening.
PRESIDENT
(OVER RADIO)
As the situation develops, one
thing must be understood above all
others... People of Gotham, we have
not abandoned you.
BLAKE
What does that mean?
GORDON
It means we're on our own. I have
to get in front of a camera -
BLAKE
Sir, they'll kill you the second
you show your face -
GORDON
The Mayor's dead. I'm the symbol of
law and order. Bane says he's
giving Gotham back to the people -
they need to know that I could
lead.
BLAKE
Bane's not gonna let that happen -
GORDON
Then he'll show his true colors.
BLAKE
And you'll be dead.
Gordon says nothing.
107.
Prisoners strain to hear Bane's words. Selina is there.
BANE (O.S.)
Where a thousand men have
languished for years. Under the
Dent Act. Under the name of this
MAN -
Gordon sits watching Bane's speech. Blake gathers supplies.
BLAKE
We're gonna keep moving you, till
we can get you in front of a camera
-
The Prisoners start cheering, shouting.
BANE (O.S.)
...and rebuilding it the way it
should have been rebuilt
generations ago...
This gets Blake's attention. Gordon watches, uneasy...
Blake stares at the TV, Gordon's face lowers into his
hands...
BANE (V.O.)
'I praised the madman who tried to
murder my own child.'
Prisoners cheer, pounding against the bars. Selina
watches...
Blake turns to Gordon, who stares at the TV.
BLAKE
These men, locked up in Blackgate
for eight years, denied parole
under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.
GORDON
A lie to keep a city from burning
to the ground. Gotham needed a
hero, someone to believe in -
BLAKE
Not as much as it does now. But you
betrayed everything you stood for.
GORDON
(looks at Blake)
There's a point. Far out there.
When the structures fail you. When
the rules aren't weapons anymore,
they're shackles, letting the bad
get ahead. Maybe one day you'll
have such a moment of crisis. And
in that moment, I hope you have a
friend like I did. To plunge their
hands into the filth so you can
keep yours clean.
BLAKE
Your hands look pretty filthy to
me, Commissioner.
Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing.
Selina watches as Prisoners stream out of open cell doors.
She makes her way quietly through the excited throng.
BANE (V.O.)
For an army will be raised...
Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners...
People ransack the apartment...
BANE (V.O.)
...and cast into the cold world the
rest of us have known and
endured...
A kangaroo court is in session, presided over by a Criminal
we recognize from Blackgate. Bane watches from the
gallery...
112.
BANE (V.O.)
The spoils will be enjoyed...
Tough-looking Revellers crack open champagne - spraying it,
swigging it - Selina amongst them, watching...
BANE (V.O.)
Blood will be shed...
Hundreds of Police living underground. Dividing up supplies
lowered by ropes... Ross opens a pack of supplies.
BANE (V.O.)
But the police will live, until
they are ready to serve true
justice...
Wayne rolls off his cot. Grunts. The Prisoner realizes Wayne
is trying to do a push-up. From the next cell, the Blind
Prisoner says something...
PRISONER
He says you must first straighten
your back.
The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.
113.
WAYNE
How would he know?
PRISONER
He was the prison doctor. A
morphine addict who incurred the
displeasure of powerful people.
Including your masked friend.
WAYNE
How?
PRISONER
Many years ago, during a time of
plague, Bane was attacked by other
prisoners. The doctor's fumbling
attempts to repair the damage left
him in perpetual agony. The mask
holds his pain at bay.
WAYNE
Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was
he born here?
PRISONER
The legend is that there was a
mercenary working for the local
warlord who fell in love with his
daughter. They married in secret.
The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.
PRISONER
When the warlord found out, he
condemned the mercenary to this
pit. But then exiled him instead.
INSERT CUT: the Mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren
road. He starts to walk.
PRISONER
The mercenary understood that the
warlord's daughter had secured his
release, but he couldn't know the
true price of his freedom. She had
taken his place in the pit.
INSERT CUT: a Woman is lowered into the prison. The
prisoners below all have their faces covered with muslin
masks...
114.
PRISONER
And she was with the child. The
mercenary's child.
INSERT CUT: the Woman watches as the Doctor, (the Blind
Prisoner, younger-looking, sighted) examines her small
child. The Doctor exits, locking the cell...
PRISONER
One day the doctor forgot the lock
the cell...
INSERT CUT: Prisoners move into the cell towards his mother.
The child runs at them with a knife...
PRISONER
Innocence cannot flower
underground. It was to be stamped
out. But the child had a friend. A
protector...
INSERT CUT: the Protector, face covered, pulls the Child off
the attackers. One grabs for the Child - the Protector snaps
his arm, carries the Child into a corner...
PRISONER
...who showed the others that this
innocence was their redemption. The
mother was not so lucky.
The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.
PRISONER
This is Bane's prison now. Bane
would not want this story told.
The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled
upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.
You have a protruding
vertebra...I'm going to force it
back...
WAYNE
How -?
The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.
PRISONER
You stay like this. Until you
stand.
Wayne passes out from the pain and we FADE TO BLACK.
Wayne is hanging in his cell, delirious.
115.
R'S AL GHL (O.S.)
A U
Did you not think I'd return,
Bruce?
R's al Ghl, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne.
A U
R'S AL GHL
A U
I told you I was immortal.
WAYNE
I watched you die.
R'S AL GHL
A U
There are many forms of
immortality.
Wayne looks inward, remembering...
INSERT CUT: R's at the campfire (from Batman Begins).
A
R'S AL GHL
A U
Once I had a wife. My great love.
She was taken from me...
INSERT CUT: the Woman is lowered into the prison...
Wayne looks at R's.
A
WAYNE
You were the mercenary. Bane is
your child. Your heir.
INSERT CUT: the Mercenary at the side of the road. R's.
A
R'S AL GHL
A U
An heir to ensure the League of
Shadows fulfills its duty to
restore balance to civilization.
WAYNE
No...
R'S AL GHL
A U
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years. With all your
strength and resources, all your
moral authority. And the only
victory you could achieve was a
lie. Finally you understand...
Gotham is beyond saving...
116.
WAYNE
NO!
R'S AL GHL
A U
And must be allowed to die.
CUT TO WHITE. And we are -
Ross strains to reach a note dangling on a string - he
grasps it. All around him are dozens of Cops living
underground...
The home is packed. People, not just kids, huddle in every
corner. Blake spots Father Reilly. Hands him the can.
BLAKE
For the bus in case there's a
chance to evacuate. Keep it in here
- people are siphoning parked cars.
FATHER REILLY
Really?
BLAKE
(GRINS)
How do you think I got it?
FATHER REILLY
Right. Any news? Is the
COMMISSIONER -
BLAKE
Less you know, Father. How're the
boys?
117.
FATHER REILLY
Power's been on more, so they get
some TV.
Blake smiles. Moves to the door.
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like
dogs.
Blake nods. Leaves.
Following Selina through rooms strewn with trash, empty
bottles and sleeping partygoers. She spots a family
photograph, glass smashed. A hand lands on her shoulder.
JEN
Who's that?
SELINA
This was someone's home.
JEN
Now it's everyone's home.
Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by.
JEN
'Storm's coming', remember? This is
what you wanted.
SELINA
No. It's what I thought I wanted.
The Prisoner unties the rope from Wayne's chest. Wayne
stands. Just. Then walks.
Wayne does push-ups. Stronger. The Prisoner watches.
PRISONER
Why build yourself?
WAYNE
I'm not meant to die in here.
The Prisoner indicates the TV:
118.
SIEGE OF GOTHAM: DAY 84.
PRISONER
Here? There? What's the difference?
Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...
Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed
Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners
gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the
light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners
get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.
Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the
next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.
His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -
the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The
Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner
lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away.
PRISONER
I told you it could not be done.
WAYNE
You told me a child did it...
PRISONER
No ordinary child...
INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child,
older now, moves to the climbing wall
A child born in hell.
INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down
- making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off
Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn.
A child forged by suffering,
hardened by pain...
INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a
handhold on the ledge and swinging up...
Not a man from privilege.
Wayne's eyes close in despair.
119.
Supply trucks await inspection. Mercenaries open an
18-wheeler - check boxes of rations...wave it on...
Three plain-clothes Special Forces Men emerge from the
boxes, checking, then concealing weapons. The doors open -
they exit.
The Special Forces Men carry boxes into the store as if
delivering. The Store Manager leads them into the back and
down into -
Where they are met by four Cops out of uniform.
FOLEY
You have ID?
SPECIAL FORCES 1
Of course not.
FOLEY
How can we trust you?
GORDON (O.S.)
We don't have any choice.
Gordon and Blake emerge from the back of the room.
SPECIAL FORCES 1
Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones,
Special Forces.
GORDON
Captain, glad to have you here.
120.
CAPTAIN JONES
How many of you are there?
GORDON
Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.
But the men trapped underground
number almost three thousand.
CAPTAIN JONES
What kind of shape they're in?
GORDON
They've been getting water, food.
CAPTAIN JONES
Could we break them out?
BLAKE
Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries
guarding the outflow south of
Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,
you've got a hole big enough for
ten at a time. I'm in contact with
my partner - they're waiting for
the day.
SPECIAL FORCES 2
Men who haven't seen daylight for
three months?
BLAKE
Men with automatic weapons who
haven't seen daylight in three
months.
CAPTAIN JONES
What about the bomb? The satellites
can't see any radiation hot
spots...
CAPTAIN JONES
What about the triggerman?
GORDON
No leads. It's a bluff - Bane
wouldn't give control of that bomb
to someone else.
CAPTAIN JONES
We can't take that chance. Until we
have the triggerman, we just track
the device, smuggle men over -
BLAKE
While Gotham lives under a warlord,
like in some failed state?
CAPTAIN JONES
Dial it back, officer. This
situation is unprecedented. We
can't do anything to risk millions
of lives.
BLAKE
(TO GORDON)
Aren't you gonna tell him?!
GORDON
Captain, things are more
complicated than you think. There's
somebody you need to meet. Blake?
Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.
They head across the empty lobby to an elevator.
Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift
furnishings line the offices and corridors.
BLAKE
I was up here looking for a vantage
point. Found the people who run the
corporation who owns it living
here.
CAPTAIN JONES
Which corporation?
FOX (O.S.)
Wayne Enterprises.
Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.
BLAKE
Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd
like you to brief the Captain.
Captain Jones indicates Miranda.
FOX
Miss Tate is fully aware of the
situation.
MIRANDA
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
have to take responsibility for it.
CAPTAIN JONES
Why?
MIRANDA
Because, Captain, we built it.
CAPTAIN JONES
You built the bomb?
FOX
It was built as a fusion reactor.
The first of its kind. Bane turned
the core into a bomb, then
disconnected it from the reactor.
123.
BLAKE
And here's the important part.
FOX
As the device's fuel cells decay,
it's becoming increasingly
unstable...until the point of
detonation.
BLAKE
The bomb's a time bomb.
FOX
And it will go off. In twenty-three
days.
Captain Jones reels at this news.
BLAKE
Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
watching Gotham rearrange its
deckchairs while the whole ship's
going down. Your appeasement plan
might not be as practical as you
thought.
Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.
CAPTAIN JONES
Could you disarm it?
FOX
I don't know, But I could reconnect
it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
CAPTAIN JONES
We'd have to let the Pentagon know.
SPECIAL FORCES 2
They'll be monitoring our
FREQUENCIES -
CAPTAIN JONES
We have no choice. Let's move away
from this location, then call it
in.
124.
Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and
Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose.
Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes
a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator.
Blake flies out of the elevator.
BLAKE
Fox, somebody sold us out!
Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.
FOX
Take Miranda -
Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries
jump out of the elevator, firing high.
MERCERNARY
DOWN ON THE FLOOR!
Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.
Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other
Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with
his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones
looks up at him, defiant.
CAPTAIN JONES
I'll die before I talk...
BANE
I'm on your schedule, Captain.
Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.
MERCERNARY
There were people living upstairs.
Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.
BANE
Give them over for judgement.
(Indicates bodies.) Hang them where
the world will see.
125.
Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in
the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the
screen.
Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind
Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.
PRISONER
He says the leap to freedom is not
about strength.
WAYNE
My body makes the jump.
BLIND PRISONER
(CRACKED ENGLISH)
Survival is the spirit. The soul.
WAYNE
My soul's as ready to escape as my
body.
BLIND PRISONER
Fear is why you fail.
WAYNE
I'm not afraid. I'm angry.
Wayne throws punches...focused.
Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
climbing, determined.
He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
at Wayne, hanging upside down.
SKINNY PRISONER
Shouldn't you get him down?
The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.
126.
PRISONER
He'll keep.
As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -
INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well,
looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.
THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)
And why do we fall?
Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.
BLIND PRISONER
(CRACKED ENGLISH)
You do not fear death. You think
this makes you strong. This makes
you weak.
WAYNE
Why?
BLIND PRISONER
How can you move faster then
possible? Fight longer than
possible? If not from the most
powerful impulse of the spirit. The
fear of death. The will to survive.
Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.
WAYNE
I do fear death. I fear dying in
here while my city burns with no
one there to save it.
BLIND PRISONER
Then make the climb.
WAYNE
How?
BLIND PRISONER
As the child did. Without the rope.
(Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
you again.
Wayne considers this.
127.
Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.
PRISONER
Supplies for your journey?
Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
below the Prisoners start a low chant.
As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
circle up to the opening above...
Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
again...then he jumps.
Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.
A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
Stryver, Daggett's functionary.
STRYVER
I want to see Bane! There's been a
mistake! Take me to Bane!
Fox watches him dragged upstairs...
128.
A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.
STRYVER
There's been a mistake! Where's
Bane?!
VOICE (O.S.)
There's been no mistake, Mr.
Stryver.
Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.
CRANE
You are Philip Stryver, executive
vice-president of Daggett
Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
The same Philip Stryver who for
years lived like a prince off the
blood and sweat of people less
powerful?
STRYVER
Call Bane! I'm one of you!
Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.
CRANE
Bane has no authority here. This is
merely a sentencing hearing. The
choice is yours, death or exile.
Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
'Death'.
STRYVER
Exile.
CRANE
(SMASHES GAVEL)
Sold...to the man in the cold
sweat!
Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...
Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.
GORDON
Where the hell are they? It's not
like we have a lot of time, here.
COP
How long?
GORDON
The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've
got about eighteen hours to do
something.
COP
To do what?
GORDON
We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
it, then we can start thinking
about how to take it down.
The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.
GORDON
(LOW)
That's it?
Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.
GORDON
Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!
Gordon heads for the door.
130.
BLAKE
You shouldn't be out on the streets
-
Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
his aid.
BASEMENT THUG 1
Find this one a spot, he's got a
big day tomorrow.
They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.
BASEMENT THUG 2
We all do. It's not every day you
bag Bruce Wayne...
Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
comes over.
MIRANDA
Bruce?
FOX
You picked a hell of a time to go
on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
WAYNE
How long until the core ignites?
FOX
That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
WAYNE
Unless we can connect it to the
reactor.
FOX
If you can get it there. I'll find
a way to plug it back in.
(Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
Miranda out?
136.
WAYNE
Not tonight. I'm sorry.
MIRANDA
Do what's necessary.
WAYNE
(TO FOX)
Tonight I need you.
FOX
What for?
WAYNE
To get me back in the game.
Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.
CATWOMAN
Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
Bane wants these guys himself...
The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
up.
WAYNE
I won't forget about you.
MIRANDA
I know.
Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.
137.
WAYNE
Any move I make against Bane or the
bomb - the triggerman sets it off.
FOX
They can't be using radio or cell -
too much interference. Infrared
doesn't have the range. It could
only be micro-burst long wave...
Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...
WAYNE
Could you block it?
FOX
Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
mount from the Bat. You remember
where you parked?
Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...
Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.
CRANE
The charges are espionage and
attempted sabotage... Do you have
anything to say in your defense?
GORDON
No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
of due process is this?
CRANE
More than you give Harvey's
prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
is determined, this is merely a
sentencing hearing. What's it to
be, death or exile?
GORDON
Crane, if you think we are going
willingly out onto that ice, you've
got another think coming.
CRANE
Death, then?
138.
GORDON
Looks that way.
CRANE
Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
exile.
He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
indicates Miranda.
BANE
Bring her to me.
Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath
LUCIUS
I think it's time to talk about my
year-end bonus...
FOLEY'S KIDS
Dad! Check it out!
FOLEY'S WIFE
Honey, take a look!
Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.
Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from
their hiding place.
Fox hurries into the reactor - starts throwing switches...
Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.
Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
guarding Miranda move towards them -
BANE
Stay back. He is mine -
Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.
BATMAN
Give me the trigger! You'd never
give it to an ordinary citizen -
Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
relief.
BANE
I broke you. How have you come
back?
BATMAN
You thought you were the only one
who could learn the strength to
escape?
Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
BANE
I never escaped - R's al Ghl
A U
rescued me. That is why I must
fulfill his plan. That is why I
must avenge his murder.
BATMAN
(CONFUSED)
The child of R's al Ghl made the
A U
CLIMB -
MIRANDA (O.S)
But he is not the child of R's al
A
Ghl...
U
Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...
147.
MIRANDA
I am.
Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs...
And though I am not 'ordinary', I
am a citizen...
She pulls out the trigger...
Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the
throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side -
MIRANDA/TALIA
My mother named me Talia before she
was killed. The way I would've been
killed if not for my
protector...Bane.
INSERT CUT: the child, Talia, makes eye-contact with the
Protector, then leaps. Down below, Prisoners swarm over the
protector, ripping the muslin from his face. Bane looks up
at Talia, says one quiet word -
BANE
Goodbye.
Then is overrun.
TALIA
I climbed out of the pit...
INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at
the landscape...
I found my father and brought him
back to exact terrible vengeance -
but by that time...the prisoners
and the doctor had done their work
to my friend...my protector...
Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask.
148.
INSERT CUT: the League of Shadows descend into the prison -
at their head, R's al Ghl. They slaughter prisoners. Then
A U
stop. R's al Ghl has found Bane, bandaged.
A U
TALIA
The League took us in. Trained
us...
Bane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows
from men with sticks.
TALIA (V.O.)
But my father could not accept
Bane.
R's al Ghl watches Bane training. Turns away.
A U
Talia looks into Bane's eyes as she holds the knife in
Batman's side.
TALIA
He saw only a monster who could
never be tamed. Whose very
existence was a reminder of the
hell he'd left his wife to die in.
He excommunicated Bane from the
League of Shadows. His only crime
was that he loved me. I could not
truly forgive my father...
Talia looks at Batman, cold.
Until you murdered him.
BATMAN
He was trying to kill millions of
innocent people -
TALIA
'Innocent' is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor
my father by finishing his work.
Vengeance against the man who
killed him is simply a reward for
my patience...
Talia twists the knife in Batman's side.
You see, it's the slow knife...the
knife that takes its time, the
(MORE)
149.
TALIA (CONT'D)
knife that waits years without
forgetting, then slips quietly
between bones...that's the knife -
Talia arms the trigger...
- that cuts deepest.
She hits the button - nothing.
Talia turns, furious.
BATMAN
Your knife may have been too
slow...
A Mercenary steps forward -
MERCENARY
The truck's under attack -
Talia looks around, mind racing.
TALIA
Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a
way to block my signal. No matter -
(Looks at watch.) He's bought
Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at
Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We
must secure the bomb until it
detonates.
Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
Mercenary - points it at Batman.
TALIA
Not yet... I want him to feel the
heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of
twelve million souls you failed.
Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes,
tenderly.
Goodbye, my friend.
Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the
Mercenaries.
150.
Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the
rounds in the barrels.
BANE
You'll have to imagine the fire -
He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face.
We both know I need to kill you
now.
He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the
lobby by cannon fire.
Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.
CATWOMAN
The whole no-guns thing? I don't
feel as strongly about it as you
do.
Batman looks at Catwoman.
BATMAN
I need you on the ground, me in the
air, we have to force that convoy
east, to the entrance to the
REACTOR -
152.
Gordon climbs into the back of the truck - the bomb is
there, heating up. He looks at the countdown - nine
minutes...
As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye -
something is wrong...
Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately
strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside,
moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead,
gauging the driver's position. Starts firing blind through
the bulkhead -
Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls
forward, dead. Talia takes the wheel - bullets keep coming.
Talia watches the navigation screen.
TUMBLER DRIVER
(OVER RADIO)
They're trying to force us onto
GRAND -
TALIA
Pushing us to the entrance of the
reactor. They're going to try and
reconnect the core.
TUMBLER DRIVER
(OVER RADIO)
Can they?
Talia smiles.
Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he
turns. A massive rumble builds - water SMASHES into the
reactor, flooding in from both directions.
Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as
a wave smashes into him, painfully...
155.
Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater -
The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small
group.
LAWYER
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of... The
contents of the house are to be
SOLD -
He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake.
Blake shifts. Out of place. The Lawyer continues.
LAWYER
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham, on condition
that they never be demolished,
altered, or otherwise interfered
WITH -
161.
People file out as the Lawyer stands.
LAWYER
My clerk will help anyone with the
smaller correspondences and
instructions...
Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.
BLAKE
Blake, John.
CLERK
(CHECKS LIST)
Nothing here.
Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.
BLAKE
Try my legal name.
The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.
CLERK
Yup, here it is.
She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.
CLERK
You should use your full name. I
like that name... Robin.
162.
Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.
LAWYER
Any word on the missing item?
CLERK
No, not yet.
LAWYER
Well, they'd better leave no stone
unturned... We can't just put a
string of pearls on the manifest as
'lost'.
Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor. Two
Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.
TECH 1
Why worry about the stabilization
software? This whole autopilot
system's obsolete -
FOX
Please, I just need to know what I
could've done to fix it.
TECH 2
But Mr. Fox, it's already been
fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software
patch...six months ago.
FOX
(CONFUSED)
Check the user ident on the
patch...
Tech 2 types some more keys. Looks surprised.
TECH 2
Huh. Bruce Wayne.
Fox turns away from the rotor, an idea starting to form...
Moving in on the waterfall from inside... Blake bursts
through, landing painfully on the shale inside. he gets to
his feet, moving cautiously into the cave...
Blake lights his torch...then ducks, crouching, as THOUSANDS
