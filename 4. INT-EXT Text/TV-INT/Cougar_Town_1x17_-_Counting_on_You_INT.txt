                    I got this song stuck in my head.  
                    You know, the one from Titanic?

                    Gay trap!  You re gay. 

                              JULES
                    That s ridiculous, Andy s not gay 
                    because he likes Titanic.  Everybody 
                    likes Titanic.  Remember when Jack 
                    asks Rose where she wants to go...

                              BOBBY

                    That guy with the bowler hat?  Come 
                    on!  What s the point of inside jokes

                    That s crazy.  You re saying any 
                    woman you re even a little nice to 
                    you want to sleep with?

                              GRAYSON
                    At least once.  Look, no guy ever 
                    woke up and thought:  You know, I 
                    wish I had a real cool chick to hang 
                    out and do friend stuff with.

                              BOBBY 
                    What would I even do with a lady-
                    friend?  I guess I could sleep with 
                    them.   Wait, that s the thing you 
                    can t do.  I got nothing.  Go carts?

                              ANDY
                    When I was single, I never hung out 
                    with a woman that I wasn t interested 
                    in dating.

                    the smell of empanadas and acrylic 
                    nails still makes him horn out.

                              JULES
                    Look, there are a lot of men who 
                    aren t just walking scrotums, and 
                    they have actual female friends.  
                    Laurie s got a ton of guy friends.

                                LAURIE
                    Totally.  We go to movies and 
                    concerts.  Just as friends.  

                              GRAYSON
                    Have you ever slept with any of them?

                                LAURIE
                    Yeah.  All of them.  But just as 
                    friends.  Nothing romantic.

                              ELLIE
                    Sorry Jules, but Tiny Eyes is right.

                              GRAYSON
                    I have tiny eyes?

                              ELLIE
                    Andy and I met because we were in the 
                    same circle of friends.  I slept all 
                    the way around it until I got to him.

                              ANDY
                    Wait, even Victor?!

                              GRAYSON
                    There are exceptions to the no friend 
                    rule.  Like if the guy s gay, or he s 
                    friends with your friend s husband.

                              ANDY
                    Like Victor?!

                              ELLIE
                    Give me a break.  He had a Saab.

                              JULES
                    You re all crazy.  I saw a news story 
                    last night about a bear and a cat 
                    that were best friends.  If they can 
                    be friends, so can men and women.

                              GRAYSON
                    They followed up that story this 
                    morning.  The bear killed the cat.

                              JULES
                    But they didn t have sex.  I mean, 
                    the bear tried but he couldn t.  
                    That s probably why he got so angry.  
                    But people aren t bears.  Point to 
                    Jules.  High five!

  She raises her hand.  No one hits it.  Finally, Bobby does.

                    You can t leave a high five hanging.

                    Morning, Andy.

                    Naw, I m just in a funk.  I m either 
                    at work all day, or up all night with 
                    Stan.  I feel like it s all I do.

                                LAURIE
                    I hear that.  I work a butt-load, and 
                    by the time I go home and catch up on 
                    Facebook and Twitter I barely have 
                    time for my self.

                    That was once, and nobody cares that 
                    much about flax seeds.

                    She can t.  She takes Ambien to help

                    giving up control, so she fights it.

                    get for marrying someone from a 
                    culture that fries sandwiches. 

                              ANDY
                    I just needed to do something for me.

                    stupid idea was that?

  Andy and Laurie look at Jules.  Jules, nervous, picks up 
  Stan and pretends to  save  him from choking.

                              JULES
                    Oh, no!  Stan!  I ll save you.  
                      (chucks a piece of hotdog, and 
                        GRUNTS as if from Stan)

                    There we go!  All clear.  Saved him.

                    Andy, you are out of your mind if you 
                    think I m letting you keep that 
                    thing.  Can you picture how 
                      ridiculous you d look wearing one of 
                    those tacky, leather outfits?

                    This is so not a big deal.  Girls 
                    ride motorcycles all the time.  Um,

                    I d rather he be mad than dead.  The 
                    thought of something happening to him 
                    terrifies me so much.  I don t even 
                    care if he has a giant life insurance 
                    policy.  I love that little man. 

                              JULES
                    Why didn t you just say that to him?

                    When you re angry and your spouse 
                    does something idiotic, you don t 
                    reward them with nice thoughts.

                              JULES
                    That is so wrong.  You should be open 
                    and honest with your spouse.

                              ELLIE

                    like this since I tried to bring you 
                    home from Math Camp.  Don t worry, 
                    I m sure this trip won t be that bad.

                    Sure, what s so bad about putting 
                    your arm in a giant fish?  Plus, they 
                    make great prosthetic arms now.

                    They re better than real arms.  I

                    no such thing as a butt alignment.

                    reason she doesn t want you to have 
                    the bike is because she loves you so 
                    much.  The thought of something

                              ANDY
                    She said that?

                    She did.  And I wasn t supposed to

                    I know the real reason you don t want 
                    me to have a motorbike.  It s because 
                    you re worried something bad could 
                    happen.  Well, I m right here and I

                    You want to know what s not fair?!  
                    I m tired of having to think for two 
                    people.  It s exhausting!

                    Being married to you is exhausting!

                    No, you stay.  So, Jules, is there 
                    any other secret information you want 
                    to share with my idiot husband?

                              ANDY
                    Leave Jules out of this.  She did a 
                    good thing by sharing.  You re the 
                    one hiding feelings from me.

                      (re: Andy)
                    No, him.  You re mad at him.

                              ANDY
                    Your problem is you re emotionally 
                    closed off, Ellie.  Closed off!

  Andy exits with a head of steam.  


  Jules, Grayson and Laurie talk in the kitchen.

                              JULES
                    What did I do?  Andy s never bailed 
                    like that on Ellie.  He usually just 
                    stands there, breathing through his 
                    nose harder and harder until he 
                    sounds like a little Cuban teapot...  
                      (realizing)
                    Which would be an amazing children s 
                    book.  Dibs.

                                LAURIE
                      I remember when my dad walked out on 
                    my mom.  She was devastated.  A week 
                    later, when she realized he had taken 
                    me and my sister with him to Mexico, 
                    she felt even worse.  That turned out 
                    to be the best family vacation ever.

                              GRAYSON
                    You have a gift for distorting 
                    reality.

                              JULES
                    Why couldn t I have just minded my 
                    own business?  You know what, we have 
                    to fix Andy and Ellie right now.

                              GRAYSON
                    That contradiction was so fast I 
                    think it broke the sound barrier. 

                              JULES
                    This is serious.  Andy and Ellie were 
                    fighting like Bobby and I did right 
                    before we got divorced.  Well, except 
                    Andy wasn t wearing a golf club cover 
                    over his privates.  And Ellie didn t 
                    have a truck stop waitress by the 
                    hair.  And it wasn t in a public 
                    bathroom in the Tampa airport.  But 
                      everything else was the same.

                              GRAYSON
                    My wife and I never fought, and she 
                    left me anyway.  Marriage is fragile.  
                    I m surprised Ellie and Andy even 
                    lasted this long.   Cougar Town     "Counting On You"  [117]               23.

                    You re right.  Maybe I should go see 
                    if Ellie s okay.  Hey, I m part of 
                    this circle of friends too, right?

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:


  Laurie approaches Ellie, who drinks a glass of wine.

                                LAURIE
                    Your husband owes me a crap-ton of 
                    money for that motorbike.  So before 
                    you and him break up and split your 
                    cash and what not, I want a check or 
                    I start slashing tires.

                    Jules sent you here to see if I was 
                    still mad at her?

  Jules enters from the sliding door with a tray of muffins.

                    Whatever.  Are those pumpkin muffins?

                    This is serious.  I need you and Andy

                      (to Andy)
                    These two got freaked out by our

                    When you re in a good relationship 
                    you don t sweat the bumps in the 
                    road.  It s like you have a built-in

                    other so much you know you re never 
                    going anywhere.  It also helps if you 
                    have a strong desire to prove your
