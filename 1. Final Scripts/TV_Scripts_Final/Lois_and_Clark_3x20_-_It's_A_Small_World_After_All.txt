To pop everything into place...    

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

 1   INT. LOIS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT #1                           1   

     LOIS is dressing for the evening, while CLARK sits on the 
     couch, thumbing through her high school yearbook.  The 
     yearbook is embossed with the mascot of a lion's head on the 
     cover and the word "LIONS."

                   My high school reunion.  Where does 
                   the time go?!  Listen, are you sure 
                   you wanna go to this?

                        (glancing up)
                   Hmm?  Oh.  Yeah.  Sure.

                                   LOIS
                   ... Because I'd understand if you 
                   didn't.  I mean, a bunch of people 
                   you don't really...

                        (stands)
                   Lois, you just got your memory 
                   back.  I just got _you_ back.  I 
                   may never let you out of my sight 
                   again.
                        (stares down at book)
                   Well, would you look at you.

                                   LOIS
                   Just my luck.  I wear polyester one 
                   day of my life and it's captured on 
                   film for eternity.

                                   LOIS
                   I was still stuck in my Charlie's
                   Angels phase.  Everyone was!

     Lois jerks the yearbook out of his hands.

                   Give me that.  It was also my 
                   'dating the quarterback phase.' It 
                   didn't last long.

                   know, I know.  I was independent 
                   and headstrong and, by the way, I 
                   also vowed not to get married until 
                   after my first Pulitzer.

                                   CLARK
                   So what changed?

                                   LOIS
                   I met you.  Charging through life 
                   alone isn't as great as sharing my 
                   life with you.

     A kiss and they are out the door.

     A posh hotel suite.  Lurking about is a majestic Abyssinian 
     CAT.  We follow it as it stealthily crosses the room, taking 
     us by issues of the Daily Planet strewn on the bed, a Vogue 
     magazine with a beautiful model, PEGGY BARRISH, on the 
     cover, a large scrapbook over-stuffed with high school 
     memorabilia, then settles on a Lions' football jersey.  We 
     hear someone singing a school fight song, ending with:

     Lois's contemporary primping herself for the reunion.
     She's neurotic, bird-like, too high strung to ever enjoy 
     life.  She's overdressed in a sort of upscale prom dress, 
     complete with wrist corsage, and expensively coiffed, the 
     "after" picture from a make-over brochure.

                   No, we barely spoke.  Right, Lo-Lo?
                   Hardly ever.  Almost never.

                                   LOIS

                   You look great, Annette.

     Lois spins to see JULIE KEATON and her husband DICK.

                   just like the old days...

     Lois smiles apologetically, grabs Clark's arm and CAMERA 
     MOVES with them into the crowd, as:

                                   LOIS
                   Julie, hi!  Hi, Dick.  Julie, this

     HANS, a lumbering henchman, disguised as a busboy in an

     in the doorway.

     The women laugh at some memory; Clark and Dick awkwardly 
     smile at each other.  Then:

                                   JULIE
                   He's so unhappy.  His wife, Debbie,
                   vanished about six weeks ago.

                                   LOIS
                   That's terrible.  Have the police
                   been notified?

                                   JULIE
                   The case is still open, but they 
                   don't have any leads.  It doesn't 
                   look good.

                   What can I do?

                   It's just good to see you, Lo-Lo.  
                   Having friends around is my only 
                   comfort.  Annette, here, has been

                   Not really, but she sure came along 
                   at the right time.  Which is

                   she'd _leave_.  Must be something

     Hans, on his belly in the rafters, lit by a pool of light

                   Clark, the spouses of two of my
                   classmates have disappeared in the 
                   last six weeks without a trace.

                   I know these people.  They are
                   just not the vanish-without-a-trace
                   type.

     They pass PERRY at the bottom of the ramp.  He is wearing 
     new cowboy boots and carries a small wrapped gift in hand.

                   Clark, when a pit bull gets a hold 
                   of a bone, it's not going to let go 
                   until it's finished with it.

                                   LOIS
                   Perry, there's a connection between
                   some no-shows at my reunion.

     Clark grins as Lois looks from Jimmy to Clark and sighs.
     She opens the gift.  It's a brass desk nameplate with the 
     name "Lois Kent."  They both stare at it in surprise.

     MUSIC: "At Seventeen" by Janis Ian sets the mood on the 
     stereo.  Annette consoles herself with cookies and milk as 
     she pets her cat.  She flips through the pages of her scrap 
     book.  Pressed flowers, concert ticket stubs, and a page 
     reserved for valentines that's completely empty.  Standing 
     by her side is Hans, looking guilty and beaten down.

                   You can't even _drop_ something

     A blustery night; distant THUNDER.  Clark returns home to 
     find the bag labeled "For the Man In Love", swinging from his
     doorknob.  He pulls out the blue bottle, reads:

     Julie, dressed for work, hurries outside. She shuts the
     door, starts away, the door opens.  It's Dick, wet, in robe,
     towel drying his hair.

                                   DICK
                   You didn't say good-bye!

                        (they kiss)
                   Mmmm. You smell good.

     She hurries down to her car, jumps in, drives off, as Dick
     retrieves the morning paper from the bottom of the steps,
     returns to the door.  As he arrives at the door, he is
     suddenly gripped with a strange, constricting feeling. He
     drops the paper and towel, grabs his head, then his sides,
     then stares at his arms.  QUICK CUTS:


 25  HIS HANDS                                                 25

     The hem of the robe is dropping toward the feet, which seem
     to pull back inside the cloth.


 27  HIS HEAD                                                  27   

     Shrinks down into the collar of the robe, which drops to the
     porch.


 28  THE FALLEN ROBE                                           28   

     From under a fold of material, tiny Dick Keaton peers out.
     RACK TO REVEAL, behind him, Hans, dressed in coveralls, who
     leaps out of the bushes and approaches with a bag attached
     to a stick.  Dick hears him, vanishes back into the robe.

     Clark brings it closer to his damp hair.

                                   ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   Thousands are fleeing for their
                   lives as lava from the erupting
                   Kilauea volcano rushes toward the
                   villages below.  To repeat... (etc.)


 36  THE SHOWER                                                36   

     Clark slams the shampoo down on the shower shelf and BLURS 
     out.  CAMERA SLOWLY PANS from shower around the now empty
     bathroom.

                                   ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   ... a disaster unparalleled in 
                   recent times.  This just in.  
                   Miraculously, Superman has just 
                   appeared and has diverted the lava 
                   flow into the Pacific ocean!  Local 
                   residents stand cheering and it 
                   appears not a single home has been 
                   lost. (etc.)

     During this, CAMERA has continued its PAN around the 
     bathroom, and as it nears the shower, red boots and cape are
     dropped into a pile of blue clothing on the floor and we 
     find a soot-covered Clark back in the shower, rinsing off.
     He now reaches for the shampoo, about to pour it on his 
     head.  RING!  The phone.  Exasperated, Clark leans out of 
     the shower, grabs the portable phone near the sink.

                                   CLARK
                   Hello.  Lois, can I call you back?
                   I'm in the shower.

     He hangs up, steps back into the shower.  He lathers up.

     Lois picks up her bag and turns to head out.  She opens the 
     door, startled to find Annette, poised to knock.

                                   LOIS

                        (breezing in; all charm)
                   Speaking of lunch, do you remember 
                   the time those senior boys dumped 
                   oatmeal on a kid in the cafeteria?

                                   LOIS
                   I'd forgotten all about that.

                                   ANNETTE
                   I remember it like it was yesterday.

                                   LOIS
                   Was that you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Boy,
                   kids can be really mean.

                                   ANNETTE
                   Yeah well, I'm getting the last
                   laugh.  Turns out oatmeal is good
                   for acne.  It cleared up my skin
                   and inspired my cosmetic line.
                        (spotting name plate on
                         table)
                   I like the new name plate.

                                   LOIS
                   Oh, that.  I'm not quite sure how I 
                   feel about that.

                                   ANNETTE
                   I know I'd never give up the name 
                   'Westman,' not that that's an 
                   issue.  Before you can marry you 
                   have to get a date and to get a 
                   date, you have to have a sense of 
                   self worth!  Ha ha ha ha.  Gee, I 
                   can't remember the last time the 
                   two of us just had girl talk.

                                   LOIS
                   You know... me, either.

                                   ANNETTE
                   Gosh, then I guess it's, oh...
                   possible... we never did!

                   I always thought, if it hadn't been
                   for all those silly barriers in
                   high school, we'd have been close

                   time you want.  Any time you need
                   help.  I want to hear all about it.

                                   LOIS
                   Well... Thank you.

                        (she roars)

     A devilish grin sweeps across Annette's face.

     A large shadow looms across Clark's front door.  The door 
     knob RATTLES and is jimmied open.  Hans appears, bag at the 
     ready.  He creeps through the apartment, looking along floor
     boards, through the bedroom and toward the closed bathroom 
     door.  A LIGHT IS SHINING beneath the door.  We HEAR MUSIC.

                                   HANS
                   Collection time, little fella.

     He pushes the door open, raising his bag.


 39  INTERCUT BATHROOM - ON FEET - HANS P.O.V.                 39   

     CAMERA TILTS up to find a very unshrunk Clark, towel around 
     his waist, brushing his teeth and rocking out to the radio.
     Clark turns to see Hans, dressed in the "Snoil Pest Control"
     coveralls.

                   Uh... sorry, I must be in the wrong
                   apartment.

     He swiftly heads out of bedroom, followed by a suspicious 
     Clark.

                                   CLARK

                   No rats here.

     Hans bolts out the door, leaving a bewildered Clark, still 
     with toothbrush in mouth.  Clark goes to doorway, watches 
     Hans retreat, slowly closes door with a puzzled look.

     working, waiting for him, a bit nervous, something on her 
     mind.

                                   CLARK
                   Morning.  Sorry I'm late.

                                   LOIS
                   I've been trying to reach Peggy 
                   Barrish, the other girl whose 
                   husband vanished?  No luck.

                   You can't believe what happened 
                   when I was getting ready this 
                   morning.

                                   LOIS
                   Actually, I heard about the
                   volcano.  Nice work.

                   you is a _huge_ part of my life,
                   don't get me wrong, but so is
                        (indicates room)
                   ... this.  And I won't feel one bit
                   less married to you holding onto a
                   name that's taken me years to
                   establish.  Not that tradition
                   isn't on your side, but why do
                   _women_ do all the changing?
                   Change our name when we get 
                   married, change our body when we

                   Lois, I ran those names from your
                   senior class, none of 'em reported
                   missing persons except the ones you
                   told me about.

                   Yeah, weird, huh?

     Joe Malloy is banging on the candy machine.  Lois and Clark 
     rush up to him.

                                   LOIS
                   Joe, are you okay?

                                   JOE
                   Damn machine.  There's one more 
                   Snickers in there, I can see it.  
                   It keeps saying it's empty, but 
                   it's not!  I want that last 
                   Snickers.

     Clark slips his foot under the machine and lifts it up a few
     inches and lets it drop, dislodging the candy bar.  He 
     reaches for it and hands it to Joe.

                                   CLARK
                   Here you go.  Joe Malloy, right?

                                   JOE
                   I don't mean to bother you people.. 
                   I just thought maybe you'd found 
                   out something about my Debbie... 
                   Or Peggy's husband, Les.
                        (tearing up)
                   I just don't know what to do
                   anymore.

     "At Seventeen" plays.  Annette takes the wriggling bag from 
     Hans, who holds the second bag.  She drops a Malibu Barbie 
     beach towel in the bag.

     She gives him a contemptuous look, takes the bag close to
     the doll house.


 44  INTERCUT DOLL HOUSE ROOM                                  44   

     The room of the doll house is full frame, making it look 
     normal.  Suddenly, the front door swings open and Dick 
     Keaton, covered in a little towel around his waist is shoved 
     into the room.

                                   LES
                   Dick!

                   Aw man... Les... Debbie... So this
                   is where you disappeared to.

                                   ANNETTE
                        (irritably)
                   Alright, break up the coffee
                   klatch!  You, Dick...

     She inserts the point of a pencil into a window.  It appears
     enormous in the room, prods Dick in the gut.

                                   ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                   ... For God's sake, get in that 
                   closet and put on something 
                   humiliating!

     Another push from the pencil and Dick scampers across the 
     room and into the closet.

                                   ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                        (snapping her fingers)
                   Hans, the last bag.

     Dick peers out from the closet.  The three look at each
     other:  "What's going on?"

                   Hans, you will perhaps note the bag
                   is empty.

                                   ANNETTE
                   Tell me he used the shampoo.

                   The shampoo didn't 'fail!'  I don't
                   'fail!' I gave _up_ 'failing!'  If
                   anyone around here 'failed' who

                   I want Lois' nightmare to begin!
                   Find out what happened!!

     Hans rushes out as Annette throws open an armoire to reveal 
     photos of Julie, Peggy, Joe and Lois.  Peggy and Joe have 
     black, crushed flower wreathes around them.  She places 
     another one around Julie's picture and clutches a fourth 
     wreath in her hands.

     Lois and Clark sit with Joe, who devours the Snickers bar.
     Clark pushes up his glasses, which keep slipping down his 
     nose.

                                   CLARK
                   Other than the fact you were 
                   friends in high school... There's 
                   nothing that links you and the 
                   other victims.

                                   JOE
                   I know.  After we graduated,
                   everyone sorta scattered.

                   How's Peggy?  I've been trying to
                   reach her.

                                   JOE
                   Completely shattered.  She and Les 
                   were so happy.  Seemed like they 
                   had it all.

                   Guess that's what they used to say

                   That's what you three had in 
                   common.  You were all big deals in 
                   high school.

                   wanna keep her waiting.  Thanks for

                   I'm not wearing cologne.

     Lois, standing close to him now, notices that his shirt 
     collar and tie are loose around his neck.  She goes to 
     tighten his tie.

     He looks down at his tie and collar, wondering what's up, 
     and his glasses slip off his face into his hands.  Lois 
     looks back.

                   Clark, your glasses!

     Clark quickly puts on his glasses, glances around.  Lois

     mirror hung on a wall.

     He loosens his tie, pulls his shirt collar away from his 
     neck.  There is quite a gap.  He stares down worriedly and 
     his glasses slip again.  He pushes them back onto his nose.
     He stares nervously into the mirror.  CAMERA MOVES IN on his

                   Jimmy said Julie's been trying to
                   reach me.  Sounds urgent.

     Lois gives him a look, dials the phone.

                   I'll try to find a wine that goes
                   with blackened lasagna.

     Clark heads to the wine rack, casually reaches for a bottle 
     on the top row, is startled to find he can't reach it.  He 
     glances back at Lois, who's preoccupied, reaches again.

     Hans, in a neighboring building window or outside the big

     Clark reaches again for the bottles, looks frustrated.  Hans
     smiles a wide, toothy grin as he pulls out a cel phone.

                                   HANS

     He's worried.  He looks to Lois to make sure she isn't 
     watching.  He FLOATS up to retrieve the bottle.  He puts the 
     wine on the table and heads to the bedroom.

     Clark enters and pulls off his sweater to reveal his shirt 
     sleeves folded up and held in place by rubber bands.  He 
     takes off the elastic and the cuffs drop, hanging just below 
     his fingertips.  Clark looks at his oversized clothes.

                                   CLARK
                        (to self)
                   This is insane.

                                   LOIS (O.S.)
                   I called Julie back and got a machine.

     Clark is swimming in his shirt.  He quickly tries pulling 
     the sleeves back up as:

                                   LOIS (O.S.)
                   Who leaves an urgent message and
                   then goes out?  I hope she isn't...

     Clark looks up.  Lois has come in the bedroom.  She stares,
     bewildered, at the dangling cuff.

                                   CLARK
                   Uh... I was just, uh, noticing that 
                   this shirt is, uh, all stretched 
                   out.

                                   LOIS
                        (as she approaches)
                   Not that I'm all that domestic...
                   But do shirts _stretch_?

     Clark continues to roll up the sleeves to hide his problem.

                                   CLARK
                   I gotta find a different
                   cleaners...

     Lois, now close enough to touch the shirt, sees that it's 
     really big, everywhere.

                                   LOIS
                        (afraid)
                   It looks like either your clothes 
                   are growing or.... Clark, what's 
                   happening to you?

                                   CLARK
                        (reluctantly)
                   I don't know.  I mean I know what's 
                   happening, I just don't understand 
                   how.  Or why.

                        (struggling for calm)
                   Has this ever happened before?

                                   CLARK
                   What's today... Tuesday?  The first
                   I noticed it was Monday.

                                   LOIS
                   This started yesterday and you 
                   didn't tell me?!  What were you 
                   thinking of?!

                                   CLARK
                   I was thinking, 'Don't tell Lois.
                   It'll only upset her.'
                        (off her exasperated
                         look)
                   I just wanted to get some facts 
                   first, to make sense out of what's 
                   happening to me.

                                   LOIS
                   To _us_.  Whatever happens to you 
                   or me, happens to us.  Didn't you 
                   just get through saying 'we're in 
                   this together?'

     She can see the worry in his eyes; puts her arms around him.

                                   LOIS (CONT'D)
                        (gently)
                   And we'll get through this.
                   Together.

 54  INT. STAR LABS - DAY #4                                   54   

     We see smoldering wood and a frozen beaker on the counter.
     Superman, standing on a scale with a sliding height bar over 
     his head, bends a steel bar into a pretzel and hands it to a 
     LAB ASSISTANT.  Dr. Klein looks on, making notes on a 
     clipboard.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   Your powers are functioning 
                   normally but you've experienced a 
                   significant loss in height and body 
                   mass.  I'm not sure why but the 
                   suit fits as snugly as ever.

                                   SUPERMAN
                   It's the aura effect.  Anything 
                   within a tenth of a millimeter is
                   essentially a second skin.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   What's happening to you could be a 
                   result of living on Earth all these 
                   years under a yellow sun.  Perhaps 
                   your molecular structure can only 
                   tolerate a yellow sun for a finite 
                   period before it begins to break 
                   down.

                                   SUPERMAN
                   At least it seems to be happening
                   very slowly...

                                   DR. KLEIN
                        (awkwardly)
                   Although... I'm afraid that... as
                   your body mass declines...

                                   SUPERMAN
                   It's okay, Doc... Tell me.  You can
                   be blunt.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   Think of yourself as a snowman.  As 
                   a snowman melts there is less and 
                   less to protect it from the effects 
                   of the sun.  Before you know it, 
                   you're nothing more than a puddle 
                   with a corn cob pipe.

     Superman stares, stunned.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                        (angry at himself)
                   Too blunt!  Too blunt!  I knew it! 
                   You can see why I don't do clinical 
                   work.

     Dr. Klein notices Superman is a few inches lower than the 
     height bar.  Dr. Klein moves it down and records it.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                        (disturbed)
                   Oh dear.  You're smaller than when
                   you arrived.

     Superman swallows hard.

     Lois walks to her desk with Julie Keaton who appears to be 
     in shock.  Lois notices Clark's empty chair.  Perry 
     approaches wearing a new cowboy hat.

                                   PERRY
                   Lois, where's Clark?
                                   LOIS
                        (too casually)
                   Oh... I'm sure he'll turn up...

                        (firmly)
                   When the rooster crows
                   cock-a-doodle-doo I expect every 
                   ranch hand to get his keester out 
                   of the bunkhouse and pull his own 
                   weight!
                        (walking away)
                   C'mon you dogies, roll 'em out.

                   He's... going through an urban
                   cowboy phase.

                        (emotionally)
                   Dick did, too.  I gave him such a
                   hard time.
                        (bursting into tears)
                   God, how I'd love to see him!  Even
                   in those stupid boots!

                   I'm so sorry.  If I'd gotten hold 
                   of you last night, I would've come 
                   over...

                   Thanks, Lois... Actually, Annette 
                   was with me.  She was so nice...

     They sit at Lois's desk.

                   No... Want to know something awful?
                   I used to sort of... tease her.

                   Sorry
                        (into phone)
                   Hello... Clark!  What did Dr. Klein
                   say?
                        (beat)
                   Meet you?  Well, yeah, I could...
                        (startled; quietly:)
                   In an alley?

 58  EXT. GLOOMY ALLEY - DUSK                                  58   

     Lois edges her way into the shadows of the alley.  She is 
     cautious and anxious.  Clark is unseen in the dark shadows
     throughout this scene.

                                   LOIS
                        (calls out quietly)
                   Clark.  Clark are you here?

                                   CLARK (O.S.)
                   I'm here.

     Lois walks towards his voice.  She nears him.  We will not 
     see Clark.

                                   CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Lois, stop.  Please don't come any
                   closer.

                                   LOIS
                        (frightened)
                   What's wrong?

     in deep shadow.

                                   CLARK
                   I went to see Dr. Klein...

                                   LOIS
                   Clark, I think whatever's happening 
                   has something to do with that 
                   exterminator!  Dick is gone, and 
                   there was an exterminator at _his_
                   place...

                   and talk to me?!

     She steps forward but still can't see Clark.

                                   CLARK
                   Lois stop.  Just listen.  I can't
                   let you see me like this.

                        (emotionally)
                   Can't or won't?  Clark, you know
                   how scared I was to let you into my
                   life.  I always thought it was weak
                   to need someone.  But it's not.

                                   CLARK
                   Lois... I need to handle this
                   alone.

                        (fighting tears)         
                   Look, ask me to scour the earth for 
                   a bad guy, ask me to wake up every 
                   cop... knock on every door, ask me 
                   to walk on water, but please don't 
                   ask me to walk away!  Because 
                   that's one thing I don't know how

     A silence hangs between them.

                        (with difficulty)
                   I know.

     Lois creeps forward and, for just a second, sees what
     appears to be a child's silhouette in the shadows.  Her
     mouth falls open and immediately the silhouette blurs away
     with the familiar WHOOSH!

                                                 CUT TO:


 60  INT. CLARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT #4                         60   

     The door is jimmied open and Hans creeps in toward the
     bedroom with his bag.  Again, he searches along the floor
     and in the corners.  He hears Lois enter so he quickly
     rushes into the bathroom, shutting the door.


 61  WITH LOIS                                                 61   

     Lois enters in a panic looking for Clark.

                                   LOIS
                   Clark, forgive me. I tried to do
                   what you asked, maybe not hard
                   enough, but I tried.  I'm here to
                   help.

     She stops when she sees Clark's suit wadded up on the floor
     in a  pile. His glasses sit on top of the pile.  She picks
     up his glasses and puts them in her jacket breast pocket.

                                   LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Clark?

     Silence.  She picks up his shirt and presses it to her face.

                                   LOIS (CONT'D)
                        (overcome with grief)
                   Oh, Clark...


 62  INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     62   

     Hans listens from the shadows.  He reaches into the shower
     to retrieve the shampoo from among other bottles on the
     shower shelf.


 63  LOIS                                                      63   

     A NOISE of falling objects in the bathroom.  Lois spins,
     startled, cautiously heads towards the bathroom.  She starts
     to push the door open when suddenly Hans bursts out,
     attempting to escape.  Lois spins around to see him.  They
     struggle into the living room.  He pushes her out of the way
     with his stick/bag. She falls over a chair as he dashes out
     the door.  Lois gets up and makes her way to the window.
     She looks out to see:

     Hans dashes across the patio area, leaps onto the ladder
     mounted on the building and disappears.  On the back of his
     coveralls is the big logo 'SNOIL' Pest Control.


 65  BACK TO LOIS                                              65

                        (quietly)
                   'Snoil.'

     As she ponders this, she sniffs a familiar floral scent.
     She turns on a light to discover the blue bottle of shampoo
     was dropped in the scuffle.  It has spilled over a potted
     plant that was overturned.  She grabs Clark's shirt, sniffs
     it.  It is the same scent.

                                   LOIS
                   Joe said Clark's cologne reminded
                   him of his wife.
                        (holds up blue bottle)
                   But it wasn't cologne.

     Lois looks back down at the plant.


 66  INTERCUT HER POV - THE PLANT                              66   

     The plant has shriveled down to a minuscule version of its
     original size.  ON Lois' horrified reaction,

                                                 BLACK.

     FADE IN:

 67  INT. LOIS'S KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                          67   

     Lois is asleep, slumped over the kitchen table, surrounded
     by a phone, legal pads covered in scribbled facts, a dish
     with the remains of dinner.  In the background we HEAR white
     noise from a television set long without programming.


 68  ANGLE ON LIVING ROOM WINDOW                               68   

     A torn page from a magazine floats through the window, as if
     guided by the wind.  It comes to rest on the table by Lois's
     dozing face.


 69  CLOSE ON MAGAZINE PAGE                                    69   

     The headline reads:  "Chemist Shrinks Living Cells"

     Superman, now six inches tall, comes out from under the
     corner of the page.  He watches Lois wistfully.


 70  LOIS                                                      70   

     A BLUR of blue streaks away from where she rests, and out of
     FRAME.  Then a small blanket floats into FRAME, settling
     around her shoulders.  The edge of the blanket flutters, and
     another BLUR streaks out from under it and away.


 71  THE TV SET                                                71   

     Static plays across its face.  The BLUR streaks by, and the
     screen goes blank.


 72  A SHELF (OR TABLE TOP)                                    72   

     On it rests a framed, full length photo of Lois.


 73  CLOSER - THE PHOTO                                        73   

     Tiny Superman floats down to stand before the picture, his
     eyes meeting Lois'.  He reaches out to touch her.


 74  LOIS                                                      74   

     She bolts upright.

     Lois then notices the Article on the table.  She looks,
     picks it up, looks at it, then glances around and sees the
     TV turned off and the afghan around her shoulders.  A smile
     comes across her face.  She knows he's returned.

                                   LOIS

     Lois stands and begins to look around.

                   Clark, I know what happened to you.
                   It was the shampoo.  I took it to
                   Dr. Klein to analyze.

                                   SUPERMAN
                   Then you know what it's doing to
                   me.

                                   LOIS
                   And I know how scared you must be.
                   And how scared I am.  But what
                   scares me even more is you think
                   you have to go through this
                   _alone_...

                                   SUPERMAN

                   for me!

                                   SUPERMAN
                   What kind of husband would I be?  I
                   don't know if I can protect you or 
                   even how long I'll be around.

                                   LOIS
                   Your ego is so tied up in being
                   this guy who busts through walls...

                                   SUPERMAN
                   It's not ego, Lois!  This wouldn't
                   be a marriage!

                                   LOIS
                   I guess it wouldn't.  A marriage is 
                   where two people solve their 
                   problems _together_.  We would 
                   solve this, Clark!

                                   SUPERMAN
                   I didn't come here to fight with
                   you.

                                   LOIS
                        (frustrated)
                   Then why did you come here?  To 
                   tell me you're going to stay away 
                   forever?

                                   SUPERMAN
                   Well, I was hoping I'd be more like
                   a guardian angel.

                                   LOIS
                   I don't want you to watch over me,
                   I want you to be with me.

     She glares at the picture, and suddenly there's a BLUR of 
     blue from behind the picture and out the window.  Lois 
     stares at the open window as the blast of air flutters 
     things around her.  The fight goes out of her.  She stares 
     sadly out at the night.

                                   LOIS
                        (quietly)
                   I love you, Clark.

     She stares down at the article in her hand, then flops down
     on the couch.  She looks around forlornly, then down at the
     yearbook on the coffee table.  She looks away, then
     something about the yearbook pulls her attention back.


 78  COVER OF YEARBOOK - INSERT                                78

     She slowly reaches down, picks up the yearbook, goes to a
     mirror, holds up the yearbook in front of her.  The word
     "LIONS" is reflected backwards.

                   A little.  But we're nowhere near 
                   reversing its effect.
                        (losing it)
                   Lois, I've never been under so much 
                   pressure!  I have this enormous 
                   responsibility!  If the world knew 
                   he was shrinking....

                                   LOIS
                   _Klein_!  Pull it together!  This 
                   is not about you, it's about 
                   Superman.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   Right.

                   If you had this Dr. Graham's 
                   notes... Could you find the 
                   antidote?

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   Possibly, but the details of the 
                   work were confidential, and Dr. 
                   Graham vanished some months ago.
                   He was never found.

                                   LOIS
                   Well, who did he work for?

                                   DR. KLEIN
                   Gee, I believe his work was funded
                   by a large... cosmetics firm.

                   Yeah, those people are always
                   trying to shrink _some_thing.

     Lois stares off, wheels turning, suddenly piecing things

                   An exterminator was at Julie's

                   to get those notes!!

     She heads full steam for the door.  There is a sudden 
     WHOOSH, and a note floats down from above.  Dr. Klein 
     snatches it.

     sleep on the sofa and easy chairs in their one room hell.

     One side of the room is _massed_ with high school
     memorabilia.  A cheerleader outfit with "Julie" written in
     script is in a plexiglass frame.  There's a football helmet
     mounted on a stand.  Pennants with "LIONS," pom-poms,
     pictures of Peggy as prom queen, school paper "The Lionette"
     with headline "Lois Lane New President," etc.

                   high school.

                                   ANNETTE
                   I... was assembling it all for the 
                   reunion.
                        (then)
                   Lois.  Please.  Share your pain
                   with me.

                                   LOIS
                   That's Julie's cheerleading
                   outfit...  And isn't that Joe's
                   helmet..?

                                   ANNETTE
                   Joe was very grateful for...
                   everything I've done.

                                   LOIS
                   Generous of you, considering you
                   didn't like him in high school.

                                   ANNETTE
                   No, it was the other way around.
                   Did you know I went to every one of 
                   his games and he never even looked 
                   my way?

                                   LOIS
                   And Julie used to tease you ... ?

                                   ANNETTE
                   She found my weight, wardrobe, 
                   braces, and attempts to speak, 
                   amusing, yes.

                                   LOIS
                   And what'd I do, Annette?

     Annette suddenly realizes where this is headed, heads for 
     the door.

                                   ANNETTE
                   I think you'd better go, Lo-Lo...

                                   LOIS
                   I'd almost forgotten you ran
                   against me for President.

                                   ANNETTE
                   Of course you forgot, Lois.  
                   Nothing I _ever_ did made the 
                   slightest impression on you.

                                   ANNETTE
                   Pretty Peggy got all the attention, 
                   all the valentines and all the 
                   boys.  Interesting, isn't it?  Now 
                   everyone needs me to comfort them!  
                   Even you.

                                   LOIS
                   You don't want to comfort anyone,
                   you just want to see our pain.

     Sudden muffled SCREAMS for help.  Lois spins to notice the 
     covered doll house, and charges over to it.

                                   ANNETTE
                   DON'T!!!

     Lois rips the cover off the doll house and stares, stunned.

     Debbie, Les, and Dick stand shouting.  Clark is gone.

                                   DEBBIE/LES/DICK
                   Lois!  Get us outta here!  She
                   shrunk us!  Call the cops!

     She stands staring, and:

                        (coolly)
                   Clark isn't here and Hans is having 
                   great difficulty finding him.

     Lois slowly turns as SHOT WIDENS to reveal Annette holding a 
     gun on Lois.

                                   ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                   So, maybe he's shrunk away to
                   nothing.
                        (a cruel smile)
                   Lonely, Lois?  Need a hug?

                                   LOIS
                   Annette!  You can make things right 
                   by turning over Dr. Graham's 
                   research notes.

     There is a tiny streak of blue behind Annette.

     Annette FIRES at Lois; Lois flies down to the floor.

                   I guess I'll have to clean up my
                   own dirty work.

     She charges off to the other room.

     There's a smoking hole in the cloth. The pocket wiggles.
     Superman climbs out of it, holding the mangled bullet.

                   Good work, people.  You two make an
                   incredible team.  But I guess I say
                   that too often.

                   Oh, I dunno... Seems it bears
                   repeating now and again.

     Clark smiles sheepishly at her.

                                   CLARK
                   Chief... No cowboy boots?

                                   PERRY
                   Aww, Sally said my boots were
                   doseying when I was doeing.  And I
                   couldn't get my tush to push.

                   So the Fortune Teller was right.
                   There _was_ a little Kent in my
                   future.

                                   CLARK
                   Are you saying I was 'small' not to

                                   LOIS
                   The four of us make a pretty good 
                   team.  We should double date more

                   Sure.  But I can always hear you
                   repeat it.

                                   SUPERMAN
                   Everything.  No matter what we do, 
                   crack a spy ring or go to the car 
                   wash, as long as we're together 
                   it's... the best.
