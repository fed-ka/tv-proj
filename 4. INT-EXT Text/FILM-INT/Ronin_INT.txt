It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're
MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
is a medieval cathedral.
And as we continue MOVING UP
something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.
Running thin,
then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.
In one hand
the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.
In the
other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
silenced pistol dangling at his side.
We don't know him, and
it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
his face because we'll see him again.
The Killer now picks
up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
BRIEFCASE.
The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.
The
Killer shows them the Briefcase.
KILLER
God loves me.
THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
The Killer raises his silenced pistol.
KILLER
(to his victim)
But I don't think he's too fond of you...
SLAM CUT TO:
A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
bar in this smokey, dim dive.
UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
This is not football...
And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.
We
see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no
attention to each other.
One of these men watches the game
with real interest.
The Ugly American talks on from off
screen.
UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
(continuing)
...Football is three hundred pound guys,
they run way too fucking fast, they got
helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
the quarterback into the next life.
SLAM CUT TO:
AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.
He's got
an obvious attitude, all of it bad.
But there's something
about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of
a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
solid.
LARRY
(talking to the air)
You wanna know what football is?
It's
hitting the other guy dirty and then
spitting in his face when he's down.
Football is all things American, and
American is A-Number-One the absolute
fucking best there is.
That's what
football is...
(he points to the TV)
...And that's not football.
The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns
slowly and gives Larry a long look.
This is VINCENT: French,
hard boiled and solid.
Charming when he wants to be, which
isn't all that often.
He gives Larry a long look and then
speaks -
VINCENT
(to Larry in perfect English)
Football -- American football -- is a
game for faggots.
A BEAT.
The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough
customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
they're interested: what's Larry going to say?
For a moment
it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
Vincent joins in, as do the others.
In particular - THE
BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
drunk, but these guys are in a different league.
The
Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a
confrontation as we go back to -
Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
here for a reason.
With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
man from Eastern Europe.
His accent is hard to pin down,
but he most definitely has one.
Gregor has the air of an ex-
spook, and that's exactly what he is.
Lastly we see SWEDE --
blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.
No, he's
not stupid -- he's a sociopath.
Now - Sam looks at the
group, which grows quiet as he enters.
Finally, Sam speaks.
SAM
Sorry I'm late...
VINCENT
(a challenge)
What makes you think we're here to meet
you?
SAM
(meeting Vincent's gaze)
Who else would you be?
Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an
expansive gesture.
VINCENT
Perhaps the police?
SAM
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for
Sam to join them.
Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes
them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.
VINCENT
Cigarette?
SAM
No thanks.
Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -
LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.
Barely
visible we can see Deirdre.
And staring at Deirdre - THE
WATCHER.
Somebody we're going to see periodically through
the movie.
Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
defined PAIR OF HANDS.
And in those hands - A KNIFE.
As the
Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
methodically, perfectly.
And he watches.
First Deirdre, and
then turning his attention to THE BAR.
He's especially
interested in the bar.
A TIME CUT TO:
The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.
When this is
finished he looks up at -
A TABLE IN THE BACK -
Where our five guys have relocated.
Now the Bartender and
Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a
set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
into Vincent's hand.
The Bartender and Vincent speak in
rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.
Sam turns
to Vincent.
SAM
He trusts you to lock up?
VINCENT
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
around the table -- again, nobody takes on.
Vincent seems
really disappointed by this.
LARRY
Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting
for?
VINCENT
(lighting his cigarette)
The question isn't what we're waiting
for... it's who.
LARRY
And who the fuck is that?
GREGOR
Whoever hired us.
SAM
I got this gig through a contractor.
And he most definitely didn't know who
was doing the hiring, only that they
were paying a lot of money...
There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
were hired the same way.
SAM
(continuing his thought)
So none of us knows who's paying the
freight, this is just some anonymous job.
For all we know, we're working for
different people.
GREGOR
Now that is an interesting proposition.
SWEDE
How so?
GREGOR
Because if there's more than one party
involved, if we really are working for
different people, then perhaps some of us
are on different sides.
(with great meaning)
Your orders might be different from mine.
LARRY
What're you talking about, man?
I don't
understand.
SWEDE
(quietly, but loud enough to be
heard)
What a surprise...
LARRY
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
GREGOR
(sharply, as if he's used to
giving orders)
Why don't both of you shut up?
LARRY & SWEDE
(to Gregor at the same time)
Fuck you!
SAM
Knock it off!
There is a BEAT.
Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who
glares them all down.
Lastly, Sam turns and looks at
Vincent.
The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
kind of mutual respect.
SAM
The point remains: we could be working
for different people.
There's a chance
for one of us...
(looks around the table)
Maybe more than one of us -- has been
paid to cross the others.
I don't know
about you guys, but I like to know who
I'm working for.
It can help prevent a
great deal of...
(finding the right word)
...unpleasantness.
LARRY
(patting the gun inside his
cheap suit)
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put
two between his eyes -- one to do the job
and the other to make sure it takes.
From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.
ANOTHER ANGLE -
Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last
exchange.
DEIRDRE
It's good to see you've all got such
faith in our little undertaking.
LARRY
Who the fuck are you?
DEIRDRE
(staring at Larry)
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this
show.
GREGOR
Who are you?
IRA?
DEIRDRE
(with a brittle laugh)
Not likely.
Once, yeah, I was -- but
there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
meaning.
I'm a hired gun, same as the
rest of you, and that's all any of us
needs to know about the other.
Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.
Larry and Swede
open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
inside.
Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
money.
But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.
DEIRDRE
From here on in you want something you
pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank
accounts are in place: ten percent up
front, the rest when the job is done.
(a quick beat, then she looks
at Gregor)
You.
What do you do and what should we
call you?
GREGOR
These days they they call me Gregor -- and
I'm a tech.
I do electronic work,
surveillance, computer runs.
Deirdre turns to Sam.
SAM
Sam.
I'm a weapons guy.
DEIRDRE
You were a soldier, were you?
SAM
Once.
Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.
Finally,
Deirdre turns to Larry.
LARRY
I drive -- and my name is Larry.
Larry
from the States.
DEIRDRE
(she turns to Vincent)
And who are you?
VINCENT
I'm Vincent.
And I coordinate.
SAM
(sharply)
Coordinate what?
VINCENT
Things.
This is my country, you know.
The two men exchange another look.
A pecking order is
developing among the group: Vincent and Sam are both natural
leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.
DEIRDRE
(to Vincent)
Coordinate all you want, but make sure
whatever you do gets cleared through me.
(Vincent doesn't respond for a
moment)
Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
VINCENT
Of course.
Deirdre waits a BEAT, letting Vincent know what she isn't any
more intimidated by him than he is by her.
Finally, she
turns to Swede.
SWEDE
They call me Swede.
LARRY
Who's they?
SWEDE
Everybody.
VINCENT
And what is it you do?
SWEDE
Me?
(with a smile)
I kill.
CUT TO:
A PAPER TARGET, in the shape of a human being, dances in
place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS, each shot hitting the
target in the belly, each shot fired by - Larry, whose been
shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just
discharged an entire clip.
The gun is empty, Larry turns to
Sam, who stands next in line.
SAM
(looking at the target)
You shoot alright.
LARRY
Gets the job done.
SAM
All in the stomach, though.
Your man
might live.
LARRY
Not for long.
SAM
Long enough to shoot back.
LARRY
Is that right?
SAM
It's been known to happen.
LARRY
(a challenge)
Why don't you go do better, then...
Without a word, Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
target in a different place.
One he clips between the eyes,
the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
half.
Larry is impressed in spite of himself.
LARRY
Yeah, well...
My way works too.
SAM
My way is better.
IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -
Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
electronic whizmos.
Right now Gregor is holding a
particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands, looking
at it almost lovingly.
DEIRDRE (O.S.)
Is it alright?
ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell
phone.
GREGOR
It's quite satifactory.
DEIRDRE
Good, because it cost enough.
There's
cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
you better fucking use it.
GREGOR
(almost caressing the phone)
I intend to.
This phone is wired like no
other: it's got an encryption chip and
instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
talk to any computer in any language and
make it understand.
With my custom
hardware and this phone I can trace the
target's cell phone signature and follow
him anywhere he goes...
DEIRDRE
You sure about this?
GREGOR
I'd stake my reputation.
DEIRDRE
But would you stake your life, that's the
question...
GREGOR
In this business, your life and your
reputation are more often than not one
and the same.
From off screen we hear MUNCHING.
It's - Larry inhaling a
sandwich.
A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's
cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry.
SWEDE
You should watch what you eat.
LARRY
Who the fuck died and appointed you food
czar?
SWEDE
I'm just worried about your health,
Larry.
You could stand to shed a few
pounds.
LARRY
(sensitive about his weight)
And you could stand to get a little
smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde
fuck?
SWEDE
(sensitive about the dumb
blonde thing)
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches
for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the
same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN
swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping
him to the floor.
Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but
it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to
the ground.
DEIRDRE
(standing above them)
Next one of you fuckers plays this game
I'm going to do for you myself.
I won't
say it again: we don't have time for this
shit!
There's a clock running on this
job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on
schedule.
A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
letting them know who's in charge.
A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent,
who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.
He's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling
men, and then at - Deirdre.
She gives Vincent a little nod --
a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam.
VINCENT
Let's go for a ride.
Vincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede
and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.
SAM
Where to?
VINCENT
To see a man about a thing.
SAM
I can do that.
VINCENT
That was a nice move you did on our young
friend.
Judo?
SAM
Jujitsu.
VINCENT
Same thing, isn't it?
SAM
Not at all.
Similar, but not the same.
VINCENT
What's the difference?
SAM
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of
Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -
Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette.
He tosses his
pack to Sam, but he seems a little surprised at Sam's
request.
VINCENT
Help yourself.
(quick beat)
Since when do you smoke?
SAM
(lighting up)
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a
week.
VINCENT
A cigarette?
As in one?
(exasperated, almost to
himself)
One cigarette a week, who smokes like
that?
SAM
I do.
VINCENT
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
and I tell myself I could be worse.
(takes a satisfying drag)
It's just so damned pleasurable.
SAM
(blowing a smoke ring with
great skill)
It has it's moments.
(stubs out cigarette)
Course, you get cancer and die, that's
the down side.
VINCENT
(with a sigh)
There is that.
Vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy
that Sam has spoiled his smoke.
SAM
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the
ride?
Job like this calls for a warm
body, somebody who can stand around and
look threatening.
A tough guy.
VINCENT
Like Larry or Swede.
SAM
Exactly.
Why not bring them?
VINCENT
Let's just say I thought the
conversational possibilities were
limited.
Of course, I might have brought
Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right
candidate -- for this.
SAM
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for
sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.
He's
smart, Gregor is.
VINCENT
So is the woman.
SAM
Deirdre?
Smart, yeah, and seriously
goddamned dangerous.
VINCENT
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
SAM
I've wondered that myself.
None of this
answers my question, though...
(suddenly direct)
Why bring me?
VINCENT
I wanted to see who you were.
SAM
Who am I?
Vincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance
before speaking.
VINCENT
You were once some kind of special
forces.
Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy
SEAL.
After that you rode shotgun for
the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
(beat)
Only now -- now you're like the rest of
us, it's a very competitive market since
the end of the cold war.
There's a lot
of hired guns out here, and not nearly
enough work to go around.
SAM
That's right: there's not hardly enough
work these days, nothing that pays the
big money, anyhow.
Then along comes this
job, paying so much goddamned money I
couldn't afford not to take it.
Somebody's
paying through the nose for this.
VINCENT
They certainly are.
Whatever it is we're
going to steal, it must be quite
something.
SAM
Whatever it is it must be goddamned
priceless.
And on that thought we -
CUT TO:
The two men drive in silence for a moment.
Vincent lights a
cigarette and offers one to Sam, who refuses.
Finally, Sam
speaks.
SAM
You know, what you pulled back there,
that was bullshit.
VINCENT
I needed to see if you were a cop.
(defensively)
I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,
and whenever they try to catch me they
always do it with an inside guy -- some
man on some job who seems more
trustworthy than all the others put
together.
And that's the guy you have to
watch out for.
(beat)
I hate cops...
SAM
(insulted that Vincent would
even consider it)
Well I ain't a cop.
A BEAT, the two men driving in silence.
VINCENT
How did you know?
SAM
Know what?
VINCENT
That there was a gun pointed at me.
SAM
I saw you look off when Francois nodded
his head.
I figured he wasn't pointing
out a particularly rare shrub, and the
rest was easy.
VINCENT
But how did you know I would have the
presence of mind to pull my weapon
when I did?
SAM
(as if it's obvious)
Because that's what I would have done...
CUT TO:
Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.
They've
told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about
all of this.
VINCENT
We kept it...
DEIRDRE
(a little annoyed)
Is that right?
SAM
Hazard pay...
DEIRDRE
(with an exhalation of disgust)
The two of you were supposed to go to a
simple meet and come back with a simple
piece of information, and instead you
went to fucking war...
SAM
We weren't real thrilled about it
either...
Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.
We FOLLOW HER
INTO -
AN ADJOINING ROOM -
Where Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.
They look up
expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without
stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.
LARRY
So what's the deal?
DEIRDRE
(barely stopping, very
snappish)
The deal?
The deal is we leave for Nice
at first light.
And she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam
and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.
larry
looks at the two of them.
LARRY
What'd you guys do?
Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
do a martial arts form.
Right now he's frozen, one leg
extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.
Now - A
KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.
Deirdre stands
there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,
and then retracts his leg.
DEIRDRE
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set
of Enter The Dragon.
Could you teach me
to do that?
SAM
I didn't think to see you again tonight.
You were pretty pissed.
DEIRDRE
I still am.
SAM
Is that right?
DEIRDRE
That's right.
Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at
him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm
thrust.
Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
floor until he's got his back to the wall.
Their movements
are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost
flirtatious about the whole thing.
Now -
Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.
He slips
behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.
The
previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing
through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and
techniques.
They're not angry, but they're not kidding,
either.
Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!
Sam wasn't distracted at
all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
and now - She's trapped beneath him.
The two of them are
breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one
another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone
from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their
faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and
he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.
SAM
Part of me says I should just look at
this as a perk.
You know, a bonus.
But
then I remember you're you -- Deirdre
who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
come very naturally to you.
DEIRDRE
(kissing him very lightly)
Nobody's saying they don't.
SAM
(returning the kiss, just as
lightly)
And when I consider that, I have to
wonder if you don't have some ulterior
motive for being here, with me, right
now.
DEIRDRE
I probably do.
(pulling him close)
But for the time being, I'm willing to
forget about it...
They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and
as they start to make love the
CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until
we've reached -
Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.
Sam seems to be
sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
when -
Sam's HAND reaches out, gently yet firmly, and takes her by
the arm.
SAM (O.S.)
No goodbye?
ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake --
looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.
DEIRDRE
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way
when I tell you we won't be doing this
again.
SAM
You don't have to explain yourself to me,
Deirdre.
DEIRDRE
(almost surprised by this)
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just
that, for once, I want to.
when I was a -
(almost with a sneer)
Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with
any man it was deemed necessary for me to
sleep with.
You know: any man who needed
setting up.
Sometimes so we might
blackmail him, sometimes so he could be
killed.
(a quick beat)
Sometimes so I could kill him myself.
IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist
organization, Sam.
To most of the men I
with I was always the girl.
"Send the girl
to do it."
"Tell The girl to take care of
it."
"Have the girl fuck him."
(a quick beat)
But I look at you and I get this feeling
you take me for what I am: no more, no
less.
SAM
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like
me.
DEIRDRE
Exactly.
And last night I wanted to be
with someone who was just like me.
Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
They're lips brush and -
A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.
A
QUICK BEAT, then -
DEIRDRE
I better be getting that.
SAM
Duty calls?
DEIRDRE
(with a trace of a sigh)
Just business.
Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
his door.
The muted phone is a little louder now.
Deirdre
closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand
and catches the door right before it snaps shut.
He watches
THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and
opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly
until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting
Sam out.
The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
to - BLACK.
Just for a second.
And then - BLINDING SUN hits
us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -
GREGOR
(finishing her sentence)
Ready when you are...
Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's
message, which we can read on his laptop.
Gregor also has a
much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we
see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.
This is a map of
incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city
as it searches for the proper signal.
The computer isolates
an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the
district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.
Now
- On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.
The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and
as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,
driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the
Target.
THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence
start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -
Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,
loading a small arsenal of weapons.
The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.
LARRY
Where is this broad?
SWEDE
You should learn a little patience.
LARRY
Is that right?
SWEDE
It's consider a virtue in some corners
of the world.
LARRY
Not in mine.
THE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.
Deirdre's
Voice is heard on the speaker phone.
DEIRDRE (V.O.)
Hello gentlemen, are we ready?
A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.
Sam is tending to
Larry's wound.
Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry
is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
shift stand.
SAM
(answering Larry's question)
It's a cocktail.
Mostly demerol, cut
with a little crank because we might need
you awake in the real near future.
LARRY
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.
I don't care what it takes, we are
getting our property back and putting it
into the hands of the people who are
gonna pay us a great deal of money when
we do.
I don't know about the rest of you
guys, but I'm not the kind of guy
to just sit back and take it in the ass.
(a quick beat)
I don't mean that in, like, a literal
way...
DEIRDRE
Of course.
VINCENT
Finding this package is a thing easier
said than done.
We don't even know what
it is.
(he looks at Deirdre, and
suddenly he's deadly earnest)
What did we steal?
DEIRDRE
(suddenly defensive)
I don't know.
VINCENT
When this whole thing started you made it
clear: you're running the show.
And I
don't believe you'd be running this show
if you didn't know what was going on.
DEIRDRE
Well I don't!
VINCENT
And I don't believe you...
Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's
head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
well, jammed into his stomach.
DEIRDRE
(suddenly feral)
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
VINCENT
(matching her intensity)
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the
the truth!
SAM (O.S.)
(with a dead cool in his voice)
Both of you...
ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or
Vincent, but not both at the same time.
The question is:
whose side is he on?
SAM
(continuing without missing a
beat)
...put your guns down and chill out.
A BEAT.
And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons,
followed by Sam.
SAM
Like it or now, we're on the same side:
we're here and the package isn't.
(looks at Deirdre)
You're not the boss any more, you're our
partner.
So tell us what you know, so we
can figure a way out of this mess.
Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust
based upon their physical intimacy.
SAM
Now, what did we steal?
DEIRDRE
(she hates to admit this)
I don't know...
(defensively, off Vincent's
look)
Well I don't!
It's a goddamned mystery
to me just like it is to you.
(quick beat, then reluctantly
continuing)
But I do know who we're working for.
My
people, and the Russian mob.
LARRY
Your people?
Who the fuck is your
people?
VINCENT
Who do you think, Larry?
The IRA.
DEIRDRE
And you believed me?
(passionately)
But it wasn't my people who did it.
LARRY
How do we know that?
SAM
Because if they had she'd be gone along
with the package, instead of sitting here
with us.
DEIRDRE
Exactly.
Gregor, he was the Russian's
man.
It was my people came up with the
idea for this run, but the Russians who
had the capital to finance it.
Gregor,
he was their insurance, and I was ours.
Everybody else was supposed to be
neutral.
Gregor must've got to Swede...
LARRY
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
DEIRDRE
That's why you were riding with him.
VINCENT
The question still remains: what do we do
now?
SAM
(he figures something out)
Gregor's cell phone...
LARRY
(to himself)
What are you gonna do, call him up and
ask him to give us back our shit?
SAM
(ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)
Did he bring that with him?
DEIRDRE
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
was using, it was in his contract.
Cost
a nice penny, too, especially that
goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive
tastes.
SAM
Check this out.
(he's thinking on his feet)
Gregor's a spook, or he was one until
recently.
When he was a spy he lived the
life -- you know, a prince in some
Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
shit and Gregor had everything.
Then the
wall goes down.
No more Cold War.
And
Gregor is out of a job.
No apartment, no
special stores with Western food and
video tapes.
I would bet dollars against
shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
doesn't want to give it up.
And I
wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant
enough to think...
DEIRDRE
(finishing his sentence)
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they
might still win this one.
Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down
the length of the Cours Mirabeau.
GREGOR
(breaking the silence)
It's a beautiful street, no?
The Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than
Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident
of what used to be called the Soviet Union.
DAPPER GENT
(he can't wait any longer)
Do you have it?
GREGOR
Always in a rush, you are.
All these
years I've known you, you could never
wait for anything.
DAPPER GENT
This is important.
GREGOR
Do you really think so?
DAPPER GENT
You know it is.
Gregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the
Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece.
GREGOR
Relax!
The Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat.
Gregor pulls the van to a curb.
GREGOR
Look over there.
GREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
CHILDREN are playing.
GREGOR (O.S.)
Do you see that one?
The girl in the
light blue dress?
We find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the
end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.
She's
breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his
silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.
DAPPER GENT
What are you doing, have you lost your
mind?!?
Gregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly
shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
ground behind the playing children.
Nobody notices a thing.
BEAT.
The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no
doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
hadn't ruined his aim.
DAPPER GENT
Why did you do that?
GREGOR
To make a point.
I don't know her, and I
was ready to splatter her brains all over
the sidewalk.
(giving the Gent a look)
I don't particularly like you, so imagine
what I'll do if you try anything...
Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
necessary and then starts the jeep as we -
CUT TO:
DAPPER GENT
(squirming)
Enough!
We've been driving for an hour,
where is my package?
Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.
He pulls the
jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent.
GREGOR
It's under your seat.
DAPPER GENT
(incredulous)
What?
GREGOR
As my American friend Larry would say:
are you fucking deaf?
It's under your
seat.
The Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the
Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat.
DAPPER GENT
I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.
I
thought I trained you better than that.
With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor,
whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is -
COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like
a prince for quite some time.
Gregor sucks in an involuntary
breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't
reached for the Briefcase.
Instead he's taken out his gun,
and it's only inches from Gregor's head.
DAPPER GENT
I've never particularly liked you either,
Gregor.
The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does -
THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still
attached by the handcuff chain.
The Hand flies up in the
Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting
to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it
scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and
fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound
of another silenced shot as we -
SMASH CUT TO:
Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.
We
hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
picked up.
PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
(in Russian, English subtitles)
Is it done?
GREGOR
(in English)
It's done.
BEAT.
The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever
this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.
The Voice
switches to English.
PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
Gregor, is that you?
GREGOR
(with a low chuckle)
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have
happened.
GREGOR
(suddenly cold, furious)
I'm in the middle of saving you people a
great deal of money -- the least you
could do is have the decency to pay me!
BEAT.
PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
So what do we do?
GREGOR
What I do is none of your concern.
What
you should do is wait for my next phone
call.
I'm going to find a place where I
can tilt the field in my favor.
When I'm
ready, I'll call you and tell you what I
want you to do.
The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut
off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -
CUT TO:
Larry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
bag on the floor.
Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet
propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.
Suddenly -
Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in
the room.
He looks around - No Sam.
Vincent gets up, takes
out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.
He moves down a
long hall and - No Sam.
Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into -
THE BATHROOM: pitch black.
He moves in, swipes the string of
the overhead light and - nothing.
Nobody's here.
The only
place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.
He
opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -
This is a small building.
There is no other apartment on
the floor.
At the far end of the landing, there is a small
ladder which leads up to -
THE ROOF.
And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
in a light wind.
LARRY
(continuing)
That I could be dead and I'd drive better
than you.
Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in
the passenger seat, watching her every move.
DEIRDRE
(very curt)
Oh shut up...
IN THE BACK SEAT -
Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.
Vincent is tracing
Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
it traces a line up the highway.
VINCENT
He's going north.
(circles something on map)
That's Aix en Provence, where he used the
phone.
Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
map.
Destination: Paris.
SAM
(making up his mind)
He's going back.
VINCENT
Not necessarily.
He could go off road at
any number of places.
He might not even
be in the country anymore.
SAM
It's Paris.
The route's too indirect for
anything else.
A guy like Gregor, he
doesn't waste time on this road unless he
has to be on it in the first place.
Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by
now.
He's going to Paris.
(beat)
Now I just hope we can find him before he
gets there.
DEIRDRE
If somebody else doesn't find him first.
Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
causes him to swear under his breath in French.
It's -
The Gunmen walking down the street.
VINCENT
I know those men.
Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the
gunmen.
None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,
but we do.
The Gunmen are heading straight for -
Vincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels.
Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren.
Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face.
It's Edvard.
EDVARD
Where do I know you from?
VINCENT
Vienna.
EDVARD
Of course...I remember.
I quite liked
you, I'm sorry to have to do this.
Edvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when -
SAM (O.S.)
Hey...
Edvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.
Even as he
squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he
does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot
awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the
room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but
not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's
too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
that kills Edvard.
A PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into -
where Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide
with fright.
Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre
turns to face Seamus Reilly.
DEIRDRE
When we're done with this, I want to do
for that one myself.
SEAMUS
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
DEIRDRE
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus
Reilly?
SEAMUS
It means I was worried that all the time
you spent away from the fold might have
affected you.
You've been living the
life of the hired gun -- the well paid
hired gun, I might note.
There's no
glory to it, but there are those that
like it.
DEIRDRE
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too
attached to this charade I've been
playing, is that it?
SEAMUS
It's been known to happen.
DEIRDRE
Not to me, you know that.
SEAMUS
(goading her)
I thought I did.
Seamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
to his head.
DEIRDRE
I guess you don't know me, then, if you
think I won't kill you for an insult like
that!
Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at
him until he starts to laugh.
SEAMUS
Just testing, lass.
Forgive me, but I
had to do it.
Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun.
DEIRDRE
Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when
we get home, I don't play "the girl"
again.
Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
clear and we -
CUT TO:
SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth.
Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and
needles.
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the
kitchen table.
Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,
who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.
Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's
going on.
Sam, with his medical training, is treating
himself.
VINCENT
(to Sam)
It's right there, beneath the surface.
I
can just make it out.
Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus
on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
next procedure.
JEAN-PIERRE
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
SAM
(sharply)
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the
mind I can control.
(quick beat)
Alright, let's do it.
During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where
he's watching.
SAM
Douse the wound with alcohol.
Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
central nervous system.
SAM
(to Jean-Pierre)
Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
the blood as you can, keep it clean so I
can see.
Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that
keeps filling the wound.
Throughout the procedure Jean-
Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he
squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.
SAM
(to Vincent)
Take the clamp...
Vincent picks up the clamp.
SAM
Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.
Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.
It takes perhaps
fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
for Sam.
He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the
smallest of grunts.
But he doesn't move.
Finally Vincent is
done.
VINCENT
Alright, it's done.
SAM
You see the bullet?
VINCENT
Clearly.
SAM
Good.
Now take the forceps, and
remember, Vincent, what we're doing here
is routine.
I've done stuff like this at
least twenty times in the field.
There
are no vital organs where you're working,
no major muscles or arteries -- you can't
kill me.
Just make sure you've got the
bullet before you try to pull it out.
Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.
This takes
probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the
clamp was attached.
Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the
smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.
Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a
single tug, Vincent extracts it.
VINCENT
(holding the bullet aloft)
A souvenir...
He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN
SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the
kitchen counter.
We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet
rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.
Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.
Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,
and he drags deeply on it.
SAM
(to Vincent)
You think you can stitch me up on you
own?
JEAN-PIERRE
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
SAM
Then if you don't mind...
(he hands the cigarette back to
Vincent)
I'm gonna pass out.
And that's exactly what he does.
A TIME CUT TO:
Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs.
An open bottle
of wine sits between them, a FIRE burns in the fireplace, and
they smoke in a contented silence for a moment.
When they
speak, it is in FRENCH, with ENGLISH SUBTITLES.
JEAN-PIERRE
He's tough, your American friend.
VINCENT
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
JEAN-PIERRE
And you respect him.
VINCENT
Of course.
Don't you?
JEAN-PIERRE
I've never seen a man who could have
taken what he just went through.
(beat)
He's a cop?
VINCENT
(beat, trying to find a way to
say it)
Not exactly.
JEAN-PIERRE
Not exactly?
But close enough, eh?
(beat)
So he saved your life, then?
VINCENT
How did you know?
JEAN-PIERRE
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in
his head a long time ago.
Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
before we -
DISSOLVE TO:
Sam is awake.
Pale from the loss of blood, he moves softly
around the kitchen, searching professionally for something,
giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
so intent on what he's doing and then he finds it - THE
COFFEE.
TEN MINUTES LATER -
A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk.
THUNK!
The door slams shut.
Gregor and Seamus are in the
back seat.
Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
handcuffs on Gregor.
Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.
DEIRDRE
Where's the case?
GREGOR
(nervous)
There's a problem...
SEAMUS
(jumping all over him)
Problem my ass!
I think you're lying to
me, and if you are you're a dead man!
DEIRDRE
Would somebody tell me what fucking well
happened in there?
SEAMUS
(disgusted)
Nothing.
GREGOR
(eager to explain)
The package didn't come.
I'm sure it
will tomorrow.
Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it.
He grabs Gregor and slams
a gun against his head.
SEAMUS
(he's almost foaming at the
mouth)
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for
a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains
all over this car.
GREGOR
(beyond desperate)
I swear, it has to come here!
It has
to...
BEAT.
For one tension-filled moment, we think Seamus is
going to splash Gregor's brains all over the place.
But then
he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on
the face.
SEAMUS
Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make
sure you're on the level.
Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper.
SEAMUS
And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
that says they got a late afternoon
delivery.
Why don't we come back later
today and do this all over again, huh?
Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
sadistic.
Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -
CUT TO:
TONY SIMON, an expatriate black American, runs this place and
lives above it.
His shelves are lined with action films made
in the Far East.
Tony knows everything there is to know
about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
about what's going on in the Parisian Underworld.
he's a
professional information broker.
Right now he's talking to a
CUSTOMER in perfect French, with English Subtitles.
TONY
Hey, man, they're both great movies.
One
is more of a character study, the other
is more of a straight action thing, but
they're great movies, and he's an amazing
fucking filmmaker.
Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.
TONY
Excuse me...
Vincent and Sam have entered the store.
Sam's ability to be
back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the
film.
what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
will.
Now - Tony moves to join them, and the conversation
immediately turns to English.
TONY
(to Vincent)
My man, how you doing?
VINCENT
I'm alright.
And you?
TONY
Doing well.
(with a look at Sam)
This is?
VINCENT
A friend.
I was telling him about how
you always have the latest tapes.
TONY
Why don't we step into my office...
Tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the COUNTER.
Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.
TONY
So what can I do for you?
Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking.
The
place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
talking to.
The Customer is still considering the two films
Tony was showing him.
VINCENT
I was wondering if you had any movies
that were particularly new.
TONY
Matter of face there's this flick I've
been hearing about.
I haven't seen it,
but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
SAM
What's the story?
TONY
It's an international thing.
Several
different peoples involved, criminals
from all over the world, experts brought
together to do a job.
But maybe the most
interesting thing about it is that
preeminent in the plot we find the
Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.
An unlikely group of partners.
VINCENT
Do you have the tape?
TONY
I might know where you could get a copy.
The Customer approaches the counter.
He has both tapes with
him.
TONY
(to Vincent and Sam)
Let me do some business with my boy here,
and I'll meet you across the street in
five.
I gotta make homes here feel like
he's getting a good deal while I give him
the pleasure of overpaying me for a
couple of second generation pirates.
A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end.
We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the
falafel.
He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
Sam.
TONY
(his mouth full)
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of
talk.
I wasn't so sure what to make of
it at first, cause, like I said, the
Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
mix.
VINCENT
You said you might know where we can get
a copy of this tape?
TONY
All depends on whether you want the
Russian or the Gaelic language version.
SAM
(instantly)
Gaelic.
TONY
You sure?
SAM
I'm sure.
VINCENT
(to Tony)
Can you get it?
TONY
The Russian would be easier.
SAM
Why's that?
TONY
Cause the Russian production company
would be easier to find.
SAM
It's the Irish tape we want.
TONY
(with a sigh)
Gonna be tough.
Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.
TONY
Last I heard there was a film rep for the
Irish players staying at this address,
name of Seamus Reilly.
SAM
(repeating it, he knows this
name)
Seamus Reilly.
VINCENT
(to Sam)
You know him?
SAM
I know of him.
TONY
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish
Auteur -- a real firebrand.
Thinks his
more moderate filmmaking brethren have
turned to making movies for peace-loving
pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
VINCENT
I get the picture.
Sam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand
on top of it.
VINCENT
Tony and I have to talk some business,
first.
TONY
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to
moan about the price, we settle somewhere
in the middle.
VINCENT
It's a matter of respect.
(to Sam)
Why don't you wait outside, this won't
take long.
Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards
the exit.
Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent
are now discussing the price of the information.
They are
both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying
themselves immensely.
Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
the wheel.
Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper.
SAM
The Irish representative?
VINCENT
Yes.
Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper.
SAM
What's this?
VINCENT
The address of the Russian production
company.
Just in case we need to find
them.
SAM
Thorough man.
Vincent starts the car and we -
CUT TO:
A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address: 35 de
Glacon.
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -
Sam, holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
complex.
SAM
You sure your friend got the right place?
VINCENT
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
BEAT.
Vincent wants to know something important.
VINCENT
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
SAM
Do what?
VINCENT
Continue when it would be so much easier
to give it up.
SAM
It's my job.
VINCENT
Then quit.
(beat)
You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
SAM
Sure I do.
You heard him, you heard the
guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard
said.
VINCENT
It's a cover, then.
A cover within a
cover, a feint within a feint.
(quick beat)
You work for the CIA, it's the only
possible answer.
LONG BEAT.
Sam considers what to say, and then decides he
owes Vincent the truth.
SAM
I'm a field agent -- last of an already
extinct breed.
I do dark ops.
VINCENT
Dark ops?
SAM
Dark operations.
Wet work.
Kidnaping.
Assassination.
VINCENT
Very ugly.
SAM
It is at that.
VINCENT
Not very zen of you, huh?
Not so much
the modern Samurai after all.
SAM
I never made that claim.
VINCENT
I know.
Jean-Pierre did.
SAM
You were behind the door?
VINCENT
I was waiting to see what would happen.
I didn't want to kill him if I didn't
have to.
SAM
You would have done that?
VINCENT
I would have tried not to.
But yes, if
it would have kept him from shooting you,
I would have.
SAM
(almost to himself)
How could you have done that?
VINCENT
Because I owe you.
(he sees something)
Look at that...
THEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
apartment building.
SAM (O.S.)
(quietly exultant)
All things come to those who wait.
Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.
VINCENT (O.S.)
(really surprised by this)
He's not dead.
BACK ON Sam and Vincent.
SAM
(figuring it out)
They don't have the package.
VINCENT
You think?
SAM
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
If they had the package, they'd have
killed him.
Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
out.
VINCENT & SAM
(simultaneously)
They're going to get it.
CUT TO:
A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the
counter.
It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in
BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System.
Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in
face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket
which lets us know where his gun is.
Now - The two men start
to move towards the exit as we -
CUT TO:
During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
the streets they travel through.
Now - The Black Compact Car
flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
get a clear shot at the other Car.
INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
What the fuck happened?
SAM
I don't know...
VINCENT
You don't know?
Bullshit, you had her,
there was no way out.
IN THE COMPACT CAR -
Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
freaking out.
SEAMUS
What in bloody hell is going on?
DEIRDRE
They're part of the team.
One of them's
the guy I told you about.
SEAMUS
From Interpol?
DEIRDRE
That's him.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
Why didn't you kill her?
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
Why didn't you kill him?
OUT IN THE STREET -
The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
(figuring it out)
You slept with her!
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
How is it these fellahs managed to get
the drop on us?
DEIRDRE
I told you: they're good...
OUT IN THE STREET -
THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
UP TO REVEAL:
THE PERIFERIQUE -
The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
city of Paris.
Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
which lead to no less than four different sections of the
Periferique.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
(slamming the dashboard in
disgust)
You slept with her!
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
(lecturing Deridre)
You should have kill him when you had
the chance.
But no...
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
You put everything on the line because
you...
IN THE COMPACT
SEAMUS
(as if finishing Vincent's
sentence)
You slept with the fucker!!
ON THE PERIFERIQUE -
THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
roadways.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Fuck...
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
Left left left!!!
Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.
At the last
second he takes the left turn as we go back to -
IN THE COMPACT CAR -
Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
Gregor.
Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
the other.
SEAMUS
(waving the package)
This better be the real thing or you're a
dead man!
GREGOR
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
SEAMUS
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
ZING-SHATTER!
A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
of his window, firing away.
Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.
SEAMUS
Lose them!
DEIRDRE
You lose them!
Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
both speeding towards another junction, where several other
roadways of the Periferique run together.
Now we see that -
Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.
SEAMUS
To the right!!!
Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
on an -
EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.
Now -
Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
and now -
One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
by their seatbelts.
The car has stalled, and Sam has to
start her up again and slam it into gear before following
after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.
SAM
Give me a cigarette.
VINCENT
Right now?
SAM
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
VINCENT
(fumbling with a cigarette)
Why are you driving?
(rapid fire)
You're not French, you don't live here,
you don't know these roads.
Why are you
driving?
He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!
About fifteen cars
pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
breathes a hugh sigh of relief.
SEAMUS
About time!
DEIRDRE
(glancing in her mirror)
Not yet...
The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
back on their tail.
SEAMUS
(practically tearing his hair)
Good Christ!
Can't you lose these
jokers?
DEIRDRE
(through clenched teeth)
They're good!
And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -
A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -
Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
slams on the brakes as -
Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
we're in SLOW MOTION as -
Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
her, even as -
Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
windshield and flying through the air as -
The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -
Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
the crash, and now -
Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
as -
Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
exit ramp as -
Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
carrying the Briefcase with him, as -
Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
now - On fire, and now -
Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
back, because -
A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
and it's too late to turn around, and even as -
Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.
Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -
Sam catches a quick glimpse of -
Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
because the Cops have reached -
The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
Cops look into the debris they see that -
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.
Everybody's gone.
FADE OUT.
VINCENT (V.O.)
We don't have much time.
FADE IN ON:
A FRONT DOOR, guarded by about five heavy locks, opens and
Vincent and Sam enter.
Sam looks around and surveys the
apartment.
SAM
Nice place.
ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment: there's
practically nothing here.
A table with a couple of chairs, a
fridge.
An open door leads to a bedroom with a small, spare
bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp.
VINCENT
(by way of explaining)
I'm not here very much.
SAM
Business keeps you on the road?
VINCENT
Something like that.
The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENT'S HAND turns a heavy-
duty COMBINATION LOCK and then: Click, the cabinet opens and
we see -- WEAPONS.
An endless cache of guns, knives,
explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it,
it's here.
Now Vincent's Hands reach into the cabinet and
start taking out weapons.
We PULL BACK ON -
Vincent, who gives the weapons to Sam.
Sam checks to make
sure the weapons are loaded and/or ready for use, and then
piles them, one on top of the other.
SAM
I know I don't need to say this to you,
but I need to say it to you.
(beat)
This is my job, I have to do it.
VINCENT
So I do it.
SAM
No you don't, and you know it.
VINCENT
If our positions were reversed, would you
leave me?
SAM
(he says this too quickly)
In a minute.
VINCENT
I think not.
BEAT.
Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what
Vincent is saying is true.
VINCENT
(considering the weapons)
Do we need anything else?
SAM
Yeah.
We need out fucking heads examined.
Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
laughing as we -
CUT TO:
Deirdre once behind the wheel.
The passenger seat next to
her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror,
which reveals -
A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.
Crashing
through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing
wounds and burn tissue.
In his eyes we see the light of a
sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.
DEIRDRE
You better be careful, Seamus, before
something happens a plastic surgeon can't
fix.
SEAMUS
(a hideous laugh)
Plastic fucking surgeon?
(indicates his face)
You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre
lass?
It's the mark of the patriot, and
I'll wear it like a badge.
As for those
who done it to me, I'll take my pound of
flesh before this is all over.
DEIRDRE
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,
and not your head...
SEAMUS
(losing it)
Shut up!!!
(he puts a gun to her head)
Shut up and drive!
I'm your superior
officer and you will do as I goddamn well
say, is that understood?!?
BEAT.
Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing.
SEAMUS
Do I need to repeat myself?
DEIRDRE
No, Seamus.
I heard you the first time.
ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
squad.
MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see
the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture.
Each room could be a museum, as we move through -
A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -
A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which
is two hundred years old -
A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light
of an exquisite chandelier -
A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
you've ever seen.
Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
it out to -
A DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for
twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and
yet the table is occupied by only one man -
MIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.
Now -
The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this
chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.
Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
into the room.
THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching
to see what Mikhi wants.
Now -
Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone
with the gangster.
Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
he motions for Gregor to sit.
MIKHI
(in Russian, English subtitles)
Sit, sit...
(offering a cigarette)
Would you like one?
GREGOR
(in English)
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.
(letting that sink in for a
minute)
Since I won't speak your language, and
you can't speak mine, English will do
nicely.
MIKHI
(makes no never mind to him)
Whatever you wish...
(lights his own cigarette)
This has all been a terrible mistake,
Gregor.
I wanted to play straight with
you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill
you.
GREGOR
Edvard said the same thing about you
before he died.
MIKHI
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd
believe him.
GREGOR
(suddenly sharp)
Enough!
Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
wrist via the handcuff.
Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
table.
MIKHI
Ahh...
The moment of truth.
Before this scene can develop any
further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice
speaks, Gregor blanches.
SEAMUS (O.S.)
The moment of truth, is it?
ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room.
And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except
for Gregor, that is).
It's as if they were expected.
GREGOR
What is he doing here?
As Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the
valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably
closer to Gregor.
His face is, if anything, even more
horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh
wounds have started to scab over.
SEAMUS
What am I doing here?
Why, I'm here to
see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the
Russian Mafia.
See, your bosses had
hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
your thieving double cross.
But they
only just found out that what's in the
briefcase is completely useless without
me.
I can't fight them, and they can't
kill me -- that means we're gonna have to
do business together.
GREGOR
But you hate each other!
SEAMUS
What's a little hate between business
partners?
Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a
glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
sedated Vincent.
As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a
PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.
The Detective looks at Sam
for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.
Sam blocks his
way.
DETECTIVE
I need to speak with that man.
SAM
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.
Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks
he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A
PIECE OF PAPER.
He hands it to the Detective.
SAM
Call that number and ask them what you
should do.
The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.
FIVE MINUTES LATER -
The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
over at Sam in disgust.
Without another word, the Detective
signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.
Now -
The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to
him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
back.
Everything in SUBTITLED.
DOCTOR
You can see your friend, now.
SAM
Thank you very much.
DOCTOR
The field dressing you put on saved his
life.
(giving him a look)
Where di you learn to do that?
SAM
Here and there, I guess.
The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but
it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past
into -
He's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.
And he's heard
Sam speak in French to the Doctor.
VINCENT
You son-of-a-bitch...
SAM
What?
VINCENT
You speak French.
SAM
What of it?
VINCENT
(in mock exasperation)
Nothing...
He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.
VINCENT
(repeating the Doctor's words
in English)
"Your field dressing saved his life."
That's three I owe you.
SAM
You don't owe me a goddamned thing,
Vincent, and you know it.
You stepped in
front of a bullet for me.
(very seriously, he now
believes this)
I owe you a heavy debt.
VINCENT
(relishing this)
I know.
SAM
(rising to leave)
You better get some sleep, alright?
VINCENT
Tell me something first.
(a quick beat)
The package: what was it?
SAM
I don't know.
Nobody knows, except a
bunch of people who are too dead to tell
us.
There's probably a couple of guys
back at the Company who know, but I don't
think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
VINCENT
What happened to it?
SAM
Gone.
Destroyed.
VINCENT
(sighs, then a beat)
I guess that's for the best.
Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say.
VINCENT
Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
you could have killed the two of them
with one shot.
You could have had the
package, finished the job.
But you
didn't, you sacrificed the job to save
her life.
Why?
Same has to think about this for a second, and his answer
reveals just how full circle he's come.
SAM
It's what you would have done.
And on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused
Vincent behind.
