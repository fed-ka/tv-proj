    A YOUNG COUPLE sits in the front seat.  DARREN, 24, has that 
          cute-I m-probably-gonna-die-soon look.  Beside him is BROOKE, 
  24, pretty, smart-faced.  Has that I ll-probably-live-longer-
      than-my-boyfriend look.   MUSIC PLAYS.

    THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD - Headlights pierce darkness. 

                                DARREN
                  An hour drive to hear that crap,  
                  wasn t even a band; guy with 
                  guitar.  An hour -- each way.

                                BROOKE
                  He wasn t that bad.

                                DARREN
                  He sounded like James Blunt.

                                BROOKE
                  What s wrong with that?

                                DARREN
                  We already have a James Blunt.  
                  One s all we need.  

    THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD  -- A misty fog starts rolling by. 

                                DARREN (CONT D)
                  You owe me so much sex for this 
                  night.

  The fog grows thicker and thicker.  It becomes difficult to 
  see the road in front of them.

                                BROOKE
                  What s with the fog?

                                DARREN
                  It ll clear...give it a sec.

                                BROOKE
                  You could slow down.

    There s nothing but white all around them.  The road s almost 
    completely gone from view.  Then, all of a sudden...                                                                                  2.



  THE FOG LIFTS.  They can see again.  

                                DARREN
                  Told ya.

    Brooke SCREAMS.

                                BROOKE
                  Watch out!!!!

    WINDSHIELD - POV - A MAN STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  

    Darren HITS the brakes.  Not fast enough -- THEY CRASH INTO 
  THE MAN.  

  His body goes up and over the JEEP, rolling off the top, 
    hitting the ground behind them.

    Darren YANKS THE WHEEL, sending the Jeep into a tailspin 
    across the road.  It comes to a SCREECHING HALT.

    Everything goes silent.  Darren turns to Brooke.

                                DARREN
                  Are you okay?

                                BROOKE
                  We hit someone, oh god...

    She s in full panic.  Starts CRYING.  Darren reaches for his 
    cell phone.  Starts dialing.  Opens the door.

                                DARREN
                  Jesus.  Shit.  Stay here, okay?  

                                BROOKE
                  Please, let him be all right.

    Darren hops out of the car.   Leaving Brooke shaking.  She 
    peers out the window, but she can t see anything.  The 
    HEADLIGHTS are pointed to the woods.

                                BROOKE (CONT D)
                  Please, please, please...

  She turns to look out her side window when...

    A FACE APPEARS IN THE WINDOW.  Brooke LEAPS OUT OF HER SKIN.

    It s Darren.                                                                                  3.



                                DARREN
                  I can t get reception.  Try your 
                  phone.

  And he s gone.  


    ELENA GILBERT, 17, faces herself in the mirror.  A silent 
    assessment.  Fresh-faced, perfect features. 

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  But, I m ready.  I can deal.  I 
                  have a plan.  I will smile.   It 
                  will be believable.  Genuine.  My 
                  smile will say,  I m fine, thank 
                  you.   Yes, much better.    Time 
                  heals everything.   

    Elena is now at her desk writing in her journal.

                                ELENA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  They will see that Elena is alive 
                  and well. 

  As she writes, the CAMERA moves around her room.  Taking 
    inventory of her life.  Items of an over-achiever; awards, 
    certificates, ribbons, etc.

                                ELENA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  And if I can convince them, then 
                  maybe, just maybe, I can believe it 
                  myself.  

    Snapshots and framed photos.  Friends in funny, happy poses, 
    reflecting the life of a popular and well-adjusted girl.  
    These are personal photos -- they mean something.  

  Her parents, brother -- obligatory family photo.   Linger on 
  it for a beat.  There s a story there. 


  The morning news is muted on a small TV in the background.  
    Photos of Darren and Brooke flash ON SCREEN.  MISSING COUPLE.

    JENNA MOYER (29) stands at the fridge.  Grad school smart.  A 
    little scattered in a brainy way.  A thinker in sweats.  
    Which works for her.  It s sexy.

  She opens the fridge door.  Studies its contents.  Jenna is 
  not domestic.  She never will be.  

                                JENNA
                  Toast.  I can make toast. 

    She s talking to Elena who just walked in.  Goes straight for 
  the coffee pot.  Pours a cup.  Elena drinks it black.                                                                                  6.



                                ELENA
                  It s all about the coffee, Aunt 
                  Jenna.

    Jenna nods, of course.  

                                JEREMY
                  Is there coffee?

    JEREMY (15) enters the kitchen.  Cool look; has an original 
    take on grunge punk, nothing extreme.  Tinkers with the nail 
    polish and eye-liner, but won t commit.  A bit of a mess.  
    Outcast cute.

                                JENNA
                  Your first day of school and I m 
                  totally unprepared.

  She grabs TWO POWER BARS.  Hands  em out.  Reaches for her 
    purse, finds some cash.  Elena declines.  Jeremy takes it.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Lunch money.  Anything else?  A No. 
                  2 pencil?  What am I missing?

    She s trying to get it right.

                                ELENA
                  Don t you have a big presentation 
                  today?

                                JENNA
                  I m meeting with my thesis advisor 
                  at --
                        (checks her watch, 
                          realizing)
                  Now.  Crap.

                                ELENA
                  Go.

    Jenna disappears in a flash.   Elena turns to Jeremy.  

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  You good?

                                JEREMY
                  Don t start.

    Jeremy exits the back door.  Uninterested and annoyed.  Left 
    alone in the kitchen, Elena SIGHS.  Steeling herself for the 
    day.                                                                                  7.




    A small Virginia town.  Quaint, picturesque.  A place you d 
    like to raise a family. Southern in its hospitality, northern 
  in its attitude.

    A Prius makes its way past Main Street.  Mom and Pop.  A 
    couple restaurants.  A hardware store.  A church.

    Elena rides beside BONNIE (17). Light, bubbly, and adorable.  
    A loyal friend with a big heart.  She s in chatty Cathy mode.

                                BONNIE
                  So Grams tells me how I m psychic 
                  because we re descendants of the 
                  Celtic Druids; I know, right?  I 
                  wasn t buying it either until I 
                  remembered my uncanny accuracy.  I 
                  predicted Obama, I predicted David 
                  Cook, Heath Ledger, Britney s 
                  comeback and I still think Florida 
                  will break off and become little 
                  resort islands.  I think there s 
                  something to it.

  She glances over at Elena who is staring out the window, not 
    listening.  She s in another world.  

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  Did I tell you about the orgy?  I 
                  had the football team over.  Threw 
                  a blindfold on.  I still don t know 
                  who took my virginity -- ELENA!  
                  BACK IN THE CAR!!!

    Elena JUMPS when she hears Bonnie YELL her name.  She quickly 
    snaps out of her daze. 

                                ELENA
                  I did it again, didn t I?  I m 
                  sorry, Bonnie.  You were saying... 

                                BONNIE
                  What?  C mon, you can do it...

                                ELENA
                        (thinking hard)
                  Something about being psychic.  

    Bonnie TOOTS the horn.  They both LAUGH.                                                                                    8.



                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  Okay, then, predict, what s in 
                  store for me?  Give it up.

    Bonnie is turning a corner.  She holds one hand out, waving 
  it like a magic wand.  In complete goof mode.

                                BONNIE
                  I see puppies and daffodils and a 
                  naked Ryan Gosling...

    SUDDENLY, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE WINDSHIELD.  Bonnie JERKS 
  the steering wheel.  The car goes SKIDDING.  

  She SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  What was that?  Oh god...

    Bonnie turns to Elena.  

                                BONNIE (CONT D)
                  Elena?  Are you okay?  I m so 
                  sorry. 

    Elena sits frozen in the front seat. 

                                ELENA
                  I m okay.  It happens.  

                                BONNIE
                  No, I m so sorry, it was like a 
                  bird or something.  It came out of 
                  nowhere.

                                ELENA
                  It s okay.  I can t let cars freak 
                  me out for the rest of my life.  

  She shakes it off.  Determined not to let it cloud her day.  
    Bonnie gets it.  Appreciates it.

                                BONNIE
                  I predict this year is gonna be 
                  kick ass.  And I predict all the 
                  sad and dark times are over.  And 
                  you re going to be happier than 
                  happy.  With some hot sex too.

    Elena smiles.  Touched by all Bonnie says.                                                                                    9.



                                ELENA
                  That s all good.  Just one thing. 
                  If you re psychic, how come you 
                  didn t predict the bird?

    Bonnie grins.  HITS the gas and they re off.


  The mysterious new guy walks down the hall, turning into the 
    ADMINISTRATION OFFICE.  We catch a half-glimpse.  Chiseled 
    profile.  Sunglasses.  


  The back of the new guy as he interacts with the secretary.

    SCENE INTERCUTS:


    Caroline passes by, then stops.

                                CAROLINE
                  Who s this?

  She and Bonnie peer through the window.

                                BONNIE
                  I can only see his back.

                                CAROLINE
                  It s a hot back.  

  The secretary looks up at Stefan.  

                                SECRETARY
                  Your records are incomplete.

                                STEFAN
                  Are they?                                                                                  13.



                                SECRETARY
                  You re missing immunization 
                  records, transcripts, parental 
                  contact information...

    THROUGH THE WINDOW -- THE GIRLS CONTINUE TO WATCH.

                                CAROLINE
                  There s style there.  Check out his 
                  boots.  California?  New York?

    Bonnie closes her eyes -- calling on her psychic abilities.

                                BONNIE
                  I m sensing Seattle.  And he plays 
                  a guitar.

                                CAROLINE
                  Turn around, turn, turn...

    INSIDE THE OFFICE

  The secretary is shaking her head.

                                SECRETARY
                  We really prefer a parent to come 
                  in and meet with us in person.  And 
                  we insist on transcripts.

    Stefan slowly lowers his sunglasses.  We still don t see his 
    face, but the secretary looks up at him, suddenly transfixed.  
  He speaks in a low, soft tone.  

                                STEFAN
                  Please look again.  I m sure 
                  everything you need is there.

  The secretary looks back down, scattered.  Slightly frazzled.

                                SECRETARY
                  Well, you re right.  So it is.

                                BONNIE
                  No fugly, no fugly...

    Slowly, he turns.  On Bonnie and Caroline s reactions.  We 
    still don t see his face.  But, it s definitely thumbs up.

    DOWN THE HALL

    ELENA is at her locker.  She sees Jeremy walk by with his 
    STONER FRIENDS.  He s shuffling his feet, swaying some, 
    definitely stoned.  He disappears into the Men s Room.                                                                                    14.


    A flash of anger from Elena.  She SLAMS her locker shut and 
    charges off.  


    Jeremy is at the sink, putting drops of Visine in his eyes 
    when Elena storms into the bathroom.  

  TWO GUYS at the urinals complain.

                                PEEING GUY
                  Whoa, pants down, chick.

    Elena ignores them.  She storms up to Jeremy and spins him 
    around, pushing him against the sink.  She grabs his hands 
  and SNIFFS them.  She SNIFFS his face.  Yes, he reeks of pot.

    A look into his eyes reveal they re bloodshot.  Reefer red.  
    Jeremy jerks away.  Embarrassed in front of the OTHER GUYS.

                                ELENA
                  Great.  First day of school.  And 
                  you re stoned.

                                JEREMY
                  No, I m not.

    Elena starts digging through his coat pockets, trying to find 
  his stash.  He jerks away, but she s fast and tough.  She has 
  her hands inside his coat jacket, feeling his pockets.  

                                ELENA
                  Where is it?  Is it on you?

                                JEREMY
                  You need to chill yourself.

                                ELENA
                   Chill yourself.   Oooh.  Stoner 
                  talk.  Dude, you re so cool.  

    She s searching his back pants pockets now.   A COUPLA GUYS 
    continue to watch, LAUGHING.   Cavity search    I m next. 

                                JEREMY
                  There s none on me.  Stop it--

  He pushes her away.  But Elena doesn t back down.  She stands 
    there -- determined.                                                                                  15.



                                ELENA
                  No, I m gonna be all over your ass 
                  every single time, so before you 
                  take that next bong hit think to 
                  yourself, is it worth it?  Is it 
                  worth the hell hath no fury of my 
                  crazy sister?  Because I will be 
                  there to ruin your buzz every time.  
                  Got it?

    Pause.  Jeremy says nothing.  He s stoned.  Embarrassed.  

    Elena backs off a little.  Did she go too far?  Her anger 
    gives way to hurt.  She has nothing but love and concern for 
  her brother.   

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  I know who you are and it s not 
                  this person.  Don t be this person.

    Jeremy s eyes soften.  A brief flash of vulnerability.  That 
  of a frightened boy.  But it doesn t last.  He jerks away. 

                                JEREMY
                  I don t need this.

  He takes off, defiant, blasting out the door.  Elena watches 
  him go.  Her face pained.


    Stefan exits the office.  We still have yet to see his face.  
  We see his feet, shoulders, back of his head.

    Bonnie and Caroline follow him.  We notice OTHER STUDENTS 
    turn and glance at the NEW KID.  Reactions vary.  He moves to 
    a door.  Just as he approaches it, it opens, revealing...

    ELENA.  She stops in her tracks when she sees Stefan.  And, 
    finally, we see his face. 

    He s a gloriously, amazingly, epic-ly beautiful young man.  
    Elegant and ageless, in a hanging on the wall of the Louvre 
    kind of way.

  He bumps into her.  Steps back.  

                                STEFAN
                  Pardon me.

  He removes his sunglasses, revealing his gorgeous eyes.  
    Looks at the door.  Checking that it s the Men s Room.                                                                                    16.



    Elena is mesmerized in the moment by his presence.  He looks 
    back to her.  

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  Is this the Men s Room?

                                ELENA
                  Yes, I was...long story.  

    They both move at the same time, bumping again.  She goes the 
    other way, when he does too, they almost bump again.  He 
    stops and allows her to pass.  She smiles, embarrassed.

    Elena starts off, but she can t help but turn back.  The door 
    slowly closes.  But not before she locks eyes with him again.

  ON ELENA -- Who was that guy? 

                                                                        TIME CUT:


    Elena is in class.  The teacher, MR. TANNER, 40 s, drones on.  
    History -- Civil War.  Ugh.

                                MR. TANNER
                  Since our own home state of 
                  Virginia was a border state during 
                  the war, it played a significant 
                  role in the outcome...

    Elena steals a glance to her right.  Stefan is several desks 
    away.  He looks up, meeting her gaze.  She quickly averts her 
    eyes.  When she dares to look up a moment later, he s looking 
  at her again. Two desks back, Bonnie stealthily sends a text.

    Elena s purse vibrates.  She slides out her phone.  FROM 
    BONNIE: HAWT-E.  STARING @ U. 

  She looks back to Bonnie and they share a smile.  Then, she 
    glances right and sees Matt staring at her.  He looks away.  
  She looks at Bonnie -- who shrugs.


  He sits at an old desk, writing in a journal.

                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  In an instant.  My veins were on 
                  fire, I couldn t resist her.


    Stefan stands under the streaming jets of his shower.  

                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  I never should have tried to enter 
                  her life.  What would she do if she 
                  ever learned the truth?  About 
                  me...and why I m really here.


    Stefan, dry and shirtless, paces the room.  Restless. 

                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  I should stay away.  But I don t 
                  know if I can.

  He stops at his desk, picking up a book.  It s ELENA S 
    JOURNAL.  He stares at it for a beat.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Fully dressed, Stefan steps to the ledge of the enormous 
    window that lines the wall of his room and JUMPS...


    Elena puts a bandage on her cut leg.  Jenna stands in the 
    doorway chatting with her.

                                JENNA
                  Maybe blood makes him squeamish?

                                ELENA
                  This guy is not the squeamish type.  
                  This guy has DANGER tattooed 
                  somewhere on his body.

    Jenna eyes her watch.

                                JENNA
                  Aren t you meeting Bonnie?

                                ELENA
                  I m gonna stay in.  I ll call her.

                                JENNA
                  You should go.  Don t sit home.  
                  Keep it up.  You re doing good.

    Elena smiles.  Appreciates this.  She puts the bandage box 
    back in the medicine cabinet.  She stops, pulls out a 
    prescription bottle.  She shakes it, opens it.  Suspicious.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  What s the matter?

                                ELENA
                  Dr. Henderson prescribed these 
                  after the accident.
                        (off Jenna s nod)
                  I took two.

  She tilts the bottle so Jenna can see.  It s almost empty.

                                ELENA (CONT D)
                  I m gonna kill him.

                                JENNA
                  I got this one.  He ll be home 
                  soon.  Let me handle it.

    Jenna is resolute.                                                                                  24.




    A cozy neighborhood bar and grill.  JEREMY is at a video 
    game, playing and eating at the same time.  Vicki, in a 
    waitress apron, passes by.  She barely acknowledges him.

  AT A BACK BOOTH

    Vicki sets down a burger plate in front of Matt.  He s 
    sitting with Tyler.

  She gives Tyler a side-long glance before walking away.  
    Tyler subtly checks out her ass.  Matt busts him.

                                MATT
                  Please tell me you re not hooking 
                  up with my sister.

                                TYLER
                  I m not hooking up with your 
                  sister.

                                MATT
                        (knows he s full of shit)
                  You re not an asshole, either.


    Vicki fills a tray with supplies.  Jeremy enters the room.

                                VICKI
                  You can t be back here.

                                JEREMY
                  What s your deal?  This summer 
                  you re one way, school starts and 
                  you can t be bothered.

                                VICKI
                  I m ignoring you.

                                JEREMY
                          (challenging)
                  Ignoring implies caring enough to 
                  avoid.

                                VICKI
                  What implies total lack of 
                  interest?  Look, Jeremy, I 
                  appreciate all the attention and 
                  the pharmaceuticals, but you can t 
                  follow me around like a lost puppy.                                                                                  25.



                                JEREMY
                  When was the last time you had sex 
                  with a puppy?

    Vicki looks to the dining room to see if anyone s listening.

                                VICKI
                  Keep it down.

                                JEREMY
                  What does it matter who knows? 

                                VICKI
                  Because I m a senior and you re 
                  not.  I don t wanna tell the world 
                  I deflowered Elena s kid brother.

                                JEREMY
                  And deflowered and deflowered.

                                VICKI
                  We hooked up a few times in a drug- 
                  fueled haze.  Now, back off before 
                  you ruin things with me and Tyler.

                                JEREMY
                  The guy s a douche, he only wants 
                  you for your ass. 

                                VICKI
                  Yeah?  And what do you want me for?

  She blows by.  On Jeremy, pissed off and hurt.  He exits...


    ...makes a beeline for the door.  Vicki watches him go out of 
  the corner of her eye.  


    Elena grabs her purse and keys, heading out.  She opens the 
    front door to find...


    Bonnie slides into the booth with Matt.  Grabs a fry.

                                BONNIE
                  Five minute heads up.  I m meeting 
                  Elena.

                                MATT
                  How s she doing?  I can t get a 
                  read.

                                BONNIE
                  Her mom and dad died.  How do you 
                  think?  She s putting on a good 
                  face, but it s tough.  It s only 
                  been four months.  She needs time.  

                                MATT
                  I get it.  That s what I m gonna 
                  give her.

    Suddenly Bonnie s face shifts.  He turns to follow her gaze.

  AT THE FRONT DOOR                                                                                  28.



    Elena and Stefan enter together.  Matt s look hardens.  He 
    quickly turns back around.

  ON ELENA.  She saw Matt s reaction.  She hesitates at the 
    door for a second, uncertain.

  ON MATT AND BONNIE

  As Caroline appears at their booth.  She s staring at Stefan 
    with Elena.  She looks to Matt.

                                CAROLINE
                  Could you do something about your 
                  girlfriend?   I m getting really 
                  annoyed with her lack of respect. 

                                MATT
                  She s not my girlfriend.

    Matt gets up.  Just as Elena and Stefan arrive.

                                ELENA
                  Matt, have you met Stefan yet?  
                  He s new and I was telling him how 
                  this was the spot.

    Stefan holds out his hand.  Pause.  Matt shakes it.

                                MATT
                  It s the only spot.

                                STEFAN
                  Hey, how ya doin ?  

    Matt returns to Tyler.  Avoiding more awkwardness.


    Jeremy enters the kitchen from the back door.  Jenna finishes 
    setting the table.

                                JENNA
                  Great, you re just in time for 
                  dinner.

                                JEREMY
                  You actually cooked?

                                JENNA
                  All your favorites.

    Jeremy sits down.  He looks at his plate, startled.                                                                                  29.



                                JEREMY
                  What is this?

  The plate contains an assortment of pills, pot and various 
    accoutrements.  All laid out like separate courses.

                                JENNA
                  I found the main course in your 
                  sock drawer.  The sides, courtesy 
                  of your dress shoes.  Oldest trick 
                  in the book, by the way.

  She points at a small bong.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Under the mattress.

    Rolling papers.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  DVD cases.  We ll save the girl-on-
                  girl porn you hid in Iron Man for 
                  another conversation.

                                JEREMY
                  I can t believe you went through my 
                  room.

                                JENNA
                  Technically it s my room.  Your 
                  parents left it to me, along with 
                  the responsibility for you.

                                JEREMY
                  I guess that was their mistake, 
                  wasn t it?

    Jenna exhales.  Keeping her anger in check.

                                JENNA
                  Look.  Four months ago I didn t 
                  even know how to keep a plant 
                  alive.  So I m not pretending to be 
                  some expert on parenting.  Because, 
                  let s face it, I m better at being 
                  the cool aunt who looks the other 
                  way.  But the jig is up.  School s 
                  started and I know how it can go 
                  one way or the other for someone 
                  like you.  So we re gonna go 
                  textbook on this one.                                                                                  30.



                                JEREMY
                  Yeah, what s that?

                                JENNA
                  You re not leaving this house for 
                  two weeks. School, home, every day. 
                  And that s law.

    She s firm.  Intense.  On Jeremy, not happy with Jenna s new 
    disciplinarian persona.


    Caroline and Bonnie sit across from Stefan and Elena.

                                BONNIE
                  Why Mystic Falls?

                                STEFAN
                  I was born here.  I missed it.

                                CAROLINE
                  Parents? 

                                STEFAN
                  Both my parents are dead.

    Elena registers this.  So does everyone at the table, with 
  all eyes finding their way to Elena.

                                ELENA
                  That s terrible.  I m sorry.

                                STEFAN
                  Thank you.

    Something else that connects them.  Caroline doesn t like it.

                                CAROLINE
                  No siblings?

                                STEFAN
                  None that I talk to. I live with my 
                  great-uncle. 

    ANGLE ON TYLER AND MATT

    Playing pool.  Both of them very aware of Stefan s table.                                                                                  31.



                                TYLER
                  They re throwing looks.  She s into 
                  it.

                                MATT
                  Don t want to talk about it, Tyler.

                                TYLER
                  Just sayin , man.  Looks like she s 
                  coming out of her  I can t be with 
                  anyone  phase.  You might wanna try 
                  to get back in that before it s too 
                  late.

                                MATT
                  You might wanna shut your mouth.

  But Matt s troubled by it.  Tyler can tell.

                                TYLER
                  Watch this.

  He heads for the booth just as Vicki arrives with a tray full 
  of soda refills.  He gives her the slightest nudge.  

  Her tray spills all over Stefan. 

                                VICKI
                  Jesus, Tyler.

    Elena gets up, glaring at Tyler.  Bonnie and Vicki try to 
    wipe up the mess.

                                ELENA
                  What the hell was that?

                                TYLER
                        (smirking)
                  Sorry.

    Tyler stares at Stefan.  Wanting Stefan to instigate the 
    fight.  But Stefan won t take the bait.

                                STEFAN
                  It s fine.

                                TYLER
                  Are you sure?  Cuz I d understand 
                  it if you were mad.

    Stefan glares.  But he still won t take the bait.                                                                                  32.



                                BONNIE
                  Your shirt.

  She tries wiping it off.  But when she touches him, she 
    stops.  Her face clouds for a second.  She looks up at him, 
    slightly troubled.  No one else picks up on it.

                                STEFAN
                  It s only a shirt.  It s about time 
                  I get going anyway.

  He looks at everyone.  Poised.  Polite.

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  It was nice meeting you guys.

    Then to Elena.

                                STEFAN (CONT D)
                  Goodnight, Elena.

  She smiles goodnight.  Then, Stefan turns and exits.  It 
    takes a moment for Elena to shake it off.  But then she turns 
  to Tyler.  Disgusted.

                                ELENA
                  Really nice.

    Tyler ignores her, happy with himself.


    Stefan is writing in his journal again.  A KNOCK on his door 
    breaks his reverie.  An OLDER MAN, PETE (70 s) enters.  He 
    carries some papers.  

                                PETE
                  I filled  em all out.  If that 
                  school needs anything else, have 
                  them call me. 

                                STEFAN
                  Thanks, Pete.

    Pete sees Stefan s conflicted face. 

                                PETE
                  What s wrong with you?

                                STEFAN
                  I think I ve made a mistake 
                  exposing myself.                                                                                    33.



                                PETE
                  It was your choice.  You wanted to 
                  be near her.  To know her.  Either 
                  leave or make the most of it.

  He heads for the door.  Turns back.  Smiles.

                                PETE (CONT D)
                  It s just teen angst.  You d think 
                  after 200 years you d know that, 
                  Uncle Stefan.

    Pete exits.  Stefan s smile goes away.  He can t quite shake 
  his turmoil.  He goes to a big armoire.  Finds the key, 
    unlocks it.

    Inside are his private KEEPSAKES and stacks of OLD JOURNALS.  
    From the last two hundred years.  

  He pulls out one particular journal -- an older one.  

    Aged leather, thick paper, written in quill pen.  He flips to 
    a page.  It s a drawing of a girl.  She looks identical to 
    Elena.  How is that possible?

    Only a closer look reveals the inscription: Katherine, 1864. 


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                  34.


                                    ACT THREE


  Mr. Tanner is in the middle of a discussion.  He s a brittle, 
    ornery man who is determined to  teach you  at all costs.

                                MR. TANNER
                  The Battle of Willow Creek.  Took 
                  place right at the end of the War.  
                  In our very own Mystic Falls.
                  How many casualties resulted in 
                  this battle?  Miss Bennett?

                                BONNIE
                  Uh...a lot, I m not sure...but like 
                  a whole lot.  

                                MR. TANNER
                  Cute becomes dumb in an instant, 
                  Miss Bennett.

    Bonnie shrinks in her seat.  That wasn t nice.

                                MR. TANNER (CONT D)
                  Mr. Donovan? 

    Matt looks up.  Uh-oh.

                                MR. TANNER (CONT D)
                  Would you like to take this 
                  opportunity to overcome your  
                  embedded jock stereotype?

                                MATT
                  That s okay, Mr. Tanner, I m cool 
                  with it.

                                MR. TANNER
                  Elena.  Surely you can enlighten 
                  your friends about one of this 
                  town s most significant historical 
                  events.

                                ELENA
                  I m sorry.  I don t know.

                                MR. TANNER
                  I was willing to be lenient last 
                  year, for obvious reasons, Elena.  
                  But the personal excuses ended with 
                  summer break.                                                                                  35.



    Elena s eyes widen.  No one can quite believe Mr. Tanner went 
    there.  Suddenly, someone pipes up:

                                STEFAN
                  There were 346 casualties, unless 
                  you re counting the local 
                  civilians.

    Everyone looks at him with surprise.  How did he know that?

                                MR. TANNER
                  You re correct, Mr....

                                STEFAN
                  Whitmore.

                                MR. TANNER
                  Whitmore?  Any relation to the 
                  original Mystic Falls settlers?

                                STEFAN
                        (wry)
                  Distant.

                                MR. TANNER
                  Very good, sir, except there were 
                  no civilian casualties in that 
                  battle.

                                STEFAN
                  Actually, there were twenty-seven.  
                  Confederate soldiers fired on a 
                  church believing it to be housing 
                  weapons.  They were wrong.
                        (beat)
                  The Founders  archives are stored 
                  in Civil Hall, if you d like to 
                  brush up on your facts.   Mr. 
                  Tanner.

    Point, Stefan.  Elena stares ahead, trying to hide her smile.


    Jenna works on her laptop, papers spread out all around her.  
  She rubs her eyes, bleary.  Gets up. 


    Jenna knocks, then opens Jeremy s door.

                                JENNA
                  I m ordering pizza.  What...

  She realizes Jeremy s not there.  

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Unbelievable.


    Stefan races into the house.  Pete is surprised by the 
    ferocity of Stefan s entrance. 

                                PETE
                  What s going on?

                                STEFAN
                  You said it was quiet here.  That I 
                  was the only one.                                                                                  51.



                                PETE
                  Mystic Falls hasn t been active in 
                  years.  I m certain of it.

                                STEFAN
                  A girl was attacked tonight.

                                PETE
                  Do you think it was...?  

  But Stefan doesn t respond, he s already up the stairs.  Pete 
    watches.  Worried.


    Stefan enters his attic loft to find the huge bay window 
    open.  Curtains blowing.  He stops.  Senses something amiss.

  He walks slowly across the room towards the window when...

    A BLACK CROW COMES DARTING THROUGH.  Stefan ducks, as the 
    crow disappears into the rafters.  Crossing back and forth, 
  up and down.  Manic.

    Stefan watches it flutter about madly -- not seeing the 
    FIGURE THAT APPEARS IN THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM.  But, then 
    Stefan stops in his tracks.  Sensing it.  Slowly, he turns 
  and comes face to face with--

    A DARKLY HANDSOME MAN. (23)   

    Stefan s eyes burn with distaste.

                                STEFAN
                  Damon.

  The Man s piercing eyes glitter smugly.

                                DAMON
                  Hello, brother.


                                END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                  52.


                                    ACT FIVE


  The CROW SITS on the window sill watching...

    Stefan pace across his bedroom floor.  While Damon can be 
    seen through the bathroom door, washing up.

                                STEFAN
                  When did you get here?

    Stefan is very pointed and reserved around his brother.  
    While Damon is just the opposite.  Damon is deliberately 
    light.  Casual.  Endless charm.

                                DAMON
                  I couldn t miss your first day of 
                  school.  

                                STEFAN
                  How did you find me?

    Damon stops.  Looks at his brother.  Really?  Do I really 
    have to answer that?

                                DAMON
                  Your hair s different.  I like it.  

                                STEFAN
                  It s been 15 years, Damon.

                                DAMON
                  Time flies.  Thank god.  I couldn t 
                  take one more day of the 90 s.  
                  That horrible grunge look.  It 
                  didn t suit you.  It s important to 
                  stay away from the fads, Stefan.  
                  Always opt for timeless.

    Damon dries his hands.  Was that blood he was washing away?

                                STEFAN
                  Why are you here?  

                                DAMON
                  I missed my brother.

                                STEFAN
                  You hate small towns.  It s boring.  
                  There s nothing to do. 

                                DAMON
                  I ve managed to keep busy.                                                                                    53.



    Beat.  Damon smirks.

                                STEFAN
                  You almost killed that girl 
                  tonight.

                                DAMON
                  Ya know I like the pill-poppers.  
                  Nice buzz.  Don t worry, I made it 
                  look like an animal.  They ll blame 
                  a bear or mountain lion.  You re 
                  safe.

                                STEFAN
                  You didn t come all the way back to 
                  Mystic Falls just to play games.

                                DAMON
                  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I would ask you 
                  the same question, but I m fairly 
                  certain the answer is all summed up 
                  in one word:  Elena.

    Stefan s jaw clenches at the mention of her name.  Damon 
    grins.  He knows he s hit his target.


    Damon moves around the room, perusing Stefan s books and 
    pictures, etc. 

                                 DAMON
                  I suppose I should go down and say 
                  hi to Pete.  Are we calling him our 
                  great uncle?  So much clutter.  
                  Do you save everything?  

    Stefan is at his desk, closing his journal, putting it away.                                                                                  55.



                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  She took my breath away -- Elena.

    Stefan turns to his brother.  

                                DAMON (CONT'D)
                  She s a dead ringer for Katherine.  
                  Is it working, Stefan?  Being next 
                  to her?  Being part of her world?  
                  Does it make you feel  alive ? 

                                STEFAN
                  She s not Katherine.

                                DAMON
                  No?  Let s hope not.  We both know 
                  how that ended.

    Stefan s eyes narrow.  His anger flaring.  He reins it in.  
  But Damon sees it.  Smiles.  

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  Tell me something, brother.  When 
                  was the last time you indulged?

    Stefan says nothing. 

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  Really?  When was the last you had 
                  something stronger than a squirrel?

    Stefan is disgusted by his talk.  By his ribbing.

                                STEFAN
                  Stop it, Damon.  I know what you re 
                  doing and it s not going to work.  

                                DAMON
                  Yeah?  C mon, don t you crave a 
                  little?  Let s do it.  Together.  
                  You and me, I saw several little 
                  tarts tonight...

                                STEFAN
                  Stop.

    Damon WHACKS him on the head.  A playful but hard thunk.

                                DAMON
                  Whaddya say?  Let s cut to the 
                  chase and go straight for Elena.                                                                                  56.



    THUNK.  He pops him again.  Stefan tries to dodge him, but 
    Damon keeps coming at him.

                                STEFAN
                  Stop it.

                                DAMON
                  Make me.  You know you want to.

    Damon keeps taunting his brother, pushing him across the 
    room, knocking his head. 

                                DAMON (CONT D)
                  I bet you can barely resist her 
                  now.  Imagine what her blood would 
                  taste like.  I can. 

  He gives Stefan another tap, but he s gone too far.  Stefan 
    WHIRLS on him.  EYES rimmed with blood, VEINS protruding from 
    under his translucent skin.  Full of fury.

                                STEFAN
                  I said stop.

  He RUSHES Damon, literally leaving the ground.  They both go 
    CRASHING through the enormous window.


    Bonnie and Caroline nurse cups of coffee.  Caroline is still 
    visibly drunk.

                                BONNIE
                  Are you sober yet?

    Caroline pauses -- thinks about it.  Shakes her head.

                                CAROLINE
                  Nope.

                                BONNIE
                  Keep drinking.  I gotta get you 
                  home.  I gotta get me home.

    Caroline is lost in drunken thought.  Beat.

                                CAROLINE
                  Why didn t he go for me?  How come 
                  the guys I want never want me?

                                BONNIE
                  I refuse to answer that.  You may 
                  remember it.

                                CAROLINE
                        (answers herself)
                  I m inappropriate.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  59.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  I always say the wrong thing.  
                  Elena always says the right thing.  

    Caroline hiccups.

                                CAROLINE (CONT D)
                  She doesn t even try.  And he picks 
                  her.  She s always the one everyone 
                  picks.  And I work so hard and I m 
                  never the one...

  Her voice trails off.  As she sits there in her stupor.  Sad.  
    Vulnerable.  Bonnie doesn t know what to say. 


    Elena pulls the car into the drive.  She and Jeremy sit 
    there.  Neither in a hurry to get out of the car.  Then...

                                ELENA
                  People are gonna stop giving you 
                  breaks, Jer, because they don t 
                  care anymore.  They don t remember 
                  our parents our dead.  They re too 
                  busy living their lives.  The rest 
                  of the world has moved on.  You 
                  have to try too.

                                JEREMY
                  Like you?  I ve seen you at the 
                  cemetery.  Writing in your diary.  
                  Is that you moving on?

    Silence.  Elena shrugs.  She s at a loss.

                                ELENA
                  Mom and Dad wouldn t want this.

                                JEREMY
                  Then it s a good thing they re not 
                  here.  

  And with that Jeremy gets out of the car.  Still angry, still 
    restless.  Still on a dangerous path.  And from the look on 
    Elena s face, she knows it.


    Vicki lies in her hospital bed.  Spots of blood seep through 
  the bandages on her neck.  Matt sits by her side.  Worry 
    etched on his face.

    Vicki s eyes flutter open.  Matt leans in, relieved.                                                                                  60.



                                MATT
                  Vick.  It s okay.  You re okay.

  She looks at him.  Voice raspy.

                                VICKI
                  Matt...

                                MATT
                  What did this to you?

  Her hand finds his, gripping it tightly.  Eyes full of fear.  
  She struggles to speak -- her wounds excruciating.  In the 
    faintest whisper, she manages to speak one word...

                                VICKI
                  Vampire.


    Jenna is standing in the hallway when Jeremy exits the 
    bathroom.  She looks at him with disappointment.  But love, 
    too.  Lots of love.  

    Jeremy gives an apologetic shrug.  Then, disappears into his 
    bedroom.  It s enough for Jenna.  For now.

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  Dear Diary.  I couldn t have been 
                  more wrong.

    Jeremy falls back onto his bed.  Rolls over.  His eyes fall 
  on a picture of his parents.  A long look.


    Stefan returns to his room.  Takes stock of the mess of 
    broken glass.  

  His voice takes over from Elena s.                                                                                  61.



                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  It seemed like a good plan.  Let go 
                  of who I was.  Create a life as 
                  someone new.  Someone without the 
                  past.

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  Without the pain.

    Stefan and Elena s voices join.

                                  STEFAN/ELENA (V.O.)
                  Someone alive.


    Bonnie heads to the bathroom, leaving Caroline alone.  

                                ELENA (V.O.)
                  But it s not that easy.  The bad 
                  things stay with you.

                                STEFAN (V.O.)
                  They follow you.

    A MAN is sitting at a nearby table, his back to the camera.  
    When Bonnie crosses, he turns, eyeing Caroline.

    It s DAMON.  Caroline catches his stare.  The looks begin...

                                STEFAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  You can t escape them.  As much as 
                  you want to.
