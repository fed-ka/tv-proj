      SFX: an owl HOOTS.



      Laura and Sarah walk through the cemetary towards their 
      mother s grave. 

                                        LAURA
                      Cemetery lawns are always so pretty.  
                                (thinks)
                      I guess all the rotting flesh is good for 
                      the soil.      

                                        SARAH
                      Hey!

      Sarah points ahead of them, where Jay, PAUL and a few other 
      COPS are cordoning off a grave site with police tape.

                                        LAURA
                      Jay?

      Laura runs up to Jay, Sarah follows behind.

                                        LAURA (CONT D)
                      What s going on?  What happened?  This is 
                      my mother s grave.

                                        JAY
                      I know.
                                (hugging her tenderly)
                      I know.  And that will never change.  No 
                      matter what they do to it.

                                        LAURA
                      What??

      Jay and Paul lead Sarah away from the burial site.

                                        JAY
                                (takes a deep breath)
                      Okay.  This is not an easy one.  We re 
                      still piecing together what happened, but 
                      we know a few things.  Your mother s 
                      headstone has been stolen.  Probably by 
                      teenagers.

                                        LAURA
                      Are you kidding me??

      Sarah looks like  what the fuck?  

                                        JAY
                      There s more.  
                                (sighs)
                                        (MORE)         5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      6.


                                        JAY (CONT'D)
                      Look.  You know how today s teenagers can 
                      be.  They re mean, reckless... hormonal. 

                                        SARAH
                      Hormonal?

      Jay looks tense.  Paul puts his hand on Jay s shoulder.

                                        PAUL
                      You re doing great buddy.  

                                        JAY
                      These teenagers, they don t always pick 
                      on fair targets.  Sometimes they pick on 
                      old people, or dogs, or skeletons...

      A beat.

                                        LAURA
                      Did someone do something to our mother s 
                      skeleton?

                                        JAY
                                (getting emotional)
                      These damned kids... they performed a 
                      kind of... brutal version of...  making 
                      love  to your mother s skeleton. 

                                        LAURA
                      Oh my god!  

      Sarah looks more pensive than distraught.

                                        JAY
                      I wish it stopped there, I really do.  
                      But unfortunately, the perpetrators 
                      also... took several parts of the 
                      skeleton, either as souvenirs, or for 
                      further... relations.  They stole her 
                      pelvis, and, evidently, what they thought 
                      to be her... boob bones.  These 
                      teenagers, they don t understand 
                      anything. 

                                        LAURA
                      Oh, Jay!

      Laura begins to cry.  Jay holds her.

                                        PAUL
                                (taking Laura s and Sarah s 
                                hands)
                      This is not your fault. You have to know 
                      that.  It s not your fault.         5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      7.



                                        SARAH
                      Wait, I don t get it.  Why does having 
                      sex with a skeleton feel good?  There 
                      must be, like, a million things you could 
                      rub your genitals against that would feel 
                      better.  And take way less effort to get.

      Laura sobs as Sarah continues her speech.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      How do you even have the energy to have 
                      sex after digging up a grave?  That s six 
                      feet of dirt you re displacing.  I would 
                      need a nap before I even got three feet 
                      deep.  I mean, that combined with my 
                      Zoloft, I just don t think I d be in the 
                      mood.  I feel like I have energy - but 
                      these kids have, like, boundless energy.  
                      God, I never felt old before, but now I 
                      just feel ancient... Ugh, this whole 
                      thing is making me really depressed.
                              (to Laura)
                      I think I need you to take me home.

      Laura is sobbing in Jay s arms. 

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                                (thinks)
                      Wait a minute -- I sounded like Bart 
                      Simpson when I said that.  
                              (Bart Simpson)
                      I need you to take me home, dude.
                              (as herself)
                      Wow, I guess from great tragedy comes 
                      great art.

                                        PAUL
                              (to Laura)
                      Um, by the way, this was in your mother s 
                      coffin.

      Paul hands Laura an item stored inside a Ziplock bag.

                                        LAURA
                      This is Mom s old recipe book!

      Laura has a...


      FLASHBACK:         5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      8.




      Sometime in the 70 s.  LITTLE LAURA comes to get LITTLE 
      SARAH, who is holding a stick and standing at the edge of 
      their yard, near the street. 

                                        LITTLE LAURA
                      Sarah, you have to come inside now. 
                      Mommy s very sick and she wants to say 
                      goodbye.

                                        LITTLE SARAH
                      Okay.  I ll be there in a minute.

      Little Laura sighs and goes back toward the house. 



      Little Sarah has speared a piece of dog poo on her stick 
      and waves it at passing cars.

                                        LITTLE SARAH
                                (yelling)
                      Doodie!



      Sarah s talking to Stencil.       5/29/07       "DOODIE"      Pre-Table, 1st Draft      30.



                                        STENCIL
                              (low key)
                      Well, Silverman.  Even though you lost, I 
                      guess the right thing to do would be to 
                      let you keep your mom s headstone.

                                        SARAH
                      That would be awesome.

                                        STENCIL
                      I m a man of honor.  And I swore on my 
                      honor that I would give this back to you 
                      if you won.  Unfortunately... we won!!

                                        STENCIL/JOJO
                      Mustangs!!

      Stencil puts on a scooter helmet.  We CUT WIDE TO REVEAL 
      that Jojo is on a Vespa scooter that has a wagon hitched to 
      the back.  In the wagon is Rose s headstone.  Stencil hops 
      on the seat behind Jojo.  



      The girls stand at their mother s grave site.  An 
      instrumental, adagio VERSION OF  WHITE DOG POO  plays 
      underneath the scene.  Sarah plants a stick where their 
      mother s headstone once was.  On top of the stick is a 
      piece of dog poo.  Laura stands up beside Sarah, they side-
      hug, and walk away hand in hand.  As they do, the dog poo 
      magically turns white.
