      walls are just broken concrete, like this downtown society
      has built itself into abandoned warehouses & tenements.

      But this just b/g: TIGHT on the FORTUNE TELLER, grasping
      DONNA's hand in hers.  Breathes in deep.  Staring at Donna.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    Ohhh you're fascinating.  No, but
                    you're good.  I can see... a man. 
                    The most remarkable man.  How did
                    you meet him?

                                      DONNA
                    You're supposed to tell me.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    I see the future.  Tell me the
                    past.  When did your lives cross?

                                      DONNA
                    It's kind of complicated.  I ended
                    up in his spaceship on my wedding
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
                    day.  Long story.

      Looking at Donna.  A noise, a quiet hissss-tic-tic-tic.

                    But what led you to that meeting?

                                      DONNA
                    Well.  All sorts of things, but...
                    My job, I suppose.  It was on Earth,
                    this planet called Earth.  Miles
                    away.  But I had this job, as a
                    temp, I was a secretary, in a place
                    called H.C. Clements -

      FLASHBACK - sudden white frames, whoosh!  - then snatched
      images from 3.X, Donna at her desk, the H.C. CLEMENTS sign -

      CUT BACK TO Donna.  But it's not just a flashback, she felt
      those images.  Like a little punch.  Blinks.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    Woah.  Sorry...

                    It's the incense.  Betters the

      WILF in pyjamas, asleep on the settee, pillow & eiderdown. 
      He's woken up by a knock-knock, and then -

      He looks round.  SYLVIA's sitting up in bed, in silky M&S
      nightie, remote in hand, flicking through channels.  (Other
      side of the bed all ruffled; that's where Donna slept.) 

      DONNA's in the bathroom, door propped open, just finishing
      her make-up, dressed all Christmas-Day-smart.

      But on Donna.  Watching the world slide by.  Wondering

      WIDE SHOT, all three standing in the kitchen, like waifs

                    Maybe she went away for Christmas.

      Stopped dead, as Mr Colasanto takes a step back.  WILF's
      sitting behind him.  Beer in hand.  Sheepish smile.

      Keep it going, a good long while, a little pocket of joy. 

      And then - GUNSHOTS!

      In the street, outside.  Song stops.  All scared.

      ROSE leads DONNA in.  Massive space.  Empty.  Except for

      OF MIRRORS, and, as Rose leads Donna across...

      An old POLICE BOX at the centre.  Surrounded by arc lights. 
      Lots of wires clipped to its side, leading to the computers.

      UNIT CAPTAIN MAGAMBO - female, 30s - salutes Rose.  (And
      Rose is a bit brisker in here, in charge.)

                    Captain Erisa Magambo.  Thank you
                    for this.

                    I don't even know what I'm doing.

                          (of the police box)
                    Is it awake?

                    Seems to be quiet, today.  Ticking
                    over.  Like it's waiting.

                    D'you want to see?

      Leading her towards it.

                                      DONNA
                    What's a 'police box'?

                                    ROSE
                    They salvaged it, from underneath
                    the Thames.  Just go inside.

                                      DONNA
                    What for?

                                    ROSE
                    Just go in.

      Donna walks towards the door...  Pushes it...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      DONNA opens the door.  Looks in...

      WIDE SHOT, the dark interior lit only by SHAFTS OF LIGHT
      shining through the roof section.  The console's been
      opened, wires and panels and junk everywhere.

                                      DONNA
                    No way!

      She steps out, into the warehouse.  Looks round.

      Steps back in.  Boggles.  Laughs!  Stops.

      Steps back out.  Looks either side of the box's walls,
      like she did in 3.X.  Runs back inside -

      - a few steps up the ramp.  Stops.  Runs back out -

      - runs out, incredulous.

                                    ROSE
                    What d'you think?

                                      DONNA
                    Can I have a coffee?

      DONNA & ROSE at the console.  Donna nursing a coffee,
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
      holding on to something normal.  Stark light from above.

                                    ROSE
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    ...Time And Relative Dimension in
                    Space.  Oh, this room used to shine
  
                    with light.  I think it's dying...

      Puts her hand on the Rotor.  A quiet machine-groan.

                                    ROSE (CONT'D)
                    ...but it's still trying to help. 

                                      DONNA
                    And it belonged to the Doctor?

                                    ROSE
                    He was a Time Lord.  The last of
                    his kind. 

                                      DONNA
                    But if he was so special... what
                    was he doing with me?

                                    ROSE
                    He thought you were brilliant.

                                      DONNA
                    Don't be stupid.

                                    ROSE
                    But you are.  It just took the
                    Doctor to show you that.  Simply
                    by being with him.  He did the
                    same to me, to everyone he touches.

                    Were you and him..?

      Rose doesn't answer, just smiles, sadly.  Walks over to
      Donna.  Reaches for her back -

      Donna tenses, scared again.  Rose so gentle.  She just
      smooths one hand across Donna's back.

                                    ROSE
                    D'you want to see it?

      The CIRCLE OF MIRRORS: rectangular free-standing mirrors,
      with wires leading to machinery.  Rose leading DONNA to
      the centre, CAPTAIN MAGAMBO standing at the edge.

                    We don't know how the Tardis works,
                    but we've managed to scrape off

                    the surface technology.  Enough to
                    show you the creature.
  
                                      DONNA
                    It's a creature?

                                    ROSE
                    Just stand there.

                                      CAPTAIN MAGAMBO
                    Out of the circle, please.

                                    ROSE
                    Yes ma'am.

                                      DONNA
                    Can't you stay with me?

      But Rose goes to the edge.  Everyone in the room watching.

                                      CAPTAIN MAGAMBO
                    Ready?  And, activate.

      Simple PRAC LIGHTS blink on, in the spaces between the
      mirrors.  A deep thrummmm of power....

      CU Donna.  Screwing her eyes shut.  Hiss-tic-tic-tic...

                                    ROSE OOV
                    It's part of you, Donna.  Look.

      And Donna...

      Opens... her eyes...

      - oh God!, there it is! - she's in shock, she spins round -
      CUT, CUT, CUT, in the mirrors, cos there it is - 

      - the THING - !

      - it's only glimpsed at first, cutting between Donna's
      terror - one mirror, then another, then another -

          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
                    - it's all right, calm down, just

      Donna breathing hard.  Controls her panic.
  
      Looks properly...

      At the HUGE BLACK BEETLE clinging to her back.  Shiny
      carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles
      clacking together, hiss-tic-tic-tic...

      Keeping control.  Wanting to scream.  Quiet:

                    time, by making someone's life
                    take a different turn.  The meetings
                    never made.  The children never
                    born.  A life never loved.  But

                    Yes you did.  Cos one day, that
                    thing made you turn right, instead
                    of left.

                    But turning right meant you never
                    met the Doctor.  And the whole
                    world changed around you.

                    reality is bending around you.

                    one minute past ten in the morning,
                    your car was on Little Sutton
                    Street, leading on to Ealing Road,

                    left, that's the most important
                    thing, you've got to go back and
                    make sure the car turns left, Donna,
                    have you got that?  One minute
                    past ten, you've got to make
                    yourself turn left, heading for

      The moment has come.  DONNA walking across the empty space,
      flanked by TWO SOLDIERS, followed by ROSE & CAPTAIN MAGAMBO.

      Military.  Tense.  Scary.

      All the SCIENTISTS at their machines, poised, staring.
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green

      But Donna's so brave.  Walks, head held high.

      They approach the CIRCLE OF MIRRORS.  Stop at the perimeter. 
      Soldiers spread out, assume positions.

                    This is where we leave you.

                                      DONNA
                    I don't want to see that thing on
                    my back.

                                    ROSE
                    No, the mirrors are just incidental. 
                    But they bounce Chronon Energy
                    back into the centre.  Which we
                    control, and decide the destination.

                                      DONNA
                    It's a time machine.

                                    ROSE
                    It's a time machine.

                    If you could.

      Donna walks centre.  Bravery faltering a little.  Rose at
      the edge.  Captain Magambo busies herself with scientists.

                    Well!  I'll just run up to myself,
                    and have a good argument.

      Thrummm, and the TARDIS windows flicker with light...

      PRAC LIGHTS flicker on, around the circle, low-level...

      Donna scared.  But excited.

                                    ROSE
                    Good luck.

                    One minute past ten.

      Lights, power rising, Donna right at Rose, so trusting:

                    Least I'm not gonna die.  Cos I

                    gonna die, but you mean this whole
                    world, it's gonna blink out of

                    ...that's right, isn't it?  I don't

                    How can I die?

      Rose can only look at her.  So sad.

      She spins round the other way to see -

      The FORTUNE TELLER is on the floor, curled into the corner,
      terrified: like she experienced all this, the whole
      different world, felt it, way beyond anything she'd planned -

      And she's terrified.  Of Donna.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    You were so strong.  What are you?

      And the Fortune Teller scrabbles away, disappearing deeper
      into the drapes and shadows of her den, gone.

      Donna lost.  Getting her breath back.  Stares at the beetle. 

      Then, in the doorway, nice and casual:

      THE DEAD BEETLE now on the table.  THE DOCTOR poking and

      DONNA recovering, sitting there with a bowl of foamy stuff.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    They are.  But you had one created

                    Keeps happening a lot.  To you.

                    Sometimes I think there's way too
                    much coincidence around you, Donna. 
                    I met you once.  Then I met your
                      Grandfather.  Then I met you again. 
                    In the whole, wide universe, I met

                    The stars...  Doctor.  She said

                    She said it was all worlds.  Every
                    world.  She said the darkness is

                                    THE DOCTOR
