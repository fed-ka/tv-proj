To pop everything into place...       

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the end of the
lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on Locations and Chronology pages)
designate.

Notes: 

Cover:  "We Have A Lot To Talk About", Written by John McNamara [and] Directed
by Phillip J. Sgriccia are all in large bolt print. WARNER BROTHERS TELEVISION
is in an Ariel-type font. The remainder of the text is in Courier 10 (10
characters per inch)

Typos noted:
page 20:  at top, "eleven year old" in original should be 
        eleven-year-old,
Page 54, near bottom, "...had a stigma." I think this 
        should have been "astigmatism."

      CLARK takes LOIS' hand and they run out of the park, across
      the street to a lighted doorway.


   3  EXT. DOORWAY - NIGHT                                            3   

      Lois and Clark step into the dry and shake themselves off.
      Then they look at each other as she hands him back his
      glasses.

                     It's the new glasses, isn't it?
                     They just don't work as good as the
                     old ones.

                            response; slips them on)
                     I guess the first question is, 'How
                     long have you known?'

                                      LOIS
                     Really?  I thought the first
                     question'd be, 'How'd you figure it
                     out?'

                     'How mad are you?'

                     How about we save that one for
                     last?

                                      CLARK

      Lois shivers, dripping, then sneezes.

                     Here.

      He steps back, lowers his glasses and a SPRAY of HEAT VISION
      caresses her body, drying her.

                                      LOIS
                     Thanks.  So.  How long have I 
                     known?  Since yesterday.  And how 
                     did I figure it out?
                           (reaches for his hand)

      tenderly, then Superman did the same.  As Superman touched
      her, we again see Lois' look of dawning awareness.

                                      LOIS
                     I've touched you before.... both of
                     you... but something about almost
                     dying sharpened everything, all my
                     senses, like putting on a pair of
                     glasses.

      Deserted.  Glistening in lamplight.  Lois and Clark walk.

                                      CLARK
                     So how mad are you?

                                      LOIS
                     Not at all.

                     I'm not mad at all, Clark.

                                      CLARK

                     do, it's logical, it's even 
                     thoughtful but when you get right 
                     down to it, you made me believe you 
                     were two people and you did it by 
                     lying and that makes me wonder if I

                                      CLARK
                     All right, that's good, just get                  (X)
                     it all out --                                     (X)

      Before Clark can utter his next syllable, he hears a MAN'S
      SCREAM from around the corner.  He and Lois both turn toward
      it.  Then she looks at him.

                                      LOIS
                     Go.
                           (he hesitates)                              (X)
                     GO!                                               (X)

      He whirls and becomes SUPERMAN.  She can't help but be
      dazzled --

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     Whoa.

      -- then a second SCREAM from the same man brings them both
      back to the immediacy of the moment.  He's gone in a
      SUPER-BLUR.


   7  EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT                                  7   

      A LEATHER-CLAD THUG is on his knees, arms twisted behind his
      back by TWO MEN IN BLACK SUITS.  The Thug is the one
      SCREAMING, unwilling to let go of his knife.  The Men in
      Black exert more pressure.  The knife drops.  Superman
      SHOOTS into sight.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Let him go.

      A TIMID MAN steps from the shadows.  Torn sweater, glasses
      askew; scared.

                                      TIMID MAN
                     No, Superman, they saved me.  I was
                     walking home and this guy --
                           (the Thug)
                     -- jumped me and these two came out
                     of nowhere.  If it wasn't for them,
                     I... I...

      Lois comes around the corner now.  Superman looks at the Men
      in Black and notices identical insignias on their breast
      pockets: brightly stylized "C's."

      He hands the Man of Steel a card.  He glances at it as Lois

      the Thug and flips open a cellular phone, mutters into it.

                     Mr. Church wants Metropolis to be a 
                     better place to live and he's 
                     committed his fortune to that end.

      More Men and Women in Black appear at every corner, near and 
      far.  Then a black sedan with the stylized "C" on the side.

                                      MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
                           (into a wrist mic)
                     Situation green, continue patrols.

      The Men and Women at the corners touch their ears, nod and 
      move off in pairs.

                                      LOIS
                     I get it, you're some kind of
                     vigilante group, Church's private
                     storm troopers.  Well, that's
                     against the law --

                     Miss, if you'd like to check with
                     the police, you'll find we're
                     operating under their purview.
                           (to fellow MIB)
                     Let's get this man into custody.
                           (to Timid Man)
                     Sir, come with us, the police'll
                     need your statement.  Superman,
                     thanks for trying to help.

      The condescension is not lost.  A brief look between the 
      two.  Superman just nods:  oooooh-kay.  Then, with a 
      no-nonsense efficiency, the Men in Black slide into the 
      sedan with the Thug and the Timid Man.

                                      LOIS
                     Well, you've got to give Church and 
                     his son credit -- they love 
                     Metropolis and they never stop 
                     trying to take over.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     I should probably take a look 
                     around the city, make sure 
                     everything's all right... but I

      He nods and closes the case.  A little too sharply.

                     Clark...

                           (kisses her)
                     But I'll tell you, I've never seen 
                     things clearer... or known with 
                     more absolute fervor my true 
                     destiny.

                     I'm guessing I'll need a drink.

      He moves to the bar, pours.

                     Billy, we're criminals.  Greedy, 
                     opportunistic vermin preying on the 
                     innocent.

                                      JUNIOR

                     And... ?

                                      SENIOR
                     I can't do it anymore.

                     You want to retire?

                                      SENIOR
                     I want to dismantle Intergang.
                     Ever since the operation, I've had 
                     visions.  I've tried to ignore 
                     them, but I can't.  It's all been a 
                     waste.  The money, the power.  It's 
                     meaningless.  We're gonna pull the 
                     plug on this whole stinking 
                     operation and use our resources to 
                     make the world a better place.

                                      JUNIOR
                     You're serious.

                                      SENIOR
                     Totally.

                                      JUNIOR
                     Considering the jet lag and the 
                     airplane food, I think I'm taking 
                     this pretty well... don't you, 
                     Mindy?

                                      MINDY
                     Huh?

                     Exactly.

                     I've earmarked five hundred million 
                     dollars for the Church Group... 
                     four thousand men and women 
                     patrolling Metropolis, with the 
                     singular goal of making this the 
                     safest city on Earth.  And if it 
                     works here, we'll do it in other 
                     cities; we'll give every cent we 
                     have to make amends for the horror
                     we've caused.

      Lois at her desk, typing into the computer, trying to 
      concentrate, but her eyes keep drifting over to:

      Clark's empty desk.  She tries not to let it unsettle her.

      PERRY and JIMMY in the near-distance, looking at Lois, then 
      looking at Clark's empty desk, then looking at Lois looking.

                                      JIMMY
                     Chief, I know we said we weren't
                     gonna talk about...
                           (off a glare from Perry)

                     anymore but...
                           (Perry's glare hardens)
                     Okay, okay.  We have lives of our

      Back on Lois now, as she hears footsteps approach, turns and 
      sees Clark walking toward her.  She brightens.

      She stands.  He stops.  Should they kiss?  Touch?

      Back to Jimmy and Perry, staring, mesmerized as Lois makes a 
      move to kiss his cheek and he backs up ever so slightly and 
      then _she_ backs up and --

      Lois and Clark finally settle on a good morning handshake,
      about as stiff and awkward as you can imagine.

                                      PERRY
                     They're doing this on purpose,
                     aren't they?  They're torturing us.

      On Lois and Clark now, handshake over, awkwardness escalating.

                     I, uh, I called last night... a
                     couple times.

                           (makes a flying motion

                     No, it was pretty quiet but I 
                     wanted to keep an eye on that 
                     Church Group.  Sure are a lot of 
                     them.

                                      LOIS
                     Yeah, I've been doing some
                     research.

                     Look, Clark last night, we both
                     got pretty emotional.  It's 
                     understandable, I guess.  But I 
                     feel a lot clearer today...

                     understand all this business you
                     two talk about... but I really

                     I'm glad to see you've come around,
                     son.

                                      JUNIOR
                     Well, I had a nice long talk with
                     the newest Mrs. Church.
                           (pulls out cigar)
                     Dad?  Can I tempt you?

                     Well, uhhhh...
                           (she nods)
                     If the nurse says it's all right.

      Junior and Senior both slide cigars into their mouths.
      Mindy is standing between them, looking at father, then son, 
      as both pat their pockets for a light.

      Mindy flicks a lighter, first lights up Senior, then Junior.

                                      JUNIOR
                     She can be very persuasive.

                                      SENIOR
                     Don't I know it.

      The two men face each other, puff away, And in the merging
      plumes of smoke between them, she lets out a dainty cough,       (X)
      then --                                                          (X)

                     Uh, honeybun?  The man with the 
                     Rodin wanted to see you about the 
                     bill.

      Senior nods and moves off, leaving Mindy alone with Junior.

                                      MINDY (CONT'D)
                     I have a kind of a thought.

                                      JUNIOR
                           (puffing away)
                     Me too.

                                      MINDY
                           (giving his cheek a
                            stroke that moves down
                            the length of the cigar)
                     Me three but _this_ thought's
                     business.  Your Dad keeps talking
                     about having this fundraiser... and
                     so maybe it could be at a museum?

                     And maybe, the museum could be full
                     of really important people and,
                     y'know, art?  And then maybe it

                     Oh, I hadn't thought of that part,
                     that's good, that's really good.

      Lois and Clark get out of her jeep and start to walk.

                     Look, it was a very tense

                     time wallowing.  We wallowed.  I 
                     hate wallowers and that's what 
                     we've turned into -- a couple of 
                     sighing, slack-jawed, self-pitying 
                     wallowers!

                                      CLARK
                     For whatever it's worth, I x-rayed 
                     under the store and found evidence 
                     of machinery being dismantled.  
                     Church could be telling the truth.

                                      LOIS
                     Are you kidding?  Next you'll be 
                     telling me you bought his lovey, 
                     newlywed spew.

                                      CLARK
                     Well, I _hope_ that being married
                     to someone changes your life, maybe 
                     gets you to think about things in a 
                     new way...

                                      LOIS
                     And doesn't that big love change 
                     start with _communication_?  
                     Getting things out in the open?

                                      CLARK
                     I _did_ get things out in the open,
                     starting with, 'Will you marry me?,

                                      LOIS
                     No, I got things out in the open,
                     starting with, 'You are Superman.'

                                      CLARK
                     A little louder, I don't think they
                     heard you in Gotham City.

                     Lois, first I needed to know if
                     you'd marry me... not Superman, his

                     know that, okay?  Then I was going
                     to tell you everything.

                                      LOIS
                     Well, I guess we'll never know,
                     will we?

                     Thanks, I think I'll just...

                     Fine.

      She slams the door and starts the jeep.

                                      CLARK
                     Fine.

      She squeals off.  Clark reaches into his pocket and pulls
      out the ring case, pops it open and studies the stone.  We
      hear the Gary Lewis and the Playboys song, 'This Diamond
      Ring' as he studies it, growing more and more upset.

      He looks around to make sure he's alone, then takes the ring
      out of the box, hauls off and hurls it into the air.

                     I don't know, ever since she 
                     said no, it's like we both... all

                     I guess.

                     Pickles and mustard.  All you got 
                     is pickles and mustard.  What kinda 
                     person lives like this?  If my

      JOE THE BLOW sits in the lamplight, smoking a cigar, working
      on an intricate bomb timing mechanism.  He looks at his
      watch, stretches, puts all of his equipment in a toolbox,
      locks it, gets up and leaves.

      Beat.

      Then the door squeaks open and in walks Lois, dressed as a
      maid.  She scans the depressing little room, then spies the
      toolbox.  Pulls a lockpick out of her skirt and begins to
      work on the lock; opens the toolbox and sees the explosive
      devices there.

                     really brilliant way of keeping him

      She comes out of the bathroom, hair wet, and steps on --         (X)

      -- a rubber mat. We hear a CLICK and the VOICE of Joe the

                     keep the beat...

      Atop the bomb is a dancer's metronome. It clicks off the
      time and Lois starts doing jumping jacks on the mat,
      matching the clicks.

                     And the only connection I can see
                     is, Church, Sr. just started buying
                     art like the Russians are in
                     Oregon.

                     So you think he might be out to
                     increase the value of his
                     collection by ridding the world of
                     a few Modiglianis?

                                      LOIS
                     I know he's a friend of yours
                     but --

                                      PERRY
                     Well, the friendship got a little
                     strained when that whelp of his
                     kidnapped me.  We're all going to
                     the party...
                           (picks up phone)
                     ... and we're going with the
                     Metropolis Bomb Squad.

      A knock at her door.  She's getting dressed for the museum 
      party; opens the door, revealing Martha.

                     calling and even ruder to stick my 
                     nose in where it doesn't belong

      Clark sits with Jonathan, having a heart to heart:

                                      JONATHAN
                     Son, I never told you this but...
                     your Mom turned me down the first
                     time I asked her to marry me.

                                      CLARK
                     You're kidding.

                                      JONATHAN
                     Actually, the first two times.

                                      CLARK
                     What'd you do?

                                      JONATHAN
                     I sulked.  Dove into my work.
                     Unfortunately, it was winter, so I
                     looked pretty silly plowing those
                     fields in the snow.  Anyway, around
                     about spring, I finally realized
                     that getting married wasn't just
                     about my feelings, hurt as they
                     were.  Your Mom was young, scared;
                     she knew she loved me but was it a
                     lifetime kind of love?  She
                     needed...

                                      LOIS
                     ... time... to think it over, to
                     get to know him the way he really
                     is. Is that so unreasonable?

                                      MARTHA
                     No.  But you have to understand,
                     Clark's always been alone.

                     When he was thirteen and getting
                     strong -- really, _really_
                     strong -- he made up his own mind
                     he wasn't going to tell anybody.
                     He said he wanted to fit in...
                           (shakes her head)
                     But he never could, not really.  It 
                     broke ray heart, watching him having 
                     to hide so much; afraid held always 
                     be alone...

                     Then tell him.  And make him tell 
                     you.  You can get through anything 
                     else.  My God, I turned Jonathan 
                     down four times before we finally 
                     made it down the aisle.

                                      LOIS
                     Really?

                                      MARTHA
                     Well, I thought he was crazy.  
                     Every time I said no, he'd get on 
                     his tractor and plow a field of
                     snow...
                           (Lois laughs and wipes
                            her eyes)
                     This is so nice.  Almost thirty 
                     years and you're the first woman 
                     I've been able to talk to about my 
                     boy.

      And as they hug --

                     Last piece of advice, son?  I know 
                     she's a handful sometimes but trust 
                     me... she's a rare woman, a 
                     fighter.  And fighters never let 
                     you down.  I know.  I married one 
                     myself.

                     getting to the bomb before it goes

                     We've got to do something, the
                     bomb's not here for decoration --
                     it's going to go off, no matter
                     what.

                                      CLARK
                     I think I have an idea.

      They head out, passing Mindy, who kisses her husband on the

                     The sensors are locked onto me.

                     I can tell you what to look for.

                           (quickly)
                     Okay, okay, I'm fine.   I'll do it.

                     We can't tell anybody what's going 
                     on.  A panic could set it off... 
                     Be careful, try not to move too 
                     fast.

      Moving with odd slow steps, Lois creeps toward the buffet 
      table.  A MAN passes and gives her an odd look.

                                      LOIS
                     I'm a mime, okay?

      She continues the slow creep.

      Lois very slowly pulls back the tablecloth.  A WAITER bends 
      to help.

                     these really, really big canisters

                     we don't have to dwell on that.  
                     Uh, so, do I want to detach the 
                     wires?  If I'm right, say 'Lois,' 
                     if I'm wrong say, 'Lane.'

  65  EXT. COSTMART - DAY                                            65   

      Senior is admiring a new painting that Junior has just 
      unveiled.

                                      SENIOR
                     Billy, it's beautiful.  It'll look
                     wonderful in the museum.

                                      JUNIOR
                     Well, in about two minutes, it'll
                     sure stand out.

                                      SENIOR
                     I think I'm going to cry.

      Just then, police cars pulls up.

                                      JUNIOR
                     Don't cry, Dad... I'll visit every
                     other Sunday.

      Senior is confused and Junior smug as the COPS get out, guns 
      drawn, cuffs-out, moving toward them and

      Many THUGGISH MEN gather around a silhouetted figure behind
      the desk.  The big chair squeaks back, a pair of feet go up
      and a match ignites in the gloom, revealing the face of
      Mindy Church.
