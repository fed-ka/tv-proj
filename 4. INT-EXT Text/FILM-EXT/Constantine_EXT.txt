Glimpses of an ancient city.
Almost motionless against
the tide of time.
Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen
against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns.
FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.
SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous
structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall.

GUARDS
(in Turkish)
Stop!
Stop!
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING
OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target. Guards check their weapons on the run.
Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road.
Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.
OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.
Not in a third world country but smack center in one of
America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.
SUPERIMPOSE:
LOS ANGELES - TODAY
A faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps
out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.
Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over
end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING
the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO
buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON
the taxi's hood.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
CHAZ
SHIT!
Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING
into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond.
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.
John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from
the taxi's hood.
JOHN
I told you to move it.
CHAZ
Well maybe if you had told me you
were dropping a three-hundred
pound mirror with a pissed-off
demon in it I would have moved it
further.
Chaz slams the hood.
They slide into the car.
CHAZ
Well?
JOHN
Well what?
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls
out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills.
CHAZ
Shouldn't have cut your stay in
the land of enlightenment. You
were so close to growing a
conscience.
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and
sits back.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
JOHN
Los Angeles...
He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.
JOHN
Never ceases to entertain.
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs.
One of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So
clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings.
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible
sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to
Earth.
MAN (V.O.)
You still with me?
Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks.
TAXI TRUNK
OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.
John
starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells --
CHAZ
There are four bags. I have two
hands. This give you any ideas?
JOHN
Make two trips?
John walks in.
Chaz curses under his breath.
Lots of blue on blue in this parking lot.
20.
So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a
pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A
Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front
are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which
is --
JOHN
Two frogs on a bench.
Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him --
he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS.
CHAZ
Two frogs on a bench.
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card
shows a BEAR in a dress.
CHAZ
What?
But I'm with him!
Right,
John?
John?
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.
Chaz
backs away, stares after him. Someday.
John SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks
44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector
cap.
HENNESSEY
Hey, John.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes,
is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.
Hennessey grabs
hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles
the syrup.
HENNESSEY
I'm real sorry about this morning,
John, real sorry. Please don't
hate me for draggin' you into
that. Please don't...
John can finally breathe.
JOHN
I don't hate you.
HENNESSEY
That's good to hear. Real good...
JOHN
But could you at least wait until
I call for you before you show up?
HENNESSEY
You didn't call?
JOHN
Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you
freak me out sometimes.
HENNESSEY
So you want me to go away and come
back?
JOHN
No. I've got an assignment for you.
HENNESSEY
Really?
What kind of assignment?
JOHN
The kind you'll have to be sober
for.
HENNESSEY
Oh God, you want me to surf the
ether.
He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.
Four
intersecting crosses.
JOHN
Come on, you know that exorcism
wasn't right.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
HENNESSEY
I... I don't have the Sight
anymore.
JOHN
Don't have it or don't want to use
it?
Hennessey vacillates.
This is obviously tough for him.
JOHN
Just look around. A few days.
You spot anything unusual,
anything -- you let me know.
Okay?
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy,
then reaches behind his neck --
JOHN
It'll be like old times.
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That
unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's
pocket.
JOHN
Just for a few days.
HENNESSEY
Okay, okay... for you, John.
Like
old times. Right.
Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the
bottle over. John downs the rest. Nods.
A metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out --
breathing deep. She runs across the tar roof, almost
afraid to look back.
She gets to the ledge, steps up.
A BOTTLE in the way
fall -- FOLLOW IT DOWN TO the --
29.
COURTYARD
-- where it SHATTERS --
Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down
to Angela's contorted body. But she's still alive.
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches
out, touches her face. Eyes close. She's gone.
DAY
Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers
and medical personnel.
WEISS
It's Isabel.
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard.
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the
face.
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and
furious.
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela. That's
when you realize that wasn't a dream. This is her twin.
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now.
Angela's eyes well with tears. It takes everything she
has to stay in control. Helps to wrap herself in the
job. She steps back, looks up at the tall building.
ANGELA
She... she fell from the roof?
WEISS
No.
She jumped.
Angela gives him an incredulous glare.
Shakes her head.
WEISS
I know it's hard to accept but --
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
ANGELA
Isabel would never in a million
years take her own life. Never.
WEISS
Angela... there was a surveillance
camera on the roof.
A PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape.
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner.
He grips the relic tight in one hand.
That anxious fever
has returned.
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're
on -- heading the opposite way.
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic
tighter.
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through
the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks
his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the
process.
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He
swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over
as driver.
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance.
Close to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor,
COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil.
John sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the
world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across
the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars.
John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes,
wondering which one will be his last.
ELLIE (O.S.)
Lung cancer?
Lung cancer?!
John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk.
Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more
ways than you think.
ELLIE
That's funny as shit, John.
JOHN
As if you guys didn't have
something to do with it...
ELLIE
Hey, I think you brought this one
on yourself.
John stares at her, tries to get a read.
ELLIE
Now why wouldn't you trust me?
JOHN
I don't know, something in the
air --
She sits right on his lap, playfully.
ELLIE
Don't worry, John, you'll beat
this. You beat everything.
JOHN
Not this time, Ellie.
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside.
ELLIE
Oh wow, you're serious... No
wonder the Boss is in such a good
mood.
JOHN
Yeah, I thought maybe you could
talk to him for me. You know...?
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she
does.
ELLIE
What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe
you but to even ASK that? All
those saints and martyrs slipping
through his grasp -- his own foot
soldiers sent back to him in
chunks. He's going to take all
that out on you, John, and he's
going to enjoy ripping your soul
to shreds until the end of time.
JOHN
So I take that as a 'no?'
ELLIE
You're the one soul the man
himself would actually come up
here to collect. And you know how
much he despises this place.
JOHN
I'm starting to see his point.
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.
ELLIE
Have you gone to see the Snob?
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.
No way.
ELLIE
Look, don't let your ego get in
the way on this. I'd miss having
someone up here I can... relate
to.
She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is
brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and
walks away.
Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society
building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place
for this city. John stares out the back seat window,
takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to
Chaz --
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
JOHN
I'm sure I can get you in here.
Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter
flag back down. Tick... tick... tick...
CHAZ
Pass.
Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour.
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the
other side, looking equally frayed. They share another
glance.
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.
Empty.
JOHN
He has a rotten sense of humor.
(steps past)
And his punch lines are killers.
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the
RAIN, away from Chaz's taxi pulling up.
CHAZ
(shouting out)
John?
It's raining! Hey!
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at
the empty cigarette pack.
DISSOLVE TO:
John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)
Hey, buddy, you got a light?
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.
OLD MAN
(coughs)
We gotta stick together, right?
John gathers himself. As he walks over to this OLD MAN,
he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a
matchbox.
The box shudders as a high-pitch FLUTTERING filters from
inside. Old Man winces as his entire body VIBRATES.
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with
the screech beetle inside. And now he knows -- a beat
too late.
Old Man attacks.
John is knocked onto his haunches. As the Old Man closes
in, he's revealed in more detail. Body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city
vermin. Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held
together in the shape of a man.
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's
outstretched grasp. He shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again.
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second, then snaps back together. He GRABS onto
John with fingers of squirming vermin. Snake wraps
around his wrist. Crab snaps at his skin.
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to
vibrate even further. Old Man grabs John's head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face.
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then
smashes it against the sidewalk.
BEETLE lets out a death SHRIEK and the Old Man
stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the b.g. through the seams.
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might. Old Man form shatters on impact.
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city.
John stands there, shocked and concerned.
What the hell
is going on?
The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery.
Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.
Sure
enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE.
Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer,
leaves.
VARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright
and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned
mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged
between competing banks.
COME TO REST ON --
The towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are
welcoming us into the "HOLY CROSS CEMETERY."
Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley.
Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her.
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in
with each step.
JOHN (O.S.)
Detective!
Angela looks back, sees John in the street.
JOHN
How open is your mind?
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.
JOHN
Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?
(off no answer)
How about what comes out of each?
Angela keeps walking.
He catches up with her.
JOHN
Hey!
ANGELA
You mean like angels?
JOHN
And demons.
Angela stares at him, continues walking.
He keeps up.
JOHN
See, you don't have the mindset
for this kind of work.
They walk together down the lonely street.
ANGELA
Look, I see terrible things every
day. A mother drowns her baby. A
ten-year-old shoots his father.
But it's not demons, it's the evil
that men do.
Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another.
They're not looking back so they don't see it.
JOHN
You're right, we're capable of
terrible things but we usually
justify it with motives like money
and power and jealousy.
Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out.
JOHN
Then sometimes, something comes
along and gives us just the right
nudge and we do truly evil things
just for the kick of it.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
ANGELA
I don't believe in demons.
JOHN
You should.
They believe in us.
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then
blacks out. Both look up.
The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT.
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight
ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING
BRIGHT.
JOHN
We should go...
Second later it BLINKS OFF.
John grabs her hand --
JOHN
Fast.
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
WIND races toward them.
John jerks her into action. They run towards the next
light. It blinks out right when they reach it.
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety
of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.
They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of
overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the
branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats
at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek.
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER,
fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths.
John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum.
A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of
blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like
LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them.
ANGELA
What is that?
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
John is just as surprised he's saying this --
JOHN
Wings.
ANGELA
Wings?
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that
cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around
Moses.
JOHN
And maybe talons.
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...
ANGELA
Are you kidding? Of what?
JOHN
Something that's not supposed to
be here.
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand.
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of
light.
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter.
JOHN
Close your eyes.
They are now standing in pitch darkness.
ANGELA
Why?
JOHN
Suit yourself.
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion --
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand.
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a
brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and
illuminating a --
-- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of
reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and DEMONS SHRIEK as
they are instantly vaporized.
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket,
extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.
JOHN
(to himself)
'I accidentally crossed over?'
I
don't think so.
ANGELA
(coming up behind)
What was that? I saw wings -- and
teeth -- they were flying. What
the hell were those things?!
JOHN
They weren't angels.
John scans the area, trying to think this through.
JOHN
Seplavites, actually. Scavengers
for the damned.
(off her lost look)
Demons?
ANGELA
What? You can't be serious...
this is impossible...
JOHN
Yeah...
(to himself)
And I don't think they were after
me...
John looks at her with renewed interest.
JOHN
You really believe she wouldn't
commit suicide?
ANGELA
(a bit thrown)
My sister?
(a beat)
Never in a million years.
John makes the decision.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
JOHN
Let's be sure.
He starts walking.
Angela is now compelled to follow.
ANGELA
How?
JOHN
Simple.
See if she's in Hell.
Not exactly an inviting place.
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.
John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long-
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.
JOHN
Is she here?
On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.
It strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze.
JOHN
Is she here?!
His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking
down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.
JOHN
IS SHE HERE?!
That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge
blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape,
rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this
isn't a safe place for the living.
JOHN
It's a simple question!
Is she
here or not?!!
John suddenly locks on something far off.
On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a
sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows
she's looking right at him.
JOHN
Isabel?
She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness.
A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk
in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox.
JOHN (V.O.)
Things I wasn't supposed to.
The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face
is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are
dug into the ground.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
WAITRESS (O.S.)
Coffee?
Young John looks up toward the voice --
The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming.
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version.
JOHN (V.O.)
Officially I was dead for seven
minutes. But believe me, seven
minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN.
runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that
PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver,
punches numbers as fast as he can. RING -- RING --
RING --
HENNESSEY
Be there, John... please...
Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body.
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
JOHN (V.O.)
Heaven and Hell are right here,
behind every wall, every face --
the world behind the world. It's
crossing over that's the real
trick. That's why most demons can
only whisper in our ears. But
even a whisper can turn your
favorite pleasure into your worst
nightmare.
The morgue is seen across the street.
The Guard that
chased Hennessey is just outside.
WEISS (O.S.)
Security Guard spotted him near
the body, chased him out.
We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.
Around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining --
WEISS
He comes over here, makes a run at
the entire menu and pow --
deflates like a fricken Macy's day
balloon.
-- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down
at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now.
John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop
starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be.
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into
Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend. That's even more
crushing.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
JOHN
Shit...
(sympathetic)
Why didn't you call me, you fat
sonna bitch...
John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.
JOHN
(to Hennessey)
Rest in peace, Father.
Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence,
heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story
hospital complex of RAVENSCAR.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
A rim-lit figure stands on the roof. But this one isn't
wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat.
ANGELA (V.O.)
Seances, crystals -- channeling...
Our father thought she was just
trying to get attention. She
certainly did that.
Angela stands behind John. A large water tank is
anchored to the roof next to her. Note the FLAME logo.
ANGELA
She'd tell everyone about things
she said she saw. Crazy things.
Things that hadn't happened yet.
She'd scare my mother to death,
talking on and on about
Revelations and the end of the
world. Then one day she just
stopped... never said another
word.
JOHN
So you put her in here.
Angela doesn't need to be reminded.
It hurts even more now.
JOHN
Show me her room.
A lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard.
John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John
drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.
Finally
sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela.
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees.
That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his
hand. But this time there's more.
ANGELA
(trying to
rationalize)
There must have been a tree in our
backyard... when we were kids...
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol --
JOHN
'COR 14:01.'
ANGELA
Cor?
JOHN
Corinthians.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
ANGELA
(shaking her head)
There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
John's face goes pale --
JOHN
I need a church.
Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John
gets her up to speed.
JOHN (V.O.)
The myth says Mammon was conceived
before his father's fall from
grace but was born after.
SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before
Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few
flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John
rushes in.
John sits in his opened window, simmering. He holds a
lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips.
Outside the city goes about its unending churn.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
Down on the street are several police vehicles. ENGINES
START and they drive away. Swirl of blue and red lights
flash across John's moist eyes.
ANGELA (O.S.)
There were no trees in our back
yard.
John finds Angela across the room in his doorway.
ANGELA
But you knew that already, didn't
you?
John meets her eyes.
Sees the questions piling up.
ANGELA
(walking towards him)
You see something in me...
Something Isabel had.
JOHN
Go home, Angela.
ANGELA
I need to understand --
John just shakes his head.
ANGELA
Why not?
JOHN
Because you open up to that world,
you're inviting whatever's out
there back in. That's what
happened to Isabel.
ANGELA
I'm not Isabel.
JOHN
No, she embraced her gift while
you denied yours and that denial
is exactly why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that'll change.
John gets off the window, starts walking away.
JOHN
And I don't need another ghost
following me around.

ANGELA
Dammit, John -- they killed my
sister!
That stops him cold.
ANGELA
I can't let them get away with
that. Even if it means going down
the same path she did. Now if you
won't help me get there, I'll find
my own way. But I won't run.
Never.
The two stand there -- locked in this moment.
ANGELA
Please...
John can't believe this day -- looks her dead in the eye.
JOHN
You do this, there's no turning
back. You see them -- they see
you. Understand?
Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.
FAT-ASS TIRES BURN under the full torque of a 426 HEMI.
A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement
garage of 20 Lanes -- slides onto the streets of L.A.
Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob --
slams into 2nd -- leaves another layer of tread behind.
FLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT OVER US.
Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a
sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below.
L.A. LANDMARKS - DAWN
streak PAST. The Big Donut, the occult bookstores, the
'57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.
He downshifts -- DRIFTS PAST a building with a facade of
pre-stressed concrete and huge gold letters -- "BZR
FINANCE AND BROKERAGE."
JOHN (O.S.)
This shouldn't take long.
ANGELA moves through the gathered crowd looking up at the
building. As she makes her way through, the amulet
brushes against bodies -- swinging from side to side.
Angela suddenly stops in the center of the street,
turns...
ANGELA
Something's coming...
She stares at her surroundings with an increasing sense
of dread. Then hears the RUMBLE and TIRES SCREECHING.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
Angela spins, spots John's BARRACUDA exploding around the
corner. It barrels up the street and slides to a
SQUEALING stop in front of her. Passenger door swings
open.
JOHN
What happened to staying in the
car?
ANGELA
You were in danger.
JOHN
Well now there's a premonition.
SIRENS crack the air.
Angela jumps in and John PEELS
OUT.
John takes a turn at 70 as Angela stares into John's
Bible.
JOHN
He was finished off by a soldier's
spear.
He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the
event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a
soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John
removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat.
ANGELA
I'm Catholic, John -- I know the
crucifixion story.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
JOHN
Then you know what this spear
would mean to a demon trying to
cross over.
She doesn't.
JOHN
The stains on its edges?
Angela looks back at the painting, notes the liquid
flowing from Jesus' wound. Angela can't believe it --
JOHN
Mammon needed divine assistance --
how's the blood of God's only son?
Angela sits stunned for a moment.
ANGELA
So that's it -- he's got
everything he needs to escape...
JOHN
Not quite.
(glances at her)
Twins.
Angela gives him a look.
Something in the rearview
mirror catches his gaze.
JOHN
Here we go --
John floors it and Angela glances out the back window,
spots something in the traffic -- bounding over vehicles,
hitting the pavement on all fours --
ANGELA
What is that?
JOHN
A hound on the hunt.
A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible
speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD --
causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each
other. And still this thing keeps coming.
JOHN
Hang on --
BARRACUDA slides into an alley, races toward the other
end.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
Angela looks back, sees their pursuer enter the alley.
It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all manner
of physics.
ANGELA
Impossible.
The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the
building.
ANGELA
I lost it.
BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good
foot.
A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts
shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in.
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly.
John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and
onto the hood -- right INTO VIEW.
A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably
Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an
extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass.
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire
windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS
PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car.
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda
into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is
thrown from the car.
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.
ANGELA
He's down --
JOHN
He's not down.
Gimme your phone.
Angela pulls out her cellular.
A BRITISH COUPLE sit in the back of Chaz's taxi, staring
out at the seedy side of town as if it were "Wild
Kingdom."
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
BRITISH MAN
They mark their territory with
graffiti instead of urine but
they're still very much animals.
British woman takes documentary photos.
Chaz's CELLULAR RINGS over the BUZZ of a dispatch SCANNER.
CHAZ
This is a private line -- John?!
INTERCUT JOHN.
JOHN
Chaz -- where are you?!
CHAZ
Ah... 3rd and Figueroa.
JOHN
You still got that Sedrallus?
CHAZ
(glancing to couple)
Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right
now, John.
JOHN
Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save
my ass here!
CHAZ
(under his breath)
What else is new...
JOHN
Remember the Chalic of Enook
incident?
CHAZ
(remembering)
Oh no, no, no, not that, I just
paid off this car!
JOHN
West side of the 3rd Street
Bridge, say...
He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph.
JOHN
... 2 minutes.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
CHAZ
I'm five blocks away!
(as John CLICKS off)
John? John?! Ah... shit.
Chaz downshifts, stops in cloud of dust --
CHAZ
Sorry, tour's over.
The British start to argue.
CHAZ
OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!!
John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the
3rd Street Bridge on the horizon.
Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes.
ANGELA
He's back.
Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours --
ANGELA
John, he's back and he's gaining!
JOHN
Of course he's gaining.
John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor.
Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge.
He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the
glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a
glass vial out of it.
Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps
out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears
the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE.
Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched
roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it?
CHAZ
Shit -- shit -- shit --
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
Chaz twists off the gas cap, drops the vial into the tank.
He pulls out his BEEPER, rips the cover off, exposing the
electronics.
He wedges the beeper into the tank inlet, then starts
sprinting off the bridge while --
John smacks the wheel, victoriously -- looks over to
Angela who sighs with relief. His expression changes as
he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her
neck.
JOHN
Where's the amulet?
WHAM -- something reaches through the roof hole and JERKS
HER right out of the car.
JOHN
ANGELA!!
John SLAMS the BRAKES home -- car spins and John is
already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs
to the rail.
CHAZ
(running up)
What the hell was that?!
Both leap onto the concrete rail, lean over and spot a
HUGE WINGED SHADOW just as it disappears below the
bridge.
Chaz is speechless as he turns to John. This is too
much. John gives him the out he's been waiting for --
JOHN
We're even.
Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail.
He jumps back
in the BARRACUDA and PEELS OUT.
Chaz watches him race away, looks back at his burning
taxi.
CHAZ
Even?
Prisoner walks out of the terminal, here at last. He
stares at all the vehicles at his disposal. A family
crowds around the back of a minivan. Wife hugs the dad.

MYSTERIOUS POV
Watches him from behind.
Prisoner turns, looks back,
suspiciously. Nothing.
PRISONER
walks out to the street, slides into the minivan, tears
away. Kids' toys tumble across the seats.
moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky. Below
her the City of Angels sweep past. Her eyes drift open
and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality --
REFLECTION IN HER EYES
The city is ON FIRE. It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic
vision before she jumped.
MIDNITE (V.O.)
Listen to my voice inside...
MYSTERIOUS POV is ON the Prisoner at the exit doors.
He
looks back, suspiciously, and there's -
John.
Watching.
Prisoner turns, heads to the minivan.
of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a
large iron ENTRANCE GATE. Prisoner is running from it,
glances back --

CONTINUED:
John is there. Watches as the Prisoner enters the
abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he
miss this?
WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across
manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital.
The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing
on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The
abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency
entrance.
John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John
stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof.
MIDNITE
(sighs)
Figures.
Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings,
penduluming up in SLOW MOTION.
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But
this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing.
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close... so close...
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky.
SATAN (V.O.)
Time to go.

-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond.
Huge sun beats down on a lone FIGURE walking across a
stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth. He stops,
kneels to the heavily-cracked soil. Starts digging.
118.
JOHN pulls back the protective hood from his face.
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the Spear of Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at
it a long beat.
John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic. He stands, nods. Job done.
A breeze blows past and John senses being watched. He
spins and finds -- nothing. For a hundred miles. He
starts walking.
JOHN (V.O.)
Some people are born to make a
difference. I had to die. Twice.
MATCH CUT TO:

A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is driving. Angela gets in.
JOHN (V.O.)
God does work in mysterious ways.
119.
John continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed.
JOHN (V.O.)
Some people like it...
Our view RISES OVER him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the SHADOW of WINGS.
JOHN (V.O.)
Some people don't.
FADE OUT.
