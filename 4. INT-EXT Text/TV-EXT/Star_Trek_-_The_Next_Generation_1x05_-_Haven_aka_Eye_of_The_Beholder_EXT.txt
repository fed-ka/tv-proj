            Our destination, the Class M Beta 
            Cassius planet known simply as 
            Haven. It is a world... 


        The Enterprise eases into orbit.

            Captain's personal log. I trust 
            my concern over the problems of 
            ship's Counselor Troi are not 
            based merely on the fact of losing 
            a highly valuable crew member. 
            Actually...

            Captain's log, supplemental. It 
            has been believed the Tarellian 
            race was extinct, an assumption 
            contradicted now by the sight of 
            one of their vessels...

            Captain's log, supplemental. All 
            attempts at warning off the 
            Tarellian ship have failed. They 
            still refuse to communicate and 
            I am growing concerned.

        Tarellian ship is engulfed by the briefly appearing 
        BEAM. Then the alien vessel slows.

            Question: What strange 
            combination... 


        The Tarellian ship pulls away from Haven -- heading for 
        deep space. 


        The Enterprise heads out of orbit, then INTO WARP
