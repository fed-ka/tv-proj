      FADE IN:


      NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - MONTAGE - OVER RADIO11

      We see famous Nashville institutions: the Ryman Auditorium, 
      the tiny Springwater Saloon, the tall glass temples of the 
      music industry, the old stone Station Inn. Vista of the 
      church steeples dot the horizon. The full-scale replica of 
      the Parthenon, LP Field, the landmark neon sign of the 
      Loveless Caf . The Greek Revival State Capital buildings, 
      quaint Music Row publishing houses, the slow, green 
      Cumberland river rolling   downtown, shabby mobile homes, *
      stately Belle Meade mansions, Vanderbilt University, Prince's 
      Hot Chicken Shack, the humble Bluebird Cafe. From the highest 
      society to the lowliest hillbilly hangouts, Nashville has it 
      all.


      EXT. RAYNA S HOME - NIGHT22

      A warm glow from the windows of a beautiful home on a gated 
      two acre lot in the Brentwood section of Nashville. From 
      somewhere in the house, the SOUND OF THE TV turned up loud, 
      the Vandy/Alabama game.


      INT. RAYNA S HOME - NIGHT33

      Pandemonium as DAPHNE (8) runs laughing and squealing down a *
      hallway. Her mother, RAYNA JAYMES (40), in curlers and a *
      dressing gown, marches purposefully behind her. She is *
      halfway made-up but totally beautiful. She s in full mom 
      hollering voice. 

                                  RAYNA
                    Daphne! I mean it! Get in the bath *
                    right now! Mama s got to get to 
                    work! Teddy, I need a little help 
                    here. I can t be late.

      Rayna s handsome husband, TEDDY CONRAD (40 s) intervenes. His *
      daughter MADDIE (12) trails behind him.*

                                  TEDDY
                          (to Rayna)
                    I got it, babe.

                                  RAYNA
                    Thank you!

      Rayna splits off to her room. 

                                  TEDDY
                          (to Daphne)*
                    Because somebody s got to work in 
                    this family-- and I want you in 
                    that tub NOW!

      Maddie stops and turns to her dad.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   2.

                                    DAPHNE*
                    Why does she have to work? I 
                    thought we were rich. 

                                  TEDDY
                    We are, but now we re a different 
                    kind of rich called cash poor, and 
                    it s bad manners to talk about 
                    money. 


      INT. RAYNA S BEDROOM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT44

      Rayna is frantically pulling curlers out of her hair.

                                  TEDDY (O.C.)
                    I m counting! One, two...


      INT. GRAND OLE OPRY STAGE - NIGHT55

      Rayna is on stage with her band, glittering like a diamond in 
      full Country Music Queen regalia, belting out a country song, 
      thrilling the full house with her big, gorgeous voice.

                                  RAYNA
                          (singing)
                    IT S A LONG LONG ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE, 
                    BUT I M LEAVING YOU FOR TENNESSEE, 
                    I GOT DEMONS RIDING SHOTGUN TELLING 
                    ME NOT TO GO, BUT WHAT THEY DON T 
                    KNOW IS I M ALREADY GONE.

      Rayna s got a thousand-watt stage presence. DEACON CLAYBOURNE 
      (43), her strikingly handsome lead guitar player, can t take 
      his smiling eyes off of her. He s the guy that all the women 
      want to be with and all the men want to be. As he plays and 
      sings harmony, he smiles at Rayna. Their flirty rapport 
      charms the crowd. 

      The song ends to a standing ovation, and as the crowd roars--

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)
                    THANKS EVERYBODY! AND GOD BLESS 
                    WATTY WHITE!

      They leave the stage waving to the crowd. Deacon puts his 
      hand on Rayna s shoulder, and she covers his hand with hers 
      in a familiar, affectionate and intimate gesture. The 
      ANNOUNCER steps to the stage right podium.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    The reigning Queen of Country, 
                    Rayna Jaymes! Coming to you from *
                    Music City, USA, and WSM it s the 
                    GRAND OLE OPRY celebration of 
                    legendary producer and songwriter, 
                    Watty White! Stay tuned for 
                    Juliette Barnes, the Del McCoury 
                    Band, Brad Paisley and Lady

66INT. BACKSTAGE WINGS - GRAND OLE OPRY - NIGHT 

      The wing of the stage is crowded with friends, family and 
      fellow country music stars. Deacon whispers to Rayna--

                                  DEACON
                    Killed  em again.

      She walks into the arms of a smiling WATTY WHITE (70), 
      flowing white hair neatly swept back. They are dearest 
      friends.

                                  RAYNA
                    Watty, I love you. Who knows where 
                    I d be without you.

      Watty sings in a beautiful tenor--

                                  WATTY
                    JUST A BIRD IN A GILDED CAGE--

                                  RAYNA
                    Thanks for setting me free.

                                  WATTY
                    Ya done good, my little songbird.

      Before Deacon knows what s happened, he s being hugged by a 
      young woman, SCARLETT O'CONNOR (early 20 s).

                                  SCARLETT
                    Uncle Deacon! That was GREAT. Thank 
                    you so much for getting us in!

      Now that he knows who he s hugging, he gives a big hug back.

                                  DEACON
                    Hey, no problem. Rayna, c mere!

      Rayna turns as Deacon steers Scarlett to her. Rayna wears her 
      meet-and-greet smile.

                                  DEACON (CONT D)
                    You remember my niece, Scarlett.

      Rayna s eyes widen in surprise. She takes Scarlett s hands in 
      hers and looks her over.

                                  RAYNA
                    No way. Oh, my gosh, hello! This is 
                    not possible. Last time I saw you, 
                    you weren t even talking yet. 

      Scarlett is smiling, overwhelmed.

                                  DEACON
                    She s livin  here now. Working at 
                    the Bluebird.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   4.

                                  RAYNA
                    Wow! The Mecca.

                                  SCARLETT
                    I think someone pulled some strings.

      Deacon looks away, feigning innocence.

                                  RAYNA
                    Are you a songwriter?

                                  SCARLETT
                    Oh! Me? No! I mean, I write poems, 
                    but no. My boyfriend is, though.

      She turns to AVERY BARKLEY (23) to introduce him.*

                                  SCARLETT (CONT D)
                    This is Avery Barkley.*

      Avery, a dead sexy East Nashville hipster who patterns 
      himself after Kings of Leon, tries to play it cool, but even 
      he is a little nervous in the presence of the legend.

                                  AVERY
                    Pleased to make your acquaintance, 
                    Ma am.

                                  SCARLETT
                    Miss Jaymes, I promised myself I *
                    wouldn t do this, but I have to 
                    tell you that I have worshipped you 
                    since I was a little girl, and not 
                    just because of Uncle Deacon. I 
                    know every one of your songs by 
                    heart, and I love your voice and I 
                    just-- You re so GREAT!

      Rayna gives her a hug, truly charmed.

                                   RAYNA
                    Aren t you sweet? Now if you need 
                    anything you let me know. Ya, hear? 

      Rayna is looking at Deacon as she says--

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)

                    We re all family here.


      INT. JULIETTE S DRESSING ROOM DOOR- GRAND OLE OPRY- NIGHT77*

      We see the door to the  Honky Tonk Angels  room at the Opry.*        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   5.


      INT. JULIETTE S DRESSING ROOM - GRAND OLE OPRY- NIGHT88*

      A gorgeous, sequined, mini-skirted young country vixen, 
      Juliette is being touched up by her hair and make-up people, 
      while a wardrobe person kneels at her feet, strapping on some 
        ridiculously high heels. 

                                  ASSISTANT
                    -- the New York itinerary is coming 
                    together. Good Morning America and the 
                    Vogue shoot are locked in. And they re 
                    waiting for approval on the perfume.

      On a table, prototype perfume bottles are laid out. She 
      inspects them and picks one up and sprays it. She wrinkles 
      her nose.

                                  JULIETTE
                    What? That doesn t smell like 
                    anything. What the hell is wrong 
                    with those people?

      An ASSISTANT cautiously delivers the news--

                                  ASSISTANT 
                    They re just the prototypes. 
                    They re all filled with water.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I can t tell without smelling the 
                    perfume which one I m gonna--

      A RINGING CELL PHONE cuts her short. The assistant finds it 
      on the table. She answers it and suddenly looks stricken. She 
      covers the mouthpiece, mouths the words--

                                  ASSISTANT 
                    It s your mom.

      Now Juliette is the one who looks stricken. She s frozen for 
      a second. Then she reaches out for the phone--

                                  JULIETTE
                    Hello?

      We hear a woman s REEDY VOICE on the other end. 

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                          (interrupting)
                    Hello? Hellohellohello?--
                    There s no one there.

      The VOICE INTENSIFIES as she ends the call. Juliette holds 
      the phone like a live rat or an unpinned grenade.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    How d she get this number?

      No one knows, but they re all frozen in fearful submission.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   6.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    Oh. So she just got it out of thin 
                    air. Is that what I m supposed to 
                    believe? Isn t that part of your 
                    job, to make sure she doesn t have 
                    my number?

                                  ASSISTANT 
                    This is a new number. I just 
                    changed it.

      Juliette flings the phone into the trash can.

                                  JULIETTE
                    Well, change it again.

      A KNOCK at the door startles them. The door opens and 
      Juliette s manager, GLENN GOODMAN (late 40s) steps in.

                                  GLENN
                    It s time.

      He holds out his hand up to help her up.*


      INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - GRAND OLE OPRY- NIGHT99*

      Juliette steadies herself on Glenn s arm as she teeters down *
      the hall on four-inch heels.*

                                  GLENN
                    This is important. Be nice.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I m always nice.

      Glenn s eyebrow says otherwise.

                                  GLENN
                    Well--be extra nice.

                                  JULIETTE
                    And this benefits me how?

                                  GLENN
                    It s not for you. It s for the 
                    label. She s royalty. Just kiss the 
                    ring and tell her you re a big fan. 


      INT. BACKSTAGE GREEN ROOM - GRAND OLE OPRY - NIGHT1010*

      We see CU shots of backstage details as Rayna makes her way 
      through, shaking hands and smiling for pictures. 

      The FLASH from an iPhone releases her, and she turns to greet 
      a tall distinguished African-American man, COLEMAN CARLISLE  *
      (40s) and his wife ANITA. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   7.

                    Hey, Cole! Hello, Anita! I didn t 
                    know you were gonna be here! Can I 
                    hug the next Mayor of Nashville? 

                                  ANITA

      Rayna s eyes stop smiling, but not the rest of her.

                    Dad come hear Hillbilly music?

                                    COLEMAN
                    He doesn t know what he s missing.

                                  RAYNA
                    Yes he does.

      And she moves down the hall.*


      INT.- BACKSTAGE HALLWAY- GRAND OLE OPRY- NIGHT1111*

      A blazing Juliette makes her way down the crowded hallway, *
      still on Glenn s arm. She owns the place and greets everyone *
      with a super-friendly--

                                  JULIETTE
                    Hi, hon, how you doin ?

      -- as if she actually cared. Glenn plays it with cool aplomb.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   8.

      CONTINUED:1111

      ANOTHER ANGLE:*

      Deacon is talking to some of the members of the DEL McCOURY 
      BAND when Juliette spots him. She lets go of Glenn.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    Deacon Claybourne?

      Deacon s caught off guard for a second, and Juliette is 
      suddenly the star-struck teenager.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    Oh my gosh! I m sorry to interrupt! 
                    I just love your songs, and your 
                    playing.  I have your very first 
                    record on vinyl and I love it.

                                  DEACON
                    Yes, you can still find them in 
                    antique stores here and there. I m 
                    glad you liked it. That makes you 
                    and my mom. 

                                  JULIETTE
                    That one song,  Been and Gone  was 
                    the most beautiful-- Oh my gosh, 
                    I m so sorry-- I just think you re-- 
                    amazing! Nice to meet you! Sorry!

      And she s gone. Deacon turns back to the grinning McCoury s.

                                  DEACON
                    She probably says that to all the guys.

                                  RONNIE MCCOURY
                    She never said it to me.

      The merciless ribbing begins.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Juliette is back on Glenn s arm, continuing down the hall.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I hope I didn t make a fool of 
                    myself. I just love him so much.

                                  GLENN
                    He s the best there is.

                                  JULIETTE
                          (sharply)
                    Then why isn t he in my band?

                                  GLENN
                    He s been with Rayna for twenty-
                    something years, but hey, if you 
                    can get him--




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   9.

      CONTINUED: (2)1111

      Scarlett and Avery come around the corner and Avery bumps 
      smack into Juliette. Glenn catches her, but Avery has also 
      grabbed her to break her fall. 

                                  AVERY
                    Oh my God! I m so sorry!

      Juliette is pissed, until she gets a good look at Avery.

                                  JULIETTE
                    That s okay. We should try that 
                    again sometime, only slower.

      And gives him a wink over her shoulder as Glenn pulls her 
      away. Scarlett s jaw drops in disbelief. She whacks Avery on 
      the arm, like it s his fault.

      INT. RAYNA S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT1313*

      Rayna s Producer RANDY ROBERTS (40s), her manager BUCKY DAWES *
      (a boyish 50), and two guys from her record label, ZACH (35) 
      and STEVE (40s), speak in hushed tones. Watty is there too. 
      Rayna comes in and the guys freeze. Something s going on.

                                  RAYNA
                    What? Somebody die?

      No one wants to answer. It falls to her manager.

                                  BUCKY
                    Nothing we need to talk about now. 
                    Let s wait  til Monday. Hey, Watty. 
                    What a night, huh?

                                  RAYNA
                    Why? Talk about what?

      Before anyone can speak, the dressing room door opens again, 
      and Glenn ushers Juliette into the room, all sequins and legs.

                                  GLENN
                    Hi, folks, Rayna. I wanted to 
                    introduce you to Juliette Barnes. 
                    She s a big fan of yours.

      Juliette all but rolls her eyes at this and goes straight for 
      Watty, a major diss to Rayna. Watty clocks it.

                                  JULIETTE
                    Mr. White, it s such an honor for 
                    me to get to sing for you tonight. 

                                  WATTY
                    It wouldn t be if you knew me 
                    better. You met Rayna yet? 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   10.

      CONTINUED:1313

      Rayna smiles as they size each other up, but Juliette shows 
      none of the enthusiasm or reverence she showed Deacon. 

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh, I know who you are. You re 
                    burning it up out there, girl!

                                  JULIETTE
                    Oh... thank you. My mom was one of 
                    your biggest fans. She said she d 
                    listen to you when I was in her 
                    belly.

      Darting eye contact between the guys. They re not off to a 
      good start. Rayna doesn t blink, but there s now a faint 
      razor sharp edge in her tone.

                                  RAYNA
                    Well, bless your heart. What a 
                    charming story. You re going on in 
                    a minute. Don t you want to go find 
                    your pants?

      The guys cut it short and Glenn hauls Juliette out before she 
      can do more damage. Rayna looks at her team.

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)
                    What the hell was that?


      INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - GRAND OLE OPRY - NIGHT1414

      Long-suffering Glenn leads Juliette towards the stage door.

                                  GLENN
                    We ve obviously got some work to do 
                    on that  be nice  deal.

      A sly smile on Juliette s lips. She knows exactly what she s 
      doing.


      INT. RAYNA S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT1515

      The mood remains grim as the bad news is laid out to Rayna.

                                  BUCKY
                      Indianapolis. Three years ago we 
                    put 16,000 tickets on sale they 
                    were gone in an hour. Now same 
                    venue we ve sold 2800. Austin, same 
                    thing.  We re at barely a third of 
                    where we d hoped to be by now. 

      Rayna is distressed.

                                  RAYNA
                    So what does this mean? I mean, I 
                    did all that radio and press--




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   11.

                                  RANDY
                    We talked about this. There wasn t 
                    a strong single. I brought you 
                    three songs I was sure could chart 
                    and you nixed all three. We came on *
                    the charts at twenty and we re *
                    falling.*

                                  RAYNA
                    Well, I don t wanna just stand here *
                    and go down in flames. What s the 
                    plan, guys?

      Nobody wants to say. It falls to Bucky. He begins carefully.

                                  BUCKY
                    Well, one idea is that you combine 
                    tours. With Juliette Barnes. You 
                    can co-headline. You d save several  
                    hundred thousand in production 
                    costs--

                                  RAYNA
                      Co-headline? You re kidding, right?

      They re not. 

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)
                    That s why you brought her in here? 
                    Was there a turnip truck that drove 
                    through here you think I fell off 
                    of?

                                  STEVE
                    Miss Jaymes, it would introduce you *
                    to a whole new generation of fans --

                                  RAYNA
                    The one that doesn t buy records? 

                                  STEVE 
                    They buy Juliette s records. She s 
                    the number one crossover artist in 
                    the--

                          (interrupting)
                    Who goes on first?

      No one says anything. This is an unprecedented proposal. 

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)
                    You re not seriously suggesting 
                    that I become Juliette Barnes  
                    opening act? For that half-talent 
                    little snipe? No. No way.

      The guys look at Bucky. It s his job to break the news.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   12.

                    I know you don t want to play in 
                    half empty venues and that s what 
                    we re looking at. If you don t cut 
                    down production costs, you re going 
                    to lose money. A lot of money. We d 
                    be better off cancelling the tour. 

      Now Rayna is the one who s silent.

                                  STEVE
                    Miss Jaymes, you are very, very *
                    important to Pinnacle Republic 
                    records. We believe putting our two 
                    most important artists together is 
                      a historic event and a way to solve 
                    a very big problem for you. You can 
                    hop onto a tour that s sold out 
                    every arena and most stadiums from 
                    New York to L.A., or you re gonna 
                    be facing a pretty tough decision. 
                    It s a no-brainer really--

                    Of course it is. Who s the genius

                                  STEVE
                    Marshall Evans. The new head of the 
                    label.

      This is not good news and she s obviously shaken.

                          (to label guys)
                    Um, okay guys, could I have a

                    Miss Jaymes, Marshall would like to *
                    know your decision by Monday.

      They go. Bucky, Randy and Watty stay. Rayna collects herself.

                    I have one record that doesn t

      Rayna is stoic, but she s in pain.

      INT. GRAND OLE OPRY STAGE - NIGHT1616

      Juliette prances charmingly across the stage in her spangled 
      mini-dress. The young people in the audience are now at the 
      foot of the stage singing, clapping and dancing with her.

      INT. RAYNA S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT1717

      Rayna s alone now. Sad, angry, confused. She watches

      Rayna picks up the remote and points it like a gun at the 
      monitor.

                    Oh shut up.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                        ACT II


      EXT. CITY HALL - DAY1818

      A CHAUFFEUR opens the door to a black SUV in front of  where 
      two black-suited SECURITY GUARDS and an EVENT GIRL wait. 
      Rayna, late, runs quickly up the steps.

                                  MAYOR (V.O.)
                    In my two terms as Mayor, Lamar 
                    Wyatt has been more than a friend 
                    and a captain of industry-- he has 
                    been a titan of philanthropy. The 
                    countless charitable causes, the 
                    cultural and intellectual 
                      enrichment brought to Nashville 
                    through his benefaction to our 
                    Symphony and to our many great 
                      Universities-- has been monumental.


      INT. CITY HALL - DAY1919

      A full gallery listens as the Mayor at the podium continues 
      his remarks. The recipient, a beaming LAMAR WYATT (late 60s), 
      sits in the front row, with his CRONIES. To his right sits 
      his oldest daughter, the handsome and regal TANDY WYATT (42). 
      To Lamar s left, an empty seat.

                                  LAMAR
                          (whispering to Tandy)
                    Where the hell is she?

                                  TANDY
                    She should be here any minute. 

      A murmur rises as Rayna hurries into the room, security in 
      tow. The Mayor sees Rayna making her way through the room.

                                  MAYOR
                    --and of course we can t forget 
                    Lamar s priceless contribution to 
                    country music by way of his 
                    daughter, the great Rayna Jaymes! *

      Rayna smiles and gives an embarrassed wave as she takes her 
      seat. Her father rises, a brief kiss on the cheek and they 
      sit. It s tense and icy. 

      As the mayor continues--

                                  LAMAR
                      Unbelievable. On a day like today.

                                  TANDY
                    She s here now, Daddy. Let it go.

                                  RAYNA
                    I showed up. More than you can say.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   15.

      CONTINUED:1919

                                  LAMAR
                    I ask for so little.

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh, for God s sake.

                                  MAYOR
                    By unanimous vote of the Nashville 
                      Metropolitan  City Council it is my 
                    honor to proclaim this Lamar Wyatt 
                    Day!

      The room rises to a standing ovation. As a smiling Lamar 
      stands, he hisses to Rayna--

                                  LAMAR
                    Try to look happy, dear.

      Lamar glad-hands his way to the podium where he s presented 
      with a framed certificate and the Key to the City. 


      LATER - ANOTHER ANGLE2020

      Lamar and the Mayor stand together as they are photographed 
      holding the award. Lamar smiles and whispers to the Mayor--

                                  LAMAR 
                    Two terms, five million dollars in 
                    campaign contributions, and all I 
                    got was this lousy certificate.

                                  MAYOR
                    It s overdue. And I can t thank you 
                    enough for your invaluable support. 

                                  LAMAR
                    Oh, you didn t thank me enough. I 
                    asked for only one thing, one lousy 
                    permit. You got something against 
                    bringing major league baseball to 
                      Nashville? 

      The mayor waves the photographers off and aides clear the 
      area, giving the two men their space.

                                  MAYOR
                    You know that s not the case, 
                    Lamar. You know that particular 
                    piece of land--

                                  LAMAR
                    What I know is that I have a billion 
                    dollar property that s been rendered 
                    worthless because you wouldn t push 
                    one permit through for me. 

      From the outside, this exchange looks like two old friends.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   16.

      CONTINUED:2020

                                  MAYOR
                    That permit falls under the purview 
                    of the Director of Public Works--

                                  LAMAR
                    A mayoral appointee whom you could 
                    have replaced at any time. And yet 
                    you chose not to, a decision I will 
                    see to it you regret as you return 
                    to life in the private sector.

      The blood has drained from the Mayor s face.

                                  MAYOR
                    Well. I wish you better luck with 
                    my successor.

      He nods in the direction of Coleman Carlisle who s being *
        photographed with Rayna and Tandy.*

                                  LAMAR
                    Hell, he s even more of a tree 
                    hugger than you are.


      EXT.  CITY HALL - DAY2121

      The event is over and Tandy walks Rayna to her waiting car.

                                  TANDY
                    Thank you for coming. He won t say 
                    it, but it means a lot to him.

                                  RAYNA
                    You know I didn t come for him. I 
                    came for you.

                                  TANDY
                    Well, then, it means a lot to me. 
                    But still I m sorry I had to ask. I 
                    tried to talk him out of it, but 
                    you know how it is with him. You 
                    win one, you lose ten.

                                  RAYNA
                    Funny thing about Daddy. He s 
                    always there when he needs me. 
                    Don t ask me again for a while, 
                    okay? I ve got enough problems.


      INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY2222

      Through the glass into the studio we see Juliette singing. 

                                  JULIETTE (O.S.)
                    BOYS AND BUSES GOT A LOT IN COMMON,

      CONTINUED:2222

      Randy Roberts sits and watches. Juliette s manager, Glenn, 
      sits on a sofa, reading Billboard. The ENGINEER lowers the 
      tracks except for Juliette s voice. It s out of tune. 

                                  RANDY
                    Don t worry. We can fix that.

      Without looking up from the magazine--

                                  GLENN
                    Thank God for auto-tune.

      Juliette sees Randy watching and gets flirty. Randy smiles.

                                  RANDY
                          (re: Juliette)
                      Heartbreaker.

      From the sofa--

                                  GLENN
                    Money maker.

                                  RANDY
                    Maybe I ought to marry her.

                                  GLENN
                    Take the money and run.

      Off Randy looking at Juliette--

                    I am sick to death of talking about 
                    money.


      INT. LOVELESS CAFE - DAY2424

      Rayna and Bucky at a table deep in conversation, looking over 
      budgets, oblivious to the turned heads of the other patrons. 

                                  BUCKY
                    You d be more sick to death of not 
                    having any. Look if you cancel this 
                    tour you re burning bridges with 
                    the promoters and radio, too. If 
                    you think the record is stiffing 
                    now, just wait till you piss those 
                    guys off. 

      A woman holding the hand of a six-year old girl approaches 
      the table, stopping Bucky. 

                                  WOMAN

                    my daughter?

      Rayna acts like she s been waiting all day for this. 

                                  RAYNA
                    You sure can. What s your name,

                    Well, you re sure pretty enough.

      Rayna puts her arm around the little girl and smiles.

                    I love your new record. But I ve

      The woman can t believe her luck. Bucky shoots, looks at it.

                      Beautiful. Y all have a good day.

      He hands the camera to the woman, who is overwhelmed.

                                  WOMAN
                    Thank you. Thank you so much.

      Rayna checks the rear view mirror. Both girls are silent, 
      staring out their respective windows. She turns the radio on.  
      Juliette Barnes  MEAN GIRL is playing. The girls perk up.

      Rayna turns it up and endures as long as she can, four more

                    Once the room s full it won t sound 
                    so bright.

                                  JESSIE
                          (wryly)
                    How about if the room s half full?

                                  SCARLETT
                    It s sold out. Y all are great. 
                    Gunnar, tell  em.

                                  GUNNAR
                    You guys should be playing bigger 
                    venues.

                                  JESSIE
                          (to Gunnar)
                    So should you. As long as we re 
                    handing out compliments.

                                  SCARLETT
                    I told him the same thing. He s 
                    great.

                                  GUNNAR
                    My time ll come.

      The door opens flooding the room with sunlight. In sails 
      Avery, happily waving a CD. Gunnar deflates a little.

                                  AVERY
                    Looky what I got-- fourteen songs. 
                    Hot off the pro-tools.

                                  SCARLETT
                    It s done? Are you happy with it? 
                    I m so proud of you. 

                                  AVERY
                    Maybe if you like it, you ll give 
                    it to your Uncle Deacon.

                                  SCARLETT
                    Maybe? You know I ll love it.

                                  JESSIE
                    Deacon Claybourne? Are you kidding? 
                    That s your uncle?

      Scarlett nods.

                                  AVERY
                    I think I deserve a beer. It s five 
                    o clock somewhere.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   21.

                                  AVERY
                    So it is.

      Avery takes a seat at the bar and grabs a beer. Scarlett goes 
      to the bar, and leans against him. Gunnar arranges mic stands.

                                  SCARLETT
                          (to Gunnar)
                    Gunnar, can we play Avery s demo?

                                  GUNNAR
                          (a little too fast)
                    Can we not-- right now? I need to 
                    give my ears a break for awhile. 

      Scarlett makes a frowny face at Avery.

                                  AVERY
                    You don t know what you re missing.

      As Avery kisses Scarlett, Gunnar s expression says, in fact 
      he does know, on several counts.


      INT. RAYNA S BEDROOM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT2727

      Rayna sits at her dressing table. She inspects her face for 
      wrinkles, seeing if a face lift might help. Teddy enters. 

                                  TEDDY
                    Don t do that. You re beautiful and 
                    if you ever get a face lift I ll 
                    leave you.

      Rayna puts her head in her hands.

                                  TEDDY (CONT D)
                    I was kidding.

      Teddy realizes Rayna is crying.

                                  TEDDY (CONT D)
                    Babe, are you crying? What s wrong?

                                  RAYNA
                      Everything. The record s a stiff, 
                    the tour isn t selling. They want 
                    me to open for Juliette Barnes.

                                  TEDDY
                    Who does?

                                  RAYNA
                    The label. Marshall Evans.

                                  TEDDY
                    Open for her? Are you sure?

                       Co-headline  they called it. 

                                  TEDDY
                    Well, now. Let s think about this. 
                    Is it really such a terrible idea?

                                  RAYNA
                    Teddy! Yes, it s terrible idea. I d 
                    have to lie and pretend like I like 
                    her music. 

                                  TEDDY
                    You ve lied for a lot worse than 
                    her. That s not the reason.

                                  RAYNA
                    I might have to cancel the tour. 
                    I have till Monday to make a 
                    decision. I m set to lose a bundle 
                    if I don t. I ve been over every 
                    detail with Bucky.

      Teddy proceeds with caution.

                                  TEDDY
                    You know, you don t have to put 
                    yourself through this. You could 
                    quit and just walk away--

                                  RAYNA
                    Not if you like living in this 
                    house I can t.  

                                  TEDDY
                    Rayna, look, I know I ve let you 
                    down and I m sorry as hell about 
                    it. I m not the first guy to go 
                    bust and I m working on some deals 
                    that ll put us in better shape. But 
                    in the meantime, there s a trust 
                    fund just sitting there doing 
                    nothing but racking up interest. 
                    You could do whatever you wanted--

                                  RAYNA
                    No. I promised myself I would never 
                    put myself in a position to rely on 
                    him or his money. And that isn t going 
                    to change. I ll wait tables first.

                                  TEDDY
                    But you won t share a bill with the 
                    hottest act in Country music. 
                      Interesting logic.

                                  RAYNA
                    Just look at Tandy. She s practically

                                  RAYNA
                    That s not the point. The point is--

                                  TEDDY
                    The point is she s never gonna have to

                    still is. Mine was a drunk. But it

                    Please, Teddy, you think you know

                    Me, too. But that s how it is. 
                    We re just gonna have to figure out 
                    something else.

                    A BLANKET OF STARS...

      Scarlett gingerly makes her way through the sold out room, 
      delivering drinks, picking up empties.  Gunnar mans the sound 
      board. Scarlett catches his eye. He mouths the word  WOW  and 
      she smiles. Avery sits at the bar, Jessie next to Avery, 
      mesmerized. In a darkened corner sits a funky/chic, dressed-
      down Juliette. Her posse gives her good cover. She quickly 
      wipes a tear.

                    ALL THAT I HAVE TO DO IS THINK ONE LITTLE 
                    THOUGHT OF YOU AND I M BACK HOME...

      The song ends to huge APPLAUSE. Deacon smiles.

                                  DEACON (CONT D)
                    Thank you. 

      VINCE GILL next up in the circle, tunes his guitar, while he, 
      PAM TILLIS, FRED SCHUYLER and GABE WITCHER, ad lib about 
      Deacon. The audience laughs along with Deacon. Still tuning.


      INT. BLUEBIRD CAFE - NIGHT - LATER3131

      The room is mostly empty. Deacon and Scarlett catch up.

                                  DEACON
                    She can stay at my place for

                    She s my sister. She s still weird.

      Avery appears.

                    Hey, Deacon, did you get my demo?

                                  AVERY
                    Kind of alt/country/punk, but more *
                      cerebral.*

                                  DEACON
                    You know, around here punk is code 
                    for not being able to play at all.

      Avery ribs him right back.

                                  AVERY
                    You need to hear what the kids are 
                    playing these days, old timer.

                                  DEACON
                    Alright, alright, I promise not to 
                    use it as a coaster. In the 
                    meantime, you keep working on being 
                    good enough for my favorite niece.

      Gunnar brings Deacon his guitar case. Avery follows Scarlett 
      back to the bar.

                                  GUNNAR
                    That was a great show. A couple of 
                    those songs I d never heard. 

                                  DEACON
                    It won t be too long before you re 
                    sittin  in that circle. Heard a 
                    couple of your demos. You re 
                    sounding good, boy. Real good.

        A compliment from Deacon is as good as it gets. 

                                  GUNNAR
                    That s-- thank you.

      Deacon looks at Avery, getting cozy with Scarlett.

                                  DEACON
                    What do you think of that guy?

                                  GUNNAR
                    I guess I m just naturally 
                      suspicious of anyone that 
                      confident.

                                  DEACON
                    Keep an eye on her for me, will ya?

      Gunnar, with a smile, as charming as can be --

                                  GUNNAR
                    Kind of hard to take my eyes off 
                    her.

      Deacon claps him on the shoulder.

      Deacon takes his guitar case and heads out the door.


      EXT. BLUEBIRD CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT3232

      Deacon opens the car door and puts his guitar on the back 
      seat. When he turns back around, Juliette is standing there.

                                  DEACON
                    Well! Hello.

      Juliette s posse waits outside her Escalade on the other side 
      of the parking lot.

                                  JULIETTE
                    That last song you did. Has that 
                    ever been recorded?

      She stands close to Deacon, gazing up at him.

                                  DEACON
                    Only by me, so that pretty much 
                    damns it to obscurity.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I want to record it. 

                                  DEACON
                    You do.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I do. This week. Will you come play 
                    on it?

      Deacon is a little unnerved by this show of attention. 

                                  DEACON
                    Well, I could, depending. I m 
                      rehearsing with Rayna all week.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I heard that tour might be off.

                                  DEACON
                    What? No. Not to my knowledge. I

                                  JULIETTE
                    Maybe I m wrong then.

      Now she s just smiling at him. He s a little at a loss.

      EXT. PROJECT SITE - DAY3333

      The early morning sun rises over Nashville.

      In a wide open, overgrown expanse of land, Lamar, Tandy, 
      HENRY, ALBERT and DENNIS stand in the stiff breeze. *

                                  HENRY 
                    One civil servant making twenty 
                    grand a year can deny a permit and 
                    hold up a billion dollar ballpark. 

                                  TANDY
                    It s not gonna get any better when 
                    Coleman Carlisle s the mayor.*

                                  LAMAR
                    Then I ll run my own candidate. I m 
                    done throwing good money after bad.

      Everyone looks at Lamar. Is he serious? He is.

                                  TANDY
                    It s not an idea without merit. If 
                    we found someone business friendly, 
                    who fits nicely in your pocket--

                                    DENNIS*
                    How  bout Michael McDaniel? He s 
                    already on Metro Council and ready 
                    to move up.

                                  LAMAR
                    Teddy Conrad.

      Tandy shoots a look to Lamar. Bad idea.

                                  HENRY
                      Son-in-law Teddy?

                    Let s stay within the realm of 
                      possibility.

                                  LAMAR
                    I just put it in the realm of 
                      possibility. Albert, what about it?

                                  ALBERT
                    Well, maybe we say-- it skipped a 
                      generation. Ted, Sr. was a rake, 
                    but Teddy got it together. I mean, 
                    after he blew through his trust 
                    fund.  But his grandfather was 
                    mayor, then congressman. Great 
                      grandfather was a judge and a four-
                    term senator. He s smart, great 
                    people skills and photogenic as 
                    hell.

                    sketchy if he pushes a deal through 
                    for his father-in-law?

                    a wife sure as hell doesn t hurt.

      They all check each other, then Lamar.  Tandy s look to Lamar 
      is unequivocal. It s a bad idea.

                                  LAMAR
                    Run it up the flagpole.

      They head to the waiting cars, Lamar quietly asks Tandy--

                    How bad do you expect Rayna s gonna

                    She s gonna lose it. She s going to 
                      absolutely lose it.


      INT. REHEARSAL STAGE - DAY3434

                                  BUCKY
                    Now. There s a meeting Monday 
                    morning. Marshall Evans. He s going 
                    to want to know your decision.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   32.

      Rayna nods, but obviously doesn t want to talk about it. She 
      catches Deacon s eye and heads toward the door.

                                  RAYNA
                    Deacon! Wait. You gotta second? 

                                  DEACON
                    For you I do.

                                  BUCKY
                    And... meeting s over.


      EXT. CUMBERLAND RIVERWALK - DAY3535

      Rayna has told Deacon everything. Almost.

                                  RAYNA
                    I mean, I feel like I m in my prime. I 
                    don t think I ve ever sounded better. 
                    But the way they say  forty  makes it 
                    sound like I should be in a 
                      wheelchair. If I m such an old hag, 
                    then why would I open for Juliette 
                    Barnes? What is she, fifteen? 

                                  DEACON
                    Nineteen. And don t talk crazy.

                                  RAYNA
                    Am I crazy? Do you understand why I 
                    can t do it? 

                                  DEACON
                    I do. 
                          (beat)
                    We ve been doin  this for twenty-
                    one years. Can you believe that?

      This makes her laugh.

                                  RAYNA
                    No. That s absolutely impossible. 

                                  DEACON
                    You ve been sayin  for a while you 
                    don t want to do as many dates now 
                    that the girls are in school--

                                  RAYNA
                    Yeah, but I want it to be my 
                    choice.

                                  DEACON
                    You can leave any way you want and 
                    come back anytime you want. You re 
                    not some overnight sensation. 
                    Although you are sensational 
                      overnight, to the best of my 
                      recollection.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   33.

      She smiles, but isn t going there.

                                  RAYNA
                    I m just not ready to hang up the 
                      rhinestones. And all the guys and 
                    the crew, they ve planned their 
                    whole year around the tour. I can t 
                    leave everybody hanging. Especially 
                    not you.

      Deacon realizes that he has to tell her, now.

                                  DEACON
                    In that vein, here s something kind 
                    of strange that happened. Juliette 
                    Barnes asked me if I wanted a job.

                                  RAYNA
                    She asked you? As what? 

                                  DEACON
                    Lead guitar. Band leader. Her guy 
                    is leaving in a few weeks.

      Rayna looks like she s been punched in the stomach.

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh. What did you say?

                                  DEACON
                    Nothing. I mean, I m not available 
                    until otherwise notified.

                                  RAYNA
                    Randy s doing her record, she wants 
                    you in her band, what, is she 
                    comin  for my house next?

                                  DEACON
                    She wants to write with me.

                                  RAYNA
                    Wow. She went straight for your 
                    soft spot.

      He acknowledges that it s his weakness.

                                  DEACON
                    I ve always wondered why you never 
                    cut more of my songs.

                                  RAYNA
                    I don t know. Felt weird, like they 
                    were all about me.

                                  DEACON
                    They are. I guess. 

      Rayna nods. He knows this is pure pain for her. She is far 
      away.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   34.

                      Sometimes, I wish I could go back 
                    and do the whole thing over again.

                                  DEACON
                    What would you change?

                                  RAYNA
                      Everything. I d do it all 
                      different.

                                  DEACON
                    That makes two of us.

      A moment. They want to kiss each other but don t.

                                  RAYNA
                    I need a drink. Walk with me to Tootsies?

                                  DEACON
                    Ha, can t. Got a meeting.

      Really? Then she gets it.

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh, that kind of a meeting. Ever 
                    miss the wild old days?

                                  DEACON
                    Everyday. Except the headaches. I 
                    don t miss the headaches.

      She smiles.

                                  RAYNA
                    You were the headache. I d never 
                    stand in your way, you know. I want 
                    you to be happy.

                                  DEACON
                    Babe, you know good and well 
                    there s only one thing that could 
                    have made me happy and I lost that 
                    a long time ago.

      Not much to say after that.

                    Look Rayna, labels are irrelevant 
                    now. You gotta figure your next 
                    move. Reinvent yourself. You used

                    Who is it?

      The door opens. Randy stands there, not knowing what to do. 
      She looks at him, tear-stained face, like a little girl. She 
      pulls him into the closet by his shirt, violently, kissing 
      him, tearing at his clothes. This is how she kills the pain.

                    Do you understand what you re being 
                    offered? This isn t an honorary 
                    position in some backwater hamlet. 
                    This is a thriving, prosperous 
                    city, an industrial and cultural 
                      juggernaut. We re asking you to 
                    take a seat in the most powerful 
                    office in the city. Do you 
                      understand the kind of power you ll 
                    have and where that can lead?

                    I see something in you, Teddy. 
                    Something you may not be able to 
                    see in yourself right now. Or I 
                    wouldn t be wasting my valuable 
                    time. The afflictions your father 
                    suffered have blessedly not been 
                    visited on you. It s on you to 
                      rehabilitate the good name of your 
                    family. We are handing you your 
                    life on a silver platter. Is there 
                    some compelling reason that you 
                    can t run, some dark secret that 
                    will further damage the integrity 
                    of your family?

                    I d like to not have my ass handed

      It s frank and Lamar is impressed by his candor.

                      I guarantee that will not be the

      Everyone looks to Lamar to answer that one. Is Teddy really

      This strikes a chord and Teddy gets mad.

      It s after hours. Scarlett and Gunnar are alone in the club. 
      He reads from the spiral notebook, clearly enjoying himself.

                                  GUNNAR
                    These are songs. Are they about 
                    someone in particular?

                                  SCARLETT
                    They re poems. Avery and I broke up 
                    for awhile. I guess nothing calls 
                    the muses more than a broken heart. 
                    Great for weight loss, too.

                                  GUNNAR
                    Hmm. Truth be told, other than 
                      heartbreak and drunken sex, I m not 
                    one hundred percent sure what you 
                    see in him.

                    Isn t that enough?

                    For awhile maybe, but a whole life?

                                  SCARLETT
                    He s an artist. It s just one of 
                    those things. I ve tried being 
                    without him. I can t. He s just -- 
                    the one. I m hopeless.

                                  GUNNAR
                    I don t believe in that. The one. 
                    There s always another one.

                                  SCARLETT*
                    Hmm. Sounds like you ve had a 
                    little heartbreak of your own.

      Their eyes meet. A moment between them. He changes the

                                  GUNNAR
                    These poems are good. Have you 
                    thought about putting them to 
                    music?

                                  SCARLETT
                    I mean, sometimes I hear music when 
                    I m writing, but they re just--

      She reaches to take the notebook back. He playfully keeps it.

                    you know, I d play when I was

                    I know you re new here, but 
                    Pinnacle Republic Records has been 
                    my home since my first album came 
                    out and went triple platinum. I ve 
                    given this label nine Grammys and 
                    eleven CMAs. When I signed, it was 
                    in a little run down house on Music 
                    Row, so you could say I built this 
                    company.

                    I wish the new record was performing 
                    better. Unfortunately, the older 
                    business models are irrelevant. We 
                    believe that you and Juliette together 
                    will be a huge event.

                    label tried to woo me away and now 
                    all I m asking for is support for a

                    You re going to have to find your 
                    place in a new market. I know 
                    that s not what you want to hear.

                    the cut as one of my back-up 
                    singers, you won t support me?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Those are your words, but still, I 
                    need to know your decision.

      She stares unflinchingly into his eyes for a moment.

                    walks out the door.

      She turns and leaves. Bucky wordlessly follows her out.

      EXT. LAMAR S HOUSE - DAY4949

      Rayna s car in the huge driveway.


      INT. LAMAR S DINING ROOM - DAY5050

      Rayna fumes while Lamar sips his soup. Tandy referees.

                                  LAMAR
                    I know you can t conceive of me 
                    actually helping a member of my own 
                    family, and you will continue to 
                    punish me for my dereliction of 
                    paternal duties  til I m six feet 
                    under, but I think you re being 
                    unduly harsh--

                                  RAYNA
                          (interrupting)
                    Save the speeches, Daddy. All I 
                    want to know is, what exactly is it 
                    you want Teddy to do for you?

                                  LAMAR
                    I want him to pick himself up, dust 
                    himself off, and get back in the game. 

                                  TANDY
                    This could be good for you and the 
                    girls or I wouldn t support it. It 
                    could restore Teddy s confidence 
                    and his standing in the community.

                                  RAYNA
                    Stop! Tandy, please.
                          (she sits next to Lamar)
                    Did you offer him money? We won t 
                    accept that. I won t accept that.

                                  LAMAR
                    Oh, I know. You re too proud to 
                    accept anything from me. You prefer 
                    to delude yourself into thinking 
                    your success was all your own 
                    doing, that I had no hand in it 
                      whatsoever. Every dime you ever 
                    earned is because of me.

                                  RAYNA
                    What are you talking about?

                                  LAMAR
                    Who do you think paid for your 
                    first album? That pissant little 
                    record label?. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   45.

      CONTINUED:5050

      Rayna isn t sure if Lamar s telling the truth about the 
      label, but it has knocked her back on her heels.

                                  LAMAR (CONT D)
                    I want you there by his side 
                    tonight. How would it look if 
                    you re not there for your own 
                    husband? I can t believe you would 
                    further humiliate him after all 
                    he s done for you. Especially as it 
                    relates to Maddie. Imagine how he 
                    would feel if he knew--

      Rayna s eyes go wide. Tandy intervenes. 

                                  TANDY
                    Daddy-- that s enough!

      He drops that point. Tandy grabs Rayna s hands and yanks her 
      up out of the chair. Rayna s been worked over pretty good. 

                                  RAYNA
                            (punchdrunk)
                    I m not for sale, Dad. Not for sale.
                          (to Tandy)
                    I m not doing it. I won t be there.

                                  TANDY
                    I know.

                                  LAMAR
                    Your absence will not go unnoticed, I can 
                    assure you of that. 

                                  TANDY
                    Stop it! You don t need to threaten her.

      As Tandy pulls her out of the room, Lamar continues--

                                  LAMAR
                    It s alright if you see me as your enemy. 


      EXT. RAYNA'S CAR - SUNSET5151

      Rayna sits in her car, high on a hill overlooking Nashville. 
      Storm clouds are piled over the city. Lamar's words continue--

                                  LAMAR (V.O.)
                    But don t be foolish enough to make 
                    that a two way street. My enemies 
                    do not fare well--

      A crack of lightning. Rain begins to pound the windshield.      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   46.


      INT. BLUEBIRD CAFE - NIGHT5252

      Rain falls against the window of the Bluebird on Open Mic 
      Night. Scarlett waits on a few brave souls. On stage, a very 
      drunk Avery is beating the hell out of a vintage guitar.  

                                  AVERY
                          (singing)
                    I AM THE KEEPER OF THIS BOREDOM
                    I AM THE BATTLE-SCARRED PINATA
                    I AM THE SON OF YIP THE KNIGHT OF YEE
                    AND THE KING OF HA. 

      The small audience is underwhelmed, and the lukewarm 
      reception pisses Avery off. He stumbles off the stage. 

                                  SCARLETT
                    Babe, that was so good!

      He puts his guitar in the case. She goes to put her arms 
      around him and he pushes her away.

                                  AVERY
                    Thanks for the great advice. This 
                    place sucks. 

      He heads out into the rainy night. Gunnar watches. He 
      looks over to Scarlett, who is hurt and embarrassed.


      EXT. JULIETTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT5353

      The rain continues. A security guard waves Randy Roberts 
      through the gates to Juliette's starter mansion. 


      INT. BLUEBIRD CAFE  - NIGHT5454

      The audience is even thinner. The MC picks up the clipboard, 
      flips it to the next page. Blank.

                                  MC
                    Anybody else want to go?

      Gunnar watches Scarlett, picking up empties.

                                  GUNNAR
                    Scarlett O Connor. Sing one.

      Shocked, she freezes. The audience claps and whistles. 

                                  SCARLETT
                    Unh-unh. No way.

                                  GUNNAR
                    She s good! Don t let her say no!

      Her resistance spurs them on. They pound on the tables. As 
      she acquiesces, she looks at a smiling Gunnar--



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   47.

                                  SCARLETT
                    I m gonna kill you!

                                  GUNNAR
                    I won t throw you out there alone. 
                    Let s do that one we worked on.

      Gunnar sets up a mic stand. Scarlett nervously adjusts it.

                                  SCARLETT
                    I ve never sung into a mic. Forgive 
                    me Lord, I know not what I do.

      The door opens and a drenched Watty White comes in, shaking 
      off the rain. Scarlett realizes she can't wait on him.

                                  SCARLETT (CONT D)
                    Mr. White, I m sorry. They re 
                    making me sing. But if you tell me 
                    your order I ll bring it quick.

      The audience is charmed by her and so is Gunnar.

                                  WATTY
                    I can make it for a few scarce minutes 
                    without a drink. Contrary to popular 
                    opinion.

                                  SCARLETT
                    Okaaay. This is gonna be 
                      interesting. This is a poem I wrote 
                    and Gunnar helped me put it to 
                    music. So if it sucks, blame him.

      Gunnar begins to play and Scarlett sings. She really sings.

                                  SCARLETT (CONT D)
                          (singing)
                    IF I DIDN T KNOW BETTER, I D HANG MY HAT 
                    RIGHT THERE, IF I DIDN T KNOW BETTER, I D 
                    FOLLOW YOU UP THE STAIRS

      It only takes a moment for everyone to realize that the magic 
      for which the Bluebird has become legend is taking place. Watty 
      White knows instantly, too. Gunnar sings harmony, and the 
      feeling is electric. It's not just the singing, it's the song. 

      THIS SONG PLAYS OVER THE REMAINING SCENES--

                                  SCARLETT & GUNNAR (V.O.)
                    WHY DO I KEEP DRINKING, WASTING MY 
                    TIME ON YOU? IF I DIDN T KNOW 
                    BETTER, BUT DAMN IT, I DO.


      EXT./INT. JULIETTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT5555

      The door opens. Juliette is surprised to see him.

      She closes the door in his face.


      INT. JULIETTE S HOUSE - NIGHT5656

      She walks into the living room where Deacon sits with his 
      guitar and some papers. She stands in front of him, takes the 
      neck of the guitar from Deacon s hands and puts it aside. She 
      climbs onto his lap, straddling him, and begins kissing his 
      face. His hands stay at his side, but he lets her go on.


      INT. HOTEL BALLROOM STAGE WINGS - NIGHT5757

      A huge COLEMAN CARLISLE FOR MAYOR banner hangs. Rayna s *
      band s equipment is set-up on stage. The room is packed. 
      Backstage Coleman reviews his speech with a few aides. 
      Another aide whispers something in his ear. He nods.


      INT. PARKED CAR - NIGHT5858

      Avery sits in the driver s seat as rain falls on the 
      windshield. The car door opens and a woman gets in-- Jessie, 
      the fiddle player from the Bluebird.

                                  JESSIE
                    I thought you d never call.

      He leans in, kisses her-- she resists not at all, not ever.

      Scarlett and Gunnar are lost in the song. And each other.

      INT. SYMPHONY HALL LOBBY - NIGHT6060

      The room is packed and TEDDY CONRAD FOR MAYOR swag is 
      everywhere.  Teddy is at the podium, remarkably at ease. Off 
      to the side we see Tandy, tense as a cat. 

                                  TEDDY

      Teddy has an endearing charm and self-deprecating style.

      The camera pulls back to reveal Lamar watching from a balcony 
      above the room with his advisors.

                                  TEDDY (CONT D)
                    -- success is to be measured not so 
                    much by the position we have 
                    reached in life, but by the 
                    obstacles we have overcome while 
                    trying to succeed.

      He's impressed with Teddy's performance. He smiles, satisfied.
