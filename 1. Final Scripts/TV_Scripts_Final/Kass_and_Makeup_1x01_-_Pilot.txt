    FADE IN:

    INT. KITCHEN (PLAYBACK)

    A clip from an old hit show, 'The Family'. The Wire meets 
    Sopranos. VINCENZO (VINCE) CANTONE, a Mafia Don trying to deal 
    with the dual worlds of his underworld family and his rapidly 
    disintegrating family at home. 

    On screen, Vince s wife GINA can barely contain her hurt and 
    rage as she confronts Vince.

                                  GINA
                Is he dead?

    Vince remains cold and silent.

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                Did you kill him?

                                  VINCE
                Don t ask me about the family, Gina.

                                  GINA
                He is my family! He's my sister s son! 
                You re my husband   you are not my 
                blood!

                                  VINCE
                I'm not your blood?!

                                  GINA
                DID YOU KILL HIM?!

                                  VINCE
                ...No.

                                  GINA
                Swear it to me. Swear on your mother 
                and your children.

                                  VINCE
                  I swear... on my mother and our 
                children   I did not kill your 
                sister s son.

    CLOSE on Michael for his  catchphrase  from the show.

                Nothing is more important than The 
                Family. You know that.

    Gina breaks down and pulls Vince tight, hugging him.

                                  GINA
                I don t believe you.

    The SOUND of a bottle breaking O.S. takes us out of the 
    playback.

    INT. OLD MAN S APARTMENT - OAKWOODS - NIGHT

    An OLD ASIAN MAN is watching  The Family  on TV.

    He glances out his window onto the courtyard of the apartment 
    complex. A LOUD PARTY is in full swing around the pool. 

    He looks annoyed. He picks up a phone and dials.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN
                Hello... this is the second time I m 
                  calling... you have to come over 
                here... everything too loud... 

    CAMERA MOVES outside with the old man's look.

    EXT. OAKWOOD APARTMENTS - POOL - NIGHT

    Would-be STARLETS, touring MUSICIANS, a transient mix of 
    Hollywood hopefuls mingle at a pool party in the complex 
    courtyard. They are drinking, smoking weed, dancing. 

    Among the crowd, A MAN carries an unconscious YOUNG BLONDE 
    over his shoulder. Noticeable but not noteworthy.

    TIME LAPSE - NIGHT DISSOLVES TO DAY.

    EXT. OAKWOOD APARTMENTS - MORNING

    The morning light reveals the tawdriness of the scene - broken 
    bottles; a few partiers sleeping it off on deck chairs. 

    Welcome to Hollywood - no glitter, no tinsel. In the glaring 
    California sun we spot a SIGN:  Oakwood Apartments. Short 
    term/Long term Furnished Suites'. 

    CAMERA DRIFTS across the courtyard to focus on an apartment.

    INT. MICHAEL S APARTMENT - DAY

    A large studio apartment - kitchen, dinette and large living 
    room/bedroom. A lot of life is crammed into a little space. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  3.

    There are photos and other memorabilia of a once prominent 
    actor s life -- a few Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. 

    The place is mess - dirty laundry, food containers, mail, 
    bedding and towels strewn about.

    MICHAEL KASS (46) - the actor we saw as Vince in the clip, is 
    sleeping atop the bed, still fully clothed.

    A PHONE RING startles him awake. He's hung over.

                                    MICHAEL
                Hello?

                                  HOWIE
                So did you get my messages?

                                    MICHAEL
                Who is this?

                                  HOWIE
                Who is this? It s Howard Simon, your 
                agent.

                                    MICHAEL
                Jesus, Howie. What time is it?

                                  HOWIE
                It s 8:15 - 45 minutes before your 
                nine AM audition. I sent you 3 texts 
                last night. Tell me you got them. And 
                don t call me Howie.

    He has no clue... about much of anything right now.

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah. I, uh, I got em... I think... I 
                must have had a rough night. 

                                  HOWIE
                  I thought you stopped drinking.

                                    MICHAEL
                I wasn t drinking, I had a couple of 
                drinks.

                                  HOWIE
                That s drinking. Look, don t blow this 
                  audition. It s not so easy getting you 
                seen these days.

    Michael turns towards the bed.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know, I know... you re a genius.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  4.

    He now notices there s a NAKED GIRL in his bed, stomach down, 
    head turned away from him. A distinct tattoo of an angel is 
    visible on her exposed shoulder.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Oh...

                                  HOWIE
                What?

                                    MICHAEL
                There s a girl in my bed.

                                  HOWIE
                Another hooker?

                                    MICHAEL
                No, I think it s my neighbor.

                                  HOWIE
                Good for you.

                                    MICHAEL
                No, shut up... This is weird.

                                  HOWIE
                Well, get her on the walk of shame and 
                don t be late for the audition.

                                    MICHAEL
                Okay, Howie, I got it.

                                  HOWIE
                Howard!

    Michael hangs up. Walks towards the bed tentatively.

                                    MICHAEL
                Vanessa? I think we got a little 
                wasted, kid. Look, no need to be 
                  embarrassed, I don t think anything 
                  happened. Vanessa?

    Michael gets to the other side of the bed and finally sees 
    Vanessa s face. 

    Her eyes are open and glazed over. Her skin is unnaturally 
    pale. There s no question she s DEAD.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Oh God...

    He completely freaks out.

    He looks around the room, desperately. Goes to the front door, 
    opens it to yell for help, then changes his mind. 

    He closes the door and goes for the phone. He dials 911.

                                  911 (O.S.)
                Nine one one, please state your 
                  emergency.

                                    MICHAEL
                I m... There s a girl. I woke up and 
                she s dead... 

                                  911 (O.S.)
                What s your name, Sir?

    He thinks about this for the first time. 

                                    MICHAEL
                My name? Why?... No, it s okay, I m 
                wrong. We re good.

                                  911 (O.S.)
                Sir?

                                    MICHAEL
                I ll call you back.

    He hangs up, even more rattled. 

    His eyes go directly to the Fridge. A BUSINESS CARD is 
    attached under a  The Family  fridge magnet.

    He grabs the card.

    EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

    A 1994 Mercedes SL500 that has seen better days starts out of 
    the garage and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES as a CITY BUS suddenly 
    appears directly in front of his car, and pulls to a stop.

    On the side of the bus is a MASSIVE AD for  THE FAMILY  
    COMPLETE SERIES BOX SET DVD - Starring MICHAEL KASS.

     NOTHING is more important than The Family. 

    The IMAGE of Michael as Vince pointing a gun is aimed directly 
    at Michael. An unsettling sight.

    One of the BUS RIDERS, looks out the window at Michael and 
    recognizes him. Waves tentatively.

    Michael slinks down in his seat as the car screeches away.  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  6.


    EXT. KASS SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

    A strip mall in the San Fernando Valley. 

    INT. ALI S OFFICE - KASS SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIONS 

    ALLISON (ALI) KASS, 40's attractive, tough and clever is in 
    her private office talking on speakerphone, while making a 
    coffee.

                                  ALI
                So you think your husband s having an 
                affair?

                Uh-huh. What makes you think your 
                husband might be gay?

    Photos on the wall show Ali in LAPD uniform as a younger 
    woman. Commendations for making Detective first grade. 
    Commendations for bravery.

                He hardly touches me anymore. We have 
                  relations maybe once or twice a month.

    Photos from a 'retirement' party. Prominent among the photos 
    are shots of her with a strapping, handsome detective we will 
    later know as her partner, HARRISON (HARRY) POTTER.

                                  ALI
                And how long have you been married?

    EXT. KASS SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIONS

    Michael comes to the front door, only to find it locked.

    He looks inside and locks eyes with HARRISON POTTER. 

    Though a bit older than the photo in Ali's office, he is still 
    an imposing figure, hard muscled and yet clearly graced with 
    an innate sweetness - like a somewhat intimidating Labrador.

    Michael bangs on the door and Harrison approaches. 

                                  HARRISON
                Hey! Michael Kass!

                What? No. Open the door.

                                  HARRISON
                We open at nine. It s policy.

                What are you, the secretary?

                                  HARRISON
                No, partner. I ve been working with 
                Allison about 3 months now. God, this 
                is amazing. I m such a big fan, Mike.

                                    MICHAEL
                You re a fan? Great, listen to me. Go 
                to your heart. I m asking you to go to 
                your heart.

    Harrison is leading an edgy Michael through the outer office.

                Yeah, right. Oh, Harrison, please. Or

    Harry backs away, uncomfortable and sensitive to the 
    situation. He retreats to the outer office.

    Michael realizes he needs to shut up if he s going to get 
    anywhere.

                                  ALI
                You have responsibilities. Do what you 
                have to do but don t make your family 
                suffer just because you decide to live 
                your life like some spoiled, stupid... 

    Ali suddenly realizes Michael is not putting up a defense.

                                  ALI (CONT D)
                What s wrong? If you re actually 
                  listening to me something happened.

                                    MICHAEL
                There s this girl, Vanessa Blake-

                                  ALI
                Oh Jesus, pregnant?

                                    MICHAEL
                No. She s this young girl, separated 
                from her husband. She moved into the 
                complex a month ago, wannabe actress, 
                We talk sometimes about the business 
                and acting. I was just trying to help 
                her out. No strings.

                                  ALI
                Uh-huh. And now there s a string?

                                    MICHAEL
                She s dead. In my bed!

                                  ALI
                            (lost for words)
                Yeah, that s a string.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  10.

                But I swear to God, Allison - I don t 
                know how she got there. We were 
                friends. That s all. We went out for 
                dinner last night, as friends and we 
                wound up at some club -

    He shows her an ink stamp on his hand.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                CLB, that s the stamp they do at the 
                door.

                                  ALI
                Who goes clubbing with a hot, little 
                friend?

                                    MICHAEL
                Who said she was hot?

    Ali just stares at him a moment.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Okay. But I m telling you there is no 
                way she would have wound up in my bed.

                                  ALI
                Michael, what do you want from me? Go 
                to the police. Call a lawyer.

                                    MICHAEL
                And say what? I ve got no answers for 
                  anything. I don t know how I got home. 
                I don t know how she got there. I 
                don t know what happened.

    Harrison enters the office.

                                  HARRISON
                Sorry. Michael, did you call 911? 

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah, but I got scared - I hung up.

                                  HARRISON
                I just heard on the scanner - CSI and 
                the coroner are at The Oakwood.

                                    MICHAEL
                But I hung up.

                                  ALI
                You can t just hang up. They trace the 
                call.

                This girl didn t just die, she was 
                  murdered.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know! That s why you ve gotta help 
                me.

                                  ALI
                              (frustrated)
                Dammit, Michael - Why do YOUR problems 
                still become MY problems? What am I 
                supposed to do - break the law for 
                you? Harbor a suspect? Innocent people 
                go to the police - they trust the 
                system.

                                  HARRISON
                But he s not just a person, Ali. He s 
                a public figure. One that s been to 
                jail and in and out of rehab.

    Michael gives him a questioning look.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                I m a fan. He won t be treated like 
                everyone else. The media will crucify 
                him before sunset.

                                  ALI
                That doesn t mean he gets to change 
                the rules.

    Harrison comes over to her for a private moment.

                                  HARRISON
                Do you not want to help him because 
                you don t believe him or because he s 
                your ex-husband?

    Ali searches for a moment, then...

                                  ALI
                  I believe him. He s not that good an 
                actor.

    Michael has overheard.

                                    MICHAEL
                Allison, I know I haven t made things 
                easy... for anybody. I m not asking 
                you to forgive me. I m asking you to 
                believe me and to help me. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  12.

                Eight hours. I ll give you eight hours 
                and after that, no matter what, you go 
                to your lawyer or the cops, I don t 
                care. You don t move from this office. 
                You answer only that phone on only   
                that line. Don t go near the door, 
                don t look out the window, don t move 
                until you hear from me or I swear to 
                God, I ll kill you myself.

    She walks out. Harrison grabs his coat.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Harrison)
                Hey - Thank you.

                                  HARRISON
                Sure... That line about  you don t 
                have to forgive me just help me  - was 
                that from the finale of season 2?

    Michael doesn t acknowledge anything. He just indicates that 
    Harrison should hurry.

                                                              SMASH TO:

                                        ACT ONE

    FADE IN:

    EXT. OAKWOOD APTS. - CONTINUOUS

    Harrison s car turns onto the property where several POLICE 
    CRUISERS have already parked alongside a NEWS VAN.

    EXT. OAKWOOD APTS. - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

    Ali and Harrison stand beside a bank of mailboxes and a tenant 
    directory. 

    LAPD and CSI are working the outside of Michael s apartment. 
    Several officers are interviewing tenants.

                                  ALI
                What are the chances we ll be greeted 
                with open arms?

                                  HARRISON
                Well, let s see - you re the ex-wife 
                of the prime suspect and I m despised 
                by at least half the LAPD. 

                                  ALI
                That s not true. You re despised by 
                more than that.

    They share a knowing smile. Harrison registers the directory 
    beside him. 

                                  HARRISON
                What did Michael say the victim s name 
                is?

                                  ALI
                Vanessa Blake.

    He runs his finger down the list, passing Michael s name. He 
    stops on  Ruiz/Blake .

                                  HARRISON
                Worth a shot.

    EXT. AMANDA S APT - CONTINUOUS

    They ring the bell. No answer. Harrison knocks, hard.

                                  HARRISON
                Ms. Ruiz? 

                                  AMANDA (O.S.)
                Who is it?

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  14.

                We d like to talk to you about your 
                  roommate.

    The door opens, still chain locked. AMANDA RUIZ (26) no doubt 
    quite pretty when you put on the paint. Right now, she looks 
    wary, wan and frail. 

                                  AMANDA
                You cops?

                                  HARRISON
                We re investigators. Can we talk to 
                you for a few minutes?

                                  AMANDA
                What s going on over there?

    This is odd.

                                  HARRISON
                You don t know?

                                  ALI
                Vanessa is dead, Ms. Ruiz.

    Amanda reels a bit.

                                  ALI (CONT D)
                We d like to ask you some questions.

    Amanda SLAMS the door closed and yells from inside.

                                  AMANDA (O.S.)
                Leave me alone.

                                  ALI
                Ms. Ruiz....

                                  AMANDA (O.S.)
                GO AWAY!!

                                  ALI
                          (to Harrison)
                Well, that was some top-notch 
                  detective work right there. Ready?

    Harrison nods  yes  and they reluctantly head toward Michael s 
    apartment.

    EXT. MICHAEL S APARTMENT - DAY

    A line of POLICE TAPE isn t all that keeps Ali and Harry from 
    crossing into the apartment. PHIL ROSEN, a squirrelish, 
    unpleasant looking Homicide Detective blocks the entrance.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  15.

                Hey, what s going on here.

    NATHAN REESE, a burly veteran cop in his fifties - paternal, 
    imposing - now stands in the doorway. 

                                  REESE (CONT D)
                Ali, Potter. I didn t expect I d see

                                  ALI
                Heard the all points on the scanner. 
                Kind of hard to stay away.

                                  REESE
                You seen your husband today?

                                  ALI
                  Ex-husband. He owes me alimony, child 
                  support... I m the last person he s 
                looking for right now.

                                  HARRISON
                Think we could take a look, Nate?

                                  ROSEN
                You can take a walk, s what you can

                Shut up, Rosen! Go inside and pretend 
                you re useful.

    Rosen moves off, giving Harrison an evil look.

                                  HARRISON
                Can we take a look, Nate?

                You don t know that he has run. You

                all. Let me have a look. I ve been 
                here before, I might see something you 
                guys wouldn t pick up on. Come on,

                an issue with that, you can report me.

    They begin looking about. Harrison can t help but react to the 
    small trove of memorabilia from Michael s career.

    Ali focuses on Vanessa s CORPSE, her lifeless eyes staring 
    into space.

    She and Harrison begin examining the body closely from 
    opposite sides of the bed.

    her neck.

                The attack was from the rear. Splayed 
                  imprints, most likely from the perp 
                wearing gloves.

                Gloves would mean the murder wasn t 
                  spontaneous. It was pre-meditated.

    He looks at his reflection and notes how the soap spots 
    occlude bits of his face. An idea sparks.

    He wipes the mirror clean and takes the bar of soap. With the 
    soap, he draws a mustache over his reflected lip and considers 
    it.

    hair. 

    In the final shot, Michael regards himself in the mirror as 
    Santini removes the smock from his shoulders, admiring. 

    Michael is a different man - one with new life and purpose. 
    But just who he is....

                                        ACT TWO

    FADE IN:

    EXT. CLB - DAY

      A sophisticated nightspot on the Sunset Strip. You don t come 
    here without cash. Valet parking is twenty bucks.

    INT. CLB - CONTINUOUS

    This is the place - four star dining and the hottest bar and 
    dance floor in LA. At present, a crew of workers are prepping *
    the main room for the night. 

    Ali and Harrison are waiting at the bar. An ATTRACTIVE HOSTESS *
    comes up to them.

                                    HOSTESS
                Mr. Galindo can see you now.

    She leads them into the main room. As they walk, Harrison 
    leans into Ali.

                                  HARRISON
                Don t use your last name right now. 
                Just a precaution.

    They approach a strikingly handsome, very well-dressed Cuban 
    man in his 40 s. This is VICTOR GALINDO, the owner of CLB. 
    Clearly powerful, he wears it with ease and charm. Off to the 
    side, but ever present are TWO BODYGUARDS.*

    Galindo approaches, hand extended, oozing easy charm.

                                    GALINDO
                Hello, I m Victor Galindo.

                                  HARRISON
                I m Det. Potter. 

                                  ALI
                Det. Jaworski. Thank you for taking 
                the time to see us.

                                    GALINDO
                My pleasure. How can I help you?

                                  HARRISON
                We re investigating the death of a 
                young woman. We believe she was here 
                last night.

                                    GALINDO
                I assume this was an untimely death?

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  25.

    Ali holds up her cellphone showing a photo of Vanessa.

                                  ALI
                Does this girl look familiar?

                                    GALINDO
                I m sorry, I couldn t say.

                                  ALI
                Why not?

                                    GALINDO
                On any given night, there are close to 
                500 people in this club. Many very 
                  attractive, young ladies. I m afraid 
                they all start to blend in the mind. 
                  Occupational hazard. 

                                  HARRISON
                Maybe you d recognize a name? Vanessa 
                Blake?

                                    GALINDO
                No, I m sorry. It s not a name I know.

    The Hostess waits beside A MAN that we can t quite make out.

                                    GALINDO (CONT D)
                Excuse me. Yes, Ramona?

                                    HOSTESS
                There s a mister Dovess.. Doovesser...

                  Douvassier. Cameron Douvassier. Not 
                easy to get from the spelling.

    This is Michael, transformed and adorned with a smart, trendy 
    suit, glasses on a neck chain and some jewelry.

    As he moves forward into the scene, no one - not even Ali or 
    Harrison - have any idea he is anything but what he presents 
    himself to be. It is a perfect and complete disguise.

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                I m with Rousse Parfait Entertainment. *
                  Apologies for no appointment but I m 
                in town for a split and my calendar is 
                an abomination. If you might have a 
                few moments to discuss an opportunity.*

                                    GALINDO
                I ll be with you in a minute, Mr...

                                    GALINDO
                Make yourself comfortable, Mr.

                                    GALINDO
                Please.

    Cameron wanders off onto the dance floor. Galindo redirects 
    his attention to the detectives.

                                  HARRISON
                Vanessa was here with a celebrity last 
                night. Maybe that would help you 
                  remember.

                                    GALINDO
                Perhaps. We do seem to be popular with 
                the Hollywood elite.

                                  HARRISON
                Michael Kass.

                                    GALINDO
                I don t know that name.

                                  HARRISON
                              (incredulous)
                Michael Kass - the actor. You never 
                watch The Family?

                                    GALINDO
                I m sorry. Is that a cartoon?

    A CLATTER OF EQUIPMENT. 

     Cameron  has been  perusing  by the DJ stand and has toppled 
    some items. He quickly covers.

                                   CAMERON 
                  Apologies. Excellent acoustics, B-T-W.

                                    GALINDO
                I regret I cannot be more helpful.

                                  ALI
                Perhaps we could speak to other 
                members of your staff?

                would know anything about this.

                                  HARRISON
                We could come back tonight.

                                    GALINDO
                  Detective, put yourself in my 
                  position. I cannot have my staff 
                  distracted nor my clientele 
                  inconvenienced. 

                                  ALI
                Commerce over compassion, Mr. Galindo?

                            (all smiles)
                Javier will show you out.

    One of his BODYGUARDS steps forward toward Ali. 

                                    GALINDO (CONT D)*
                Good day, detectives.

    Galindo heads off toward  Cameron . Ali and Harrison head to 
    the door.

                                  HARRISON
                Are you going to hug the man goodbye?

                                  ALI
                I m afraid I would slide off.

    They exit.

                                    GALINDO
                Now then, Mr. Douvassier. What did you

                you been living under a rock, Mr.

                                    GALINDO
                Then perhaps we should go to my office

    INT. GALINDO S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

    This is a plush, upscale private office.

    Galindo shows  Cameron  footage from surveillance cameras set 
    up around the club - a whole deck of seven or eight monitors.

                This footage is just from last night.

     Cameron  now spots himself on one of the monitors, being 
    pulled toward the dance floor by Vanessa Blake.

                Ah, that is the young lady the 
                  detectives were asking about.

    On the monitor, a Barmaid brings two drinks over to Michael 
    and Vanessa. They accept and toast a silent  thank-you  to 
    some unseen someone off camera.

    to connect with the mystery caller. 

    As they pass a booth, Cameron s hand shoots out to stop them.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  31.

                If I were paranoid, I might say you 
                two were stalking me.

                                  HARRISON
                You re the guy who came into CLB.

                                  ALI
                Did you call us? Do you know something 
                about last night?

                                   CAMERON 
                I know your ex-husband is innocent.

                                  HARRISON
                How do you know that?

                                   CAMERON 
                Because he s family.
                            (Vince Cantone)
                And nothing... is more important than 
                the family.

    Harrison clues in.

                                  HARRISON
                Holy Sh-

                                  ALI
                Michael!

    Michael smiles, he doesn t see that Ali is angry.

                                  HARRISON
                That s unbelievable. UNBELIEVABLE!

    Ali starts slapping and kicking at Michael who can do little 
    to fend it off. Then Ali starts striding off.

                                    MICHAEL
                Ali, wait...

                                  ALI
                Is this a game to you? I m risking my 
                ass every second I help you and you re 
                playing dress-up?

                                    MICHAEL
                I m not playing. But I couldn t just 
                sit and do nothing. 

                                  ALI
                No, that would waste a perfectly good 
                  opportunity to SCREW EVERYTHING!!!

                                    MICHAEL
                Hey could you YELL A LITTLE LOUDER so 
                we can make more of a scene?
                          (to the onlookers)
                Sorry to disturb, everyone. Anger 
                  management therapy. Field trips - so 
                  critical.

    He moves her back toward their booth.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                I m trying to help. You did great at 
                my apartment cause you re cops. But 
                you struck out at that club because 
                you re cops. 

                                  ALI
                We re not cops anymore.

                                    MICHAEL
                  Detectives, same thing. You re bound 
                by rules. I m not. I can be anything I 
                want. And admit it, I fooled you. I 
                fooled Victor Galindo. And I got good 
                  information.  So, I m crazy? Fine, 
                this whole situation is crazy. Now you 
                can stand there and hate me or I can 
                tell you what I know.

    Ali sits, but she s still upset.

                                  ALI
                I choose both.

                                  HARRISON
                Very mature. Good work.

                                  ALI
                Shut up, Potter. Go fly your 
                  broomstick.

                                  HARRISON
                And thus endeth the maturity.

                                    MICHAEL
                Galindo absolutely knew Vanessa. He 
                just wasn t copping to it.

    Harrison s cell rings and he answers it.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                Vanessa hung with a group of girls 
                that the club caters to - free drinks, 
                lots of perks, intros to the big 
                players, that sort of thing. 

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  33.

                I knew he was lying. 

                                    MICHAEL
                Those girls will be back there 
                tonight. Maybe they know something.

                                  HARRISON
                             (on phone)
                Thanks man, I owe you.

    Harrison hangs up and scribbles something on a napkin.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                The lab confirms Rohypnol in her 
                system. She was roofied. They probably 
                nailed you, too, Mike. LAPD is sending 
                a team out to talk to the husband.

                                    MICHAEL
                Finally. *

                                  HARRISON
                My guys will tell me if he becomes  of 
                  interest . *

                                  ALI
                I want to sniff around the Oakwood 
                some more. Maybe someone will talk to 
                me. 

                                    MICHAEL
                Wait, aren t you going to check out 
                the husband? 

                                  ALI
                LAPD are all over it and we re not 
                supposed to know about a husband, 
                  remember? We have no jurisdiction. 
                Come on. 

                                    MICHAEL
                You guys go. I m going back to 
                  Santini s.

    Ali starts to protest.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                He s safe. And he has the stuff to get 
                this disguise off me. 

                                  ALI
                Then you stay there, do you hear me? 
                No more excursions. We ll connect in a 
                few hours.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  34.

    She heads out, leaving Harrison to linger.

                                  HARRISON
                You re right, by the way. She and I 
                would never have gotten that 
                  information. You might want to wipe 
                your mouth, you got a little something 
                on your face.

    Harrison heads out. Michael reaches for a napkin on the table. 
    It s the one Harrison was scribbling on.

    INSERT:  Dan Blake, 17731 Cloverdale Rd. Husband. 

    Michael looks up just in time to see Harrison shoot him the 
    tiniest glance before heading out.  

    INT. GASLIGHT STUDIOS - SANTINI S OFFICE

    Michael and Santini work the computer. Google Maps ZOOMS in on 
    a particular house. The Napkin is there for reference.

    INSERT SCREEN: A satellite view of a suburban house.

    Santini hits the  Street View  button. There is a truck parked 
    in front and gardeners working.

                                    MICHAEL
                What do you think?

                                    SANTINI 
                How s your Spanish?

                                    MICHAEL
                I can order a burrito.

                                    SANTINI
                Good enough.

    A SERIES OF RAPID CUTS...

    As Michael is again transformed in phases of makeup, wigs and 
    facial hair. 

    In the final shot, Michael regards himself in the mirror as 
    Santini removes the smock from his shoulders, admiring.

                                      ACT THREE

    FADE IN:

    EXT. BLAKE S HOUSE - STREET - DAY

    An LAPD CRUISER is parked out front. A battered PICK-UP TRUCK 
    pulls up and parks.  

    A MEXICAN GARDENER removes some tools and walks towards the 
    back yard. Only we can tell this is an unrecognizable Michael.

    EXT. BLAKE S HOUSE - BACK YARD

    Michael walks along the house glancing into windows until he 
    spots DAN BLAKE, being interviewed by 2 LAPD COPS.

    Blake(40) is a hefty man, barely hanging onto what must have 
    been real good looks just a few years ago.

    The window is slightly open. Michael moves to hear the 
    conversation inside, all the while trimming hedges without 
    paying attention.

    INT/EXT. BLAKE S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

    Blake sits, clearly shaken by the news of his wife s death.

                                  COP#1
                When was the last time you spoke with 
                Vanessa?

                                  BLAKE
                I m not sure. Uh, we spoke often. At 
                least once a week. Maybe more.

    The Cop makes a note. Blake feels he needs to explain.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                We were working it out. Vanessa just 
                felt like she needed to get away... 
                Think things through. We were working 
                it out.

                                  COP#2
                Did she ever mention any other 
                  relationships? Friends? Boyfriend?

                                  BLAKE*
                Yeah, she had some friends, I guess - *
                  a roommate. I don t know how close 
                they were. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  36.

                                  COP#1
                Did she ever mention the name, Michael 
                Kass?

                                  BLAKE
                The actor?

    Michael stops and strains to listen 

                                  COP#1
                Yes, sir. 

                                  BLAKE
                He lives at those apartments. I mean, 
                I think he does. I m not sure. Why?

                                  COP#1
                Your wife s body was discovered in his 
                  apartment. 

    Blake, seemingly devastated turns to the window. He locks eyes 
    with this unknown gardener.

    Michael, caught unexpectedly, over-compensates by clipping 
    away like a madman. In his zeal, he manages to CUT HIS FINGER. 
    He moves off from the window.

    Michael continues pruning while eyeing the officers and Blake 
    in the house. As their conversation ends, Blake leads them to 
    the front door. 

    Michael tracks them, moving toward the front door to catch the 
    final snippet of conversation.

                                  COP#1 (CONT D)
                If you think of anything that might be 
                useful, please call. And you ll hear 
                from our department in the next 24 
                hours to follow up. 

                                  BLAKE
                Follow up? Follow up on what?

                                  COP#1
                This is an ongoing investigation, Mr. 
                Blake. I m sure we ll need some 
                  additional information. 

                                  BLAKE
                Of course. Thank you.

    Michael watches the Officers move off. He turns back as Blake 
    hurries to shut the door.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  37.

    CONTINUED: (2)

    Michael trails him from outside. Blake hurries past windows on 
    his way back to his office.

    Once there, Blake closes the drapes. But he is unaware of the 
    gap at the split of the curtains.

    Michael steals up to the window and works to look inside. He 
    gets only glimpses.

    Michael s POV: BLAKE AT HIS DESK. He rifles through a drawer.

    BLAKE stuffs his laptop in a bag. HE CROSSES to a closet door. 
    Has to unlock it with a key. A light goes on inside. There are 
    SOUNDS of file cabinets, papers rifling, etc.

    Blake emerges from the closet with several FILE FOLDERS and a 
    large trash bag stuffed with something. He leaves the office.

    Michael races to intercept him at the front path.

    He reaches the front path and starts randomly clipping as 
    Blake comes pounding out the door with his bundles.

    As Blake tries to hurry past, Michael surreptitiously jams his 
    clippers into the trash bag, splitting it open and spilling 
    it s contents to the ground.

    A quick glance reveals them to be INSURANCE RECORDS. 

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                God damn it. You idiot, what the hell 
                are you doing?

    Michael now adopts a thick, Mexican accent - the finishing 
    touch on his transformation to the character of  ERNESTO .

                                   ERNESTO 
                Lo siento. Lo siento. Sorry.

    Ernesto bends to help Blake gather his papers. Blake shoves 
    him back, hard.

                                  BLAKE
                Don t touch that. Who are you?

                                   ERNESTO 
                Ernesto, senor.

                                  BLAKE
                I don t know you. Where s Jorge?

                                   ERNESTO 
                Jorge necesito... another job. I 
                finish.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  38.

    Blake looks at the butchered hedges for the first time. 

                                  BLAKE
                Finish? You ve destroyed the goddamn 
                place. I should call those cops back 
                and have them lock you the hell up.

    ** As Blake fumes, he gesticulates wildly with his hands. 
    Michael, being a keen observer and mimic, notes that Blake 
    holds both his ring fingers in a peculiar way when he 
    gestures. The audience is unlikely to note it now, but they 
    will later.

                                   ERNESTO 
                Jorge tell me... como esta. He say to 
                make good. 

                                  BLAKE
                This is not good! Comprende? Not good!

    He gathers his fallen items.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                You get your tools and get the hell 
                off my property. You hear me? 

    Blake is moving quickly to his car, tossing the items in.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                I see you again, I m calling the 
                police.

    Blake climbs in his car and speeds off.

                                   ERNESTO 
                I sorry. Sorry. 
                       (then, as Michael)
                Sorry I didn t kick your ass, you son 
                of a bitch.

    Michael turns back toward the house.

    Establish.

    EXT. MICHAEL S APARTMENT

    Police have left, but the door is sealed with crime scene 
    tape. 

    AMANDA, Vanessa s roommate, stands peering through a window 
    into the apartment. She moves to the door, stands for a moment 
    with her hand on the knob, then tries to open it.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  39.

                  I wouldn t do that.

    Amanda whirls around in surprise to find Ali.

                                  ALI (CONT D)
                  Tampering with evidence... that s a 
                big ole felony. I was hoping to find 
                you, Ms. Ruiz. I thought this might be 
                a better time to talk.

                                  AMANDA
                How did she die?

                                  ALI
                I was hoping you would tell me.

    Amanda moves to rush past her, but Ali grabs her arm.

                                  AMANDA
                I didn t do anything.

                                  ALI
                Then stop acting like you did. Do you 
                know something, Amanda? Did you see 
                  something?

                                  AMANDA
                I told her to go. She walked away 
                once. She just didn t stay away.

                                  ALI
                From who? Her husband?

                                  AMANDA
                I don t have to talk to you! Leave me 
                alone!

    Amanda pulls away and runs off. Ali just stands there, she 
    knows better than to pursue at this moment.

    As Amanda disappears, Ali surveys the area. For the first 
    time, she notices several SECURITY CAMERAS around this common 
    area. The OLD ASIAN MAN from the opening scene sidles past 
    with his oxygen tank in tow.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN
                Next time you come when I call.

                                  ALI
                I m sorry? I think you have me 
                confused with someone else.

    Ali turns to go.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  40.

                No, you cop. I see you with other 
                cops.

    This stops Ali in her tracks.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN (CONT D)
                You all come today. But nobody come 
                last night. Music too loud. Everybody 
                making too much noise. I see. I call. 
                But nobody come. You come next time.

    Ali regards this man, then the cameras. Interesting.

    EXT. BLAKE S HOUSE - GARDEN

    Michael is awkwardly climbing through the open window.

    INT. BLAKE S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

    He lands and looks around the room for a second, then makes 
    his way towards the office.

    INT. BLAKE S OFFICE

    Michael scans the room. PHOTOS OF VANESSA are everywhere - the 
    walls, the desk, the shelves. Adoring or obsessive?

    Michael moves to the closet Blake had gone into. The door has 
    been left slightly ajar and the light on.

    INT. OFFICE CLOSET

    A standard utility closet. But there are also shelves of 
    MEDICAL SUPPLIES: syringes, swabs, gloves, braces, etc. 

    In the rear of the closet is a FILE CABINET. Several drawers 
    are haphazardly open. Michael begins rifling through them.

    INSERT: MULTIPLE CLAIMS made to different insurance carriers 
    for the same individuals or companies. 

    Michael takes some cell phone pictures, then crams a few files 
    into his pockets. 

    As he does, he sees his BLOOD has stained the cabinet. He 
    swipes at the spot with his sleeve, leaving a streak.

    He turns to the shelves of medical supplies, pushing aside 
    boxes in search of a bandage, when he begins to notice all 
    kinds of PHARMACEUTICAL SAMPLES. 

    One package in particular catches his eye - Rohypnol. He 
    stuffs the sample into his pocket.  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  41.


    INT. BLAKE S OFFICE (CONT.)

    He moves back to Blake s desk. It s a mess of papers with an 
    ANSWERING MACHINE flashing in the corner.

    Michael hits the play button.

                                  ANSWERING MACHINE
                You have... no... new messages. First 
                saved message...

    Michael fast forwards through, stopping only for...

                                    VANESSA (O.S.)
                It s Vanessa. Look, I saw your car  
                tonight. And I saw you at the club the 
                other night. I want you to stop it, 
                Dan. Stop following me. Stop calling 
                me. I don t want to hurt you but we 
                both know I have more than enough 
                  information to do that. Don t make me 
                use it. 

    The message ends. Michael is stunned by the evidence. Unsure 
    what else to do, he TAKES THE MACHINE and goes.

    INT. KASS SECURITY - EVENING

    Michael  Ernesto  enters the outer office, drawing Harry s 
    attention.

                                  HARRISON
                Sorry, not open.

    Ernesto responds in a torrent of nonsense Spanish.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                No, no... amigo, no en casa.

    Ernesto drops the accent and assumes Michael s regular voice.

                                    MICHAEL
                Really? What if I told you I ve 
                cracked this case wide open?

    Harrison lights up.

                                  HARRISON
                GET OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE. That 
                is UNBELIEVABLE! I thought you were... 
                holy Moses.

                                    MICHAEL
                Muchas gracias, Senor.

                Yeah. He s the guy, Harry. Cops tell 
                him his wife is dead, he puts on some 
                dog and pony show of grief. They leave 
                - bang. He s pulling files into a 
                trash bag. He s way deep into some 
                kind of insurance scam. 

                                  HARRISON
                  Insurance?

                                    MICHAEL
                Vanessa knew all about it. She must 
                have been holding it over him and he 
                snapped. The guy s a lunatic. Comes 
                running out of his house, gets right 
                in my face. 
                            (imitates Blake)
                 You ve destroyed the goddamn place. I 
                should call those cops back and have 
                them lock you the hell up. 

    Michael does an uncanny impression, right down to Blake s odd  
    hand gestures. 

                                  HARRISON
                What s with your hands?

                does.

                His ring fingers are bent in like

                It could make something make sense. 
                It s just... the time-line is weird.

                LAPD checked his movements last night 
                based on cell phone pings. They put 
                him at the Oakwood Apartments. Only 
                not at the time of death. Coroner s 
                office says Vanessa was killed between 
                one and three a.m., this morning. But 
                they only have Blake there around 7:30 
                last night.

                The prime... the only suspect in this

                  EVERYTHING in his home that points to

                I ll keep you out of it. I ll say you 
                had no idea I was working for him. 
                They can t touch you.

    Ali is overwhelmed. Her heart tugged in every direction. 
    Finally...

                                  ALI
                Okay. I promised you a day, Michael. 
                So we keep going.

                I ll head back to CLB, see if 
                  Vanessa s girlfriends can tell me 
                  anything. I won t tell you what to do. 
                Because frankly, I don t know anymore. 
                      (to Harrison)
                I ll check back with you later.

                                    MICHAEL
                Ali --- thank you.

                                  ALI
                Don t thank me, because unless you can 
                find somebody to squeeze a confession 
                out of Dan Blake, I think you re in 
                for a very tough time.

    Ali heads out. Michael and Harrison exchange looks before 
    Harrison follows her out.

    Michael walks to the bathroom and stares at himself hard in 
    the mirror. 

    IN A SERIES OF SHOTS, he peels fake facial hair, nose, wig and 
    begins to wipe the pancake makeup from his skin. 

    What s left is a Michael more lost, yet determined than we 
    have ever seen him.

                                        ACT FOUR

    FADE IN:

    EXT. BLAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

    Michael stands outside the front door, repeatedly ringing the 
    bell and banging at the door.

                                  BLAKE (O.S.)
                I don t care who you are, I am going 
                to rip your head...

    Dan Blake swings the door open violently.

                                    MICHAEL
                            (dead serious)
                Off?

    Blake goes to slam the door shut but Michael kicks it back 
    inward. He pushes into the entryway and slams the door.

    INT. BLAKE HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                  BLAKE
                I ll kill you.

                                    MICHAEL
                Too late. You should ve taken me out 
                when you killed Vanessa.

                                  BLAKE
                What? What did you say?

                                    MICHAEL
                I know all about your little insurance 
                scam, asshole. I have your files. I 
                have your phone machine. I know where 
                you were last night and I can prove 
                it. Wanna rip my head off now? Or do 
                we start talking?

    Blake stands, dazed and cornered.

    EXT. AMANDA S APARTMENT - OAKWOODS - NIGHT

    Harrison looks thru the window. Amanda is hurriedly throwing 
    things into a suitcase and a duffle bag.

    Harrison moves back toward the door and knocks. From inside, a 
    voice...

                                  AMANDA
                Who is it?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  48.

                It s Det. Potter, Ms. Ruiz. I need to 
                talk to you.

    Amanda opens the door, still chained.

                                  AMANDA
                I told the woman, I can t talk to you.

    Harrison holds up his cell with a photo of Vanessa s corpse.

                                  HARRISON
                You wanted to know how she died. This 
                is how. Strangled to death while she 
                was unconscious. She never had a 
                chance. There s no way you did this, 
                so why are you acting like a killer?

    She starts to close the door but he blocks it.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                Amanda, the person you re running from 
                is the person I want to get. Help me.

    We can almost see the surrender in her eyes.

    INT. CLB - NIGHT

      A cacophony of bodies, lights, haze, booze, sexuality - all 
    gyrating to a pounding, non-stop beat.

    Ali moves her way through the crowded dance floor, dressed to 
    kill. Suddenly, a young PRETTY BOY comes up behind her and 
    grabs her hips, pressing himself inappropriately close.

                                  ALI
                I don t believe you asked me dance.

                                  PRETTY BOY
                I don t believe I need to, mama.

    Ali turns around seductively and grabs the guy, hard, by his 
    nipple. It does not feel good.

                                  ALI
                Do I still remind you of your mama?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                I m sorry. I m sorry. Let go.

    She releases him.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  49.

                Damn. You don t have to go all 
                Angelina on me. I thought you were one 
                of Victor s girls.

                                  ALI
                Victor s girls?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                Yeah, I thought you were on the menu. 
                My bad.

    Ali takes it in, plays dumb.

                                  ALI
                Hey, it s all good. I m looking for a 
                  girlfriend of mine. Maybe you know her 
                  - Vanessa Blake?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                Amanda s friend?

                                  ALI
                Yeah, that s right.

                                  PRETTY BOY
                  I haven t seen her tonight. But her 
                crew are over there by the bar.

    Ali turns to see a GROUP OF UNBELIEVABLY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG 
    GIRLS, dressed to be seen. They are largely of Latino descent. 

    INT. BLAKE HOUSE ENTRYWAY  - NIGHT

    Little has changed.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know you were at my apartment last 
                night. The cops know you were there, 
                too.

                                  BLAKE
                I just wanted to talk to her. 

                                    MICHAEL
                Hard for her to talk with your hands 
                wrapped around her throat.

                                  BLAKE
                Are you insane? You murder my wife and 
                you re trying to pin it on me?

                                    MICHAEL
                DROP THE ACT! YOU STALKED HER! YOU

                And when she still wouldn t back down, 
                you choked her to death, you son of a 
                bitch.

                                  BLAKE
                Listen to me, you piece of garbage - 
                you want to play psycho games with me? 
                Fine. Let s call the cops. Have them 
                hook us up to a couple of lie 
                  detectors. You tell your story, I ll 
                tell mine. I loved that girl more than 
                  anything. I never raised a hand to 
                her, ever. And if I have to spend the 
                rest of my life in jail for the crap I 
                am guilty of, I ll do it -just to put 
                you away for what you ve done. 

    Michael is desperately trying to make sense of the man and the 
    story before him.

    INT. AMANDA S APARTMENT - OAKWOODS

    Amanda is sitting with Harrison.

                                  AMANDA
                I didn t know her that long. She left 
                her husband, I needed a roommate...

                                  HARRISON
                Why did she leave him? Was she afraid 
                of him?

                                  AMANDA
                No, she was angry. He was into some 
                bad stuff. I don t know what. She was 
                so damn righteous all the time.
                            (full of emotion)
                She ruined everything.

                                  HARRISON
                How?

    INT. CLB - CONTINUOUS

    Ali arrives at the circle of  Victor s  girls. These girls are 
    barely out of their teens.

                Excuse me. I m looking for Amanda. 
                Have you guys seen her tonight?

    This elicits some giggles from the girls.

                                  GIRL#1
                She doesn t come here anymore.

                Are you her friends, too?

                You should talk to Victor. Vanessa 
                doesn t come here anymore.

                                  ALI
                I know she doesn t.

    Ali takes out her cell phone. A PICTURE of Vanessa dead in the 
    bed. The girls stagger. Now there is fear, in all of them.

                                  GIRL#2
                Who are you?

                  A friend. This shouldn t have happened 
                to Vanessa. I m trying to make sure it 
                doesn t happen to anyone else. So 
                maybe you can talk to me?

    The girls eye each other, looking for a response.

                She wanted to be an actress. I took 
                her to the club. I thought... She 
                would meet people. Maybe they would 
                give her a chance. I didn t think he

                I have many acquaintances. Their

                concern. As for your claim of 
                  prostitution - they are ridiculous. I 
                have fostered careers, nurtured 
                talent. The girls I take an interest 
                in thrive. How can that be

    Reese tilts his head sideways. What is going on?

    INT. CLB - VIP LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

    Cornered and frantic, everybody moves fast. 

    Ali goes to grab a pistol from her thigh holster. Galindo 
    intercepts her, grabs the gun and pulls her into him. He s now 
    got the gun at her head.

    Harrison starts to move toward them as the Bodyguard slams him 
    back against the wall and pulls a gun to his head. 

     Cameron  is frozen between all of them.

                                   CAMERON 
                Victor, security issues suddenly 
                abound.

                                    GALINDO
                Shut up!*

                                  ALI
                You want to shoot me? Do you have the 
                guts to look me in the face? Or will 
                you be the same coward you were with 
                Vanessa?

                                    GALINDO
                SHE WAS NOTHING! She comes to my 
                place. She defies me! She humiliates 
                me. Challenges me in front of my 
                people. And still, I let her walk.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  61.

                Because you had nothing to hold her 
                with.

                                    GALINDO
                I LET HER WALK! And that bitch, that 
                whore comes back and threatens me?

                What does she think I am? Walks in 
                here to play me - with this Michael 
                Kass - a loser who acted like a tough 
                guy on TV? The whore brings a clown to 
                take me down? Screw her! And screw 
                him, too. I should have killed them 
                both. 

                                   CAMERON 
                I agree.

    Everyone freezes, out of confusion if nothing else.

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                I ve never trusted clowns. They rarely 
                amuse. And why? Because they are silly 
                men beneath silly masks. But remove 
                the mask...

     Cameron  removes his wig and prosthetic pieces as he 
    speaks...

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                And they re not so silly anymore. 
                Hello Victor, I m Michael Kass.

    Galindo and his guard are both stunned. 

    In that split second, Ali grabs at Galindo s gun and spins 
    away from him. But what she s holding onto is not his gun, BUT 
    HIS PROSTHETIC FINGER. 

    Galindo aims at Ali. 

    The guard has been distracted by all the action. Harrison 
    deftly deflects the gun from this head, grabs the Bodyguard s 
    arm and uses the weapon to SHOOT Galindo.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  62.

    Galindo hits the ground as Harrison disables the guard.

    Reese and LAPD burst in, guns drawn.

                Reese! Situation contained.

    Michael runs over to Ali. They stare at each other a moment.

                                    MICHAEL
                  I couldn t get that confession you 
                wanted.

    Ali pulls out the conceal wire.

                                  ALI
                            (glowing)
                I did.

    All they can do is smile at each other.

    EXT. CLB - NIGHT

    SEVERAL OFFICERS are making arrests and taking statements. 

    A LARGE CROWD AND REPORTERS are held back from the scene.

    Victor is wheeled out on a gurney and placed in the back of an 
    ambulance.

                                  ALI
                            (holding the fake 
                              finger)
                You might want to give this back to 
                him.

    Reese examines it for a second.

                                  REESE
                What s with the phony finger?

                                    MICHAEL
                I still don t understand. There was no 
                evidence that tied Galindo to my 
                  apartment. He s smart enough to know 
                that. How d you get him to break?

                                  ALI
                He forgot about the security cameras 
                there.

                                    MICHAEL
                What are you talking about? Those 
                cameras haven t worked in years.

                                  ALI
                I know that, but Victor didn t. By the 
                way, you owe your neighbor, Mr. Lee, a 
                signed photo. He s a big fan.

    Galindo reacts as the ambulance pulls away.

                                  HARRISON
                I got a question. When did you bring 
                Reese in on this?

                                  ALI
                After I talked to the old man. His 
                  description of Galindo was spot on. 
                The rest of it was just a hunch. But 
                it was one Reese was willing to play.

                                  HARRISON
                              (to Reese)
                I didn t think you were on our side.

                I ll always back a good cop. That 
                includes you, boy wizard. You were a 
                good cop. Not everybody knows that. 
                Give it time.
                            (to Michael)
                Mr. Kass, I always liked your show. 
                              (to Ali)
                  Detective, maybe we can help each 
                other out again sometime.

    Reese heads off to his officers.

                                    MICHAEL
                How do I thank you?

                We did more than save my butt today. 
                We did the right thing for a pretty 
                stand-up young lady. She was a great 
                girl. And maybe she didn t die for 
                nothing. I like being part of that.

                I was good. Come on, admit it. You

                                  HARRISON
                That s true.

                                  ALI
                Shut up!

                                    MICHAEL
                This could be great for me, Allison. 
                It s real acting again. It was alive 
                and dangerous. I haven t felt like 
                this in years. And it meant something. 
                We did that. And we could do it again.

                                  ALI
                Michael, listen to me...

                                    MICHAEL
                Plus, we could spend some time 
                  together. It d be good for us. Good 
                for the kids.

                                  ALI
                Michael - listen to me - we re over. I 
                love you. You re the father of my 
                  children. I m so glad you re trying to 
                  straighten out your life. I m hopeful 
                you ll make it this time. But there s 
                no us. There s no this. This was 
                insanity today. And I left you because 
                I don t want any more insanity in my 
                life. 

    She kisses his cheek, sweetly.
