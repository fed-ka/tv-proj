Which is under siege by ROYALISTS trying to board the
overcrowded train and the REVOLUTIONARIES who are trying
to stop them.
A TOURING CAR pulls up RIGHT ON THE TRACKS behind the
caboose as the train starts to pull away.
Tatiana and Anastasia climb out of the car and race for
the train, fighting their way through the frenzied and
frightened crowd. WE HEAR shouts of "The Empress - let
her through!" which helps clear the way.
Anastasia reaches the train first, then turns to see
Tatiana. trying to catch up.
ANASTASIA
Hurry, Grandmama!
TATIANA
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Anastasia refuses to board the train.
UP AHEAD
A MOB OF REVOLUTIONARIES block the tracks with a TRUCK
ON ANASTASIA
who pushes Tatiana up the stairs of the caboose. This
puts Anastasia a few steps behind as the train speeds
up. Tatiana is gripped by other passengers as she
reaches out to Anastasia.
TATIANA
Grab my hand!
Anastasia reaches up and takes Tatiana's hand.
ANASTASIA
Don't let go!
CLOSE ON
the TWO HANDS. then suddenly. her small hand is pulled
from Tatiana's grasp and falls out of the frame.
TATIANA (O.C.)
ANASTASIA!
ON ANASTASIA
who has stumbled, hitting the ground hard.
ON TATIANA
horrified, screaming:
TATIANA
ANASTASIA!
Tatiana rushes to jump off the train after her, but is
caught and held back by the ROYALIST PASSANGERS as the
train CRASHES through the truck and picks up speed.
TATIANA's POV:
Anastasia rising from the ground, her hand outstretched.
But she is suddenly swallowed up by the mob.

ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots.
The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half,
sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.
From the
depths of the snow we HEAR her voice.
ANYA (O.C.)
I hope there's no snow in
Paris. . .
HILLSIDE - DAWN
A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the
horizon. Anya stands at
edge of the hill, looking
down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray
orphanage looms behind her. Anya "borrows" an old,
beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the
hill.
Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on
her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises
and St. Petersburg looms nearer.
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS -
- full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her
rickety bike toward the city. "Her heart is on its way"
and nothing is going to stop her.
Anya passes though the countryside toward the city. A
peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy
Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very
fancy car zooms by.
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from
a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long
as she finds her real family.
People stare at her as she rides into the edge of the
city. She is captivated by all the activity:
cars,
busses, stores, long lines of people, etc.
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE"
(CONT.)
Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be
someone who has a clue to her identity.
She'll stop at
nothing to find the someone who once loved her.
SOARING
MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION.
END MUSICAL NUMBER
Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a
HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk
by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts
across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She
watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the
angry pack.
On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley
after him.
ALLEY - DAY
Meetoo is trapped.
The PACK surrounds him, ready to
pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle.
The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya
and Meetoo.
Anya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . .
growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious
as possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's
a girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave,
behind her and growls along with her.
Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder.
The pack has definately had enough - some start to back
out quizzically, others turn and run like hell.
Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully,
wagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it
back in his mouth.
ANYA
I think you should be more
careful about who you invite to
dinner!
Meetoo nods and lets out a little "bark" that sounds as
if he were saying "retu".
Anya pats him and heads back
to her bike.
ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY
Anya rides down the street. She doesn't see Meetoo,
running like a little maniac behind her.
Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign
over the door: "The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy".
She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo,
breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost
reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face.
He
slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.
BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY
Anya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo
and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in
lines for everything:
bread, gas, clothes, etc.
ANYA
(to herself)
Dmitri? There must be a
million Dmitris. . .
FOLLOW ANYA
as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting
tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets.
Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air.
Her eyes
widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating
through the air.
She spins around and sees Serebreakov
DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET.
Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.
He turns in
her direction just as a bus passes.
Anya is gone.
We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it
drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping
- he knows he'll never catch up to her now.
Then he
sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off
into the mud.
Happily, Meetoo trots off in her
direction.
Anya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in
front of a cafe.
PEASANT 9
(to Peasant 10)
Which line is this?
PEASANT 10
The line to get into the line.
ANYA
Excuse me, do you know
Dmitri. . .
PEASANT 9
I know nothing!
PEASANT 10
Nothing!
PEASANTS 9 & 10
(whispering
simultaneously)
Try the tavern/ library.
They begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers
as to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library.
Exasperated, Anya walks away.
They call after her.
PEASANTS9& 10
But we didn't tell you!
Anya rolls her eyes in frustration.
She doesn't see
Meetoo at her feet.
ANYA
(To herself)
I wish they'd all stop telling
me they didn't tell me!
Meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement. Anya looks down and
sees him.
ANYA (CONT.)
What are you doing. . .
Just then, she catches another whiff of something foul
in the air. Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses
Meetoo. Anya peeks out. A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead
fish and rotten food passes Anya.
She sighs with relief,
it wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him.
Anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET
ARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY
HUSBAND looks over his shoulder.
TINY HUSBAND
(To Artist)
Could you get rid of her
moustache?
ANYA
Excuse me - I'm looking for a
man named Dmitri. . .
The Artist quickly scribbles and address on his pad and
hands it to her without turning around.
ARTIST
But I didn't write it.
Anya looks down at the note

She rushes the steps.
ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE - CONTINUOUS
DMITRI
She could be right under our
nose
Anya is running up the stairs as Dmitri walks out and
they COLLIDE:
her forehead banging Dmitri literally
under his nose.
Dmitri grabs his upper lip in pain.
DMITRI
(over reacting)
Ouch!
That really hurt!
ANYA
I'm sorry. . .
I'm. . .
DMITRI
That's quite a hard head you've
got there, boy.
In her old hand-me-down boys clothes andhat pulled low,
she could easily be mistaken for a boy.
ANYA
(breathless)
I'm looking for Dmitri.
I need
traveling papers - to Paris. I
heard Dmitri could help me.
Vladimir and Dmitri exchange a look. . .
wary. . .
Dmitri
looks around and motions to Vladimir to handle it while
he walks ahead nonchalantly.
VLADIMIR
Who did you hear it from?
ANYA
I heard it from everyone who
said I didn't hear it from
them!
Do you know Dmitri?
Dmitri keeps walking ahead followed by Vladimir. Anya
is determined not to give up and keeps up with Vladimir
even though she keeps getting bumped and pulled off
track by people walking in the opposite direction.
VLADIMIR
(loudly, acting)
Providing travel papers is
illeagal!
(then, quietly)
I know Dmitri well - perhaps I
can help you.
Providded you
have enough money to pay for
this service. . .
ANYA
Well, I don't have any money . . .
VLADIMIR
Good day!
Vladimir pats her on the head and walks away.
ANYA
I have a bike!
Perhaps I could
sell it and. . .
Vladimir keeps walking, catching up to Dmitri.
Anya runs back around to the front of the building where
she left her bike.
She stops suddenly when she realizes
that there is no bicycle there anymore - just Meetoo.
ANYA (CONT.)
What are you doing here?
And
where's my bike?
A POLICEMAN strolls by.
ANYA (CONT.)
Officer!
My bike has been stolen!
POLICEMAN
Nonsense.
There is no crime in
the Soviet Socialist Republic.
And he keeps walking. Anya realizes that there is no
hope in pursuing the policeman so she heads off to find
Vladimir - who has vanished down the street.
Meetoo
starts to follow her.
ANYA
Sorry, boy, I have to go.
Meetoo barks "retu" and starts after her.
ANYA (CONT.)
No.
You can't come with me.
I'm leaving. . .
Meetoo barks his "retu" and starts after her again.
ANYA (CONT.)
(laughing)
It sounds like you're saying
"me too".
Listen little guy, I
have money, no food. . .
and
no bicycle.
I'm the last
person you should be following!
Anya pats him on the head and heads off in the direction
of Vlad and Dmitri.
Meetoo, of course, follows her.
FURTHER DOWN THE STREET
Anya spots Vladimir and Dmitri turning the corner in the
distance.
Anya runs, trying to catch up with them.
She
turns the corner and STOPS.
ANYA'S POV
the PALACE in the distance, only now it's run down,
boarded up and partially burned.
Anya is taken back.
She stares, fascinated by it -
moved by it .
As the sun sets behind the Palace, it's
bathed in a beautiful golden light.
PALACE AT ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT
Anya approaches, tentative and glancing around.
She
tries to open the door but it won't budge, so she moves
to a boarded up window.
She looks through a crack in a
board.
PALACE
Anya uses a stick to pry off some of the window boards.
We HEAR a crack.

BARTOK'S POV
The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of

Finally, in the distance, we see
the orange glow of a fire.
GYPSY CAMP - NIGHT
Bartok swoops along the wagons.
Everyone looks to be
asleep.
Bartok keeps flying until he sees an OMINOUS

Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open

Dmitri looks at Anya, her back toward him, as he raises
his arm to her.
DMITRI
Find out the truth - come to
Paris with us.
Anya expression registers her internal debate. What if
it's true... It couldn't be... but if... Then,
ANYA
All right. I will go with you.
Meetoo lets out his "retu". Vladimir lets out a whoop of
joy. Dmitri smiles and bows to Anya.
DMITRI

BARTOK

And have fun...
The Minions take off. Rasputin laughs wildy.
END MUSICAL NUMBER
Anya and Metoo doze near a fire along with the other
PEASANTS waiting for the train. Dmitri looks over Vladimir's
shoulder nervously watching his forging their travel papers.
DMITRI
Hurry up with those papers.
VLADIMIR
Would you have leaned over
Rembrant's shoulder and told
him to paint faster?
Vladimir looks at Dmitri's anxious face.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)
You probably would.
(hands his the papers)
They're still wet.
A TRAIN WHISTLE SLOWS and Vlad Moves to Anya.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
DMITRI
(correcting)
"Wake up, your highness" - we should
start getting used to saying it.
VLADIMIR
What a world - a man who was in
my position in society is calling
a peasant 'Your Highness".
Dmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly.
DMITRI
(to Anya)
Wake up!
Anya's
eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts
Dmitri in the nose. Ditri reels back,
lands on his butt -
Vladimir observes ruefully.
VLADIMER
We have a lot of work to do...
Vladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the
way as they head for the train. Vlad climbs on just as
it starts up, followed	by Dmitri. Dmitri turns back and
reaches out his hand to help Anya up. But she
freezes... just STANDS THERE, not running.
ANYA'S POV
DMITRI
Come on!
Dmitri on the train, his band extended - just like
Tatiana's was. Although Anya can't quite remember,
something about this terrifies bar. She snaps out
of it when Meetoo nips her ankle.
Anya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and
runs for the train.
DMITRI
Take my hand!
Anya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without
touching his.
Anya. Dmitri and Vlad step out on a platform and see
there is no place left to run. Only the engine is
ahead of them.
DMITRI
Wait here!
He leaps up gracefully, grabbing the edge of the roof,
and pull& himself up.
ANYA
(to Vlad)
Would you like to tell what we are...
as Dmitri's head, upside down, appears from the roof.
DMITRI
Come on up!
ANYA
Why?
Vladimir picks Anya from up from tobehind and hoists
her up to Dmitri. She hollers.
Anya is pulled up by Dmitri, with a force that knocks
them both over Anya on top. An awkward moment. Anya
rolls off him as Dmitri tries to catch the breath she
knocked out of him.
ANYA
Just what do you think you're doing?!
DMITRI
Trying... to... breathe...
Suddenly, Meetoo appears, as if he were flying and
lots out a little "retu". Vladimir has tossed his
up and Dmitri catches his, band his to Anya, and
reaches down to Vladimir.
Minion one grabs for Vladimir's legs, just as
they disappear.
Dmitri and Anya let out a sigh of relief as Vlad in
safe, but it's short lived as they both SIMULTANEOUSLY
lot out a yell.
DMITRI & ANYA'S POV:
a TUNNEL rapidly approaching.
They hit the deck, Vlad on his back between Anya and
Dmitri.	Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as the
tunnel gets closer - Vladimir's stomach is sticking up
too high to clear the tunnel. They reach up together
and push down on his big belly, causing his eyes to
bulge
ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIN
The minions, now climbing up the side are plunged into
total darkness.
ON THE ROOF
light hits as the train comes out of the tunnel.
Vlad lets out a gasp as they release his belly.
Just then a Minion hand reaches up over the edge.
Dmitri assumes it's a Guard.
DMITRI
The guards!
(Anya gives his a lack)
I'll explain later.
Anya and Vlad follow Dmitri toward the back of the train.
ON THE MINIONS
now on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance.
ON ANYA AND THE OTHERS
running, without looking back. jumping from car to car,
passing Meetoo like a football. Vladiair makes a huge
running leap into the air...
The TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see
her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black
smoke of the engine. Behind them, Anya can another tunnel.
TUNNEL
They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya
and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel.
They push it down.
ON THE MINIONS
An the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when
they realize it's too late for them. The train roars the
tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &"'not the sift of
the mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which
they were created.
Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching
his well laid plan *go up in smoke", and lots out a
simmering growl.
Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing
with Dmitri and Vladiair.
ANYA
Forged papers! Now, what?!
DMITRI
Now just get off the train.
ANYA
HUH?!
Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes
her head slowly.
ANYA
Noooo....
VLADIMIR
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man
of my stature should not have to
Dmitri shoves him off the top of the train with Meetoo
in his arm. Dmitri then puts out his hand to Anya.
DMITRI
Come on, we'll jump together...
Take my hand.
Dmitri turns forward and sees the train is approaching
a HIGH RAILROAD BRIDGE over a rocky ravine. It's now
or never.
DMITRI
Come on!
ANYA
No!
With his outstretched hand, Dmitri shoves her off the bar.
Vladimir has landed in a large pile of snow. He stands,
rubbing his bottom.
VLADIMIR
I think I have hurt my...
Meetoo comes out of the pile of leaves, rubbing his
bottom and answers Vladimir's with his "retu".
A short distance away, Anya seems to be sitting on
top of a puddle - but she isn't wet. Suddenly, Dmitri
gets up from underneath her, covered in snow. Anya
isn't wet because she landed on Dmitri! She jumps up.
DMITRI
You must enjoy causing me pain!
ANYA
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Vladimir and Meetoo come over.
VLADIMIR
Is everyone all right?
ANYA
I'm fine.
DMITRI
She's fine!
(limping away)
I may never walk right again,
but she's fine...
Rasputin, on his obsessed mission, leaps on top of the
wagon as Bartok, still dizzy, tries to catch up.
RASPUTIN
We'll catch her and finish her!
(he grabs the, reigns)
We ride this night!
Rasputin then looks down and sees that there are no horses
harnessed he gave then to the begins a slow growl.
BARTOK
Well,	we wait this night!
Anya is walking ahead with Vladiair as Dmitri follows
he's still muddy, wet and unhappy.
VLADIMIR
No have a lot of work to do,
Anya! Come along, Meetoo!
Meetoo is trying to catch fire flies in his mouth.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)
We have to prepare you for an
audience with Sophie.
ANYA
Who's Sophie?
VLADIMIR
(lost in warm memories)
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The
ravishing first cousin, once
removed, from the Empress. We
must convince Sophie that you
are the Princess before we'll
be granted a meeting with the
Empress ... your grandmother,
I mean.
Anya stops dead in her tracks, this is the first she's
heard of this.
ANYA
What?!
Dmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back
of Anya. Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is
rubbing his now sore shoulder.
ANYA (CONT.)
You never said anything to me
about having to prove I'm a
Princess!
DMITRI
You are the Princess.
VLADIMIR
We're just going to refresh
your memory...
ANYA
I don't have a memory and I'm
not a Princess!
(looks down at herself)
Even if I were - no one's ever
going to believe it. I'm not
exactly...
Anya searches for the -word as she sits down next
to a frozen pond.
ANYA (CONT.)
(sadly to herself)
... good enough...
(to others)
I can't go through with this!
Dmitri sits next to Anya and looks at her reflection
in the ice.
DMITRI
What do you see?
ANYA'S POV
her smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands
come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and
them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly,
look pretty.
DMITRI(CONT.)
See? The Princess is under there ...
VLADIMIR
Ah! Let us begin!
A POSSIBLE VLADIMIR SONG
Vladimir would begin to sing here, telling Anya that she
has a lot to learn. The music would probably have a
LIGHT, SOMEWHAT COMEDIC tone, and would be just a SHORT
SECTION OF SINGING, which would then SEGUE TO UNDERSCORE
for the scenes of instruction which follow.
We see the three of them from behind, walking down a
road - Meetoo trots behind them, happily.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)
You were born on the Adriatic sea at
the summer palace, where the parties
and the buffets were marvelous ....
Vladimir is putting icicles in Anya's hair to keep it
up in a bun - she looks sweet, despite her boy's clothes.
She is reciting something to Dmitri.
ANYA
...and on my father's side,
there was [THIS SECTION IS NOT LEDGABLE]
Anya thinks as Dmitri looks at a long sheet of
paper, prompting her.
DMITRI
Every Russian family has one..
ANYA
(gets it)
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!-
but we called her Nashie
Fooshie!
VLADIMIR
Did I tell you that?
ANYA
You must have.
Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir are sitting in the back of a
pig cart traveling down a country road. The pigs are very
interested as Anya is pointing to different pieces of hay
which "set" her imaginary table.
ANYA
(repeating)
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .
(can't remember, then
exasperated)
[THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
DMITRI
(hinting)
It's the best fork of all
ANYA
The dessert fork!
VLADIMIR
(lost in a memory of
rich desserts)
Ah, yes ... I have always loved
that fork...
Dmitri and Anya exchange a look and then laugh,
adding ad libs of "we can tell" and "There's a
fork you should have skipped". This is the first
time Dmitri and Anya have laughed together -
actually the first time he's ever seen her smile.
Dmitri, who is sneaking around, pulling women's clothes
out of a suitcase that clearly isn't theirs! He takes
out a large, but pretty dress, a beautiful veil - and a
huge brassiere, which he quickly stuffs back in the
suitcase - somewhat frightened. He takes the dress and
veil puts it in his backpack and joins Vladimir and Anya
as they admire the ship.
ANYA
What a beautiful ship!
DMITRI
It used to be a private yacht
before the government took it over.
VLADIMIR
Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel
of elaborate elegance in entertaining...
(looks at Dmitri and Anya explaining)
A party boat. It once belonged to ...
Vladimir honestly can't remember, Anya thinks it's
another quiz.
ANYA
Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
Dmitri and
Vladimir exchange a quizzical look. No
one told her that...
Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished
ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them.
She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo.
ELDERLY DOWAGER
No, no, boys! You don't know where
he's been!
They give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo
looks a little hurt.
Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens
and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist
of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri
and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with
confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder.
"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE)
The tone of the song would now change - - the older,
wiser person watching as two younger people are
unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be
light, as are the visuals here, but there would be
an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would
end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary
embrace.
MONTAGE: (MOS)
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully
down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion.
Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion.
Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.
IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's
been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where
Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole
against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya -
she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her
covers and she SLUGS him.
UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing
feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY
PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally
see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine
shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo
grabs them in his mouth and runs.
ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled
shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling
like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.
Anya turns to them.
ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's
shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him
with great vindication.
BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and
graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and
completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri
applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks
him with her head accidently.
THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes
gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is
directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together,
with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left
and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither
of them even try to readjust.
END MONTAGE
STILL IN THE SCENE
Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he
knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away
from Dmitri.
VLADIMIR
You are a natural! I don't know
how you ever learned to dance
that well! That must have been
some high class orphanage ...
As a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl
and the waves become more violent.
REVERSE ANGLE
just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see
Rasputin's face.
The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin
stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea
demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the
icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing.
RASPUTIN
(low, slow)
She's out there ...
The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging
upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm.
BARTOK
I'm getting a chest cold..
RASPUTIN
Bartok... a question.
BARTOK
I'm getting pneumonia. I have
a fever. Feel my forehead...
RASPUTIN
What do you think is the most
humiliating way to die?
Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the
answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his
beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the
wagon. Bartok follows.
BARTOK
My cousin Mischa, nice fellow
had some dental problems - you
didn't want to watch him eat,
let's put it that way...
Rasputin steps in
Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches
as it disappears into the horizon of the water.
Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.
Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully
through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day.
She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks
up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover
the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she
HEARS A GROWL.
Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees.
(All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT
resemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE
BEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back
away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS
and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape.
It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply
and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes
to the safety of a large tree
She climbs the tree and
escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy
branch, the ground seems miles away.
Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold
on to it tightly. But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD
HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with
red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her!
Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake.
She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED
YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP
TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.
A BURST OF SUNLIGHT
as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed
and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the
beautiful sunny wheat field.
Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently
in the storm, as she smiles.
IN HER DREAM
Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of
a BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful
little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water;
laughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a
low flowering wall to look closer.
PULL BACK
REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck
and is looking into the black ocean... smiling.
DISSOLVE TO:
A SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE
It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the
reliquary.
Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water.
IN HER DREAM
Anya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward
her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from
the frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted
to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who
they are to her.
Anya is standing right on the edge of death...
IN HER DREAM
She isn't there. He of his bed.
the FAMILY is waving to her. NICHOLAS waves for her to
jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and
moves to jump in...
Anya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black
waves. She takes one step out when... DMITRI GRABS HER
SHOULDERS.
Anya JOLTS awake from her dream. Confused at first,
then terrified to see what almost happened to her.
isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing
and looks at her.
DMITRI
What were you doing?!
Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking
and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms
around Dmitri and holds him tightly.
Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms
around her.
DMITRI (CONT.)
It's okay now - I've got you.
You're safe...
They stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace,
their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME, as seen through the reliquary
Rasputin watches ... seething quietly, as Bartok peeks
meekly over his shoulder.
BARTOK
Boy, don't you hate it when
that happens?
RASPUTIN
(controlling)
She leads a charmed life, that
little one ... Someone is always
there to save her. In the palace
as a child, on the train and now
... it's him.
Rasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and
Anya still in a warm embrace.
BARTOK
Nice looking fellow. I mean,
don't get me wrong - I'm not
attracted to him in the physical
sense, I just ...
But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the
reliquary and speaks directly to it.
RASPUTIN
You are toying with me, aren't
you? You let me get so close...
The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling.
Rasputin smiles and joins in with it.
RASPUTIN (CONT.)
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
BARTOK
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me.
Ever try and fly after one of
those heavy sauces?
Rasputin returns the reliquary to its cabinet.
RASPUTIN
We are going to Paris - and while
we're there, let's kill the young
man. He annoys me.
As Anya walks down the plank her dress gets caught
on a nail. Dmitri is walking toward her as she yanks her
dress free and accidentally punches him in the stomach.
Dmitri takes it like a man.
ANYA
Oh! I'm sorry...
DMITRI
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank
with Meetoo - they exchange an "oh boy" look, both
noticing that clearly something is different between
Anya and Dmitri. Anya catches something out of the
corner of eye and turns quickly.
CLOSE ON a sign: "Paris 30 kilometers"
Anya walks away from Dmitri and over to the sign
and looks at it longingly.
ANYA
(to herself)
I'm almost there... I'm finally
going to know...
AT THE OTHER END OF THE DOCK
Vladimir stares into his purse, depressed.
DMITRI
How is our current financial status?
VLADIMIR
If I used the word "bleak" I would
be optimistic.
As he says this the ELDERLY DOWAGER from the ship
passes by with her TWO OBNOXIOUS PUG DOGS. Meetoo
growls as Vlad and Dmitri get an idea.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)
The "Odessa Dunk"?
DMITRI
It worked in Odessa...
Vladimir picks up Meetoo and whispers instructions.
Meetoo likes the plan.
NEW ANGLE
as Meetoo races past the PUGS. They ignore him, so he
stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry",
which piques them a little. Meetoo then bends over and
waves his furry little butt at them. Now the PUGS are
offended and TAKE OFF after him, yapping all the way.
Meetoo turns and scrambles with the Pugs in hot pursuit.
As they get closer, Meetoo SUDDENLY STOPS and the Pugs
go FLYING OFF they edge of the dock and into the water
below. Meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'Boy,
are you guys morons look as the ELDERLY DOWAGER runs
up screaming.
ELDERLY DOWAGER
Help! My little dogs! Chevalier! Maurice!
Hold on, darlings!
Dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.
DMITRI
I'll save them, Madame
Dmitri dives into the water as Vlad rushes up behind
the Elderly Dowager. Anya watches from a distance as
Dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked
(and pissed) Pugs.
VLADIMIR
Such bravery! Why, that man should
be rewarded! Amply rewarded!
MINUTES LATER
Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches.
ANYA
That was really very kind of you.
She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with
Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A
little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad.
VLADIMIR
I won't say a word...
Traveling is style! Vladimir is driving - badly - with
Meetoo in the front seat. Meetoo covers his eyes. Dmitri
and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful
French countryside.
Dmitri looks over at Anya.
DMITRI
Nervous?
ANYA
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie,
I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
DMITRI
You'll convince her. You have the
qualities of a princess you're
poised and strong... and beautiful
... even if you forget a couple
dates of family names - she'll know.
Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence
she has is because of him. She takes his hand but
looks away.
They pull up in front of the beautiful white house.
Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door
ahead of Dmitri and Anya. Vladimir knocks. Sophie
answers the door.
She moves with grace and regal poise.
VLADIMIR
May I present her Royal
Highness Princess Anastasia!
SOPHIE
Oh good! We haven't seen an
Anastasia in several days!
Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last
comment. Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy"
signal.
They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into
the house.
Vladimir has finished giving Dmitri the details.
Both are ecstatic.
VLADIMIR
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're
going to see Tatiana at the ballet
tonight and we're going to be rich!
Rich!
DMITRI
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
VLADIMIR
(shocked)
Are you feeling all right?
ANYA (CONT.)
(deeply grateful)
But you never doubted who I was,
did you, Dmitri? Not for a second ...
Anya gratefully kisses Dmitri an the cheek and
runs into the house. Vladimir, who's been watching,
has a warning.
VLADIMIR
Life is funny, isn't it. You find
the right girl ... and then you
lose her.
DMITRI
What do you mean?
VLADIMIR
Dmitri ... You must understand that
once you take her to Tatiana... well,
it's over... nothing can happen between
you. She's a princess and you're a
commoner.
Dmitri understands this and is devastated. Vladimir pats
him on the back as he walks into the house.
MUSIC BEGINS: BRIGHT, EXCITING, PARIS IN THE TWENTIES
Anya and Dmitri, followed by Vlad and Sophie are walking
down the Champs Elysees. Meetoo trots along after them,
happily. They walk by AN ACCORDION PLAYER and a LADY FLOWER
SELLER, who watch them and whisper to each other.
ACCORDION PLAYER
Lovers!
FLOWER SELLER
Ooh la la!
"PARIS HOLDS THE KEY TO YOUR HEART" (PRODUCTION NUMBER)
In UPTEMPO "PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of
Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad,
to Paris!
The foursome explores the city and Anya has the
happiest day of her young life. On the streets they
encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as
people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the
audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker,
Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud,
Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties..
For those in the audience who don't recognize them,
they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who SING.
As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri
is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya
to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a
short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya
visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box
for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go
off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female
poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's
wistfulness cuts against joy.
