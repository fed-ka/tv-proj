
      LOIS CLONE, breathtaking in her beautiful nightgown, stands
      watching Clark, who's in bed.  CLARK, all but panting, 
      smiles and:

                     You know, I have... imagined this
                     moment... For so long.

      He pulls back covers to make a space for her.  She smiles,
      approaches. outside, a soft roll of THUNDER.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     Hello, Mrs. Kent.

      She gets into bed, he moves in close, kisses her.

                     We've gone through so much to get 
                     to this night, but none of that 
                     matters.  It's perfect.

                     He starts to kiss her again.

      Lois Clone, in robe, dabs at her mouth with a napkin,

      pulling on robe, comes out of the bedroom.

                           (crosses to kitchen)
                     I know you like coffee.  It's one

                     Yeah well, depending on how you
                     define 'warm.'

                     To your right.  We changed 'em

                     little worried we'd gotten
                     off-track, but we're okay, right?

                     I was just thinking tonight'd be
                     even _more_ perfect if Superman                 (X)
                     were here.

      He looks at her, startled.

                     You... want.... Superman here.

                     I sure do.

      Clark considers this, figures it may be a turn-on he wasn't 
      aware of.  What the hell.

      He gives her a jaunty little smile and suddenly SPINS into
      SUPERMAN.  He stands there with an expectant grin.  Her

      The Clone has a mirror set up on her desk, holding a new top
      up to herself and admiring the view.  Clark approaches, and,
      unnoticed by Lois, tips his glasses, X-RAYS her ankle.

      that serves as a stage, backed by a guy at an upright piano.
      Wanda finishes, sashays overland in her gravelly voice:

                     So do I get the gig or not?  Just

                     Keep me away from Clark!  I've had 
                     enough of that life, I tell ya!  He 
                     ain't gonna drag me back!
                           (beat; staring off)
                     I sing the sad songs, boys.  'Cause 
                     sadness is what I know.  But it's a 
                     sadness with no face.  Who is it 
                     I'm lookin' for?



      We hear the lock UNLOCK, and the door opens. Clark, we
      from a night of searching, enters the din room, flipping on
      a light.  He looks up and his mouth falls open.

      Every image of Lois has been trashed.  A large photo has a     (X)
      meat cleaver in it.  Pictures of Lois and Clark are ripped     (X)
      in half.  Framed Lois photos are smashed.  Scrawled on the     (X)

      Clark spins and Lex Luthor, coat draped over his shoulders,
      steps from the shadowy bedroom area.  Clark's face contorts
      and he loses it, charging at Lex and slamming him up against
      a wall.

                     destroy Lois.

      grabs a phone, dials.

                     the heroine of her secret novel?!


  77  BACK TO JIMMY AND CLARK                                      77   

      Jimmy waves the print-out he made from her computer.

                                      JIMMY
                     Wanda Detroit!  Wanda's got this                (X)
                     jerk of a boyfriend named...                    (X)
                     'Clark.'  He's elusive and
                     secretive.

                                      CLARK
                     She must've written that when she
                     was mad at me.

                                      JIMMY
                     Then there's this other dude who 
                     she seriously loves.  Her hero.  
                     The guy she'd do anything for.  
                     Only he won't give her the time 
                     of day.  His name's Kent.  One 
                     thing about Lois's brain, it sure 
                     is filled with a lot of you.

                                      CLARK
                     Oh God...  Where can I find her?                (X)

                                      JIMMY
                     At the docks.  She sings at this
                     dive called The Ace-O'-Clubs.

                                      CLARK
                     Jimmy, thanks!

      He tosses the door closed as:

                                      JIMMY
                     Wait, take me with...

      SLAM!  The door is closed.  Clark yanks it back open.

                                      CLARK
                     Can't.

      He SLAMS the door again, dashes down to the bedroom.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     Luthor, I think I know where...

      But as he looks in the bedroom he finds no one.  Then he 
      notices the window is wide open.  Lex has fled.

      Bibbo is watering the liquor.  Wanda comes rushing out of 
      the back room carrying a brown paper bag.

                                      BIBBO
                     We're gonna miss you Wanda.  You're 
                     really stacked, and you enchant the 
                     clientele.

                     and blues guitars.  Story of my

                                      BIBBO
                     What about Red?

                                      WANDA
                     Aw, he's better off without me.  
                     I'm like cheap booze, Bibbo: The 
                     high ain't bad; the hangover's 
                     murder.  I'm gonna kiss the cook 
                     good-bye.

      She exits to the kitchen just as:

      The SUPER WHOOSH outside swings open the door, scattering 
      napkins, and knocking over a bottle.  Then Clark enters.
      Inside, he notices an easel next to the piano. on it is a 
      photo of Lois, under which is written "Tonight - Wanda
      Detroit."  He approaches the bar.

                                      BIBBO
                     What can I offer you today?

  80  BEHIND THE DOOR BETWEEN KITCHEN AND BAR                      80   

      Wanda listens in horror to:

                                      BIBBO (O.S.)
                     All right.  What's your name?

                     Clark.

      Wanda cringes, frightened.

                                      WANDA
                     'Clark?'

      Then she looks around, vanishes from FRAME.

                     What'd ya say your name was, buddy?

      Clark spins as CAMERA ADJUSTS to find an angry-looking Red.

                     Yes?

      And Red hauls off and slugs Clark.  Clark, stares, 
      unaffected.  Then he catches himself and feigns hurt.

      Bibbo and Red, sweating and weary, stand before Clark, both

      He finally sighs, tosses the two men lightly away from him,
      they hit the wall.  Clark strides off.                         (X)
