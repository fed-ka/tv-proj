               PEMBLETON lights cigarette, gazes around Parking Lot. In 
               b.g., through glass, SEE BAYLISS talking to MOTEL CLERK, 
               showing him photograph of Glen Holton. As PEMBLETON takes a 
               drag off his cigarette, BAYLISS emerges. PEMBLETON turns to 
               him.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Holton checked out an hour ago. 
                         Clerk's so stoned he doesn't know if 
                         Holton left by cab, on foot, or by 
                         wagon train.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He could have flown away on the wings 
                         of Icarus. What difference does it 
                         make? He's gone.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You're tired, Frank.

               BAYLISS goes to driver's side door of Cavalier, holds up 
               hand, as PEMBLETON takes out keys.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Toss 'em.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'll drive.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Give me a break. You're all over the 
                         road.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         And you think you're more awake than 
                         I am?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Yeah, I do. Unlike you, I known I'm 
                         mortal. I've been eating protein. 
                         I'm wide awake. So toss me the keys.

               A beat. PEMBLETON tosses keys across roof to BAYLISS.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Thank you.

               BAYLISS opens door, gets in, as does PEMBLETON.


               Walker and LEWIS emerge from Cavalier, cross street.

                                     LEWIS
                         Eight years, huh? Your fiancee's got 
                         a bad case of the commitment blues.

                                     WALKER
                         Looks, it's me, okay? Not him. I'm 
                         just not ready. Anything wrong with 
                         that?

                                     LEWIS
                         No, hey, it's cool.

               They approach SHEILA HOLTON, fifties, overweight, wearing 
               rubber gloves, kneels on marble stoop, scrubbing with scrub 
               brush, which she dips in bucket of water and muriatic acid.

                                     WALKER
                         That's Holton's mother.

                                     LEWIS
                         What's she given us?

                                     WALKER
                         Not a thing. According to her, she's 
                         up for Mother of the Year. And her 
                         son's only problem is he's 
                         misunderstood.

               LEWIS and WALKER approach.

                                     WALKER
                         Mrs. Holton, we need to ask you a 
                         few more questions.

                                     SHEILA
                         Who's he?

                                     LEWIS
                         Detective Lewis, ma'am.

                                     SHEILA
                         A good-looking police officer.
                              (to WALKER)
                         How come you never brought nobody 
                         good-looking with you before?

                                     WALKER
                         Good-looking? You need glasses, Mrs. 
                         Holton. Have you heard from Glen 
                         today?

                                     SHEILA
                         I'm on my knees. I got a scrub brush 
                         in my hand.
                              (gestures with brush)
                         This is the hold I got on life. It 
                         sucks. You suck. Glen sucks. Now 
                         leave me alone, unless you wanna dip 
                         your elbows in muriatic acid and 
                         give me some help.

               On WALKER and LEWIS, exchanging a frustrated glance,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH and DRUMMOND exit and approach Cavalier.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I don't want it to appear as if I'm 
                         pushy but I've always been the driver.

                                     MUNCH
                         Oh, of course. What's wrong with me? 
                         How could I have forgotten? You're 
                         the best wheel man in the Department. 
                         Stan says so.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Stan exaggerates.

                                     MUNCH
                         Not Stanley. He's the master of 
                         understatement, if anything.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         You ever go on vacation with him?

                                     MUNCH
                              (pauses)
                         We could never work out our schedules.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         The best time me and him had was a 
                         three day trip down to Mexico. Just 
                         zipped down there 'cause we dared 
                         each other. We know the wives are 
                         gonna have a conniption, but there 
                         we are anchored off Acapulco on this 
                         sixty-five foot charter. The sun, 
                         the water, we have these beautiful 
                         babes on the working crew. We're 
                         knocking back tequila shooters and 
                         caster out our lines. Checking our 
                         poles for nibbles, y'know. And Stan 
                         hooks into this marlin the size of a 
                         house.

                                     MUNCH
                         It was a yellowtail.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         A what? It was a marlin. I was there.

               as THEY get into Cavalier,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Police crime scene tape is still up and UNIFORMS guard the 
               entrance to the building as a Cavalier pulls up and parks in 
               front. MUNCH and DRUMMOND exit Cavalier and approach building.

                                     MUNCH
                         Stan showed me the pictures. He's 
                         standing with a yellowtail.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (pauses)
                         It took me, Stan, and the boat captain 
                         the whole day just to haul it out of 
                         the water.

                                     MUNCH
                         Hunh. 'Musta been a world record 
                         yellowtail. "World"? It musta been 
                         cosmic.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         We about broke our asses bringing it 
                         on deck.

                                     MUNCH
                         The biggest yellowtail tops out at a 
                         buck and a quarter.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         It was at least five hundred pounds 
                         if it was an ounce.

                                     MUNCH
                         What, Stan didn't show me the 
                         pictures?

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (pauses)
                         Why do I remember him catching a 
                         marlin?

                                     MUNCH
                         It was a yellowtail.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         It was a crappy vacation anyway. We 
                         argued the whole time. He snored. He 
                         insulted the waitresses. Stan can be 
                         such a monumental jerk.

               MUNCH shoots DRUMMOND a surprised look, then glances up at 
               building. Sergeant SALLY ROGERS approaches.

                                     ROGERS
                         I heard you guys got close to Holton 
                         last night.

               MUNCH doesn't answer, continues staring at building as if 
               mesmerized. DRUMMOND turns to ROGERS.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         We're looking for Detective Higby.

                                     ROGERS
                         He's around back in the alley.

               MUNCH and DRUMMOND go around building.


               MUNCH and DRUMMOND come around the corner of the building.  
               MUNCH looks up at building, reflects.

                                     MUNCH
                         I never even fired a shot. I had my 
                         gun up, I aimed, and I skipped. I 
                         couldn't get off a damn shot.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         It happens.

               MUNCH and DRUMMOND continue down alley. MUNCH and DRUMMOND 
               walk up to Detective WILLARD HIGBY, no toothpick in mouth, 
               who holds a plastic evidence bag.

                                     HIGBY
                         We found Holton's keys. We checked, 
                         this one opens his apartment.

                                     MUNCH
                         Where'd you find them?

                                     HIGBY
                         Next to the dumpster.

               MUNCH gazes up at roof of neighboring building, separated 
               from Holton's building by a chasm of about ten feet.

                                     MUNCH
                         You're telling me Holton jumped from 
                         his roof... to that roof?

                                     HIGBY
                         The keys must have fallen out of his 
                         pocket.

               HIGBY hands them plastic bag, DRUMMOND looks inside.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         There are four keys on this ring. 
                         What are the others?

                                     HIGBY
                         We haven't identified them yet, except 
                         for this small one. It's a subway 
                         locker. We traced the number to the 
                         Calvert Street entrance of the subway.

                                     MUNCH
                         Radio Frank Pembleton. Tell him to 
                         meet us at the subway station.

               As MUNCH and DRUMMOND head off,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               RUSSERT stands with LEWIS.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Tell me about the clerical error.

                                     LEWIS
                         Two-oh-one instead of two-one-oh. 
                         They went to the wrong apartment.

                                     RUSSERT
                         The numbers were transposed from the 
                         original file to the arrest warrant 
                         memo?

                                     LEWIS
                         So maybe Gee initialed the memo, so 
                         what? You know hot it is, how many 
                         pieces of paper cross your desk in a 
                         shift.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Wait, wait, wait. Giardello initialed 
                         the memo?

                                     LEWIS
                         Sure, he initialed it, like any other 
                         warrant --

                                     RUSSERT
                         He signed off an arrest warrant, 
                         printed with the wrong address?

                                     LEWIS
                         You're talking like what happened 
                         was somehow Gee's fault.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I'm just supposed to put together a 
                         report, that's all.

                                     LEWIS
                         Nailing Gee's butt to the wall.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I've got no choice, Meldrick. I was 
                         ordered. By Barnfather and Granger.

                                     LEWIS
                         The bosses are looking for someone 
                         to blame. And they're using you to 
                         do their dirty work. How can you do 
                         that to Gee?

                                     RUSSERT
                         I don't want to do anything to him. 
                         If he made a mistake, he made a 
                         mistake. God knows we've all made 
                         mistakes.

                                     LEWIS
                         And God knows there's always gotta 
                         be a fall guy, right?

               LEWIS exits. On RUSSERT, conflicted,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Cold and misty. A half a dozen Police Cruisers, lights off, 
               engines cut, roll up to the pier next to the Freighter. The 
               QRT OFFICERS get out and start running silently up the ramp 
               to the ship. PEMBLETON, BAYLISS, MUNCH, DRUMMOND, WALKER and 
               LEWIS follow the QRT OFFICERS.


               As the QRTs and our GUYS quietly storm the ship. PEMBLETON 
               and BAYLISS follow a QRT OFFICER down some steps into the 
               bowels of the ship. The OTHERS descend into the ship from 
               other gangways and staircases.
