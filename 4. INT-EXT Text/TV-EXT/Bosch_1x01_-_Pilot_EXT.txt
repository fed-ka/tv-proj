That peculiar mix of the magisterial and marginal that is 
downtown L.A.: lawyers, judges, law enforcement personnel and 
business executives, cheek by jowl with the homeless, the 
mentally ill, felons, ex-felons; para-legals and illegals.  

Christmas.  Holiday decorations on the lamp posts and nearby 
buildings.  In front of the federal building, a 20-foot 
tinseled Christmas tree that has seen better days.

On the steps of the plaza TWO CAMERAMEN are setting up their 
tripods, videocameras and a microphone tree.  No cameras 
allowed in federal court, so the stand ups will be outside.

Detective HARRY BOSCH -- early forties, tough, wounded -- 
stands by the statue of blindfolded Lady Justice, smoking.  
His eyes track an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE as she hustles up the 
steps and through the heavy glass doors.  He shoots his butt 
into the trash can and follows her in.



Raining.  Dark.  As Chandler narrates, Bosch raises his gun 
and aims. 4.


ROBERTO FLORES kneels in a puddle, arms up and spread wide.  

CHANDLER (V.O.)
In acting under the color of law, 
Detective Bosch shot and killed 
Roberto Flores on the evening of 
November 12th, 2010. 

Bosch fires twice.  The bullets tear into his chest. 

CHANDLER (V.O. CONT D)
Shot twice through the heart.  We 
will prove that Roberto Flores was 
unarmed.  

Flores falls backward into the puddle, his empty hands 
splashing in the alley rainwater.

CHANDLER (V.O. CONT'D) (CONT D)
We will prove that he offered no 
resistance, he offered no threat.  
We will prove that Detective Bosch 
killed an innocent man...  

CLOSE ON 

Bosch, rain dripping off his face, looking at what he s done.

Bosch holds his dripping weapon, his unblinking stare.

CHANDLER (V.O.)
The darkness engulfed him, and he 
fell.  Detective Bosch became that 
which he was sworn to fight.  A 
monster...

Bosch walks over and looks down at Flores.  By his reaction, 
not what he expected.  Off Flores, eyes wide open, unseeing --

CUT BACK TO:



A HOMELESS MAN roots in the ash can for butts, mumbling to 
himself, as Bosch smokes by the statue, watching Gloria 
 opening.  Her Newsome tape a standup report on Chandler s
words drift across the plaza...  

NEWSOME
...the wrongful death civil suit of 
veteran homicide detective Harry 
Bosch opened today in federal court 
in downtown Los Angeles.  Bosch is 
being sued by the family of Roberto 
Flores, a man Bosch believed to be 
the serial killer known as the 
Dollmaker.  
(MORE)7.

NEWSOME (CONT'D)
The family contends Flores was not 
the Dollmaker, and that he was 
unarmed the night Bosch shot and 
killed him.  The Dollmaker case was 
never solved.  Although Bosch was 
cleared by the LAPD, questions 
remain about exactly what happened 
that night...

BOSCH

looks up at someone s approach and walks quickly away.  Bosch

Speaking of which.  Can I ask you

Why didn t the city settle this

do it every week.

they tried to settle.  

He looks over to Newsome, who is interviewing a CITIZEN.

BELK (V.O.)
Ms. Chandler quoted Nietzsche.  Let 
me quote Sun Tzu, The Art of War. 
When Detective Bosch encountered 
Roberto Flores on that dark, rainy 
street three years ago, he entered 
what Sun Tzu called The Dying 
Ground.

Flores  right hand goes inside his rain coat.

Bosch yells at him to stop and put up his hands.  Flores 
draws a gun and brings it up in a two-handed grip.

BELK (V.O.)
At that point Detective Bosch had 
to fight or perish, shoot or be 
shot.  To second guess his actions 
now is impossible -- and unfair.  
 there.  We weren t11.


Bosch fires two shots to the chest before Flores can get off 
a shot.  

BELK

Flores goes down in a puddle.  Bosch lowers his gun and 
stares at what he has done.  Rain drips off his face.

CUT BACK TO:



Bosch, behind the wheel, smoking, listening to jazz radio -- 
 something with momentum.  Freddie Hubbard sHub Cap. 

Hollywood Boulevard is decked out in candy canes and tinsel 
on the light posts and glittery Christmas scenes strung above 
every intersection.  Xmas in Tinsel Town. 

He turns into the Hollywood Station parking lot.  



Bosch, with a beer, a cigarette in his mouth, gazing out over 
his city at the lights below, listening to the music.

FLASHBACK TO:



Bosch and Edgar move down the alley, carrying their weapons 
ready.  Dumpsters, abandoned cars, debris, graffiti on every 
wall.

They come to a crossing street.  They pause and look at each 
other.  Bosch signals to Edgar, motioning him to go down the 
street while he stays in the alley.   They separate.

Bosch continues down the alley alone.  Ten steps and suddenly 
Flores stands up from behind a dumpster.  He raises his hands 
and steps into the middle of the alley.  

Bosch yells at him to get on his knees and raise his hands.  
Flores complies, drops to his knees in a puddle. (To this 
point, this matches what Chandler described in her opening 
statement.) 

Bosch raises his gun --



The rain has stopped.  A BODY, covered by a body bag, lies 
where he fell, in a puddle of black water.  Camera PANS 
across the tableau of a crime scene cluster fuck: patrol 
cars; UNIFORMS; SID INVESTIGATORS and PHOTOGRAPHERS; POLICE

supervisor, a fifty-ish, sneaky, ambitious bureaucrat.  18.


Pounds confers with other SUITS, members of the Officer 
Involved Shooting team.

SID investigators  cameras FLASH off the rain slick surfaces.

Bosch is to one side, putting his weapon into an evidence bag 
held open by an OIS SUIT.

Edgar stands by, looking a little shell-shocked, talking to 
yet ANOTHER SUIT, who is noticeably not taking notes.

from the back seat.  Sixty, tall, lean, shaven head, Irving

Pounds breaks off in mid sentence with his minions and goes 
over to Irving.

Irving ignores him, zeroes in on Bosch, strides right by 
Pounds, comes to a stop in front of Bosch.  They regard each 
other with mutual contempt.

IRVING
Bosch.

BOSCH
Chief.

IRVING
In God s name, Bosch, another one?  
What the fuck happened?

Off Bosch, who just looks at him --

CUT BACK TO:



Bosch stares out into the night, seeing only the memory of 
that rainy night in that forlorn alley.  What did happen?

CROSS FADE TO:



Establishing.  Aerial shot.  A perfect, clear, sunny day. 
Bosch s car, traveling west, cruising the crest of the Santa 
Monica Mountains, Bebop on the radio.  To the north, the 
Valley and the San Gabriel Mountains.  To the south, the Los 
Angeles basin.  On the far horizon, Santa Monica Bay, the 
Pacific, and Catalina.  Harry Bosch is going to work.19.



Crime scene activity, clustered around a not-new Toyota, 
doors flung open.

Coroner's white-with-a-blue-stripe van, BODY CREW and 
INVESTIGATOR; couple patrol cars, some UNIFORMS, SID. An SID 
PHOTOGRAPHER photographs the BODY.

Bosch pulls up, gets out.  Met by a UNIFORM.  They walk as 
Bosch pulls on latex gloves.  Off Bosch's look, "Well?":

UNIFORM

chest.  Ran the plates.  Belongs to

BOSCH
Thank you for not fucking up the 
scene.

At the car, Bosch, gloves on, leans in, examines DEAD WOMAN 
slumped over the wheel, long hair covering her face.  Bosch, 
telling not asking the YOUNG MALE CORONER INVESTIGATOR:

BOSCH (CONT D)
 gonna move the body.I m

He reclines the seat, then almost tenderly moves the Dead 
Woman to an upright sitting position, one hand on the back of 
her head.  He brushes the hair out of her face: she s pretty, 
early thirties.  A small red wound over her heart. BOSCH 
notes powder burns on her blouse.  He examines her right 
hand, lifts it to his nose, inhales, gently puts it down. 
Does the same with the left hand.  Looks under her feet, 
feels under the driver's seat, shifts position, leans over 
her body, feels down in the space between seats.  Under the 
passenger seat, he finds something: a small caliber handgun. 20.


He sniffs the barrel, stands, turns, hands gun to SID Tech.  
Strips off his gloves.  Catches Uniform's eye.

BOSCH (CONT D)
Suicide.  

UNIFORM
Whoa.

BOSCH
Swab her left hand to confirm 
gunshot residue.  Send me the 
report.

Bosch turns back, contemplates Dead Woman, then looks out at 
the City of Angels.  Incomparable view, incomparable day.

BOSCH (CONT D)
(to himself)
 wanna live on a day Who wouldn t
like this?

On Bosch, gazing at the last thing she ever saw, wondering 
why here, what was she thinking when she pulled the trigger --



DR. GUYOT, elderly, walking his yellow lab, CALAMITY, on this 
glorious day, up the hill.  Gorgeous.  Flowers in December. 
Stops at the end of the street, leans down --

DR. GUYOT
You gonna be good?

He lets her off the leash.  She's off like a shot, up the 
hill, and into the woods.  As Dr. G trudges after her --



Bosch stands next to his car filling out reports, using the 
hood as a desk.  The Uniform saunters over.

UNIFORM
Suicide, huh?

BOSCH
Yep.

UNIFORM
Beautiful girl like that... I mean, 
why?21.


Without looking up Bosch points at the Hollywood sign which 
is very close on the next mountain ridge.

BOSCH
 why. That s

Bosch goes back to writing while the Uniform looks up at the 
sign and contemplates what Bosch just said.



DR. GUYOT, at the edge of the woods, leash in hand, whistling 
for his dog.  He whistles.  He calls.

DR. GUYOT
Calamity?  Here, girl.  Come on, 
girl. Come, dammit.  Calamity? 
Calamity Jane?

A rustle in the brush, and Calamity emerges from the woods.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Good girl.  Come.

She trots toward him, a dark piece of driftwood in her mouth.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Come.  Bring it here. 

He reaches down to take it from her.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Give it to me.  Leave it.  Leave 
it.  Calamity --

She growls and bares her teeth.  Dr. Guyot frowns, leans in, 
takes a closer look.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
What do you have there, girl?

Calamity growls again, guarding her prize -- 



Bosch looks up at steep wooded hillside.  Gauges the light, 
looks at watch, mutters to himself, heads for --



The door is opened by a strikingly attractive officer in her 
mid-thirties, JULIA BRASHER.  She makes the uniform look 
good.  Bosch shows his badge, steps in --



Bosch, one foot on the bumper, trunk open, lacing work boots. 
Brasher gets out of the patrol car and approaches.27.


BRASHER
Going up to look?

BOSCH

out here again tomorrow.

Sorry about butting in with the 
doctor.  You were trying to 
establish rapport.

BOSCH

Their eyes meet.  The moment s broken as Dr. Guyot comes out 
with Calamity on a leash and Brasher turns at the sound.  
Bosch glances down into the trunk, sees his flashlight, 
checks if Brasher's watching, covers it with an oil rag.  He 
grabs a roll of crime scene tape and a digital camera, slams 
the trunk closed, turns to her. 

BOSCH (CONT D)
 going to get dark up Listen, it s
there and I forgot my flashlight --

BRASHER
Use mine.

She smiles, slides hers off her belt and gives it to him.

BOSCH
You sure?

BRASHER
Sure.28.


DR. GUYOT
Ready.

BRASHER
I ll go up with you.

Bosch nods, pleased. She signals Edgewood in the car, points 
up hill. But Edgewood pulls the car up, lowering his window.

EDGEWOOD
Just got a hot shot, partner. 
Double D.

BRASHER
I hate domestic disputes.

BOSCH
(dryly)
Me, too.  Especially when they turn 
into homicides.

BRASHER
Maybe next time.

He starts to hand her back her flashlight, she demurs --

BRASHER (CONT D)
 got an extra in the car.  You I ve
can just get it back to me.  Good 
luck.

 BOSCH
You too.  Be careful.

She jumps in the car and it takes off.  Bosch steps over to 
the doctor and his dog.

DR. GUYOT
An attractive woman.

BOSCH
m  think I Okay, Doctor.  I don t
going to be able to climb and hold 
 do the dog.  Unleash her and I ll
my best to keep up.

DR. GUYOT
Hah.  Fat chance.
(unhooking the leash)
Go get the bone, girl. Go get it!

Calamity's gone like a shot. Guyot smirks an I told you so 
look as Bosch turns on the flashlight and starts uphill --29.



The sun isn't down yet but the woods are dark.  Bosch climbs 
slowly, grabbing branches to pull himself up.  He can hear 
Calamity crashing through the brush way up ahead, Guyot 
CALLING and WHISTLING somewhere down below.  



Bosch comes to a level area where the trees are thinner.  He 
sees the dog by a stand of acacia trees, but it takes off. 
Bosch walks over and starts scanning the ground with the 
light.  Finds a place where the earth has been dug up, 
disturbed.  With his foot he stirs the loose dirt, uncovering 
a batch of small brown twigs.  Then he realizes they aren't 
twigs at all.

He kneels, shines light.  Dawns on him what he's looking at: 
SMALL DELICATE BONES, scattered in the newly disturbed dirt.  

He stands, begins taking pictures, close on the bones first.  
He steps back and takes a wider shot of the area.  He puts 
down the camera and starts marking off the area with the 
crime scene tape -- 



Bosch has finished taping off the area.  Almost dark.  BOSCH 
starts back downhill, cutting pieces of tape with a penknife 
and tying them to branches to mark his path --



Bosch makes his way downhill.  He loses his footing, FALLS 
heavily, sliding into a tree trunk, ribs first.  

He lies still for a moment, then groans, feels his side.  
Hurts to breathe.  As he struggles painfully to his feet --



Guyot, with a neighbor, VICTOR ULRICH, as he puts the leash 
on a panting Calamity -- 

DR. GUYOT
 whistle as well as I used I don t
 hear me, to.  And when she can t
 come.she doesn t30.


ULRICH
 whistle.  Never have. Can t
Genetic.

DR. GUYOT
Oh come on, anyone can whistle --

ULRICH
Not me.

Bosch emerges from the woods, shirt torn and bloody, face 
scratched. He is favoring his ribs on one side.

DR. GUYOT
My goodness.

BOSCH
I fell. 

DR. GUYOT
I should take a look at that.

BOSCH
 okay, Doc.I m

He looks at Ulrich: who the fuck are you?

ULRICH
Victor Ulrich.  I live over here. 
Just came out to see what was going 
on.

BOSCH
 a crime scene up Nothing.  There s
there.  I need both of you to steer 
clear of it, not tell anyone.  
 let your dog off Doctor, don t
leash the next few days.
(off their nods)
ll want to  sure we Mr. Ulrich, I m
talk to you tomorrow.

ULRICH
I work at home.  Just ring the 
bell.

Bosch heads to his car, favoring his side.  Guyot follows.

DR. GUYOT
 walking like you broke a You re
rib, Detective.  Maybe more than 
one.31.


BOSCH
Nothing you can do for a broken 
rib.

As Dr. Guyot catches up --



Bosch cruises down a street of mansions.  All decked out with 
expensive, tasteful holiday lights and displays.

He pulls into the turn around circle in front of a large 
Spanish-style mansion. Only white Christmas lights here.

He gets out of the car with the shoebox and his camera.



The door is opened.  TERESA CORAZON, 40, attractive, Latina. 
Dressed for a Saturday night out.  She contemplates Bosch a 
moment as she fastens an earring.  Less than thrilled.

CORAZON
Bosch.  As I live and breathe.

BOSCH
Teresa.

CORAZON
 on my way out. I m

BOSCH
Five minutes.  It s important.

She looks put out.  Finally she steps back, opening the door 
all the way.  She looks past Bosch as he enters.

CORAZON
Is that the same city junker that 
used to leave oil spots all over my 
beautiful brick drive-way?

Bosch looks back at his city car.

BOSCH
Nah, I traded that junker in for a 
newer one.

As he steps in --



 Bosch pulls away, leaving a nice oil leak on the driveway s
perfectly ordered rows of bricks.35.



MUSIC continues from the stereo inside, Art Pepper, "My Funny 
Valentine".  Bosch, leaning on the rail, drinking a beer, 
smoking.  He shifts his weight gingerly.  Looking out from 
his cantilevered deck at the lights below, brooding --  



A police helicopter circles high above Laurel Canyon.

PAN down to the turn around circle as a Toyota Prius pulls up 
behind several official vehicles parked at the cul de sac. 

Brasher gets out of the Prius.  She s in off-duty clothes but 
has her badge hanging around her neck.  She holds it up to a 
uniform officer posted at the bottom of the hill.  He lets 
her pass and she starts climbing the hill.  A series of ropes 
have been strung tree to tree and portable stairways put in 
place here and there to make climbing the hillside easier.

TOP OF THE HILL40.


Bosch stands with Edgar, holding a crudely drawn chart of the 
hilltop that is dissected into squares, directing a small 
group of YOUNG POLICE CADETS on how he wants them to conduct 
a surface search of the area.

BOSCH
We spread an arms distance apart in 
one line and we move slowly across 
each quadrant on the map...  
Slowly, got it.  Take your time...

In background Teresa Corazon and her excavation team:  DR. 
WILLIAM GOLLIHER and KATHI KOHL, plus ASSISTANTS, are 
conducting an excavation of the site Bosch discovered the 
night before.  There is a VIDEOGRAPHER recording their 
efforts, always sure to keep Corazon in the frame.

Bosch sees Brasher make it to the top of the climb.  He hands 
Edgar the chart.

BOSCH (CONT D)
You get them going.  Good luck.

Bosch walks over to Brasher, curious but pleased to see her.

BRASHER
I heard you needed volunteers.  I 
offer my services.

BOSCH
Thanks, we could use you. 

BRASHER
Have you found more bones?

BOSCH
Yeah.  Looks like most of the 
remains are in this spot.  

BRASHER

BOSCH
 definitely a grave.  I cant It s
think of a lot of legit reasons why 
somebody would bury a body up here.

 dig is covered by a makeshift canopy.  The The coroner s
perimeter of the grave has been dug out and Golliher -- 50s, 
ponytail, Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts -- is using small 
digging instruments and brushes to slowly reveal the bones. 
It looks like an anthropological dig. 41.


Corazon is not getting dirty herself, preferring to stand 
 wearing a ton of makeup outside the tape and direct.  She s
for the camera.

Golliher lifts a sizable bone from the dirt, brushes it off 
and hands it up to Kohl.

GOLLIHER
Left femur -- mark it in B-twelve. 

Kohl takes the bone to a folding table where all the bones 
are being placed after retrieval.  She then charts the find 
on a sheet on a clipboard that holds a sketch of the burial 
sight.  Bosch and Brasher step over and look at the table. 
Bones from the ribs, spine, arms, hands, hips and now the 
femur (thigh bone) arranged on the table.  Kohl puts down the 
chart and Brasher takes a look at it, reading the top line:

BRASHER
City of bones?

CORAZON (O.C.)

The coroner has stepped over, her Videographer in tow.

CORAZON (CONT D)

blocks of a city.  We know exactly 
which bone was found where.

The camera is now on Bosch.  He puts a hand over the lens.

GOLLIHER (O.S.)
Detective Bosch.

Bosch looks over.  Golliher is at the dig site, holding 
something up with a tool. 

Bosch steps over, pulling a plastic evidence bag from his 
back pocket.  Golliher drops a quarter into it.

GOLLIHER (CONT D)
Nineteen ninety.  Found it by the 
left wing of the pelvis -- it was 
 probably in our young victim s
pocket.  That puts us inside twenty-
five years.

GOLLIHER
Two other things I want to 
emphasize preliminarily.  Grave 
depth and location terrain.  They 
tell us something about what 
happened here.

BOSCH
Tell us what?

GOLLIHER
A contradiction.  We are talking 
about a very shallow grave which 
suggests panic, poor planning. But 
by the same token, the remote 
location, the difficult terrain...

BOSCH
Tells us the opposite.  Like the 
place was chosen.  Ahead of time.

Golliher nods, then turns back to his work.43.


BRASHER
Detective, how do you want me to 
help?

Bosch points off at Edgar.

BOSCH
 my partner.  Go see him. That s
 searching the entire We re
hillside.  Animals may have gotten 
into the grave and scattered the 
bones over time.

BRASHER
You got it.

BOSCH
And call me Harry.

She nods and smiles.  Bosch watches her go off toward Edgar.



A second folding table now and the dig team has added scraps 
of deteriorated clothing, the elastic band from a boy s pair 
of underwear and a backpack that appears largely intact.

Bosch is looking at the assembly with Golliher, who is taking 
a break, eating yogurt out of a plastic container.

GOLLIHER
Haines underwear.  That and the 
pelvis assembly confirm we have a 
male here.

Bosch studies what remains of a life on the tables.

There is a sharp WHISTLE.  Bosch looks across the hilltop and 
sees Edgar and Brasher standing together in the knee-high 
brush.  Edgar is signalling them over with both hands.

Bosch and Golliher walk up and Edgar steps back.

EDGAR
Brasher found it.

BOSCH looks down.  A CHILD'S SKULL, half-buried in the soil, 
hollow eyes looking up at him.44.


He looks up, finds BRASHER.  She looks back at him, sobered.  

Golliher kneels down next to the skull.  He bends down to 
study it from all angles.  He then puts his hand on the top 
of it, his finger tracing a triangle pattern in the bone.

Corazon, her videographer and a STILL PHOTOGRAPHER join the

GOLLIHER
The cranium shows clear evidence of 
fracture lines and surgical 
healing, which again indicates 
we re dealing with relatively 
contemporary bones.  Can we get 
this photographed so I can collect 
it?

The videographer and still photographer move in as Golliher 
stands and steps back.  He turns to Bosch and confides:

GOLLIHER (CONT D)
There was a surgery ante mortem. So 
there will be records -- somewhere. 
Hospital records. You may be able 
to get your identification that 
way.

Bosch nods.  Golliher returns to the skull.  Kneeling down he 
carefully extracts it from the soil.  From his back pocket he 
pulls a paint brush and uses it to carefully brush the dirt 
off the skull. 

GOLLIHER (CONT D)

No teeth on the upper.

He turns the skull and pauses when his brushwork reveals a 
fracture at the rear base of the skull.

Blunt force trauma?

them in a circle.  The videographer has his camera on him but

Tables and canopy are gone.  Bones have been collected and

Assistants are carefully going down the makeshift stairs 
carrying bone boxes in two hands.  

Bosch, Edgar and Brasher remain behind.  To Edgar:

BOSCH
City services will leave the ropes 
and the stairs in place for the 
next two days, in case the DA wants 
us to come back for more photos or 
to survey the hillside.  You check 
with a deputy in major crimes 
tomorrow.

EDGAR
You got it.

BOSCH

Bosch notices movement in the acacia trees at the edge of the 
clearing twenty yards away.  He lowers his voice.

BOSCH

EDGAR

They separate.  Bosch goes into the woods.  Slips behind a 
thick tree to relieve himself.  But then he peeks around the 
other side to get a line on the man hiding in the trees.

Bosch gets a bead on him and starts moving quickly through 
the brush, but his footfalls announce his movement.

The MAN alerts, then starts moving away.

The chase is on. Bosch runs through the heavy brush. 

A branch hits him in the side and he groans as it rakes 
across his wounded ribs.   He keeps going and is gaining on 
the Runner.

Edgar comes out of nowhere and tackles the fleeing figure. 

Bosch catches up, holding his side.  Edgar and the Runner are 
rolling around in the brush.

THE RUNNER
Wait, wait.  Hold it. 

Edgar straddles him and pins him face down.  Wincing, Bosch 
leans in for a closer look. 

BOSCH
Fuck.

EDGAR
You know this guy?

BOSCH
 a reporter.  He was in court He s
Friday.

As Brasher joins them --

TYLER
 Nate Tyler from the Times.  My I m
press pass is in my back pocket.

EDGAR
Are you fucking kidding me?

Bosch taps Edgar on the shoulder.  Edgar releases Tyler and 
stands, brushing himself off.

BOSCH
Get up.47.


TYLER
Okay.

BOSCH
Get the fuck up.

He stands and starts brushing himself off.

TYLER

something of a checkered past.

Bosch moves in closer.  Tyler raises his hands.49.


Bosch holds his stare on him for a long moment.

Tyler reaches into his pocket and pulls out a business card. 
He hands it to Bosch.

asshole.  Authorized personnel 
only.  So get the fuck outta here.

Tyler trudges disconsolately back down the hill the hard way. 50.


Bosch watches, then drops the business card into the brush.  

BOSCH
Fuck him.

Brasher laughs.

EDGAR

things to do.

BOSCH

They watch Edgar head to the stairs.  Brasher looks at Bosch.

Bosch looks at her, trying to read between the lines.

BOSCH
I still owe you a flashlight.

BRASHER
Yeah, you do.

Off her sexy smile --



Bosch s car is parked under the lone street light. We see the 
beam of a flashlight making its way up the wooded hillside.


Bosch turns off the flashlight.  The moonlight is bright 
enough.  He is squatting at the spot where they found the 
skull of the murder victim.  Bosch picks up a handful of 
dirt, lets it run through his fingers.  Another handful.  He 
sifts through the dirt, getting a feel for what happened here 
so long ago, communing with the soul of the dead boy, whoever 
he may be.  He mutters to himself.  Making him a promise.

The nearby brush rustles.  Bosch flicks on the flashlight:

A COYOTE56.


It looks at Bosch, curious.  Bosch watches it.  Maybe the 
coyote disturbed the grave and brought him the case.  The 
coyote turns and disappears into the brush.

Bosch turns off the light.

Off Bosch at the burial ground, alone in the night -- 



Bosch is once again at the statue having a smoke before court 
begins.  He watches a steady parade of MEDIA and TRIAL 
JUNKIES entering the courthouse.

He sees Tyler go in.

Then he sees Rosa and Elena Flores being escorted by Money 
Chandler.  Elena is the only one to glance Bosch s way.  She 
quickly looks away.

The Homeless Man from the other day shuffles up, muttering to 
himself, sounding like he says something about the  Concrete 
 just before he kisses two fingers, then reaches up Blonde 
and touches them to the butt of the statue of Lady Justice. 
He then goes to the ash can, finding the pickings thin.

HOMELESS MAN
I hate Mondays.

Bosch walks over and throws his butt into the can, then hands 
the homeless man his half full pack of cigarettes.

BOSCH
You and me both, brother.
