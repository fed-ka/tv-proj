A taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds.
The taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart,
flies out of sight.
Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.
We hear
faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music
from waterfront bars.
One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is
loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt.
Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.
His face floods
with relief.
WHITTLESLEY
Thank God.
He tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the
pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese.
Whittlesley
shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia.
The boat's engines churn to life.
WHITTLESLEY
I need to speak to the captain!
Where is he?
The sailors hold Whittlesley back.
WHITTLESLEY
Get your hands off me!
I'm trying
to save your lives, you fools!
Several crew members murmur the word "loco".
Hearing the commotion, a
squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches.
CAPTAIN
FRANCO.
FRANCO
American?
WHITTLESLEY
Yes.
Thank Christ somebody speaks
English.
I'm Dr. John Whittlesley.
You have some crates of mine on
board.
They were shipped by mistake
to the Natural History Museum.
We
have to get them off the boat.
FRANCO
You have I.D.?
Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep
control and appear reasonable.
WHITTLESLEY
No.
Let me explain.
I was on an
expedition for the museum on the
Upper Xingu.
Something horrible
happened.
I'm the only one who got
out alive.
I lost everything, my
I.D., everything.
I have to make
sure no one else dies.
The crates,
the crates were sent out before we
knew.
There's something unspeakable
inside.
If your boat leaves harbor
with those crates on board, I can't
be responsible.
My God, if they
reach New York...
Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically.
Franco looks to his men.
FRANCO
Loco.
WHITTLESLEY
No!
I'm not crazy!
As God is my
witness, I'm telling the truth.
Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the
arms.
They start to lead him back to shore.
WHITTLESLEY
Don't do this!
You have to believe
me.
Your lives are in danger.
The sailors laugh.
But with an almost super-human strength born of
desperation, Whittlesley throws them off.
He pulls out his wallet.
WHITTLESLEY
Cash.
Cash, you see?
American money.
Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck.
The breeze scatters the
bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco,
scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese.
While they are
occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck.
The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the
harbor, disappears into the night.
DISSOLVE TO:
Squad cars roar down the back roads, sirens flashing.
In the center of
the column is an unmarked car.
The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.
A hot sun beats down
on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.
The boat lists at a crazy angle where
it has been washed up on the shore.
At first glance, it appears to be
deserted.
A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each
successive wave.
We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad
cars pulls up.
Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES.
PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.
All of the cops immediately
cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.
Pendergast sniffs
once and frowns.
Apart from this, he doesn't react.
SMALL TOWN COP
(choking)
Goin' up-wind if you don't mind.
Pendergast nods.
The cops all fall back in revulsion.
They watch from
a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship.
His shiny
laced wing-tips sink in the sand.
He leans down, pulls them off one at
a time.
He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and
proceeds barefoot towards the boat.
Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the
Santa Lucia.
With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the
deck.
At the top he touches a rail.
It's covered in a DARK STICKY
LIQUID.
BLOOD.
Flies buzz loudly.
A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the stern.
Chairs are overturned.
A DEAD GOAT, eviscerated, lies in the bow.
A
lifeboat hangs half off the stern.
Pendergast moves aft.
The COPS
watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.
Pendergast
hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.
He follows the noise and
sees...
THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.
He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the
stairwell.
Below deck are
BODIES... stacks of them.
They've been TORN TO SHREDS.
THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of
the stairs.
It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.
His face is frozen in a howl of
terror.
Flies congregate in the eye sockets.
With his foot, Pendergast
nudges the body over.
The skull has been torn open.
THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD.
FADE TO BLACK:
Silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city... horns, traffic,
construction work.
SUPER TITLE... NEW YORK CITY, FOUR MONTHS LATER as we...
FADE IN:
ON A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one of gold, the other silver.
The twin
to the one seen on Whittlesley.
Widen to...
And the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.
She sips her morning
coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.
Her hair
is neatly combed.
No make-up.
She doesn't need it.
She has a natural,
unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap.
At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.
A CNN world news report plays.
Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's
been doing rapidly, in ink.
Clearly this is a woman who likes order,
with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time.
An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the
crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and
shuts off the T.V.
She reaches for her back pack and looks out at
CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes.
HELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot
of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE
making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.
Margo wears
jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone
DOUBLE HELIX PIN.
On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her
lap top computer.
She emerges from the park, catches the green light
and rolls up to...
As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to
rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic
arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.
This is not an ordinary
building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.
The
structure fills an entire city block.
Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide
stone steps two at a time.
We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release,
the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN.
Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.
Their teacher,
MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent,
calls after them as they all head inside.
MRS. BEASLEY
Don't run, children!
Stay with your
partner and do not run!
If anyone
runs they will be sent back to the
bus!
Ignoring Mrs. Beasley, TWO BOYS charge past Margo.
HENRY and LARRY.
Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots.
Both are 8 years
old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles.
MRS. BEASLEY
Henry!
Larry!
What did I just say!
You walk right this minute!
Did you
hear me?!
Reluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach
the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles.
Above the doorway WORKMEN are hanging a LARGE BANNER.
It reads:
"SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT... OPENING OCT. 29"
Yellow crime tape encircles the museum.
Dead leaves swirl in clusters
and the sky is overcast.
Overnight, fall turned to winter.
The front
of the museum is ringed with police cars.
Margo rides up on her bike
and pauses, startled at the sight.
We watch as she crosses, has a few
words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.
She
wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up...
A TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.
Out steps SPECIAL AGENT
PENDERGAST.
An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing.
Pendergast and D'Agosta walk
to a squad car.
D'AGOSTA
I've got to admit, that was a damn
sight better than "the dog ate my
homework".
PENDERGAST
How do you explain the part about
Beauregard?
D'AGOSTA
They heard the victim's name and
wove him into their story.
Nice
touch.
PENDERGAST
I believed them.
D'Agosta stops, stunned.
D'AGOSTA
You think what we've got here is a
monster as big as a house that
smells... like hamburger?
PENDERGAST
No.
I think what we've got here is a
psychotic killer wielding some kind
of unusual weapon... who wants us to
believe he's a monster.
D'AGOSTA
(totally confused)
Oh.
A black and white heads uptown.
The yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain.
Most
of the emergency vehicles have left.
The police have released the
employees who are now headed home.
We see Frock and Kawakita exit.
Cuthbert isn't far behind.
Pendergast approaches them, headed back
inside.
PENDERGAST
Excuse me.
Has Dr. Green left?
KAWAKITA
Before eight?
You must be joking.
She's in the physical anthro lab
making up for lost time.
Pendergast nods his thanks.
THREE COPS including MCNITT, RODRIGUEZ and ROGERS prepare to enter the
exhibit.
All are armed.
Margo watches as Pendergast gives them
instruction.
She appears rattled and confused.
PENDERGAST
Stay in formation together.
Take it
room by room.
Check for footprints,
any signs of disturbance.
If you see
or hear anything the least bit
suspicious, I want to know.
He points to DOYLE, an older red-haired cop who takes up a post
outside the exhibit.
Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie.
PENDERGAST
Bailey's going to be in the guard
house outside.
Officer Van Dorn is
right down that hall.
When McNitt's
done, he'll relieve you.
Doyle nods.
Pendergast and Margo walk out.
Margo and Pendergast exit.
The cold air is like a slap in the face.
PENDERGAST
Dr. Green...
MARGO
I didn't imagine it.
I know what I
saw.
Are you sure there are enough
men in there?
PENDERGAST
They're all heavily armed.
MARGO
(stops)
All right.
This is hard for me.
I'm
a scientist.
I like order and logic.
Sometimes too much.
There's got to
be an explanation.
There can't be an
animal in there.
But I saw
something.
PENDERGAST
What was it?
MARGO
I don't know.
(she has a thought)
Mr. Pendergast.
Do me a favor.
Get
me a DNA readout on that claw.
DISSOLVE TO:
All is quiet.
Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight.
The museum
is back in business, but not many people are going in.
A crowd lingers
at the margins, pointing at the building.
Several hold a copy of the
POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair.
A series of boxes labeled "PROFESSOR FROCK" sit on the loading dock.
A
small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of Frock's
office, sits waiting.
Frock delves through one of the boxes while
Pendergast and D'Agosta look on.
FROCK
I know they're here somewhere.
It's
a good thing we caught the movers in
time.
They're nineteen century
blueprints from when the museum was
built.
I remember the sub-basement
was below the regular basement,
linked to the city sewer.
I only
know about it because it flooded all
the way up to the museum during the
hurricane of '49.
I lost so many
precious books.
Frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left.
It's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia.
A collection of
wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl.
Finally he pulls out some
very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile.
FROCK
Eureka.
Who says it doesn't pay to
be a pack rat?
Now please be careful
with these.
When you're done, I'd
like them back.
Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance.
A huge rotating
SPOTLIGHT is now turned on.
Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets
and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas
jousting.
As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain... crying,
terrified, unclear what exactly happened.
These are the lucky ones.
Among them we find IPPOLITO.
His walkie talkie is squawking.
The
windows of the museum behind him are black.
D'AGOSTA ON RADIO
Ippolito!
Where the hell are you?
We're trapped in here!
We need help!
Ippolito!
Come in, dammit!
Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of
what he's done.
The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out
damage control.
The walkie talkie keeps calling.
He doesn't respond.
Police cars are pulling up outside the museum.
Sirens wail.
Torrents
of rain limit the number of onlookers.
Crowds of people are scattered
about.
There's disbelief on everyone's faces.
Many people are in
shock.
Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION
near the gate.
He yanks the door open and jumps inside.
There are increasing numbers of SWAT vehicles around.
A HELICOPTER
lands on the roof.
The rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain
pouring down.
Ippolito is in the thick of the action.
The S.W.A.T.
commander, JENNINGS, comes over buckling an ammo belt over his
fatigues.
JENNINGS
We're ready.
We've got enough
firepower to turn a herd of lions
into a fine red mist.
IPPOLITO
Then do it.
Jennings nods, goes off.
As Ippolito watches the S.W.A.T. team break
the glass skylights, gets ready to go in.
A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the
roof.
Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a
sling.
Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie.
WATERS
We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.
No
one's answering!
What do you want to
do?
Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them.
IPPOLITO
Holy shit.
Pull him up.
Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons
all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!
The men on the roof stare
down astonished.
Their mouths hang open at the sight!
IPPOLITO
Get more guns!
Now!
The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan
trapped below.
There are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the
place.
Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from
Columbus Ave.
Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the
company to the ambulances.
Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue
efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast.
KAWAKITA
Margo Green.
Have you seen her?
PENDERGAST
She's over here.
Greg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan
and Hobbes.
Her face is devastated.
He moves to her side.
She reacts
as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug.
D'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.
And he likes it like that.
He
rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in
cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet
match.
He's struggling hopelessly.
Finally he tosses the useless pack of
matches, sighs.
But then a flame lowers right before his face.
He
looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.
D'Agosta
smiles, takes a nice long hit.
PENDERGAST
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
D'AGOSTA
The sub-basement, huh?
Great idea.
We go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back...
DISSOLVE TO:
Christmas decorations are up.
A light snow is falling.
There is a very
long line.
