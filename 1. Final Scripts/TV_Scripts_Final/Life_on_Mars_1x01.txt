      INT.SAM S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 1/1 07:0811

      Close-up - photograph. A small boy - 4 or 5 wearing an 
      oversized policeman s hat. Freckles. Toothy grin. 

      Reflected in the glass of the photo - a dozen separate News 
    24 items explode onto a plasma screen.

    The widescreenTV spews up a giddy-making cocktail of current 
      affairs. These images usher in a fast set of very 
      contemporary TITLES.

    The TV with Dolby 5.1 dominates one half of the apartment and 
      holds the attention of SAM TYLER. This room with its beams 
    and varnished wooden floor has been converted from some vast 
      Victorian factory.

    SAM himself is smart, lithe, mid-30 s.If he were a flavour 
      he d be spearmint. He is talking into his mobile and 
      negotiating the News 24 menu simultaneously. Girlfriend MAYA
      cradles her coffee, watching him.

                                  SAM
                    If we get the go-ahead I want base-
                    point to be at the cross-roads ...

                                  MAYA
                    Sam .. 

    He doesn t appear to hear her.

                                  SAM
                    .. the suspect was positively id d
                    by the victim of the assault. 
                    Afterwards I want SOCOthrough 
                    every inch of the house. And I m 
                    going to apply for the right to 
                    hold him for 72 hours if necessary 
                    ... Yes, I m expecting to get it 
                    ...

                                  MAYA
                    Sam?

    He snaps the phone shut. Holds up two identical blue ties.

                                  MAYA
                    The blue one.

                                  SAM
                    Good choice.

                                  MAYA
                    Sam, can we ...?

    His phone rings. He shrugs - sorry. Has to take it.



                                                                                            1       Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 2

      MAYAwalks sadly out of the room. 

    He glances at her as she leaves - feels bad about avoiding a 
      conversation. Turns his attention back to the phonecall.

                                  SAM
                    We re heading out there now...
                    (dialogue continues over top of sc
                    2) I want the Exclusion Zone to run 
                    from the junction to the end of the 
                    street. We re not losing this one 
                    because of sloppiness.

      INT.SAM S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 1/1 07:0922

      MAYAsits on the loo (seat down) with her own phone. She can 
      hear SAM babbling ten to the dozen outside. She finishes 
      leaving a phone message.

                                  MAYA
                    Don t know if you can understand. 
                    Maybe at some point we can sit down 
                    and talk.

    She finishes the call. Cups her hand over her face.

                                  SAM (O.S.)
                    Maya? Heads up. We re on.

      EXT.STREETS - CARS - DAY 1/1 10:4033

      Three unmarked Police cars tear past a row of defining 21st 
      century shops - typical of a modern, vibrant city, turning 
    off into a residential street.

44EXT.VICTORIAN TERRACES - DAY 1/1 10:41 - CONTINUOUS 

      A white van caked in grime -  Heating Services . In the grime 
    are written these words - RooneyIs God.

    One of Manchester s modern buildings (the Halle perhaps) 
      rises up in the background - steel and glass. 

    GO WIDE - CID spill out of the cars. Everyone as neat and 
      sharp as SAM. All look to SAM - these next few minutes are 
      crucial.

      They run to an unloved house at the end of the terrace. 
      (Muffled rock music from the house next door.) SAM clocks the 
      music. MAYArings the bell. Dogs yap within.

                    the door.

      OFFICERS move forward with the battering ram but SAM motions 
    for them to hold back. He knocks. Almost polite.

                                  SAM
                    MrRaimes we have a warrant to

                    property in compliance with the 
                    Criminal Evidence Act ..

      Noise from round the back. Flower-pot knocked over. 

      EXT.REAR OF HOUSE - DAY 1/1 10:4255

      COLIN RAIMES (30s/ skinny / gingerhair / tracksuit) is 
      already clambering over the back wall. MAYAis the first to 
      reach him. He kicks her in the throat. She steps back, 
      gagging. RAIMES goes over. CID struggle to follow but SAM 
      takes the wall athletically.

      EXT.STREETS - DAY 1/1 10:42 - CONTINUOUS66

      RAIMES running with frenzied vigor. SAM in pursuit. Like a 
      sprinter - piston arms, set jaw.

      RAIMES darts between moving cars. SAM does the same - 
      matching madness for madness. RAIMES cuts down an alley. SAM 
      stops. Scans houses opposite. 

      Crosses the street and goes over a gate. Over another garden 
      wall just as RAIMES is running by. SAM leaps onto RAIMES who 
      throws him off with a scream of rage. SAM reaches into his 
      belt and whip-cracks his baton to full extension. RAIMES 
      grabs a dustbinlid - gladiator s shield.

    TWO BOYS watch them.

      RAIMES swings the lid. SAM side-steps and lashes out with the 
      baton which RAIMES deflects.

                                  BOY 1
                          (to RAIMES)
                    Smash his face in!

      RAIMES giggles - king for a day.

                                  SAM
                    Colin, this is going to look very 
                    bad on your arrest report.

      RAIMES lunges at him. SAM parries and swings his baton into 
    the back of RAIMES  legs. RAIMES crumples. The BOYS boo. SAM 
      holds him down.



                                                                                            3       Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 4

      Gleaming squad cars lined up outside a modern day terrorist 
      proof Police Station. Two POLICEMEN stationed outside. SAM 
      returns to the station. 

      Heswipes his security fob for immediate clearance into the 
      station - which it must be said more resembles the entrance 
    to an expensive private clinic than an inner city cop-house.

    Sam walks down the corridor playing his voicemailoff the 
      mobile. Maya is waiting for him a little way ahead.

                     I m moving out. I can t live with 
                    you any more Sam. Don t know if you 
                    can understand. Maybe at some point 
                    we can sit down and talk. 

    SAM is hurt but he doesn t have time or space to indulge it. 
      Maya watches. He doesn t even glance her way. He snaps his 
      mobile shut and starts walking. Maya hands him a fresh shirt. 
    He rips off the cellophane, strips to the waist and puts on 
    the clean shirt.

      Rapid montage - DATmachine loaded, CCTValigned, lap-top 
      booted. SAM sets out pens and pad. Squares them with the edge 
    of his desk. Tightens his tie knot.

      TIME JUMP: SAM and MAYAon one side. RAIMES on the other 
      flanked by his LAWYER, SOCIAL WORKER and PSYCHIATRIST. Twin 
      DATdecks and CCTVrecord everything. (During the scene we 
    cut sporadically to CCTVPOV.)

    We zoom in on COLIN who looks up into camera.

    SAM takes off his state-of-the-art watch.

      COLIN is rocking in his chair and rolling a fag.

                                  SAM
                    This is a no-smoking room.

    The PSYCHIATRIST gives the LAWYER a look.

                    My client is advised by his

                                  SAM
                    Look at these photos Colin. Lauren 
                    Chester. Strangled to death in 
                    November last year. No sexual 
                    assault. Kidnapped. Held for around 
                    30 hours. Strangled with bootlace.

    The photos show explicitly the thin welts running around the 
      victim s throat. RAIMES looks away, groaning.

    SAM swipes to let himself out through the security doors. A 
    PC struggles to get a coffee from a dispenser. Rattles the 
      machine. Sam pauses to run his fingers over it. Sam reaches 
    for water from the cooler then turns to the dispenser and 
      gives it a light precise tap. A cup drops into the tray just 
    as his mobile goes off.

      EXT.PLAYGROUND - DAY 1/1 13:501616

      SAM s Jeep pulls up. Close up of a sign - SatchmoreRoad.

    SAM walks through the desolate space. He crosses the 
      playground to where a couple of COPPERS are standing near a 
      swing. Maya s blouse hangs off the swing. Unmistakably hers. 
      A single fleck of blood spoils the material.

    SAM is horrified to the core yet his every sinew of his being 
      fights to hold SAM TYLERin check.

      I/E. SAM S JEEP - DAY 1/1 14:001717

    SAM at the wheel - distressed but keeping a lid on it.  Life 
    On Mars  plays softly over his i-pod.He brakes hard. The 
      music floats around him as he tries to marshal his thoughts 
    and feelings. He steps out of the car. Leans against it to 
      pull in some clearing air. He is close to tears.

    He steps back to compose himself. A car smacks into him at 
      speed and in half a second SAM is thrown down the street like 
      a scarecrow full of straw. It s shockingly sudden.





                                                                                            9     Life on Mars Episode One - Shooting Script       Pink Amended: 25/04/2005 10

    SAM unconscious on dusty ground. He is wearing a dated brown 
      leather jacket and bell-bottom cords.  Life On Mars  can 
      still be heard playing. SAM lifts his head. The music is 
      coming from the 8 Track playing in the Ford Granada that he 
    is lying beside. The door is open. SAM heads towards the car.

      A COPPER arrives. There is something about his uniform that 
      isn t quite right. He also has a large radio transmitter  
      around his neck. COPPER helps SAM to his feet. 

                                  COPPER 
                    What happened? Did you not see the 
                    signs?

    SAM realizes that he is standing in roadworks. A development 
      plot for the very same road he was driving on moments ago. A 
      road which now seems to be in the process of being built.

    SAM pelting through streets of old terraces. Collapses 
      against a lamp post. Becomes aware of the cars parked nearby - 
      Hillmans, Vauxhalls, Austins.

    He catches a glimpse of himselfin the chrome hub cap of one 
    of the cars. He crouches down to study  his reflection and 
      notices the change in his image for the first time.

      numerous black bicycles that are lined up outside. A Morris 
      Panda car pulls out. 

      INT.POLICE STATION - FRONT DESK - DAY 1/2 CONTINUOUS2424

      Sweaty, dizzy and disorientated, SAM staggers into the tatty, 
      poorly lit reception. No security swipe here. A road safety 
      poster on the wall - squirrel with thumbs up. Tufty Says 
      Follow The Code.

    The WPCon the front desk is a formidable creature with the 
      voice of a welder - PHYLLIS. She watches a PC wrestling a 
      drunk. Shouting and swearing and bouncing off walls.

                    Get your ducks in a line Tony!

      DRUNK and PC collide with people waiting. SAM is appalled. 
      PHYLLIS marches out from behind the desk and yanks the 
      DRUNK S trousers down to his ankles.

    it doesn t work this time. He sets off again. Encounters a

      Pushes through dirty swing doors -

      INT.POLICE STATION - CID - DAY 1/2 CONTINUOUS2626

      A DOZEN CID stop and stare. Most are smoking. The air is 
      opaque with it. Page 3 girls jostle for space with crime 
      scene photos. Desks over-flow with ash-trays, coffee cups and 
      paperwork. Most officers are dressed in cheap suits flecked 
      with dandruff flurrys.The younger ones sport tight-fitting 
      leather jackets. They look pallid and cynical. They are all 
    and I mean ALL chewing gum.

      Every fibre of SAM S being tries to assimilate this. A

      GENE grabs SAM S arm, steers him into the office.

    He pushes SAM violently against the pre-fabwall which 
      trembles.

      CLOSE UP on a chunky wood panel TV in the corner of the room, 
      a public information film from the Central Office of 
      Information (COI).  The scratchy footage shows a dodgyman 
      loitering in a residential street.  Curious neighboursfollow 
    his every move through net curtains.

      A wobbly caption card appears asking the public to be 
      vigilant about strangers in the area.

                    That was a public information film.  

      Someone jabs off the telly.Bustle, noise, radios playing. 
      Wads of gum thrown from hand to hand. Huge cast-iron 
      typewriters thumping away. SAM sits amongst it all looking 
      grey and lost. 

    His gaze drifts down to The Mirror lying on the desk.  
      Headline - Anne: No Romance - Saturday, March 3rd1973.

      remember it then starts dialling a number.

    SAM slaps the phone down. 

      A sound - like the wheezing of a hospital ventilator. SAM 
      looks for its source. Hears another noise - the distant ping 
    of what, for all the world, could be a heart monitor. The 
      phantom sounds are swallowed up by bustle.

      CHRIS puts down the phone and hurries over to GENE who is 
      lighting yet another smoke.

    SAM just stands there. 

                                  CHRIS (TO SAM)
                    Boss? 

    The team congregate around the table. They wait onSAM who 
      stands like a fool before them. SAM has no idea what to say 
    or do.

    SAM looks up. A beat. 

                                  CHRIS
                    So should we...start?

    SAM shrugs. Why not?!

      CHRIS lays out personal effects from a plastic bag, 
      interspersed with bites from his fried egg sarnie.It should 
    be noted that RAY doesn t appear to like SAM much.

                                  RAY
                    Suzihad been dead a couple of 
                    hours when she was found. No sign 
                    of sexual assault.

    He shrugs - what else is there to say? CHRIS feels the need 
    to expand when RAY doesn t go on.

                                  CHRIS
                    This is what she had on her.

    He puts out a few items of make-up. A necklace. Egg yolk 
      drips onto her purse.

                                  CHRIS
                    Bloody hell.

      INT.MORTUARY - DAY 1/2 16:153131

      Cold. Dank. Dingy. SAM, CHRIS and RAY stand around the upper 
      body of SuziTripper. Her skin is pale and clear save for the 
      ugly cord marks around her throat. (The same injuries we saw 
    in the Lauren Chester photographs in 2005.)

    SAM stares at Suzi sbody - making connections in his fevered 
      mind.

                    He didn t shag her. Didn t rob her.

                                  SAM
                    Garroted with thin cord. No other 
                    attack marks. Nothing in or around 
                    the mouth. What have you learnt 
                    from the stomach contents?

    RAY shrugs.

                    She wasn t fed for at least a day 
                    before she was killed.

                    End! Stop! Over! Finish! ENOUGH!

    SAM turns suddenly and flattens his back against the wall. He 
      begins to notice the wall he is standing against. He feels 
    the moist brick. Even sniffs the air.

                                  SAM
                    The wall s wet .. Smell the

    SAM crosses to Suzi.He lifts up her hand - long nails. SAM 
      scrabbles behind him until he finds tweezers on the tray. He 
      pokes around under the nails.

                                  CHRIS
                    You just need a large scotch and a 
                    bit of kip. 

    SAM pulls a thin cotton strand from under a nail. (This 
      identical to the forensic evidence located on Lauren Chester 
    in 2005.) He stares and stares at it until his whole body is 
      trembling.

                                  SAM

    She is standing with a STUDIOUS GUY, NEIL, in glasses who 
      hangs back, staring at SAM. ANNIE is wearing a simple leather 
      skirt and looks much younger out of uniform.

    SAM is slumped in the big draylonchair holding a beer and 
      half asleep. The GOATEED PRESENTER steps into screen.

                                  GOATEED PRESENTER
                    In Module 3 we noted that the 
                    collective Pythagorean angles 
                    embedded in our x to n ratio could 
                    be derived from the simple numinary
                    a as the constant 10 and depicted 
                    thus ...

      Inexplicable diagram appears on screen.

                                  GOATEED PRESENTER
                    But what concerns us most is 
                    regulating his breathing. That is 
                    why we have to keep the 
                    endotracheal tube in place. I have 
                    to stress to you that Sam is in low 
                      responsiveness but not in a 
                    persistent vegetative state ...

      SAM S eyes snap open. He is blown away by what he is hearing.

                                  GOATEED PRESENTER
                    .. although he has suffered severe 
                    cranial trauma. But The Glasgow 
                    Scale does put him at a deep level 
                    of coma.

    The GOATEED PRESENTER is peering out of the TV screen as 
      though peering down into the eyes of a person lying on a bed.

                                  SAM
                    You re talking about me! I m not in 
                    a vegetative anything! Look at me! 
                    I m here! I can hear you!

    SAM comes down to the TV.

                                  GOATEED PRESENTER
                    At times however he moves, murmurs, 
                    has motor response as though caught 
                    in some sort of powerful REM sleep 
                    from which he can not wake.This 
                    gives us some hope despite the 
                    brain-stem bruising ...

                                  SAM
                    Hey! I m here! Does this look like 
                    low responsiveness to you?

      CUT: SAM opens his eyes with a start. He is sitting in the 
      chair and must have nodded off. The GOATEED PRESENTER is 
      still burbling on about angles and numinaries.

                    In Module 4 we will be studying 
                    what happens when the numinaryis 
                    in flux. So the constant a becomes 
                    an elliptical variant. You can 
                    prepare for this module by reading 
                    the annotated chapter entitled 
                     Variant Numinaries  in the 
                    accompanying module pack ...

                    here ...

    He sinks to his knees before the TV. Punches another channel. 
    The test card pops up. Girl in a smock at the blackboard with 
      a clown doll and a green balloon. Smiling out at him. And the 
      test tone slicing through his head.

      Morning light seeping through. SAM asleep fully clothed on 
    the bed. He blinks. For a second it was all a bad dream. Then 
    he sees the wall paper in front of him. He sees the clothes 
    on the bed. He sits bolt upright with a start as the awful 
      truth hits him here!

    He gets off the bed and prepares to hit the day.

3737INT. POLICE STATION - LOST AND FOUND ROOM - DAY 1/3 11.00 
      CONTINUOUS

    The room is a trove of bric-a-brac. Umbrellas, stacks of 
      handbags and purses, a padre s black bicycle. Sitting behind 
      a table is a skinny girl, DORA, who hides like a sparrow 
      inside her big coat adorned with Bob Dylanbadges. The place 
    is now an ad hoc interview room.

                                  GENE
                    You had a drink with Suzithe night 
                    she died, didn t you Dora.

      GENE sits down opposite DORA, SAM sits down beside GENE and 
      CHRIS sits at the back with notebook and pencil but doesn t 
      appear to be writing anything down. The room is bare. No 
      tape. No video.


                                  DORA
                    I know you. From the picket line. 
                    You put the boot into my old man.

                                  GENE
                    Happy days.

                                  DORA
                    Sod off.

                                  GENE
                    Can t love. This is my esteemed 
                    colleague, DITyler.

    He motions for SAM to take over. SAM on the spot.

                                  SAM
                    Uhh.. hi Dora. I want you to call 
                    me Sam.

      CHRIS looks up from his notebook.

                                  DORA
                    You really a copper?

                                  SAM
                    Possibly. 

      DORA laughs. GENE scowls at SAM and lights up.

                                  SAM
                    When was the last time you saw 
                    Suzi?

                                  DORA
                    In my dreams.

    SAM looks lost. Wants to give up. Notices the way GENE is 
      looking at him. Fuckit, why should he give him the 
      satisfaction?

                                  SAM
                    All right ... I want you to stow 
                    away this counter-productive 
                    attitude Dora because it isn t 
                    helping anybody. How did Suziseem 
                    to you that night? Did she talk 
                    about meeting anyone?

                                  DORA
                    She was horny.

                                  SAM
                    Did you see her get into an 
                    argument with a stranger ...?

                                  DORA
                    You got lovely neat hair. Were you 
                    in the Army?

                                  SAM
                    You think I need this shit?

    He stands. DORA looks unnerved. GENE looks impressed. SAM 
      rocks on his feet. Pulls himself together. Sits.

                                  SAM
                    Let s start again ...

                                  DORA
                    I know the answer. It s blowing in 
                    the wind.

      GENE sweeps her tea cup and her fags off the table. Then he 
      throws over the table. DORA screams and jumps back. SAM jumps 
      back also - horrified.

                                  GENE
                    I m done with this game. Let s play 
                    another. Let s play hopscotch. Pin 
                    the tail on the donkey? You pick 
                    Dora.

    The walls are closing in on SAM.

      There s an acrid smell and a conspicuous puddle on Dora s 
      side of the room. A cleaner, JUNE, arrives and tackles the

      A smoke-filled utilitarian pub. Led Zepon the jukebox. Man 
      City flags on the wall. A few off-duty UNIFORM at the bar 
      waiting to be served. GENE and SAM enter. GENE leans on the 
      counter next to UNIFORM.

                    times in some places on some 
                    enchanted evenings he can be my

                    bag or something made from coarse 
                    material. Gets under their nails.

      Coppers just don t talk this way and it has an odd effect on

                    her fault. She s taunting him just 
                    by being there.

                    By looking at similar cases. By

      A round of laughter. The phone rings and CHRIS goes to answer 
    it.

      INT.POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR - DAY 1/3 17:405050

    SAM is having no luck getting the drinks dispenser to deliver 
    his tea. He doesn t notice RAY draw alongside. RAY S tone is 
      casual but loaded.

                                  RAY
                    Thought you had the magic touch.

                                  SAM
                    I press tea and I get Bovril.

                                  RAY
                    New machine in tit.
                          (beat)
                    We had a machine here for years. 
                    Got bashed to buggery. Cracked. 
                    Dented. Patched up with Sellotape.
                    Then the plastic went all yellow. 
                    Didn t look too snazzy. But it did 
                    the job. Tea from the pot, hot to 
                    trot. Then they replaced it for no 
                    good reason. Flashing lights and 
                    formicatray. Latest range.

                                  SAM
                    I assume this diatribe is going 
                    somewhere Ray.

                                  RAY
                    New don t mean improved is all.

    RAY suddenly kicks the shitout of the dispenser. Cup rattles 
      into holder and fills with tea.

                                  RAY
                    You can get tea from just about 
                    anything if you know how to ask.

    SAM looks stunned. RAY holds one great fist over the machine 
    as if ready to punch it.

                                  RAY
                    Sorry Boss, how many sugars?

    on a swing.

    SAM sits cross-legged on the floor with CHRIS and SID. All 
    are surrounded by an Alpine range of papers.

    CID are getting slaughtered at the bar. SAM is hunched over 
      NELSON S private telephone which he has put on the bar. SAM 
      watches RAY collectingcoins in the now very heavy Man City

    He makes certain that SAM sees he has his eye on him. The 
      OPERATOR comes back on the line.

    He slams the phone down. NELSONis watching him, concerned. 
    Can really see the pain in SAM S face.

                    phone.

      NELSONdismisses it - no problem. SAM rustles him up a 
      genuine smile.

    He notices the way those same PCsshe was once laughing with 
    are now eyeing her suspiciously.

                                  SAM
                    I m sorry if I put you on the spot 
                    but I needed help.

                    Yes, you do. Need help.

                                  SAM
                    I don t know why I m here and I 
                    don t really know where  here  is. 
                    But maybe solving this case is a 
                    key to getting out somehow.

                                  ANNIE
                    It s hard for us to get on in the

                    It s nothing to be ashamed of, you 
                    are who you are.

                    Nelson, I m lost. Really lost.

      NELSON S grin fades away. The man looks sober and serious. 
    His eyes fix steadily upon SAM. Suddenly NELSONlooks like a 
    man you can trust. And when he speaks, the broad Rastalilt 
    is gone. NELSONhas a soft, firm Lancashire brogue

                    you are. And you have to make the 
                    best of it. It s all you can do.

    SAM doesn t know what to say - NELSON S accent change has 
      thrown him.

                                  NELSON
                    Keep it to yourself, eh.Folks just 
                    feel happier with the other Nelson.

    go.

                    So you think I don t know how to do 
                    my job? It s an interesting point 
                    you raise. Allow me to retort.

    He pushes SAM under his chin with the flat of his hand. SAM 
      smacks his arm away. He swings a punch at GENE. GENE catches 
    it, twists his arm, pulls him in close and thumps the side of 
    his face. SAM drops to his knees.

                                  GENE
                    Better?

    He walks away leaving SAM in utterly fazed shock.

      EXT.HIGH STREET - DAY 1/4 11:155757

    SAM strikes out. ANNIE (on patrol) breaks away from her 
      partner to catch him up.

                                  ANNIE
                    Where are you going?

                          (looks around him)
                    My mind can only invent so much 
                    detail. So I m going to walk until 
                    I can t think up any more streets 
                    or faces.

    He points down the High Street and we see it for the first 
      time a 70 shigh road complete with red telephone boxes, 
      Wimpeyand old-fashioned Wooliesand Timothy Whites.

                    I had a nephew and he .. he fell 
                    off a pier and .. and he couldn t 
                    remember the names of things. 
                    Couldn t tell you what .. what an 
                    apple was or a pencil. And do you 
                    know what, he stopped believing in 
                    them. He didn t believe that food 
                    had taste. Or that cars got you 
                    from A to B. And he said it was 
                    like .. life was a play with 
                    rubbishy props. But then he got 
                    better and everything seemed real 
                    again.

    He stops to look into a RECORD SHOP.

      INT.RECORD SHOP - DAY 1/4 CONTINUOUS5858

    The Aladdin scave that you so rarely find in modern times. 
      KIDS with lots of hair leafing through boxes of albums and 
      45 sor listening on large headphones. ANNIE follows him in. 
    SAM walks as though in a trance.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m going to call DCIHunt.

                    What s he going to do, push me down 
                    the stairs and say I walked into a 
                    door? He doesn t need me. Doesn t 
                    want me. And I certainly don t need 
                    .. him ...

    He hesitates. Something has caught his attention. He walks 
      towards the back of the shop.

                                  ANNIE
                    Sam? What is it?

      SAM S attention is fixed upon the sound-proofed boxat the 
      back of the store. Through the single window a DUDE is 
      listening to something by T-Rex.You can barely hear it 
      outside the box. 

    SAM opens the door and a wave of Marc Bolan flies out. SAM 
      pushes a dude out of the way. SAM pushes off the needle.

    SAM studies the walls of the booth.

                    kiss them so he doesn t gag them. 
                    But if they shout out, he could be 
                    caught. How s he going to keep them 
                    quiet?

    The sound-proof wall is tatty. Clumps of fibrous padding hang 
    in wispy strands from the wall.

                                  SAM
                    Strands of material under their 
                    nails and on their skin. But it s 
                    not wool. Rough. Synthetic. 

    SAM tears a clump out of the sound-proofed wall. Fibrous 
      strands in his hand.

      INT.POLICE STATION - CID - DAY 1/4 11:505959

    SAM flies into the room clutching a hand full of the sound-
      proofing. GENE and the others look up from their conflab.
      GENE is still simmering from their previous head-to-head.

                                  SAM

      MRSRAIMES frowns, looking troubled.

                    MrsRaimes, it could be very 
                    important. It could bevitalthat

      Cream on the walls. Walls which have been covered with egg-
      boxes and swathed in rolls of bushy, fibrous pipe-lagging. 
      Even over the windows.

    The stereo plays loudly in the corner. GENE switches it off. 
    SAM runs to the bound DORA who is crunched up against the

      A dishevelled young man with wild hair steps into the room 
      carrying some sandwiches. EDWARD KRAMER. He clocks the 
      coppers. GENE is on him like a ton of bricks.

      Different van from 2005 but the same company.

    On the van is scrawled - George Best Is God.

    In the next garden a skinny LITTLE BOY with gingerhair 
      stands staring at him - a four year old COLIN RAIMES. Those 
      piercing eyes blaze with fire at SAM then turn with real 
      affection towards KRAMER. KRAMER gives the boy a wink.

                    UhhGuv.. Burt s back. Want me to 
                    get the retirement fund?

      GENE nods, goes to leave. SAM grabs his arm.

                                  GENE
                    What? Wannahave another pop at me? 
                    Or do you wannaget me suspended? 
                    If you like you can try your hand. 
                          (beat)
                    And as for this note, I m making it 
                    your call.

      GENE walks out. SAM looks at the letter. It s an anguished 
      decision. He finally screws it into a ball. 

      Through the window he watches DSBURT nervously take his 
      desk. He s about 27.

      GENE is handed the Man City sock fat and swollen with coins. 
      BURT jumps to his feet as GENE starts to swing it. He sweeps 
      everything off BURT S desk in one blow.

                                  GENE
                    You got your doubts Burt, take it 
                    to a priest. In here I m Wyatt Earp
                    crossed with Jesus Christ.

                    and this will be your retirement. 
                    Get it?

      GENE empties the sock of coins across BURT S desk. Everyone 
      takes back the money they put in.

      GENE looks back at SAM. Reckless. Scary. Magnificent. He 
      strides to his office, pausing at SAM S ear. Realizes SAM has 
      screwed up the doctor s note.

                                  GENE
                    Welcome to the team.

                                  SAM
                    Thanks. Guv.

      GENE gives him a nod - moment of respect. Marches on.

      SCENE 72 OMITTED7272

      INT. POLICE STATION - CANTEEN - NIGHT20.457373

    SAM sits completely alone in the canteen whilst a small ARMY 
    OF CLEANERS wash the tables and floors around him. One of the 
      cleaners, JUNE, is wiping his table. 

                                  JUNE
                    Are you okay Sir?

    SAM nods and JUNEmoves on to wipe the next table.

                                  SAM
                          (quietly)
                    I m sorry Maya. I don t know how to 
                    reach you.

                                  NEIL
                    Sam.

    SAM looks over. NEIL again - standing staring at him. SAM can 
      hear the faint hiss of the ventilator.

                                  NEIL
                    Sam. Can you hear me? Can .. you ..

                    in your bed on the IC ward of St

                                  SAM

                    hear me then I know that you can 
                    wake up. I choose to believe that 
                    you can hear me.

                                  SAM
                    I can hear you. I thought I was 
                    back in ... I m in a coma, yes? And 
                    you can help me ...

                    Whatever you may be experiencing 
                    isn t real Sam. You can escape. You 
                    only need to take that definitive

                    She s safe. If you can hear me then 
                    I know that will give you strength.

                                  SAM
                    I m coming back. Tell her I m 
                    coming back ...

      EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOF - NIGHT20.497474

      ANNIE bursts out of the service door and onto the asphalt. 
    SAM is on the edge of the roof, a fifty foot drop behind him. 
    He is excited and energized.

                                  ANNIE
                    Sam! Come away from the edge.

                                  SAM
                    It s okay, I know the answer. I m 
                    in a coma. But I m going to take 
                    the definitive step I need to wake 
                    up. 

    He turns to face the drop.

                                  ANNIE
                    Neil s my ex.

    He glances back.

                    He did psychology with me. I told 
                    him all about you. He .. He read 
                    those notes you made. 

                                  SAM
                    There was nothing in the notes 
                    about a mobile phone.

                                  ANNIE
                    What?

                                  SAM
                    This is just my mind trying to keep 
                    me here..

                                  ANNIE
                    He s playing games with you. He s 
                    like that. Just .. look down. 
                    Carefully.

    SAM peers down. NEIL waits in the street, bouncing anxiously 
      from foot to foot.

                                  NEIL
                          (shouts up)
                      P-Pleasedon t jump. Sorry. I m 
                    sorry. Baaadjoke.

                                  ANNIE
                    Come away from the edge. There s 
                    nothing to wake up from. 

                                  SAM
                    I refuse to accept that.

    He lifts one leg, grinning and thrilled.

                                  NEIL
                    Please no! Don t do it!

      ANNIE climbs up onto the ledge with him.

                                  SAM
                    What are you doing?

                                  ANNIE
                    We all feel like jumping sometimes 
                    Sam. Only we don t. Because we re 
                    not cowards, you and me. 

                                  SAM
                    This is my mind ...

                                  ANNIE
                    Sometimes I feel like running away

                    more than a plonkwith a girl s
                      truncheon. 

    She holds out her stubby truncheon. Despite his predicament, 
    SAM has to smile.

                                  ANNIE
                    But at least while we re here we 
                    have the hopeof making a 
                      difference. Maybe you re here for a 
                    reason. To .. To make a difference.
                          (beat)
                    Give me your hand.

    She reaches out and carefully takes his hand.

                                  SAM
                    What s that on your hand? Grit ..

                    Sand. I was running up here and I 
                    fell against the fire bucket.

                                  SAM
                    Why would I imagine that? Why would 
                    I bother to put that kind of detail 
                    in?

                                  ANNIE
                    You wouldn t. There s a real sand 
                    bucket and I really fell into it.

    SAM stares at her. And she smiles a bashful, hopeful smile 
      that suggests she feels a connection to him. And in that 
      moment he feels it to.

                                  SAM
                          (whisper)

                                  ANNIE
                    Stay.

    He stares at her.

    THE PICTURE FADES INTO A WHITE DOT IN THE CENTRE OF THE 
      SCREEN. THE DOT WE ALL REMEMBER FROM SEVENTIES TV S.

      Sound of ventilator. Then SILENCE.
