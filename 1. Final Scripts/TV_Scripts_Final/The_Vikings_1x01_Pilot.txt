    TEASER

  A young Viking, RAGNAR LOTHBROK is engaged in a fight to the 
  death with two LATVIAN WARRIORS, distinguishable by their 
    eastern-looking clothing. Ragnar has been fighting a long 
  time. His torso is smeared with blood, like his sword, and 
  the bodies of the dead lie scattered around. 

  The Latvians are bigger and heavier but we quickly appreciate 
    Ragnar s weapon skills and speed of thought, blocking the 
  blows of the axes with sword and shield and weaving out of 
    range. We also see that one of the Latvian s is already badly 
    wounded, with blood streaming from a wound in his head.  

    Ragnar concentrates on him for a moment, thrusting, turning 
  him, twisting away so the warrior wastes his diminishing 
    energy slicing thin air with his axe and bellowing angrily. 
    Finally he stumbles and Ragnar drives his sword into his 
    chest.

  But at the same moment the second Latvian attacks from 
    behind, swinging down his axe for a mighty blow. Ragnar 
    pivots round, his shield taking the full force of the blow,  
    leaving the axe-head embedded in the wood.

    Aghast, unable to free his weapon, the Latvian abandons it 
  and starts to run. Very calmly, Ragnar pulls a spear out of 
  the body of one of the dead and hurls it after the running 
    man. Speared clean through the back the warrior falls.

    Ragnar, suddenly as weary as death, trudges a few yards up 
  the slope and surveys the rest of the battle field. In the 
    gathering gloom an eery silence has fallen. Scores of bodies, 
    hacked, mutilated and speared lie on the ground. And 
    everywhere flocks of crows and ravens flutter down and feast 
  upon the corpses. And there is not one living human thing 
    moving over that field of death - except a solitary figure. A 
  TALL MAN with a long cloak and a wide-brimmed hat, holding a 
    spear, he moves slowly between the bodies of the Viking dead, 
    seeming to note and inspect each one. He is a spectral 
    figure, strange, disturbing, powerful, with ravens sometimes 
    perching upon his shoulders...and Ragnar watches him like one 
    transfigured, like one who has come face to face with his 
  god.

  The tall man pauses by one of the Viking dead and points him 
  out with his spear. At that moment the air around appears to 
    shimmer and two or three almost transluscent, almost naked 
  YOUNG FEMALE VALKYRIES appear and gather the slain warrior 
  into their arms. In great brightness the young women lift 
  into the liquid air...and vanish.                                                                                  2.



    Ragnar watches this miracle in silent awe, then looks over 
  again at the tall man. For a brief moment the tall man lifts 
  his head, revealing his face beneath the wide-brimmed hat. 
  The face is indescribable - except for its single eye, which 
    stares back at Ragnar with a pitiless and terrible intensity.

  And then he is gone, as if he had never been, leaving Ragnar 
  to survey the darkening, mysterious scene.

  END OF TEASER

  These words appear on the screen:

    NORWAY, LATE 8TH CENTURY.

  The wooden and turf house is dark and almost window-less, the 
  rooms lit by tallow candles. From outside comes the dull 
    rumble of summer thunder.

    Somewhere in the darkness a WOMAN is breathing heavily and 
    groaning. We hear the sound of other WOMEN S VOICES, low and 
    sibilant, almost chanting.

  A YOUNG MAN - RAGNAR - fretful and anxious, crosses the place 
    where the colored war shields are fixed to the wall like 
  eyes, and looks into the chamber where his wife, LAGERTHA, 
  the shield-maiden lies upon their bed giving birth, 
    surrounded by three or four OLDER WOMEN, one of them ancient.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  What do you want?

                                RAGNAR
                  Isn t it here yet?

  The ancient woman doesn t bother to respond, spits on the 
  floor and places her hands again on Lagertha s swollen 
    stomach and resumes her low, strange chant.

  One of the other MID-WIVES speaks more kindly.

                                MID-WIFE
                  Not yet, Ragnar. Go away and do 
                  something useful.

    Outside the storm breaks, the thunder louder and rain hissing 
  on the ground.

    RAGNAR moves away, into another chamber, and crouches down 
    beside a small wooden statue set in a niche beside the fire, 
    very crudely carved from a piece of wood: a statue of a nude 
    female figure,wearing just a necklace, with large breasts.                                                                                    3.



    Ragnar picks it up.

                                RAGNAR
                  Freya, make everything go well 
                  today. Make sure Lagertha lives, 
                  and is delivered of a healthy 
                  child. 

  A beat. The thunder cracks again. Then Ragnar shrugs and puts 
  the figure down.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                I know you can t really change 
                  anything.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN V.O.
                  It s time.

    Ragnar hurries back through.

  His wife s legs are spread wide open and something is 
    emerging between them: a head, with a halo of bright hair. 
  The ancient woman continues her sing-song chant and the 
    younger women help with the birth, one of them holding the 
    baby s head as the rest of its body slithers out in an abrupt 
    rush of blood and afterbirth...and Ragnar gasps at the wonder 
  of it. Stares at the bloody bundle even as they cut the chord 
  and begin to wash it.

                                RAGNAR
                  What is it?

                                LAGERTHA
                        (with a laugh)
                  It s a boy.

                                RAGNAR
                  How do you know?

                                LAGERTHA
                  What are you talking about? Didn t 
                I promise you a son?

    Ragnar looks at the ancient woman.

                                RAGNAR
                  Is it a boy?

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Look for yourself, Ragnar Lothbrok.

    Ragnar looks. Satisfies himself.                                                                                  4.



                                LAGERTHA
                  Give him here. I have enough milk 
                  for a herd of boys.

  The baby is lifted to her breast, where it suckles.


  EXT. VIKING SETTLEMENT - DAY

    Ragnar emerges from his house carrying the baby, wrapped in a 
    blanket. The storm has passed. The wood and turf building is 
  one of several in the small hamlet perched on the edge of a 
  deep fjord. It s a vision of stillness and utter 
    tranquillity. The thickly wooded slopes of the fyord drop 
  down sheer to the water, and above them the bare rocks are 
  still capped with snow. The whole landscape has a strange, 
    magical luminosity - a heightened, almost unnatural beauty. 

    Ragnar takes his son to the water s edge and holds him out in 
  his arms, like an offering.

                                RAGNAR
                  Look Odin. Look, I have a son. 
                  Thank you, lord. Thank you for my 
                  son.

  We move in CLOSE on the baby s face - then the camera tilts 
  up towards the sky.

  And suddenly the sky begins to darken...


    EXT. THE HEAVENS

    Darkness - and out of the darkness a noise like no other, of 
    horns and hooves and the shrill cry of birds and the roaring 
  of men and women. And over the dark fields, fringed with 
    fire, high in the darkling sky flies a tumultuous host: 
    thousands of Viking warriors and Valkyries packed together 
  and riding plunging horses, armed with spears and swords, and 
    half-naked shield-maidens with bows and shields, sweeping 
    across the heavens in a wild hunt amidst thick flocks of 
    wheeling ravens.

  And in the midst of this vast ghostly army the huge figure of 
    Odin, the god of dead warriors, lord of Valhalla, riding his 
    eight-legged horse Sleipnir, carrying his spear, two ravens 
    perched on his shoulders, his cloak streaming out behind him, 
  his single-eye surveying this great, ecstatic, thundering 
    host of the risen dead.                                                                                  5.




  INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

    Winter. The embers of the fire still glow in the centre of 
  the floor. We are close again on the baby s face...as he 
    sleeps in the crook of Ragnar s arm.

    Ragnar is awake, staring up into the darkness and the play of 
    shadows across the rafters, a look of profound awe upon his 
  face.


  EXT. HOUSE - DAY

  Now everything is in the fierce grip of the deepest winter. 
  Icy winds blast across the fjord, heaping the water into 
    wild, foaming waves, and the mountains above are thick with 
  snow. Even at mid-day the sky is almost dark, like a 
    perpetual twilight.

  But through this dark desolation a solitary FIGURE can be 
  seen, a black smudge against the snow, wrapped in furs 
    against the icy winds, struggling towards the hamlet.


  INT. HOUSE - DAY

    Lagertha plays with her two CHILDREN. Her son BJORN is about 
  ten and daughter GYDA about eight years old.

    Ragnar appears, gestures to her.

                                RAGNAR
                  Come.

    Ragnar leads Lagertha into the main room.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Here is the man I told you of, 
                  Lagertha.

  He indicates the figure standing beside the fire: a tall MAN 
  of uncertain age, his craggy face heavily lined, his hair and 
    beard both long and matted, as if his journey has been long 
  and arduous.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Welcome, stranger, to our house.

  The strange man bows a little. Lagertha pours a drink of 
    sweet, strong mead and hands it to him. The stranger empties 
  the cup.                                                                                  6.



                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  Sit by the fire, warm yourself.

  The stranger nods again, and sits, Ragnar and Lagertha doing 
    likewise.

                                RAGNAR
                  This man is a wanderer. He has been 
                  on a boat that travelled to the 
                  west.

    This is clearly a shock to Lagertha. She stares at the man.

                                LAGERTHA
                Is it true?

  Once more the stranger nods, but does not reply. Lagertha 
    suddenly realizes that he is glancing towards his cup, and 
  she quickly re-fills it.

  And once more he empties it, then belches, and wipes his hand 
  over his mouth.

                                WANDERER
                  We sailed north up the coast, to 
                  the rock formation which looks like 
                a skull. And then, when we were out 
                  in the open sea, we turned due 
                  west. And I was frightened.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What happened to you? Where did you 
                  get to?

    Behind her, we see Bjorn and Gyda peeking into the room, and 
    listening.

                                WANDERER
                  After two days and nights we saw 
                  land. Someone said it was a land 
                  called England, for they had been 
                  there before. But I don t know if 
                  it s true. I was only told that in 
                  this land there was great treasure. 
                  We went ashore, found a big house 
                  there, and took some things from 
                  it.

    From his bundle of discarded furs he retrieves an object: a 
    small but very beautiful ivory crucifix.                                                                                  7.



                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                In England, they worship a strange 
                  god called Jesus Christ. They say 
                he died in a tree.

                                RAGNAR
                  Like Odin. Only Odin came back to 
                  life.

    Lagertha examines the glittering prize.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Tell us how you crossed the open 
                  ocean - once you lost sight of 
                  land? How did you know you were 
                  sailing west, not north or south?

                                WANDERER
                  We had a board. It belonged to a 
                  Swede.

                                LAGERTHA
                A board? What kind of board...?

                                WANDERER
                A sun-shadow board. Here is one.

    Again he reaches into the thick pile of animal furs and this 
    time produces a  solskuggerfol  board. It is a smallish 
    wooden board with a pin or gnomon in the centre (which can be 
    adjusted up or down) and with circles drawn around the pin.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                To show you how it works, I need to 
                  float it in a tub of water.

    Ragnar goes off to fetch one.

  Once more the wanderer looks at his empty cup, and once more 
    Lagertha re-fills it.

  And once more he empties the cup in one gulp. Outside the 
    wind blasts against the house and makes the candles inside 
    flutter and almost gutter.

    Ragnar returns with the tub of water and the wanderer places 
  the board in the water, where it floats.

  Then he takes a candle.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  This candle is the sun.                                                                                  8.



  He holds the candle over the board.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  Each day the sun rises, and climbs 
                in the sky until noon.
                      (he arcs the candle across 
                        the board - the shadow 
                          shortens)
                  See how the shadow shortens. At 
                  noon it will be at its shortest as 
                  the sun is at its zenith.

                                RAGNAR
                  But this only tells me how far 
                  south I have travelled -

                                WANDERER
                  Now listen. The day before you 
                  sail, mark a circle around the 
                  pointer on the board at the place 
                  where the shadow is shortest at 
                  noon. The next day at sea, place 
                  the board in water again around 
                  noon and watch for the shadow. If 
                it only touches the circle, your 
                  course remains true. If the shadow 
                  passes outside the circle, like 
                  this, you have drifted and must 
                  steer further south. If the shadow 
                  never reaches the circle you are to 
                  the south and must steer more 
                  north. Keep the noon shadow on the 
                  circle and your course will be 
                  true.

    Ragnar and Lagertha stare at the board and the shadow as it 
    moves across it.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Is it really true, wanderer, that 
                  you crossed the ocean using only 
                  this...this children s toy?

                                WANDERER
                  Yes, I swear to you. I swear on my 
                  sacred ring. Of course, we also 
                  used ravens to show how far we 
                  might be from land, but the board 
                  took us across the open sea.

                                LAGERTHA
                I cannot believe it.                                                                                  9.



    Ragnar looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  But if it s true, Lagertha, just 
                  imagine! In just two days and 
                  nights we can reach the coast of 
                  England. We can find out for 
                  ourselves if what people have said 
                  is there really is there: rich 
                  lands, buildings made of stone, 
                  places filled with treasures. Don t 
                  you want to go and find out? I do.

  A long beat.

    Lagertha looks at the board, then at the wanderer.

  Then she blows out the candle, plunging the board into 
    darkness.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Why did you do that?

                                LAGERTHA
                  Because there is something I want 
                  to know. I want to know what 
                  happens if there is no sun? How can 
                  the board help you then? How can 
                  you find your way.

                                WANDERER
                  You use this.

  He holds something out in his hand, but they can t see what 
  it is. Ragnar brings another candle closer - and it shines 
    upon a piece of semi-transluscent rock (actually a form of 
    calcite).

                                RAGNAR
                  What s that?

                                WANDERER
                A sunstone.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What good is it?

  The wanderer smiles.

                                WANDERER
                  I ll show you. Come outside.

    Ragnar leads them outside.                                                                                  10.




  EXT. HOUSE - DAY

  They look up at the sky - even now, around noon, it s a 
    leaden grey, with no sign of the sun.

                                WANDERER
                  Watch.

  He holds up the sunstone. A beat. (The calcite works by 
    polarizing light).

  The sunstone glows faintly, and an equally faint beam seems 
  to bounce back from it and illuminate a spot in the sky, 
    behind the thick clouds.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  You see? There is the sun.

  It seems like a miracle. Neither Ragnar nor Lagertha can 
    speak as they bear witness to it.


    EXT. SETTLEMENT - SPRING - DAY

    Time has passed. Watched by her ten-year old daughter GYDA, 
    Lagertha draws water from the well. Despite her reputation as 
  a shield-maiden, Lagertha remains a slim, slight figure, with 
    long braided hair.

    It s still cold enough for her breath to steam, but the icy 
    blasts of winter are over and the landscape breathes and 
    greens.

  As she carries the bucket back towards the house we see 
    various animals in timbered pens, for this is a working farm. 
  And down by the water, a couple of small wooden boats.

  Two large and hairy hunting dogs shamble around the yard.

    Lagertha looks over at a neighboring property, where the 
    HOUSEHOLDER is leaving, riding a small, wiry horse up the 
    steep trail behind the houses.

    Glances back at her daughter.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Gyda, feed the goats.                                                                                  11.




  INT. RAGNAR S HOUSE - DAY

    Lagertha, carrying the bucket inside, finds Ragnar putting a 
  thick woollen coat over the shoulders of his son, BJORN, now 
    twelve years old, and a handsome, strong-looking youth.

    Lagertha stops and looks at them.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What are you two doing?

                                RAGNAR
                  I m taking Bjorn to the Thing.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Not yet. He s not old enough.

                                RAGNAR
                  He s twelve years old. 

                                LAGERTHA
                  Take him next year. Next year is 
                  soon enough.

    Ragnar smiles at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  He ll need a silk ribbon.


    INT. HOUSE - EVENING

    BJORN  spies  on his mother as Lagertha washes her long 
    blonde hair in the tub of water. The water seems to flow in 
    slow motion from the ends of her hair like mercury as she 
    kneels over the tub.

  His eyes are full of love for her.

                                BJORN
                        (quietly)
                  Mother.

    Lagertha looks up, flicks back her hair so she can see him, 
  and smiles tenderly.


    INT. BEDCHAMBER - HOUSE - NIGHT

    Ragnar and Lagertha in bed together, cradled close after love-
    making. She stares into his eyes.                                                                                  12.



                                LAGERTHA
                  Don t sleep with too many women in 
                  Kattegat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Are you crazy? I won t sleep with 
                  any of them. I don t want to. I can 
                do without it for a few weeks.

                                LAGERTHA
                Is that another way of saying you 
                  love me?

  She teases him.

                                RAGNAR
                I always dream of you. Last night I 
                  dreamt you were feeding me blood 
                  pudding.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What does that mean?

                                RAGNAR
                  It means you were giving me your 
                  heart.

  And they close in, and kiss passionately.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                I love you so much I could feed you 
                  the whole sky.


    EXT. YARD - HOUSE - DAY

    Father and son are ready to depart on their small, tough 
    horses, both wearing heavy woollen coats, tight leather 
    trousers, cloaks and leather boots.

    Lagertha and Gyda bring out some food for the journey, 
    putting it into their saddle-bags.

    Bjorn kisses Gyda.

                                BJORN
                  Goodbye, little sister.

                                GYDA
                  Goodbye, big brother. Don t get 
                  drunk.                                                                                  13.



                                LAGERTHA
                  Wait. I have something for both of 
                  you.

  She takes out two thin strips of colored ribbon, and ties one 
    around Bjorn s head and the other around her husband s.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  There. Now everyone will know you 
                  are free men on your way to the 
                  Thing. 

    Ragnar kisses her.

                                RAGNAR
                  Goodbye my shield-maiden.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Look after your son - and when you 
                  come back, just tell me the truth. 
                I don t care about anything else.

  And then she and her daughter watch Ragnar and Bjorn set off 
  up the rough trail towards the trees, accompanied by one of 
  the hunting dogs, Ragnar armed with a spear, a sword and 
  knife and Bjorn with his hunting knife.

  Bjorn looks back once, and raises his arm in farewell, and 
  then they are swallowed up into the trees.


  EXT. TRACK - DAY

  They ride slowly on together through a landscape of forest, 
  scrub and rock. There is no-one else in sight, no farms or 
    dwellings, for the rocky earth here is clearly unfit for 
    agriculture or ploughing. Is even too barren for sheep.

  There are signs of spring everywhere, however, the trees a 
    brighter green, the gorse in flower.

                                BJORN
                  What will happen at the Thing?

                                RAGNAR
                  Earl Haraldson will deal, as usual, 
                  with some criminal offences that 
                  have happened since the last 
                  meeting. And then everyone will 
                  discuss the summer raids. 

                                BJORN
                  Where will you go?                                                                                  14.



    There s a long beat. Ragnar glances at his son, then away 
    again, with a shrug.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s not up to me. Earl Haraldson 
                  decides. I wish it was not so...but 
                  that is the law.

  But Bjorn can see that the question has affected his father s 
    mood.

    They splash through a stream.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  All the ice has gone. Spring is 
                  here again, thanks to Frey.


    EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

    They have camped in the open. A fire is burning and they have 
    cooked some small animal over it and eaten it. The dog gnaws 
  at the bones.

                                BJORN
                  There s something I want to ask 
                  you.

                                RAGNAR
                  Then ask me.

                                BJORN
                  How did you meet mother?

    Ragnar s smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  Hasn t she ever told you?

                                BJORN
                  Of course. But I want to know if 
                  your story is the same as hers. 

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Well, it occurred when a Swedish 
                  chieftan invaded our part of 
                  Norway. I went off to fight him and 
                  many of the local women dressed up 
                  in men s clothing and joined our 
                  camp. Lagertha was amongst them. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  15.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                I was impressed by her courage and 
                  courted her from afar. 

                                BJORN
                  How far is that?

                                RAGNAR
                  Hush. Listen. After a while I went 
                to confess my love for her - but 
                  when I arrived I was set upon by a 
                  bear and an enormous hound who 
                  guarded her home. I killed the bear 
                  with my spear and managed to 
                  strangle the hound with my bare 
                  hands.
                        (beat)
                  And that s the way I gained her 
                  hand in marriage.
                        (glances at his son)
                  What did she tell you?

  Bjorn smiles, then lies down, pulls the blanket over himself.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Did she tell you the same story?

  A long beat.

                                BJORN
                  Just about.

  And he closes his eyes, still smiling.


  EXT. KATTEGAT - DAY

  They ride into Kattegat, a sizeable town and a trading 
    station, set on the bank of a river. It s a busy place with 
  open carts and covered wagons, horses and boats bringing 
    people and goods to the local market, as well as delegates to 
  the Thing, wearing ribbons around their foreheads.

  At the market place, TRADERS - several of them of Arabic 
    appearance, and dressed in totally different costumes - are 
    examining the pelts, furs, ropes and bear-skins for sale.

  The ARABS are also examining the handful of SLAVES for sale, 
    most of Slavic appearance, checking their teeth, hair and 
    nails, as if they were horses.

  There is a lot of good-humored banter and loud haggling.

  All of this Bjorn has clearly seen before, and is not fazed 
  by.                                                                                   16.


  But then a large group of YOUNG MEN, clearly drunk, come 
    swaggering through the market place, shouting out insults to 
  the traders and laughing, grabbing at the pelts and furs, 
    creating a disturbance.

  The traders reclaim their goods and drive them away, angrily. 
    Ragnar watches the incident with a heavy heart.

                                BJORN
                  Who are they?

                                RAGNAR
                  Young men with nothing better to 
                  do. These days they regard the old 
                  ways, of trading and farming, as 
                  too tame. They think it s stupid to 
                  acquire by sweat and toil what they 
                  can easily win by blood.

                                BJORN
                  Blood?

                                RAGNAR
                In battle.
                        (beat)
                  It s a real problem. There seem to 
                be more and more of them every 
                  year. And it s a great waste. Those 
                  young men are our future. Someone 
                  should harness their strength and 
                  their anger.

  They move on. 

  Then a great bear of a man steps out before their horses, 
    grabbing the bridles and laughing.

                                BEAR MAN
                  Ragnar Lothbrok!

    Ragnar and Bjorn dismount. Ragnar embraces him. 

                                BEAR MAN (CONT D)
                  Do my eyes deceive me? Is this your 
                  son? How he s grown!

                                RAGNAR
                  Bjorn, this is your uncle Rollo. We 
                  sail in the same boat.

                                BJORN
                  Uncle.

    Rollo looks him up and down.                                                                                  17.



                                ROLLO
                So you re here for the Thing? 
                  You re a real man now. Let s have a 
                  drink. 


  INT. TAVERN - EVENING

  A long gloomy room, with a fire in the centre and benches 
    arranged on either side.

  The men drink ale from horned cups. Rollo watches Bjorn sip 
  from his horn, and laughs.

                                ROLLO
                  You won t get drunk like that.

    Bjorn smiles uneasily, then tips back the horn and drinks 
    deeply.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  Are you ready for a woman? There 
                  are some good-looking women in 
                  Kattegat. And they re free.

                                RAGNAR
                  Of course he isn t. He can t even 
                  grow a beard.

    Rollo laughs again, empties his horn, and holds it out to be 
    refilled by a WOMAN with a jug. He stares at her wolfishly.

                                ROLLO
                  So - where do you think he ll send 
                  us this year?

                                RAGNAR
                  Probably to the Eastlands again - 
                  the same as last year. The same as 
                  always.

                                ROLLO
                  Those bastards up there are as poor 
                  as we are. What do they have left 
                  to give us?

                                RAGNAR
                  Only themselves.

  A beat. He glances round, lowers his voice.                                                                                  18.



                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                We should go west. I ve heard such 
                  tales, Rollo. Great towns, cities 
                  and treasures; hordes of gold and 
                  silver. And a new god.

                                ROLLO
                  I ve heard those stories too. But 
                  what does it mean?
                We can t sail across an open ocean.

  A beat. Ragnar glances carefully at Bjorn, who has fallen 
    asleep on his thigh. Lowers his voice again, despite the 
  loud, drunken voices around him.

                                RAGNAR
                  We can. I believe there s a way.

    Rollo looks at him.

    Then Ragnar picks up his son.

                                ROLLO
                  Where are you going?

                                RAGNAR
                  To sleep.

                                ROLLO
                I don t understand you, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok, everyone else comes here 
                  to get drunk in the company of good 
                  friends and to fuck beautiful 
                  women.

    Ragnar smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  I ll see you in the Great Hall.

  He carries his son away.


    INT. RAGNAR S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Outside, a cold wind whips across the waters of the fjord. 
    Lagertha settles her daughter to sleep, telling her a story.

                                LAGERTHA
                  The giantess opened her rotting 
                  cavernous mouth and yawned.  Go 
                  away!  She said.  I want to sleep 
                  again. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  19.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT'D)
                  I m not doing you any more favors.  
                  She gave Freya a withering look. 
                   My noble goddess, she said,  you 
                  leap around at night like Heidrun 
                  cavorting with a herd of goats. 

  Gyda, warm beneath a bear skin, smiles sleepily.

  A beat.

                                GYDA
                  Go on!

                                LAGERTHA
                  Freya slowly raised her arms - like 
                  this!
                        (raises her own arms)
                   I will girdle you with flame so 
                  you cannot leave this place without 
                  catching fire.  Hyndla laughed. 
                   You ve gone running to Od, who 
                  always loved you; and many another 
                  has wormed his way under your 
                  apron. 

  She pauses, checks the girl again...whose eyes are now 
    closed. She is nearly asleep.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                        (more quietly)
                  There was fire in Asgard, dancing 
                  in the air. A band of flame, a 
                  quivering halo, surrounded the 
                  giantess. Her limbs tightened; she 
                  pressed her arms against her side.  
                  Flames about me,  she cried.  The 
                  earth is on fire, and I must pay 
                  the full price or forfeit my life. 

  She stops, listens for a moment to the sound of her 
    daughter s easy breathing. Then leans down, kisses her 
    forehead, and pulls the bear skin up to her neck.

    Lagertha moves through to the other chamber. The fire (in the 
    centre of the room) is dying down. But its flickering flames 
    illuminate the war shields hung from hooks on the wall. She 
    stares at them - and then unhooks one, and holds it to 
    herself...as if remembering all the times she used it, in the 
    heat of battle. 

  Now she stands proud with it, in the empty room, with only 
  the crackling of the logs and the moaning of the wind.                                                                                  20.




  INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

  A large and impressive chamber with a lattice of high beams 
  and some wall coverings. It s crowded. On a raised dais at 
  one end, sat on a carved chair, is EARL HARALDSON, late 
    forties and still a formidable-looking warrior, dressed in 
    wide trousers and fur-trimmed coat. The Earl is flanked by 
  some of his HOUSECARLS - his private, elite bodyguard - by 
    SLAVES and several (mostly male) members of his FAMILY. His 
    striking WIFE wears a sleeveless dress which reaches to the 
    ground, and over it a sleeveless cape which is thrown back, 
    revealing the whiteness of her arms. She is adorned with 
    necklaces and oval brooches.

    Filling the rest of the hall, and obliged to stand, are 
    FREEMEN like Ragnar and Rollo.

  In the small space between them a rather pathetic FIGURE is 
    standing, shifting from one foot to the other, his eyes 
    downcast. He s almost a figure of fun and everyone is 
    grinning at him.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Olaf Anwend...

                                OLAF
                  Yes, sir.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  You have pleaded guilty to the 
                  charge of stealing. Tomorrow you 
                  will run a gauntlet of stones and 
                  turf as punishment.

                                OLAF
                  Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Don t thank me. And let it be known 
                  that a fine is to be paid by anyone 
                  who fails to throw something.

    There s laughter - as Olaf is led away. Bjorn tries his best 
  to peer through the men blocking his view of events.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Bring in the next accused.

  Bjorn actually catches a glimpse of the YOUNG MAN brought 
  into the hall in chains by the housecarls. The young man has 
  a pleasant expression, keeps his head high and does not avert 
  his eyes.                                                                                  21.



                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Eric Trygvasson, you are accused of 
                  the murder of Sigvald Strut this 
                  January. How do you plead?

                                TRYGVASSON
                It wasn t murder, lord. I killed 
                  him in self-defence. It was he who 
                  attacked me.

                                WOMAN
                        (shouting)
                  LIAR!

  The WOMAN is part of the dead man s family, standing in a 
  group close to the defendant.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  If it wasn t murder, why did you 
                  not declare your crime to the first 
                  person you met afterwards, as the 
                  law obliges? In fact, you passed by 
                  several houses before you reported 
                  it.

    Trygvasson looks over at the woman and the dead man s family.

                                TRYGVASSON
                  I...I thought the relatives of the 
                  dead man might be living in them.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  The law allows you to pass two 
                  houses in such circumstances - but 
                  never a third.

                                FAMILY MEMBER
                  You felt guilty. You went to his 
                  house and murdered my brother in 
                  cold blood.

  Fresh uproar. Bjorn struggles to keep an eye-line on the 
    accused. Ragnar notices, lifts him up.

                                  TRYGVASSON
                  It s not true. We argued about some 
                  land. He pulled out a knife...

                                WOMAN
                  You re lying! You wanted that land 
                  for yourself. You re a liar and a 
                  coward.                                                                                  22.



                                TRYGVASSON
                  Who says I m a coward? I m no 
                  coward.

  More people join in the shouting. The Earl bangs his fist on 
  the table.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Silence! All of you - show some 
                  respect.

    They fall silent. Earl Haraldson looks at Trygvasson.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                As the normal procedures were not 
                  followed, this killing cannot be 
                  atoned for by compensating the 
                  victim s family.

  The family shout their approval, raise their fists 
    aggressively towards the defendant.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Murder is a dishonorable act among 
                  our people, Eric Trygvasson, 
                  committed in secret, unacknowledged 
                  and very likely to set in train a 
                  cycle of revenge killings, which 
                  would also involve your own family.

  He looks up at the assembly.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                I ask all of you how you find the 
                  accused. If you think him guilty, 
                  raise your arms. Your decision must 
                  be unanimous.

    Quickly, everyone raises their hands. But the Earl hesitates, 
  for someone has not. Ragnar realizes who it is and squeezes 
    Bjorn s thigh. Bjorn raises his hand.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Eric Trygvasson, you have been 
                  found guilty of murder. How would 
                  you like to die?

  A beat. Trygvasson looks round the room in that same cool 
    way, as if he was above it all.

                                  TRYGVASSON
                  By beheading, lord.                                                                                  23.



                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Granted. Your execution will take 
                  place tomorrow. And afterwards we 
                  shall feast and discuss the summer 
                  raids.


  EXT. KATTEGAT - DAY

  To jeers and shouts, Olaf Anwend runs the gauntlet of stones 
  and turf. He staggers down the line of people, women as well 
  as men, throwing the missiles at him.

  Bjorn watches with Ragnar, at first enjoying the comic 
    aspects of the scene - then wincing slightly as Olaf is 
    struck by stone after stone, staggers, and starts to bleed.

    Ragnar offers the boy a stone. Bjorn looks uncertain.

                                RAGNAR
                  You have to.

  A beat. Ragnar turns and throws the stone himself at Anwend, 
    hitting his leg. Anwend struggles on, everyone still enjoying 
  the comedic aspects. With a laugh Rollo throws a large rock 
  at Anwend, which hits his head and makes him cry out with 
  pain.

  Bjorn grabs a handful of turf and throws it, missing easily 
  and deliberately.

    Bleeding heavily, but alive, Anwend crawls the last few yards 
  to the end of the line, where with renewed hilarity a bucket 
  of cold water is poured over his bleeding head, and he 
    emerges - grinning like a madman. 

  Then Earl Haraldson and his entourage appear, the housecarls 
    bringing Eric Trygvasson to his execution. Trygvasson s 
    hands, unlike at the trial, are now unbound, and he walks 
    resolutely up to the wooden block on which he will be 
    decapitated.

  He smiles at the crowds gathered around him, and acknowledges 
  the dead man s family.

                                BJORN
                  Why is he smiling, father?

                                RAGNAR
                He wants to die well, of course, 
                  without fear. To atone for his 
                  sins.                                                                                  24.



  Bjorn looks puzzled.

                                ROLLO
                  Cattle die, kinsfolk die, we 
                  ourselves must die. But one thing I 
                  know will never die - a dead man s 
                  reputation. Remember that, young 
                  Bjorn.

    Trygvasson kneels on the grass and puts his head on the 
    stone. A HOUSECARL with an axe approaches, first lays the 
  blade of the axe flat on his head, then presents the blade 
  for him to kiss. Trygvasson kisses the blade eagerly, and 
    almost tenderly.

  Bjorn turns his head away.

                                RAGNAR
                  You must watch - for his sake. This 
                  is his only hope of reaching 
                  Valhalla.

    Bjorn forces himself to watch.

  The axe falls, striking off Trygvasson s head, which rolls 
    away into the grass.

    Earl Haraldson picks up the head and contemptuously tosses it 
  to the dead man s family.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Here. Feed it to your pigs. I curse 
                  him. May he never enter Valhalla. 

    Ragnar looks shocked. He s not the only one.

                                BJORN
                  Why did he do that?

                                RAGNAR
                I don t know. He should not have 
                  done. Not according to our law. He 
                  must have wanted that land himself.

  And he exchanges a meaningful glance with Rollo.


    EXT. BOAT - DAY

  The oars of a small boat slice cleanly into the waters of the 
    fyord. Bjorn stares down silently into the water, but the 
    reflections on its surface make it seem like the mountains 
  are in the water.                                                                                   25.


    Ragnar rows, keeping close to the shore, beneath the lee of 
  the overhanging cliffs and slopes of scree which fall sheer 
  to the fyord.

  Bjorn drops a smooth round pebble into the water and watches 
  it drop and drop, deeper and deeper into the clear depths.

  Bjorn watches his father row.

                                BJORN
                  Now where are we going, father?

                                RAGNAR
                To visit a friend.

                                BJORN
                A friend? What s his name?

                                RAGNAR
                  His name is Floki. 

  Bjorn stares at the high, snow-capped hills, the great, 
    almost overwhelming beauty of it.

                                BJORN
                  Like Loki, the god?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, like Loki. Only... different.

                                BJORN
                  How is he different?

                                RAGNAR
                  Well...
                        (thinks)
                  He s not a god.

    Bjorn laughs.

                                BJORN
                  Why didn t he come to the Thing?

  A long beat. Oars slice through the deep still waters. One 
    could well imagine that the gods were here, among these 
    unnaturally beautiful, silent places.

                                RAGNAR
                  Because he s...because he s shy.

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                  26.




  EXT. BAY - DAY

    They ve pulled the boat onto a narrow beach in a hidden bay. 
    There s no sign of habitation.

  They walk up a steep path through the trees.

  When a FIGURE leaps out at them, wearing a fierce mask, and 
    with a hideous screech.

  Bjorn is shocked...but still calm enough to draw out his 
    hunting knife.

    Ragnar laughs.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s all right. Put your knife 
                  away.
                        (beat)
                  Floki, meet my son. Bjorn...this is 
                  my dear friend Floki.

    FLOKI rips off his mask, and grins. He has a strange, 
    mischievous, almost ageless face, ugly but animated, with 
    bright, piercing eyes.

                                FLOKI
                  Hello. How are you?

                                BJORN
                  Well, thank you...sir.

    Floki stares at his face.

                                FLOKI
                  Let me see. You have your father s 
                  eyes - unfortunately.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why unfortunately?

                                FLOKI
                  It means he will be like you. And 
                  therefore he will want to do better 
                  than you. And you will hate him for 
                  it.

                                RAGNAR
                  He s only twelve years old.                                                                                  27.



                                BJORN
                  How can you tell that by just 
                  looking at my face?

                                FLOKI
                  It s the same with trees.

                                BJORN
                  With trees?

                                FLOKI
                  Yes. I can tell which trees will 
                  make the best planks just by 
                  looking at them. I can look inside 
                  the tree. 

                                RAGNAR
                  Floki is a boat-builder.

  Bjorn stares around at the deeply-forested hill they are on.

                                BJORN
                So - you could tell which of these 
                  trees would make the best planks 
                  for a ship?

  Floki grins...then abruptly walks off the path, and into the 
    trees. They follow him.

  For their POV - and from ours - all the trees look the same, 
    virtually identical.

  But Floki stares at them with a strange, bewitching 
      intensity....touching the trunks of some of them, laying his 
  cheek against the bark, staring up at the uppermost branches. 

    Whatever amusement Bjorn might derive from seeing a man 
    staring at trees is quickly confounded by the aura of 
    spiritual intensity which surrounds Floki. He s no ordinary 
    mortal. It s not possible to laugh at the way he examines the 
  bark of tress, or caresses them, or simply just looks at 
  them.

  Floki is different. Strange but compelling. Authentic.

                                FLOKI
                        (suddenly)
                  This is one.

  He indicates a tree - to the others, just like the rest of 
  the trees...and yet. Floki strokes the trunk.                                                                                  28.



                                FLOKI (CONT D)
                  Inside this tree are two almost 
                  perfect planks. They will bend, 
                  then curve, like a woman s body, 
                  from the thigh to the back. When I 
                  split the tree I will find them.

  He marks the tree with a couple of blows from his axe.

  Bjorn laughs.

                                BJORN
                  You can see that?

                                FLOKI
                Do you think I m joking? I joke 
                  about many things, son of Ragnar, 
                  but never about ship-building. Our 
                  boats are our souls. 

  Bjorn looks abashed - embarrassed.

                                RAGNAR
                  So - how is our boat?

  Floki looks back at him. And grins.

                                FLOKI
                  Ah...

                                                                          CUT TO:


    INT. BOAT-YARD - DAY

  A secret, turf-covered shed close by the edge of the water.

    Gloomy - but slightly  religious  in the way the space is lit 
  by tallow candles. 

    Watched by Ragnar and Bjorn, Floki uncovers the skeleton of a 
  a new boat. It s still in a rudimentary shape, its spars 
    naked. Even so, Ragnar is immediately entranced.

                                FLOKI
                  What do you think, Ragnar Lothrok?

                                RAGNAR
                  It s bigger! The hull s deeper.                                                                                  29.



                                FLOKI
                  Yes, but it will be lighter and 
                  faster than before, and carry a 
                  much bigger sail. The construction 
                is different. It s built with a 
                  strong central plank. The two 
                  strakes above it are nailed 
                  directly onto the knees of the 
                  frames. But the ones below - look! - 
                  are cleated and lashed onto the 
                  frames, not nailed, so they can 
                  move in relation to each other. 
                  This means the boat will not butt 
                  against the waves like a goat, but 
                  move over them like a ripple.

    Ragnar continues to study the boat.

    Meanwhile, Bjorn studies Floki s tools with all the 
    fascination they exert upon a young boy s mind. Planes, spoon-
    shaped bores, small axes and rivets. And then, almost with a 
    shock, he sees the small, strange figure hunched in the 
    shadows, wearing a conical hat and grinning. It s a wooden 
    statue of the god Loki and the grin is not pleasant, but 
    wicked and somehow disturbing.

    Bjorn moves quickly away.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why have you cut the oarports into 
                  the sheerstrake?

                                FLOKI
                  It makes it easier to row, and the 
                  ports can be closed when the boat 
                  is at sea. 

                                RAGNAR
                  You think this boat could handle 
                  long sea voyages?

                                FLOKI
                  That s why I built it.

                                RAGNAR
                  And it will be strong enough?

    Floki shrugs.

                                FLOKI
                  We won t know that until we try. 

    Ragnar looks at him.                                                                                  30.



                                RAGNAR
                  When will it be ready?

                                FLOKI
                  Ah, as to that...

                                RAGNAR
                  What?

                                FLOKI
                  We re out of money. We have to pay 
                  for the sail...and then the anchor. 
                  You know what those blacksmiths are 
                  like! Such greedy bastards.

  A beat. Ragnar reluctantly brings out a leather pouch.

                                RAGNAR
                  This is almost all I have left from 
                  last summer s raids.

  Floki takes the pouch, with a grin.

                                FLOKI
                  Don t worry, Ragnar Lothbrok. We ll 
                  soon be as rich as dwarves!

  And he laughs.


  INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING

  Great trestles have been set up and the freemen sit around 
  them, drinking and ready to feast. Music is playing. Earl 
    Haraldson, with his wife and family members, sits at high 
    table.

  There is much laughter in the hall. Then a horn is sounded - 
  for silence.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Before we feast, we have an 
                  important ceremony to perform. Two 
                  young men have joined us for the 
                  first time and must receive their 
                  arm-rings.  Olaf the son of Ingolf 
                  and Bjorn son of Ragnar Lothbrok. 
                  Both of you come up here.

    Bjorn and the other YOUNG MAN approach the high table. The 
    Earl walks round to the front of the dais...and draws his 
    sword.                                                                                  31.



                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Kneel.

  They both kneel. A housecarl slips two ornate bracelets of 
    twisted silver, the clasps fashioned as animal heads, onto 
  the blade. Earl Haraldson holds the blade close to the young 
    men s faces.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  These rings symbolize your coming 
                  of age - and they also bind you in 
                  loyalty to me, your chieftan. Any 
                  oath you swear upon your ring, you 
                  must honor and keep, or else lose 
                  your honor. Do you understand and 
                  do you swear so?

                                BOYS
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  And you freely recognize your 
                  fealty to me?

                                BOYS
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Then take your rings.

  The boys take their rings from the point of the sword and 
    clasp them around their arms. Ragnar looks on proudly. Then 
    sees that Haraldson is staring at him. 

  But the moment is lost as the freemen shout out their 
    approval, banging their fists on the tables as the boys 
    return, embarrassed but delighted, to their seats.

                                RAGNAR
                  Let me look! Ah - it s a fine ring. 
                  Never lose it, my son, or something 
                  dreadful will happen to you.

                                BJORN
                I won t father.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Now let s feast.

    Ragnar suddenly stands up.                                                                                  32.



                                RAGNAR
                My lord...we all want to feast: but 
                  we also want to know where we will 
                be raiding this summer.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Can t it wait?

                                ROLLO
                  No, tell us. We re anxious to know. 
                We have a right to know.

  A beat. The hall has fallen silent.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Very well. Then we shall go raiding 
                  to the east again, into the 
                  Eastlands, into Rus...

                                RAGNAR
                  Every year we do the same thing. We 
                  raid people who have nothing more 
                  than we have. We have a hard life, 
                  and they have a hard life - but we 
                  take from them even the few things 
                  which they have. But, lord, we have 
                  an alternative...a choice...another 
                  journey...

    There is a groundswell of noise...of some disagreement. The 
    Earl is alive to it.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Oh yes, I too have heard the 
                  rumors. I hear that if we sail 
                  west, across the open, fathomless 
                  ocean, we shall somehow come to 
                  lands far richer and more 
                  plentiful. Yes, I have heard those 
                  stories. But I tell you now that I 
                  will not risk my ships or my 
                  reputation on wild, speculative and 
                  unrealistic visions.
                        (beat)
                I pay for the ships. Therefore they 
                  go where I tell them to go, and 
                  that is the end of the matter.
                        (beat)
                  Now let s feast.

  He claps his hands...and the feast is brought in.

    Ragnar looks at Rollo, who shrugs.                                                                                  33.



  Then a HOUSECARL approaches their table. The housecarl has a 
  livid scar which runs from the corner of his mouth up his 
  cheek to his eye.

                                HOUSECARL
                  Ragnar Lothbrok, Earl Haraldson 
                  wants to speak with you in private.

    Ragnar nods, glances reassuringly at Bjorn, follows the 
    housecarl behind the dais, into a small chamber.


  INT. CHAMBER - EVENING

    Haraldson is flanked by several of his heavily-armed 
    HOUSECARLS. It s an intimidating atmosphere.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Ragnar Lothbrok...

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Are you hungry?

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  You want to feast in my hall? You 
                  want to sail in my ship? What else 
                  do you want of me?

                                RAGNAR
                  Lord, I -

    Haraldson slams his fist onto the table. The housecarls close 
    around him.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                I know you question my rule. I know 
                  you have big ideas. But you should 
                  keep them to yourself, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok. What are you? You re a 
                  farmer. Remember that. You re just 
                a lowly farmer. And you owe 
                  obedience and rent to me.
                        (beat)
                I warn you. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  34.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT'D)
                If you dare to stick your nose in 
                  my face, I will kill you.

  He stares at Ragnar.

                                                                          CUT TO:




    EXT. KATTEGAT - NIGHT

    Ragnar leads his sleepy son by the hand through the dark 
    settlement. Bjorn trips over something, yowls. Dogs bark.

                                BJORN
                  Where are we going now?

                                RAGNAR
                  Just to a place. Just to see 
                  someone.

                                BJORN
                  What place? To see who?
                        (beat)
                  I m so tired.

    Ragnar sees a lamp set outside a low door.

                                RAGNAR
                  Here it is. Wake up.

  He finds the door open, pushes his son inside, follows.


    INT. HOUSE/HUT - NIGHT

  A few low tallow candles, otherwise darkness. The shapes of 
    things.

  A long beat.

                                BJORN
                  I m frightened.

    Ragnar grasps his wrist. Then there s the sound of a voice, 
    ancient, unsexed.

                                VOICE
                  Why don t you come in? I m waiting.

    Ragnar encourages his son to push aside the curtained wall, 
  and go inside.                                                                                  35.



  The ANCIENT SEER is sitting in the dark. An old man or woman, 
    with withered dugs, sightless, white-eyed. Probably an old 
    woman, it s actually impossible to tell. But there s a 
    strange and powerful aura about the figure which makes Bjorn 
    instinctively recoil. Before her is a bowl of dried brown 
    shrivelled mushrooms. She reaches out gnarled fingers and 
  chews one.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  What do you want?

                                RAGNAR
                I want to know what the gods have 
                in store. 

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  For you - or for your son?

                                RAGNAR
                  I m more interested in myself.

  The ancient hag chuckles.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  The gods desire you to have a great 
                  future. I see that. But they can 
                  withdraw their goodwill at any 
                  time. 

                                RAGNAR
                  To have this great future, must I 
                  challenge the law?

    This seems to be the nub of it. There s a pause. The ancient 
  one reaches out and touches his face and her sightless eyes 
    peer into his.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  It is always possible for a man to 
                  shape his own fate. You must 
                  convince the gods to alter the 
                  runes, so they work in your favor. 
                  But the laws of men are  far below 
                  the workings and shapings of the 
                  gods.

                                RAGNAR
                  So I should take the law of men 
                  into my own hands?

    Silence.                                                                                  36.



                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  You won t answer me!

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  You already have your answer. 

                                RAGNAR
                No I don t. I don t have the real 
                  answer.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Then go and ask the gods 
                  themselves. What are you afraid of?

  Looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                        (quietly)
                  Who is not afraid of the gods?

  The old hag grins. Looks sightlessly at Bjorn.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                I say only this to you: beware of 
                  your sons.

                                RAGNAR
                  My sons? I have only one son.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                I see more.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why should I beware of them?

  The ancient stares at Ragnar again with her white, blind eyes 
  - and will not answer. Turns instead and stares, sightlessly, 
  at Bjorn, who is afraid of her, looks away.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Look at me, child.

    Bjorn steels himself to look back at her.

    After a few moments, she nods.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN (CONT D)
                I think your son is ready. Take him 
                  up to the temple. Let him also see 
                  the gods and, if he wishes, speak 
                  to them. That s all I can tell you.                                                                                  37.



                                RAGNAR
                  You haven t helped me at all, old 
                  woman.

  A long beat.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Perhaps you asked the wrong 
                  questions. In any case, sometimes 
                  you should not try to forsee your 
                  fate, for it is best not to know 
                  it.


    EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY

    Ragnar and Bjorn ride their small horses inland, up the side 
  of the mountain. It s a hard trek. The landscape is harsh and 
    dramatic with huge rock formations and boulders scattered 
    across it.

                                BJORN
                  This looks like a place where the 
                  giants might live.

    Ragnar smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  You know very well that the giants 
                  dwell in Utgard, in the outer 
                  place. And between Midgard, where 
                  we live, and Utgard there is a 
                  great sea.

                                BJORN
                  Not our sea?

                                RAGNAR
                A bigger sea than that. And the 
                  Midgard serpent encircles it and 
                  holds the sea in.

                                BJORN
                  Don t the giants ever come here, 
                  into our world?

                                RAGNAR
                  They try to. They are 
                    shapeshifters. They can appear 
                  disguised as anything. But the gods 
                  look after us. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  38.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                  They are forever watching out, in 
                  case the giants try to cross the 
                  sea and bring their chaos with 
                  them.

                                BJORN
                  And the dwarves help too?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, you can t always trust them of 
                  course - but they are a help to the 
                  gods sometimes. They bind Fenrir 
                  the wolf, so he can t escape and 
                  swallow the sun.

                                BJORN
                If Fennir is so big and strong, how 
                do they bind him...?

                                RAGNAR
                  With things you can t see or hear: 
                  like the breath of a fish; the 
                  sound a cat makes when it s 
                  walking, and the roots of a 
                  mountain.

    Bjorn nods, satisfied with the explanation. Takes it in. 

                                BJORN
                  I m hungry.

                                RAGNAR
                  Then we must catch something.


  EXT. RIVER - TWILIGHT

  They stand up to their knees in the cold flowing waters, both 
    with spears raised.

  They wait, and wait...and then both plunge their spears into 
  the water.

  Bjorn extracts a fish on the point of his spear, still 
    flapping. He grins.


  EXT. RAGNAR S FARM - DAY

    Lagertha is milking the goats in the milking shed. One of the 
    goat s is giving her trouble. She tries to coax it gently.

  Then Gyda comes rushing in, looking frightened.                                                                                  39.



                                GYDA
                  Mother.

  She glances over her shoulder. Lagertha understands that 
    something is wrong.

                                LAGERTHA
                      (to Gyda)
                  Stay here.

  She walks outside.


    EXT. YARD - HOUSE - DAY

  Two YOUNG MEN - just like the young men who rain riot through 
  the town, are standing arrogantly in the yard. They are 
    armed.

                                LAGERTHA
                 What do you want?

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  Where s your husband, woman?

                                LAGERTHA
                  He s at the Thing - where you 
                  should be. You re old enough.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Don t taunt us, woman. We know 
                  you re alone here. All the men are 
                  gone.

                                LAGERTHA
                  If you re thirsty I will give you a 
                  drink. If you re hungry I will feed 
                  you. Otherwise you must go.

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  We ll eat and drink after we ve 
                  satisfied our other needs. Let s go 
                  into your house.

  By way of a threat, he touches the axe head in his belt.

  A beat. Then Lagertha nods.

                                LAGERTHA
                  All right.
                        (looks over her shoulder)
                  Stay in the shed, Gyda. Do as I 
                  say.                                                                                  40.



  She leads the way into the house.


  INT. HOUSE - DAY

  The young men feel frisky, cocky. They laugh, nudge each 
    other.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Where s your softest bed?

  A beat.

                                LAGERTHA
                  In here.

  She leads them into the shield room. Springing forward, she 
    snatches a shield from the wall. 

    They take the axes from their belts.

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  We don t want to kill you, woman.

                                LAGERTHA
                  You couldn t kill me if you tried 
                  for a hundred years.

  She swoops into a secret place, and pulls out a sword. 

  Now she is a shield-maiden again. Her eyes have hardened. She 
  is changed.

  For the first time, the two young men are not so sure.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Before you try anything, think 
                  about your daughter.

                                LAGERTHA
                I am thinking about my daughter. 
                  Now you will leave my house or I 
                  will gut you like fish and cook 
                  your entrails.

  She attacks them with frightening speed. No sooner has the 
    first young man raised his axe than she has sheared off the 
    handle with her blade. She slashes at the second young man - 
    once, ripping his clothes open, and a second time slashing 
  the side of his face.

  He screams. His blood splashes on the floor.                                                                                  41.



    Lagertha fixes her attentions on the first, now unarmed young 
    man...who loses his nerve and bolts for it. His companion, 
    bleeding copiously, bolts after him.

    Lagertha takes a moment to compose herself - then hurries 
    outside.


  INT. SHED - DAY

  Gyda is hiding among the goats. Lagertha takes her into her 
  arms.

                                GYDA
                  Have they gone?

                                LAGERTHA
                  Yes, they ve gone.

                                GYDA
                  What did they want?

                                LAGERTHA
                  They were travellers. They were 
                  thirsty, that s all.
                        (beat)
                  Shall we go on milking the goats?


  EXT. PLAIN ABOVE KATTEGAT - DAY

  They ride up, through the thinning line of trees, to the edge 
  of the plain.

  And stop.

  A majestic but also strange sight greets them. In the 
    distance is the golden dome of the temple. It s surrounded on 
  three sides by a grove of trees which are remarkable, even at 
  this distance, because there are very few other trees on this 
  high plateau.

  But dotted around there are some large earth mounds, clearly 
    man-made; burial mounds, but now covered in grass. And also 
  huge piles of stones. Bjorn knows what they are and doesn t 
  have to ask.

  The whole vista is strange, haunting.

                                RAGNAR
                  There it is.                                                                                  42.




  EXT. TREES - DAY

  They ride towards the temple, between the trees. There s a 
    strange atmosphere here. Hidden bells chime very softly, 
    sweetly like a sighing wind.

                                RAGNAR
                  Keep to the path. The grove is 
                  sacred. Every nine years, here in 
                  the temple, the priests sacrifice 
                  nine of everything and hang them in 
                  the trees.

                                BJORN
                  Nine of everything? Nine sheep and 
                  nine hens?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes.

                                BJORN
                  And nine horses?

                                RAGNAR
                Of course. We love our horses.

  A beat.

                                BJORN
                  And nine of us? Nine humans?

    Ragnar looks back at his son, but doesn t answer.

  Now Bjorn becomes aware of waif-like creatures flitting 
    between the trees, dressed in pale colored robes.

                                BJORN (CONT D)
                  Father, who are they?

                                RAGNAR
                  Priests, I expect. Or other things. 
                  Who can tell in a place like this? 
                  Look, here s the  entrance.


    EXT. TEMPLE - DAY

    They dismount in front of two large wooden doors, studded 
    with iron.

  A PRIEST appears, bows, silently opens the doors. He is a 
    tall, thin, homosexual YOUNG MAN, dressed in a flowing robe                                                                                  43.



  And they step inside.


  INT. PAGAN TEMPLE - UPPSALLA - DAY

  The golden glow from the roof generates a strange, almost 
    unearthly light. There s a water-source somewhere...for the 
  sound of water running and splashing fills the great domed 
    space.

  The space is dominated by three huge wooden statues, several 
    metres high, made of highly polished wood. But the priest 
  first takes them over to the stone altar on which there is a 
    sacred Viking ring, a wooden bowl filled with blood and a 
  twig.

    Ragnar kneels by the altar and Bjorn follows his example. The 
    priest dips the twig into the blood of a sacrificed animal 
  and shakes it over them, sprinkling them with blood.

                                PRIEST
                        (sing-song)
                  Hail to the Aesir! Hail to the 
                  goddesses! Hail to the mighty, 
                  fecund earth. Wit and wisdom may 
                  you give us, and healing hands 
                  while we live!

  They move towards the statues, Ragnar once more sinking to 
  his knees and making his obeisance.

  Bjorn looks confused and over-awed. But the priest, with a 
    smile, gently guides him closer.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                My son, you have travelled a long 
                  way, but now at last you are face 
                to face with our gods.

  He draws Bjorn gently towards the first statue: of a massive, 
    muscle-bound, bearded, earthy-looking figure holding aloft 
  his mighty hammer.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  This is Thor. You know him, of 
                  course. You hear him in the 
                  thunder, when he races across the 
                  clouds with his goats. He protects 
                  all of us. And when he goes forth 
                  with his hammer, Mjollni, in his 
                  hand, he is irresistible.                                                                                  44.



  CLOSE ON: Thor s sculpted face, his exaggerated features, 
    peasant-like, wide-mouth, bulbous nose - rather comic-book.

  The priest draws Bjorn towards the second statue: a figure 
    with a disproportionately huge and erect phallus.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  You know who this is?

                                BJORN
                        (tentative)
                  Frey?

                                PRIEST
                Of course it s Frey. Who else could 
                it be? The god of sunshine and 
                  rain, of fertility, of children and 
                  crops. Of harvests. Of everything 
                  that grows new...but is cut down 
                  again each year. Then grows once 
                  more. 
                        (beat)
                  Come. 

  He draws Bjorn to the last figure. We have seen this figure 
    before: a tall, thin figure holding a spear, wearing a cloak 
  and a wide-brimmed hat, under which his single eye peeps out. 
  Even carved in wood, there is something magnetic but also 
    something sinister, even terrifying about the image.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  And this...

                                BJORN
                  ...is Odin.

                                PRIEST
                  Odin. god of war, of warriors slain 
                in battle. He lives in his great 
                  hall at Valhalla, with all the 
                  reborn warriors, feasting and 
                  drinking...

    Ragnar suddenly cuts in.

                                RAGNAR
                  Odin is not only the god of those 
                  slain in battle. He is many other 
                  things. He is our universal father. 
                He is the god of Skalds; he governs 
                  the mystic ecstacy, the great 
                  pathos, the passion of the soul.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  45.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                He is the god of thought..of 
                  curiosity. He wanted to look into 
                  the well of knowledge, guarded by 
                  the wise, decapitated Mimi. They 
                  told him he would have to lose an 
                  eye to gain knowledge...and gladly 
                he did it. You see there, Bjorn? He 
                  has but one eye. But with that 
                  single-eye he sees everything.

  A beat. He takes out two small coins, gives them to the 
    priest.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Thank you for your time, priest.

  The priest is clearly offended, and would like to say 
    something stinging - but manages to restrain himself. He 
    bows, walks out.

  A long beat. Bjorn is still staring up at the statue of Odin, 
  as if mesmerized.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                        (softly)
                  Bjorn...there s something you 
                  should know. Our family are direct 
                  descendants of Odin. Odin was once 
                a man. He fought and made a great 
                  name for himself, and when he died 
                  he became a god. But he was once a 
                  man, with a family and a home. And 
                  it is written in the runes that we 
                  are directly descended from his 
                  family.

                                BJORN
                  We are descended from gods? No 
                  father. How can it be?

                                RAGNAR
                  It is so. Which is why I believe I 
                  have inherited the god s curiosity. 
                  He loved knowledge. He wanted to 
                  find out about things. And so do I. 
                I want to find out what lies to the 
                  west of us...what cities and gods 
                  are over there. I m not satisfied 
                  with staying here, in this small 
                  country, where everyone has to 
                  scratch out a living, unless you re 
                  an earl. Odin gave his eye to 
                  acquire knowledge, but I would give 
                  far more.                                                                                   46.



  Bjorn stares up again at the giant statue of the one-eyed 
  god. 

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                Go outside and wait for me.

  Bjorn nods, and leaves Ragnar alone with his god.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                        (quietly)
                  Lord, O High One, I have sworn my 
                  life to you, and I have come to ask 
                  your advice. Is it not true that, 
                  in the beginning of everything, you 
                  led the revolt of the Aesir against 
                  the Vanir? Was it not you, Lord, 
                  who burned the body of the witch 
                  Gullveig three times? And did you 
                  not sit in your high seat in 
                  Valhalla sharpening your spear and 
                  polishing your shield? And when the 
                  gods moved against each other, was 
                  it not you who cast the first spear 
                  into the host of the Vanir?  
                        (beat)
                  So I have come to ask, have I your 
                  permission to rise in revolt 
                  against my earthly lord? Would you 
                  give me your blessing, if I cast 
                  the first spear? Lord, O High One, 
                  if you would forgive or encourage 
                  me, I ask only that you give me a 
                  sign.

    Odin stares back at him with his single eye.


                                                                          CUT TO:


    INT. RAGNAR HOUSE - DAY

    Ragnar and Lagertha sit on the bed.

                                LAGERTHA
                  How was it?

                                RAGNAR
                  Good. Earl Haraldson gave Bjorn his 
                  arm-ring. Then I took him up to the 
                  temple.                                                                                   47.



                                LAGERTHA
                So many things at once. My poor 
                  son.

                                RAGNAR
                He didn t complain. Then I took him 
                to see the new boat.

                                LAGERTHA
                  How is it?

                                RAGNAR
                We won t know until we sail in her, 
                  but she looks good.

  He reaches out, touches her cheek.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                I missed you. Did anything happen  
                  while we were away?

                                LAGERTHA
                  No.

                                RAGNAR
                  Did you miss me?

                                LAGERTHA
                I was too busy on the farm to miss 
                  you.

                                RAGNAR
                  Is that true?

  She smiles. 

                                LAGERTHA
                  No. I ached with love longing. My 
                  belly was empty of laughter.  

                                RAGNAR
                  How can I make you laugh now?

                                LAGERTHA
                I don t want to laugh now.

  She pushes him back on the bed, and gets astride him.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                I want to ride you, like a bull. 
                  Like a wild bull.                                                                                   48.



  She rocks back and forth, her eyes gleaming. Unclasps her 
  hair and leans down to kiss him, her hair falling all around 
  him.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  Now bull, now.

  He starts to make love to her.

  In the other room, by the smouldering fire, Bjorn can hear 
  them. His parents make love loudly, shouting, and the bed 
    shakes.

    Untroubled, he saunters outside.


  EXT. HOUSE - DAY

  We are struck, again, by the immense, almost overwhelming 
    beauty of this place. A beauty that seems almost unreal. 

  A small boat is approaching, cutting through the calm waters, 
    dwarfed by the distant mountains.

  It reaches the naroow shingle beach and Rollo climbs out, and 
    fastens it to a post.

                                BJORN
                  Hello Rollo.

    Rollo ruffles the boy s hair.

                                ROLLO
                  Hello, young Bjorn.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  Where are your parents?

    Bjorn is matter of fact.

                                BJORN
                  They re fucking.

    Rollo laughs.


    INT. HOUSE - EVENING

    Ragnar, Lagertha, Bjorn, Gyda and Rollo eat and drink. Rollo 
    drinks copiously. Looks at Gyda.                                                                                   49.



                                ROLLO
                  So, Gyda, tell me: is your mother 
                  teaching you how to use a shield?

                                GYDA
                  Yes. I know how to use a shield. I 
                  know what it s for.

                                ROLLO
                  Your mother was a famous shield-
                  maiden.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Not so much of the  was  please, 
                  Rollo.  Is  will do.

                                ROLLO
                  Is...a famous shield-maiden. We 
                  fought in the same shieldwall. 
                  Against the Eastlanders. She fought 
                  like a Valkyrie.

                                LAGERTHA
                I fought to protect my husband, my 
                  brothers and my father. They, too, 
                  were in the shieldwall. I would 
                  have died, willingly, for any of 
                  them.

    Ragnar looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  You nearly did.

    (It s something between them)

  She rises.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Come on children, to bed. We ll 
                  leave the men.

                                BJORN
                  I m a man. I have a ring.

                                LAGERTHA
                  To bed!

                                BJORN AND GYDA
                  Good night.

                                RAGNAR
                  Good night, my children.                                                                                  50.



    Kisses them.

  They go off. Ragnar pours more mead for them both.

                                ROLLO
                  Tell me your news: what about the 
                  boat?

                                RAGNAR
                  I ve seen it. It s a wonderful 
                  thing, Rollo. It s almost half-
                  finished.

                                ROLLO
                Do you trust Floki? Isn t he a 
                  great joker?

                                RAGNAR
                  He s a great boat builder. I trust 
                  him to do that.

                                ROLLO
                  And the sun board and the sunstone - 
                  you believe they can guide you 
                  across the sea?

                                RAGNAR
                I do.
                        (beat)
                  But I have to ask you this: when 
                  the boat is finished, will you sail 
                  west with me?

    There s a long beat. Rollo drinks, wipes his mouth. Stares at 
  him.

                                ROLLO
                  Only if we re all equal. I won t go 
                  under your command.

    Ragnar slips the ring from his arm. Holds it out to Rollo.

                                RAGNAR
                I swear on my sacred ring, I swear 
                  before Odin, that everyone in the 
                  boat will be equal, and will share 
                  equally what we find.
                        (beat)
                  Will you come?

  A beat. Then Rollo reaches out, and also takes hold of the 
  ring.                                                                                  51.



                                ROLLO
                I will come. I swear.

    Ragnar grins, embraces him.

  But Rollo is still staring at him.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  But we must find a crew. Not many 
                  men will go against the wishes of 
                  Earl Haraldson. Many of them will 
                  be afraid, and if we approach them 
                  some may even go to him and betray 
                  us.

                                RAGNAR
                  Leave that to me. I have a good 
                  idea where we will find our crew.

    Rollo looks at him quizzically, but doesn t question him.

                                ROLLO
                  You re very determined, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok. How do you know we ll be 
                  successful?

                                RAGNAR
                I don t know. But what I do know is 
                  that our fates are already decided. 
                  One way or another, we can t change 
                  them.

  A beat. Then Lagertha comes back in.

                                LAGERTHA
                  They re asleep.

  She sits down. Ragnar rises.

                                RAGNAR
                I must go and piss.

  He walks outside.

    Rollo pours Lagertha some mead.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Thank you.

  She smiles at him. He tries to hold her gaze.

                                ROLLO
                  I ve always wanted you. Always.                                                                                  52.



                                LAGERTHA
                  That s too bad.

  She smiles again, but he takes it like an insult - reaches 
  out and grabs her wrist. She spills her drink.

                                ROLLO
                  Don t insult me, shield-maiden.

    Looks at him.

                                LAGERTHA
                  No. I would never insult you. 
                  You re too great a warrior.

    Eyes tight on each other. Then he releases his grip.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  But not so great a man.


    EXT. HOUSE - EVENING

    Ragnar finishes his piss. The landscape is bathed in 
    moonlight, which gives everything a mysterious look. Ragnar s 
    gaze is somehow drawn across to the edge of the woods...as a 
    wolf emerges.

  The wolf walks down the meadow a little way, completely 
    unafraid. Then stops, and seems to look back at Ragnar for a 
  few long moments.

  And then it turns, moves away among the shadows.


    INT. HOUSE - EVENING

    Ragnar comes back in. Is immediately aware that something has 
    happened between Lagertha and Rollo - but chooses to ignore 
  it.

  He sits down again.

                                RAGNAR
                I saw a wolf in the meadow.

                                ROLLO
                  You must kill it.

    Ragnar looks at him.

                                RAGNAR
                  No. I mustn t kill it.                                                                                  53.



                                ROLLO
                  Why not?

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Because it wasn t a wolf.




    INT. BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

    Bjorn lies in his narrow bed, still awake.

  He can hear the adult conversations in the next room. His 
    hand still grips the arm-ring he s been given, for he will 
    never let it go.

    When he closes his eyes he sees the statue of Odin. Odin is 
    staring at him with his one eye. But the eye is alive. And 
  his gaze is terrible. It bores into you.


    EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY

  We are in the fjord. Clouds scud across the sky. The 
    mountains soar into the blue air, and fall into the water 
    below.

  The water is full of reflections - of the sky, of the 
    forests.

  A waterfall cascades down the side of a mountain, foaming 
    over the rocks, sending up a fine mist of spray.

    This is nature, raw and elemental.

  We hear Lagertha s voice.

                                LAGERTHA V.O.
                A pyre was built around the body of 
                  Balder and his wife Nana, dry 
                  faggots that needed nothing more 
                  than a spark to leap into their own 
                  life and consume the lifeless 
                  bodies that lay upon them, 
                  releasing their bodies to travel 
                  on.                                                                                  54.




  INT. RAGNAR S HOUSE - EVENING

    Lagertha recites the saga to her children, who listen, like 
    frozen things listening.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Balder s horse, meanwhile, was 
                  galloping along the foreshore and 
                  worked into a streaming sweat. Then 
                a servant plunged a short dagger 
                  into its throat. It gave a violent 
                  jerk and, without a sound, crumpled 
                  among the wrack..


  EXT. FJORD - DAY

    Ragnar is out fishing with his son, Bjorn, in the deep 
    soundless waters of the fjord.

                                RAGNAR V.O.
                  Now Odin strode through the 
                  shallows and gripped the gunwale. 
                  He climbed into the boat and stood 
                  over the body of his dead son. For 
                  some time he gazed at him...

    Ragnar gazes at the very alive, very animated face of his 
    son. Then he speaks aloud:

                                RAGNAR
                  Then Odin bent down and put his 
                  mouth to Balder s ear. Again he 
                  gazed at his son; then he left the 
                  boat.

    Ragnar looks over at the shore, and points out something to 
  his son.

    Someone has kindled a fire on the far shore.

                                LAGERTHA V.O.
                  At a sign from Odin a servant 
                  stepped forward with a lighted 
                  brand. He set fire to the pyre and 
                  at once a steady plume of smoke, 
                  twisting and spiralling, rose into 
                  the calm air.

  And as father and son stare at the sight on the far shore, 
    this is exactly what they see.                                                                                   55.


  A boat has been set on fire - and the smoke, twisting and 
    spiralling, rises into the calm air.


  INT. RAGNAR S HOUSE - EVENING

    Ragnar goes on with the nighttime saga, as the children hover 
    between wake and sleep.

                                RAGNAR
                  Thor raised his hammer. Slowly and 
                  solemnly he intoned the magic words 
                to hallow the cremation. Then a 
                  dwarf called Lit came running along 
                  the water s edge. He passed right 
                in front of Thor, and Thor was so 
                  enraged that he put out a foot and 
                  tripped him. The dwarf flew threw 
                  the air and landed right on the 
                  licking and curdling pyre. In this 
                  way, he was burned to death beside 
                  Balder.

  Bjorn bursts out laughing at the thought of the dwarf flying 
  into the fire. He laughs and laughs. And Ragnar smiles, and 
  even his daughter is tickled.


  EXT. FJORD - DAY

    Father and son watch the boat, now completely alight, drift 
    slowly across the water. It s a fantastic, compelling image, 
  the fire reflected in the water so it seems to spread out 
  right across the fjord.

                                RAGNAR V.O.
                  The boat drifted across the water. 
                  Sea winds caught at her and tugged 
                  her away. First she was more boat 
                  than flame, but soon more flame 
                  than boat. She was a quivering 
                  shape, a farewell on the horizon, 
                  moving on under a great cloud of 
                  her own making.

  And so it is.

  And the boat burns on.


    INT. RAGNAR S HOUSE - DAWN

  The first brightness in the night sky. A little rill of 
    light.                                                                                  56.



  The moon is still in the sky, pale and diminishing.

  The camera travels through the house and its sleeping 
    inhabitants. We see the colored shields, some weapons. The 
  ashes of a fire, a slaughtered beast upon a hook.

  The children asleep, like any other children. But Bjorn still 
    clasping his arm-ring in a deathless grip. The small statue 
  of Freya. A sleeping cat.

    Ragnar and Lagertha naked and asleep, coiled together.

  Then Ragnar opens his eyes.

  And the first thing he sees is a horrifying mask. And then he 
  hears laughter, and Floki rips off the mask as he stands over 
  their bed.

    Ragnar stares up at him, covering his cock.

                                FLOKI
                  It s ready.


  EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

  The finished boat. It is a thing of such indescribable beauty 
  and latent power that Ragnar strokes the burnished planks 
    with his hands and lays his cheek against it, and shivers.

    Freshly oiled and painted. Sinuous, sleek, graceful the hull 
    rising shapely, like the contours of a body, like an organic, 
    living thing.

  And the prow standing proud, with its ornately carved dragon-
  head.

  Floki stares intently at Ragnar, watching his reactions.

    Ragnar looks at him.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s...

    Floki puts a finger over his mouth.

                                FLOKI
                  No need to say. I see it in your 
                  eyes.
                        (beat)
                  Let s put her on the water.                                                                                  57.




  EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

    Floki, his assistant, Ragnar and Rollo pull and heave the 
    finished boat, over wooden rollers, the short distance to the 
    water.

  The boat glides into the water and the men climb in.

    Threading oars through the oarports they row the boat out 
  into the deeper waters of the fyord, where a strong breeze 
    ripples the surface and sends the clouds scudding across the 
  sky.

  Floki is like a man possessed, grunting and groaning, 
    sighing, swearing at, then encouraging the boat, listening 
    intently to its creakings, watching for its listing.

    Ragnar ships his oar.

                                RAGNAR
                  Now the sail, Floki, the sail!

                                FLOKI
                  She ll sink. Oh, what have I done?

                                RAGNAR
                No she won t. She won t sink.

                                FLOKI
                I shouldn t have pretended to build 
                  such a boat. It s beyond my humble 
                  capabilities. I m a fool.

  He looks as if he s about to cry.

                                RAGNAR
                  I ll set the sail.

    Ragnar unfurls the large black sail. It falls. The others 
    fasten the ropes. Nothing happens for a moment. The sail 
    flaps rather uselessly.

                                FLOKI
                  I m sorry, Ragnar. I ve wasted all 
                  your money. It was all a joke.

                                RAGNAR
                  Shut up, man.

  A beat.                                                                                  58.



                                ROLLO
                  Look!

  A breeze catches the sail and it swells out proudly. The boat 
    starts to move. As it moves faster, the motion stabilizes, 
    becomes less choppy. It glides on smoothly, still picking up 
    speed.

  And now, suddenly, they re flying! The boat, still sitting 
  low in the water, cuts through it so easily that the frame 
    doesn t shudder on impact with the waves. It seems to ride 
  over the waves.

  And, after a while, there s an eruption of joy inside the 
  boat, the men shouting, and hugging, and Floki going mad, 
    laughing, leaping about, hugging them, trailing his hands in 
  the water.

                                FLOKI
                  Ha! What did I tell you? Now it 
                  runs on its cool keel. It s 
                  beautiful. Why didn t you believe 
                  me?

    Then, as they speed on, they calm down. Sober up. Look at the 
    shoreline racing past.

    Ragnar doesn t say anything. He doesn t need to, his 
    expression says it all. He can see the future now. He is 
    sitting on the edge of his dream.


    EXT. CLIFFS - DAY

  A HORSEMAN sits astride his horse, at the edge of the cliffs - 
  and watches the black-sailed ship carving through the waves.

  We have seen him before. He has a livid scar that joins his 
    mouth to his eye. He is one of Earl Haraldson s housecarls.

  He stares as the boat flies on.
