      Late night.  Foggy.  The sounds of police SIRENS echo in the
      air as MacLeod and Richie stroll home, dressed in elegant
      formal evening wear.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm sorry, Mac, but I just don't get
                    opera.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It would help if you spoke Italian.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's not that.  It's just what's the
                    point?  What's opera got to say about
                    today?

                                      MACLEOD
                    The same thing it had to say a hundred
                    years ago.  The world's not that
                      different.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't know.  I think things are
                    getting worse.  Just turn on the
                    tube.

      A POLICE CAR goes by, its light flashing.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                          (re the police car)
                    Or take a walk.


      An old man, JASON LANDRY, stands in the shadows watching the
      barge.  His breathing is labored and ragged -- he looks wild-
      eyed, frightened and desperate.  Above him, MacLeod and Richie
      are coming down the stairs.

                                      RICHIE
                    Watching some fat guy sing for four
                    hours about his lost love is not
                    only irrelevant, it's just plain
                    lame.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      2.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

      They approach the gangplank to the barge.

      LANDRY

      lurches from the shadows.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    Please, I have to know!  Are you
                    Duncan MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm MacLeod.

                                      LANDRY
                    Thank God... I've come to warn you!
                          (leaning closer)
                    The time is at hand... the millennium
                    is upon us... HE is coming!

      MacLeod and Richie trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (humoring him)
                    I'm sure he is.  But it's late, and
                    I think you're a little confused...

      Landry grabs MacLeod's jacket with a surprising strength.

                                      LANDRY
                    Listen to me while there's still
                    time!  You must stop him, MacLeod...
                    you alone!
                          (beat)
                    God help you, you're the only one
                    who can.

      As MacLeod moves to disengage himself  -

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE EMBANKMENT

      a man in a tuxedo, a RED scarf around his neck, stands at
      the railing, not moving, gazing down at MacLeod -- JAMES
      HORTON.

      MacLeod stares, not believing his eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You!

      And we FLASH TO:


      Horton turns to face MacLeod.  He pulls a knife.

                          (pointing to his neck)
                    You have one chance.  Right here.

      Horton charges MacLeod, who with one quick move, buries the
      blade in Horton's gut.


      MacLeod shakes his head, thinking his eyes must be playing
      tricks -- but the vision is still there.

      HORTON

      smiles faintly.  He turns and steps back into darkness.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Horton.

      Mystified, Richie follows MacLeod's gaze to --

      RICHIE'S POV - THE EMBANKMENT

      empty.  Not a soul in sight.

                                      RICHIE
                    Who?

                                      MACLEOD
                    James Horton... he was right there!

      He starts for the stairs.  Landry tries desperately to hold
      onto him.

                                      LANDRY
                    No!  You don't know what you're
                    facing!

      But MacLeod pulls away, intent on this ghost from his past. 
      He hits the stairs at a run.  Landry grabs onto Richie.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    You have to stop!
                          (he calls after MacLeod)
                    He's here for you.


      MacLeod reaches the embankment to find...

      HORTON

      watching him.  He's not moving a muscle -- so still that
      it's eerie, unreal.  When his lips move, they're oddly slack. 
      It's as if he might be dead.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How?

                                      HORTON
                    The question you have to ask yourself
                    is...
                          (beat)
                    "... is he real?  Has Horton really
                    come back from the dead... or have I
                    gone insane?"

      His features twitch into a mocking smile.

                                      HORTON (CONT'D)
                    How many more times do you think
                    you'll have to kill me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just once.

      He pulls out the katana, but as he does...

      Horton is gone.  Then, as if coming from a great distance --
      a dry, mocking LAUGH, so faint that it might be imagined.

      MacLeod scans up and down the street in frustration as Richie
      catches up.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    He was here!

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, you killed Horton three years
                    ago.

      INTRUDER'S POV

      (NOTE: The POV will have our reddish tinge) as SOMETHING
      comes along the Quai towards Landry, moving over the ground
      with an eerily fluid SAWING MOTION, as if it could be FLYING. 
      As it draws closer to Landry...

      LANDRY

      feels the PRESENCE looming up behind him.  Filled with sudden
      dread, he turns to face it -- and SCREAMS.

      HANDS circle his neck, squeezing the life from him.

      We SEE THE IMPRESSIONS on Landry's skin made by the grip of
      UNSEEN FINGERS.  The invisible hands slowly BEND LANDRY BACK,
      forcing him to his knees.

      MACLEOD AND RICHIE

      race down the stairs.

      LANDRY

      amidst the swirling, red-hued fog, topples over, dead.

      An EMERGENCY LIGHT strobes over a stretcher as two AMBULANCE
      ATTENDANTS slide Landry's body into the back of their vehicle. 
      MacLeod and Richie stand by, watching somberly.

                    "The time is at hand..."?  He was
                    out of it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He was terrified.

                    He knew my name.

      The ATTENDANTS shut the doors and get into the vehicle.  It
      pulls away into the night.

                    Horton is dead.  It was dark, we had

                    I checked his wrists.  No tattoo.

      CLOSE - A GRAVESTONE

      and inscribed on its face -- JAMES HORTON -- 1947-1994.

      And below the stone -- an EMPTY GRAVE, fresh mounds of DIRT
      and CUT SOD piled beside it.

      MacLeod and Richie stand over the empty hole with an older,
      conservatively dressed CEMETERY OFFICIAL.

                    This was not done in my day.  A body
                    was meant to stay in one place, as
                    God intended.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know exactly how you feel.

                    Elvis and J.F.K., listening to Jerry
                    Garcia.  You think this is some huge

                    Like you said, he's family.  You'd

                    Good luck.  You're gonna need it.

      He turns in disgust and walks away.

      turns quickly to the BUZZ, his blade leading.

      FADE IN:


      An ornate older building, divided into private apartments
      with separate entrances.  The street is dark and quiet --
      it's the middle of the night.


      The wind moans in the trees.  Mysterious shadows turn the
      benign forest into a tangle of unnamed threats.

      MacLeod, wild-haired, dressed in furs over tattered tartan,
      moves through the woods, head down against the chill wind
      and rain.

                                      MACLEOD (V.O.)
                    It was 1625.  I'd been Immortal almost
                    three years, but I still didn't know
                    what I was, why I was still alive. 
                    I'd survived two hard winters with
                    no Clan, no family.  No one had taught
                    me about the Game, about what we
                    are.

      Stumbling, clearly suffering from cold and hunger, MacLeod
      spots a sheltered bit of rock up ahead.  He moves to it, and
      finds the entrance to a --


      MacLeod steps from the cave into the forest, still shaky and
      confused from the Quickening.  As he does, he feels an
      unwelcome sensation -- THE BUZZ.

      Still not knowing what it means, he puts a hand to his sword
      and looks up to see --

      MAN ON HORSEBACK

      in a GAP between two great trees.  The rising SUN behind him
      casts a blinding halo, obscuring his face -- but we can make
      out long hair, a Scots warrior's dress, the MACLEOD TARTAN.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am Duncan MacLeod of the Clan
                    MacLeod.

      THE RIDER

      stretches a HAND down to meet MacLeod.  MacLeod looks up at
      the powerful figure looming over him --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Connor!

      The two Immortals clasp hands.

                    What are we?

      Mid-scene.  Richie, Dawson and Methos walk and talk.

                                      METHOS
                    Millenium theory is nothing new, but
                    I'll tell you something.  I've seen
                    good years.  I've seen bad years. 
                    It doesn't have much to do with the
                    calendar.

                                      RICHIE
                    But you should see this guy's journal. 
                    It's pretty convincing stuff.

                                      METHOS
                    Most religions have some version of
                    the savior myth.  Demons come to
                    destroy the earth... Champions sent
                    to protect it.
                          (beat)
                    It's a comforting thought, but Richie,
                    I've lived five thousand years, I've
                    never seen a demon.

                                      RICHIE
                    Maybe you've got another explanation
                    for what's going on?

                                      DAWSON
                          (exasperated)

                    We'll talk to the granddaughter.

      Dawson shrugs, giving in.  They come around a corner and
      find --


      Gutted by fire.  STEAM and SMOKE hiss from the shattered
      windows as soot-faced POMPIERS drag hoses from the building.

      A POLICE CAR is parked on the curb, near a knot of NEIGHBORS
      and WITNESSES being questioned by a PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE.

                    You're sure this is the place?
                          (off Richie s nod)
                    Well, so much for good intentions. 
                    Anything that might have helped us
                    is toast.

      The Detective finishes with the Neighbors.  Seeing them, he
      steps over.  He takes out a notepad and a RED pen.

                                      DETECTIVE

      BEAT.  You could hear a pin drop.

                                      DAWSON
                    Nobody we know.

      The Detective nods and moves back to the firefighters by the
      door.

      Dawson looks grim.  Richie can see where his thoughts are
      headed.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not a chance.

                                      DAWSON
                    Richie, I know how you feel...

                                      RICHIE
                    Like hell you do!  MacLeod wasn't
                    involved in this... you know he
                    wasn't!

      At that moment a bagged BODY is carried from the building on
        a stretcher.  The Detective is walking with the STRETCHER

                                      RICHIE

      MACLEOD AND RICHIE

      as MacLeod reins in his reaction.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    That's impossible.

      Dawson and Methos exchange looks.

                                      RICHIE
                          (into phone)
                    It was him.  I think they headed
                    into the catacombs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do nothing.  Nothing.  Get back here
                    now.

                                      RICHIE
                          (beat)
                    Sorry, Mac.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie, you don't know what this is!
                    Stay right there, I'm coming after
                    you!

      He TOSSES the phone to Dawson as he grabs his sword.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie trailed it to the catacombs.
                    Talk to him.  Keep him there!

      He's already racing for the door.

      Dawson puts the phone to his ear.

                                      DAWSON
                    Richie?
                          (beat)
                    Richie!

      Methos looks at him questioningly.  Dawson lifts the phone
      so they can both hear it clearly -- a DIAL TONE.  No one
      there.
