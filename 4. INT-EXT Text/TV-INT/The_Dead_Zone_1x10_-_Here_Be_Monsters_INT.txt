          Bruce and Johnny in their classic driving pose; Bruce's
          eyes on the road, Johnny's staring out the side window.

          Music, circa the '70s'-'80s, plays on the speakers.  Bruce
          is trying to get into it, but it's just not working.

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, fifty mile mark.  Time
                        for my music. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        We listened to "The Outcasts" all
                        the way down to Boston, now you'll
                        have to suffer on the way back. 

                                        BRUCE
                        First of all, it's just "Outkast." 
                        No "the", no plural- 

                                        JOHNNY
                        And no more.  Please.   Pull out
                        one of my other Cds if you don't
                        like this one...

          Bruce reaches into a CD case glances at dated albums
            including AC/DC's "Highway to Hell"...

                                        BRUCE
                        Ancient history.  I'm trying to
                        bring you up to speed on the music
                        of today.

                        Bruce, you didn't know me before
                        the coma.  I was never "up to
                          speed"... was part of my charm.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, but you're so far behind
                        now it's like you're going in
                          reverse.  You gotta get with the
                        new, y'know?  With the now. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        The new, huh? 
                                (off Bruce's nod)
                        The now?

          Johnny reaches behind his seat and pulls out a series of
          X-RAYS of his SKULL, including a 3-D CAT-SCAN rendering
          of his head.  Bruce sees where he's going, and sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I present the latest
                          technology, utilized by the top
                        doctors at the most cutting edge
                        labs... this is not your father's
                          CAT-SCAN...

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, enough...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yet all the king's doctors, with
                        all the latest toys, still can't
                        find what's wrong with me.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's because there is nothing
                        wrong. 

          Bruce's tone signals that they've been through this before. 
          Silence hangs as Johnny rolls the sentiment around in his
          mind, trying to decide how to feel about it.  He smirks. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Besides my taste in music.

                                        BRUCE
                        Besides that.  I'm hungry.  You
                        hungry?



          EIGHT LOCALS are having lunch.  2 COUPLES at tables, 3
          OLD MEN at another, and a hefty man (BERT) at the counter. 

          All eyes go to Johnny and Bruce as they enter.  Johnny
          and Bruce hesitate a moment as some conversations pause
          briefly to consider the strangers.  They head for the
          counter, feeling eyes on them.  There's something
          unwelcoming about this town.

          Johnny and Bruce take seats, place orders with the waitress
          (LINDA) whose face we cannot see.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, hi ya doin'?
                                (no answer)
                        Uh, could I get a cup of chowder
                        and half a turkey sandwich? 

          The Waitress jots it down.  Johnny, distracted, looks up.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Cheeseburger and just a glass of
                        water, please... 

          His voice trails off as he turns to look over his shoulder.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, water for me too, please.

          Johnny meets the glances of the locals.  Most of them
          turn away from his look.  The old men don't. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - TEASER - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  4.

          Johnny turns back as the Waitress sets down two glasses
          of water.  As Johnny raises the glass to his lips, we
          RAMP INTO HIS FACE AS A VISION STRIKES --



          Johnny nearly chokes on his water as he swallows it. 
            Ashen-faced, he calls out to the departing Waitress.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me...

          She turns, and we recognize her as one of the screaming
          faces of the Mob.  Right now, her face is passive. 
          Johnny's voice almost cracks as he fights to maintain a
          polite smile.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can we get this to go?

          Bruce looks at Johnny, confused, as we...

                                (beat, considering
                                  Johnny)
                        Look, if you'll just have a seat,
                        I'm gonna bring in some of the
                          evidence in this case... who knows -
                        you might pick up some psychic
                          vibration or whatever you call

                                he say?)
                        Okay, sure.

          She leaves.  Bruce immediately turns to Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                        You want to tell me what's going
                        on?

          But Johnny looks at the mirror, moves over and touches it
          and as he does...


  10A10ATHE OBSERVATION ROOM

          Finding, in the observation room, SHERIFF JAMES DANFORTH,
          50s, tired eyes, forehead creased with worry lines... and
          we know Johnny knows he's in there and so he can't be
          open with Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (speaker)
                          Nothing.  You're right.  I should
                        help if I can.

          Danforth frowns... moves out to...



          Finding Simmons already sitting in front of a computer
          console... scrolling an internet story written by Dana
          Bright about the Dodd strangler case and Johnny Smith...
          Danforth moves behind her... looks over her shoulder...

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                        People here are scared out of
                        their skins, the last thing they
                        need to hear is we're soliciting
                          a psychic for "help" in our
                          investigation.  

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Jim, I don't believe he's got
                        mental powers!

          Danforth is confused.  Simmons pauses her scrolling...

                        Serial killer up in Maine.  This
                        Smith fellow led the Sheriff
                          straight to the suspect, a deputy
                        named Dodd.  But Dodd never
                        confessed.  Killed himself before
                        they could question him.

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                        Where are you going with this?

                        What are the chances this "psychic"
                        is in Hobbs Landing the day after
                        Mary Reed and her daughter are
                        killed?  What if he led the Bangor
                        Sheriff to arrest someone else to
                        cover his own tracks... then he
                        decides he's not finished and
                        shows up here to "help" us out...?

          Danforth places a gentle arm on her shoulder...

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                        I want you to stop, I want you to
                        get some rest.

          Simmons rises, headstrong.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        We have a crime scene with ritual
                        satanic elements.  Here's a guy
                        who claims to have supernatural
                        powers and he's been jumpy since
                        the first moment he saw me...  I
                        think we'd be foolish not to hear
                        what he's gonna say.

          Sheriff Danforth sighs, gives the okay.

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

          Nothing.  He turns the sneaker over.

                                (shaking clear)
                        This was used to cut down the
                          branches, they were shaped into a
                          pentagram... before the killing. 

          Danforth straightens in surprise in the observation room... 

          Simmons slides the DAGGER across the table.  The blade is
            S-curved, a wave of steel.  Dried blood caked on the tip.

          Johnny touches the hilt with a tentative finger.  Then
          two.  Starts to get a feeling... 

                                        JOHNNY

                        This was the murder weapon... but
                        in only one of the murders...

          The Deputy and Sheriff respectively react to his insight.
          Johnny's grip on the knife adjusts.  His fingers interlace,
          like we've seen him do in visions, except now they tighten
          over the hilt of the dagger.  Then he begins to whisper
          to himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Micama.  Goho Pe-iad.  Zodir come-
                        selahe azodien biabe os-lon-dohe...

          Holy shit.  Sheriff Danforth takes a step back.  Deputy
          Simmons' hand casually slips off the table to rest on her
          holster, thumb gently hooking under the snap.  Bruce's
          eyes narrow with concern...

          Johnny slowly raises the dagger above his head in a double
          grip, eyes shut tight.  Mouthing the language (Enochian).

                                        JOHNNY
                        Micama!  Yehusozod noari...

          Sheriff Danforth's jaw slacks open.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                          Baphomet!

          Johnny suddenly STABS DOWNWARD WITH THE DAGGER.

          As they SNAP OPEN and his face is SPECKLED with blood, he
          gasps:

                        No!  Susan!    

          Johnny JOLTS back from the table, hands recoil to his
          face, to wipe away the blood that, of course, is not there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My god.  Oh my god.

          Bruce moves to Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                        That's enough.  John, it's okay,
                        you're okay...

          The Deputy has stepped up and out of her chair, hand still
          on her sidearm (still in its holster).  The DAGGER sticks
          straight up from the table, vibrations from the impact
          ebbing away. 

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS

                        All I can tell you... it was a
                        sacrifice.  A ritual sacrifice.

          Off Johnny, rubbing the skin over his eye...



          Danforth has seen enough.  He exits with a purpose...

          DOUG MARTIN, 45, dressed in a simple blue dress shirt and

          He hangs up... Deputy Simmons steps forward and presses
          her finger onto the phone hook as Johnny starts to dial
          another number.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        One phone call. 

          Johnny looks at Bruce, who is running his hands through
          his dreads, trying to squeeze the stress out.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mind working, to
                                  Bruce)
                        Call Purdy.  But call him from
                        out of town.

          The deputy takes him toward the cellblock...

                                        BRUCE
                        No way, I'm leaving you here.  

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calling back, re-
                                  emphasizing)
                        I mean it, Bruce.  Out of town! 

          Johnny's gone.  Bruce studies him, knows Johnny's warning
          him... but how can he abandon his friend... turning to
          Danforth...

                        This is crazy.  We were in Boston
                        all weekend.  Johnny was seeing
                        doctors about his brain...
                                (realizing how that
                                  sounds)
                          ...which is fine, his brain I
                        mean... but we just drove into
                        town today!

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                        I'll need the keys to your Cruiser. 
                        We'll be impounding it during the
                          investigation.

          Bruce shakes his head, hands Danforth the keys.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're making a big mistake.

                        You'll be making one if you try
                        to leave.

                          There'll be a hearing in a few
                        hours.  If I were you, I'd stick
                        around to testify for your friend.

          Martin nods to the Sheriff and exits through the front
          door.  The Sheriff walks into the bullpen.  Bruce is left
          alone.

          Panning to find someone else eating a grilled cheese
            sandwich, looking outside at Bruce.  It's a man in a RED

          bloody Bruce vision.

                        Smith.  People who live here are

                        I'd say 'I'll prove it to you'
                        but I'd rather not.

          Off Gabe's reaction...



          JUDGE DONALD WILSON, 60's, a grandfatherly face, listens
          curiously, struggles to place the ordinance, he prides
          himself on knowing most of them.  LOCALS have filled the
          only seats available in the back.  Tom Reed is among them. 
          Bruce sits behind Johnny.

                                        MARTIN
                        ...The practicing of Witchcraft. 
                        We request that he be held pending
                        trial.  

          A confused murmur ripples through the crowd.  Judge Wilson
          adjusts his hearing aid, leans forward. 

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Excuse me, Doug.  I missed that,
                        thought you said witchcraft.  

          Gabe quickly stands.

                                        GABE
                        Your Honor, the defense moves to
                        dismiss this charge as
                          preposterous.  The prosecution of
                        witchcraft as a criminal charge
                        was dismissed over two hundred
                        years ago...

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Counsel approach the bench.  Both
                        of you.  Now.   

          ON Martin, Gabe, Judge Wilson.  Their rapport is familiar.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Boys, I was hoping to go fishing
                        today. 

                                        GABE
                        The Sheriff and Prosecutor have
                        clearly trumped up a bogus charge
                        to unlawfully detain this man. 
                        It's a violation of his civil
                          rights...
                                (right to Martin)
                        And frankly I think it mocks this
                        court.

          Wilson looks at Doug Martin, who remains very calm.

                        I won't lie.  The accused is the
                        leading suspect in the Reed
                          murders, and the Sheriff needs
                        time to gather evidence.  But the
                        outcome of this hearing will be
                          evidence in its own right.

          Judge Wilson wrinkles his nose, confused.  So is Gabe.

                                        MARTIN
                        The Reed Murders involve elements
                        of Satanism.  A conviction on
                        witchcraft will be a key element
                        in the prosecution of that case. 
                                (turns to Gabe)
                        And the charge is not bogus,
                        because I intend to prove it.

          Judge Wilson thinks about it.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        I'm willing to see where this
                        goes, but if I don't like it,
                        we're all going home.

          They break.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          As Martin reads from it...  

                                        MARTIN
                        Local ordinance number 65 defines
                        witchcraft as "the practice of
                        and belief in supernatural
                        abilities, including the divination
                        of future and past events, the
                          sickening or corrupting of others
                        through incantations, spells or
                        motions of the hand or eye.  A
                          communion with the Devil."

          He then walks a handful of PRINT-OUTS up to Judge Wilson.

          Dana edges through the doors, eyeing the packed room, and
          feeling the looks of xenophobic locals.

          She spots Bruce on the stand...

                        So you admit to being a witness
                        to Mr. Smith's... powers.  Would
                        you say it's accurate to say he

                        I don't think he 'divined'
                          anything.

                          non-scientific explanations can

                        Called you?  Where's he?

                                        DANA
                                (not trying to sell
                                it)
                          Something urgent came up.  Truth
                        is he's home, making sure his
                        hands don't get dirty.
                                (dry)
                        He asked me to keep him well
                          informed and to express his deep
                        concern for your well being.

                        Great.  We call for the cavalry
                        and he sends a press release.

                        They can't seriously expect this
                        witchcraft charge to hold up in
                          court...

                        It doesn't have to hold up in
                        court.  People hear what the
                          prosecution is saying... they
                        know Satanism was involved in the

                        There was a doll of a man found
                        at the murder site... when I
                        touched it I got a vision of the

          Johnny nods to Bruce, I need you to do this.  This goes
          against every grain in his body... but he takes the keys...

                        I need to convince the people of
                        this town that they don't have to
                        be afraid of me... I want them to

                        Mr. Smith, I have the report from
                        your interview with Deputy Nancy
                          Simmons.  Says here that by
                          touching key pieces of evidence,
                        you were able to "see" the crime
                        scene in great detail.

          Johnny's eyes sweep the crowd, lock onto Deputy Simmons,
          who holds his look, unrepentant.

                        At one point, you held a ritual
                        dagger, the kind used in Satanic
                        ritual, and began to speak words
                        in a "strange language."

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Perhaps you should fast forward
                        to your point, Doug. 

                                        MARTIN
                                (advancing on Johnny)
                        My point, your Honor, is simple:
                        either Mr. Smith possesses
                        attributes which match the
                        definition of witchcraft in
                          ordinance sixty-five -
                          "supernatural abilities including
                        the divination of future and past
                          events", or he lied to the
                          investigators, and was present at
                        the scene of the murders. 

          It's as if an electric current was sent through the
            assembly.  Judge Wilson has to BANG his gavel hard...



          Martin has crossed back to his desk and holds aloft a
          HAIR CLIP like it's the fucking sword in the stone.

                                        MARTIN
                        Your honor, this is a piece of
                          evidence recovered from the crime
                        scene.  A hair clip belonging to
                        Cathy Reed, which was not touched
                        by Mr. Smith during his interview.
                                (to Johnny)
                        I'd like you to touch it now.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT THREE - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  40.

                                        GABE
                        I'm not going to allow my client
                        to...

                                        MARTIN
                        I'm giving him the chance, in the
                        eyes of this court, to demonstrate
                        his abilities are what he claims
                        them to be.  Otherwise, we have
                        no choice but to believe that he
                        is a murderer.

          Gabe leans as far over his desk as he's allowed.

                                        GABE
                                (to Johnny)
                        You don't have to do this... 

          Johnny looks at Gabe, Martin, the Crowd.  It's the witch's
          dilemma: if you float, they hang you.  If you drown, you're
            innocent. 

          The room falls silent as Johnny reaches out and takes the
          hair clip from Martin, who makes a show of stepping back.

          Johnny looks down at the hair clip (note: it has a pearl
          imbedded in it) and suddenly the CAMERA begins to SWAY
          into a CANTED ANGLE.  He looks up to see...



          Cathy Reed, sitting at an undersized table in an undersized
          booth, her eyes unfocused, HAUNTED.  Slowly, the room
          begins to SLIGHTLY TILT the other way.  We hear the echoing
          moan of wood STRETCHING.

          Half the LOCALS in the room stand straight up in their
          seats, and order is lost as SHOUTING ERUPTS.  Martin steps,
          vindicated, impressed with himself.  Gabe slowly sits
          back down.  Judge Wilson BANGS his gavel OVER and OVER
          and OVER.  And the waitress, LINDA, eyes are watering as
          she stands up and blurts out, almost choking on a sob --

                        Just tell us what you've done
                        with her, you freak!

          Bang!  Judge Wilson doesn't lose a second.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Clear the court!  Bailiff, see
                          everyone out!

          The assembly GROANS its disapproval.  Overlapping cries
          of "come on!"/"I didn't say anything!"/"Not fair..."

          George the Bailiff tries to herd people out, Deputy Simmons
          assists.  Dana forces her way against the throng toward
          Johnny, who gets up from the stand, passing Gabe.  His
          eyes connect a beat with Tom Reed as Reed leaves the
            courtroom...

          Urgent: Johnny hurries to the railing where Dana moves to
          him...

                        A boat.  She's on a boat.

          She acknowledges as she moves outside.  As Johnny stands
          before them, stunned by his own revelation, and the town's
          reaction to it, we...

          FADE IN:


          Crowded with town-folk who were chased away by the Sheriff
          earlier, including Eddie Wolcott, Bert and others.  Linda
          bursts in, all heads turn...

          them like a wave.  Eddie and Bert exchange a look...

                        ...And while Mr. Smith possesses
                        an uncanny knowledge of recent
                        events in this town, he has not
                          appeared to use these powers for
                          personal gain or to harm others,
                        so therefore he's broken no
                          enforceable law...

          The court doors BURST OPEN, and the MOB swarms in, heading
          for Johnny.

          No cries of hatred, no roar of madness.  Just the horrible
            shuffling of fifty plus feet on hardwood.

                                        JUDGE WILSON
                        Get out of here... all of you...
                          Bailiff!

          But the bailiff is overwhelmed... Gabe stands up...

                        Eddie, Linda... stop this now...
                        this isn't the way you do things...
                        not in our town...  

          Johnny waits for them to swarm past Gabe and over to him. 
          Hands grabbing, mess of arms, blacking out the FRAME.


          Man in Red sits in, closes the door, listening to his
          cell.  Cronies in the back - some bruised.  

                                        EXCITED VOICE (PHONE)
                        We got the guy.  We took him! 
                        We're bringing him out to the
                        crime scene, he's gonna confess! 
                        You better get over here... 

          Man in Red puts it in gear...



          Danforth is on the CB, angry because he's not getting any
            response.  Dana is in the back seat with Cathy.

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                          Nancy... Deputy Simmons... dammit,
                        pick up... answer me! 

          Dana looks at the CB, worried.
