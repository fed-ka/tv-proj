Jane with a COFFEE, passes SOME FLYERS.  One reads:  LOOKING *
FOR A ROOMMATE?  COME HAVE FUN WITH ME!  On it is a picture *
of ALEX (IN A TANK TOP) BOUNCING ON A TRAMPOLINE.  A CREEPY 
GUY rips off one slips.  As Jane rips the flyer off...*


Brad and Max sit at a table.  Brad s eating a hot dog.

BRAD
Is Dave still meeting us?

MAX
I dunno, I haven t seen him since he 
went to have the conversation with 
Andrea.  Two days ago.

Just then Andrea and Dave PULL UP IN HER CAR.  Dave (in a 
fedora) gets out, but Andrea pulls him in for a LONG KISS.  
Max and Brad watch in awkward silence.  Brad whispers:

BRAD
I finished my hot dog.  Should I get 
another one or wait it out?  

ANDREA
(as they break)
Bye moo-moo!

DAVE
Bye doodle bug!

She drives off.  Dave turns to the group, SHOCKED-FACED.*

BRAD*
What happened, moo-moo? 

DAVE
Oh, not much.  Just went to have the *
conversation.

DAVE (CONT'D)
But before I could say anything, she *
launched into a whole thing about *
how great it was to finally meet a *
good guy, and that her last *
boyfriend stole money from her dad *
and had sex with her cousin.  I *
couldn t do it.  *

MAX
I think you re missing the point: 
she has a rich dad and slutty 
cousins.  

BRAD
We told you, dude, the 
conversation s hard. 

DAVE
I know!  I ve been out of the game *
too long guys.  How do I get outta *
this thing?   *

BRAD*
First off, stop calling it  the *
game. *

MAX
Here s what you gotta go with... the *
Peter-Out.

BRAD
Oooh, looove the Peter-Out.  

MAX
First, stop calling her every day, 
change plans at the last second, and 
never go out on a weekend night. 

BRAD
And in a few weeks things ll just... *
peter out.  No conversation. *

MAX
When are you seeing her again?

DAVE
Saturday night.

MAX
Perfect.  Text her right now and 
switch it to Wednesday.  The most 
non-sexual night of the week.Happy Endings  "The Quicksand Girlfriend" [104]      14.

Andrea waits on the street.  Dave runs up.

DAVE
Sorry I m so late.  I don t own a 
watch.  What is time anyway, but a 
man-made shackle? 

ANDREA
That is almost literally my high 
school yearbook quote, verbatim.  I *
hate rushing everywhere.  Soulmates!*


Dave and Andrea exit under a marquee that reads: NATURE S 
SERIAL KILLERS: US?  Andrea is clearly moved.  Happy Endings  "The Quicksand Girlfriend" [104]      17.

ANDREA
Oh my God.  When the mother elephant 
got dragged off by those poachers I *
just got so, so... *

DAVE
Horny?  Would it be crazy for us to 
go back to the car and have sex? 

ANDREA
Yes.  The car s like ten blocks 
away.  Let s just go to the handicap *
stall in the theater bathroom.

DAVE
What?!

ANDREA
When I get emotional, I get so 
sexual.  And if that movie taught us *
anything it s that we are all 
animals.

DAVE
(confused)*
I did not get that at all.  *

She drags a BEWILDERED Dave back inside the theater.


As Andrea exits, she turns and smiles at Dave.*

ANDREA
You are the best guy ev--*

Just then, Andrea is HIT BY A BIKE MESSENGER!*
