                                        ACT ONE

  INT. GRAY S PUB - DAY (DAY ONE)11

  JULES, ELLIE, LAURIE, GRAYSON, BOBBY and ANDY have drinks.

                              BOBBY
                    I got this song stuck in my head.  
                    You know, the one from Titanic?

                    Gay trap!  You re gay. 

                              JULES
                    That s ridiculous, Andy s not gay 
                    because he likes Titanic.  Everybody 
                    likes Titanic.  Remember when Jack 
                    asks Rose where she wants to go...

                              BOBBY
                    To the stars.  

                              JULES
                    Super gay trap!  You re gay.

  Everyone laughs as Jules gives high-fives all around.

                              JULES (CONT D)
                    See, who says guys and gals can t be 
                    friends?  Look at us.  Just hanging. 
                      (nudging Laurie, cockney)

                                LAURIE
                    No clue what you re talking about.

                              JULES
                    That guy with the bowler hat?  Come 
                    on!  What s the point of inside jokes 
                    if you re not going to remember them? 

                              GRAYSON
                    You know who says girls and guys 
                    can t be friends?  Everyone.  It s a 
                    fact.  As shown in When Harry Met 
                    Sally.  Nora Ephron s best work.

                              JULES 
                    That s crazy.  You re saying any 
                    woman you re even a little nice to 
                    you want to sleep with?

                              GRAYSON
                    At least once.  Look, no guy ever 
                    woke up and thought:  You know, I 
                    wish I had a real cool chick to hang 
                    out and do friend stuff with.

                              BOBBY 
                    What would I even do with a lady-
                    friend?  I guess I could sleep with 
                    them.   Wait, that s the thing you 
                    can t do.  I got nothing.  Go carts?

                              ANDY
                    When I was single, I never hung out 
                    with a woman that I wasn t interested 
                    in dating.

                              ELLIE
                    Including his mom.  And even there, 
                    the smell of empanadas and acrylic 
                    nails still makes him horn out.

                              JULES
                    Look, there are a lot of men who 
                    aren t just walking scrotums, and 
                    they have actual female friends.  
                    Laurie s got a ton of guy friends.

                                LAURIE
                    Totally.  We go to movies and 
                    concerts.  Just as friends.  

                              GRAYSON
                    Have you ever slept with any of them?

                                LAURIE
                    Yeah.  All of them.  But just as 
                    friends.  Nothing romantic.

                              ELLIE
                    Sorry Jules, but Tiny Eyes is right.

                              GRAYSON
                    I have tiny eyes?

                              ELLIE
                    Andy and I met because we were in the 
                    same circle of friends.  I slept all 
                    the way around it until I got to him.

                              ANDY
                    Wait, even Victor?!

                              GRAYSON
                    There are exceptions to the no friend 
                    rule.  Like if the guy s gay, or he s 
                    friends with your friend s husband.

                              ANDY
                    Like Victor?!

                              ELLIE
                    Give me a break.  He had a Saab.

                              JULES
                    You re all crazy.  I saw a news story 
                    last night about a bear and a cat 
                    that were best friends.  If they can 
                    be friends, so can men and women.

                              GRAYSON
                    They followed up that story this 
                    morning.  The bear killed the cat.

                              JULES
                    But they didn t have sex.  I mean, 
                    the bear tried but he couldn t.  
                    That s probably why he got so angry.  
                    But people aren t bears.  Point to 
                    Jules.  High five!

  She raises her hand.  No one hits it.  Finally, Bobby does.

                              BOBBY
                    You can t leave a high five hanging.

                    Morning, Andy.

                    Naw, I m just in a funk.  I m either 
                    at work all day, or up all night with 
                    Stan.  I feel like it s all I do.

                    I hear that.  I work a butt-load, and 
                    by the time I go home and catch up on 
                    Facebook and Twitter I barely have

                    That was once, and nobody cares that 
                    much about flax seeds.

                    giving up control, so she fights it.

  Jules watches Laurie ride a motorcycle as a gleeful Andy 
  clings to her back.  As they pass, screaming like a woman:

                    With all the shrieking, I thought a

                    Nope.  Just Andy pallin  around with 
                    Laurie.  Of course they re probably 
                    just ramping up to an all day bang-

                    You basically said we re not friends. 

                              GRAYSON
                    No.  I merely said men and women 
                    can t be friends without there being 
                    a sexual undercurrent.

                    Look, we re attracted to each other, 
                    we re flirty-- that s our dynamic.  
                    But we don t act on it because 
                    there s only two ways it can end.  
                    Either we get married, which we don t 
                    want.  Or we try it, it goes south 
                    and we re stuck living across the 
                    street from someone we feel awkward 
                    around and the friendship is over.

                              JULES
                    It s so lame men think like that.

                              GRAYSON
                    Not just men; women choose to be 
                    friends with guys they re attracted 
                    to, too.  That s why we re friends.

                              JULES
                    No, we re friends because we have a 
                    lot in common.  We re both divorced, 
                    single, we re neighbors.

                    You and Tom have a lot in common.  
                    Why aren t you friends with him?

  They look over at an frumpy man (TOM) watering his lawn. 

                              TOM
                    Hey, Jules.  Want me to water your 
                    tulips?

                              JULES
                    I m good, Tom.

  Laurie and Andy pull up.  He dismounts the motorcycle.

                    care if he has a giant life insurance 
                    policy.  I love that little man. 

                              JULES
                    Why didn t you just say that to him?

                    When you re angry and your spouse 
                    does something idiotic, you don t 
                    reward them with nice thoughts.

                              JULES
                    That is so wrong.  You should be open 
                    and honest with your spouse.

                              ELLIE
                    Oh, like you were open with Bobby? 
                    How d that all work out for you?

                    I haven t seen you drag your feet 
                    like this since I tried to bring you 
                    home from Math Camp.  Don t worry, 
                    I m sure this trip won t be that bad.

                                TRAVIS
                    Sure, what s so bad about putting 
                    your arm in a giant fish?  Plus, they 
                    make great prosthetic arms now.

                              BOBBY
                    They re better than real arms.  I

  Travis and Bobby are waist deep in the lake.

                                TRAVIS
                    This isn t so bad.  The lake is 
                    pretty, the water s warm... one 
                      question-- why are we wearing jeans?

                              BOBBY
                    A normal bathing suit isn t gonna cut 
                    it.  We re in the wild.  I can t tell 
                    you how many times denim has saved my 
                    hang-low from a rusty can or a pokey 
                    tree root.  Safety first, son.     

                                TRAVIS
                    Right.  So, noodling.  What do I do?

                    Well, you want to find a good hole, 
                    reach in and wait for a bite.

                                TRAVIS
                    Define  good hole.

                              BOBBY
                    It s a hole with a catfish in it-- 
                    der.  Of course, in some holes you ll 
                    find snapping turtles or water snakes 
                    or, you know, maybe something cool.  
                    I found a revolver once.  

                                TRAVIS
                    I think I get the general concept of 
                    a fish eating my arm, but what s the 
                    skill or sportsmanship in it?

                              BOBBY
                    There isn t any.

                    Dad, I m trying here, but I have to 
                    ask-- why would anyone do this?

  Bobby is neck-deep in the water, feeling around under him.    

                              BOBBY

                    Hi, Mark... I know this is an odd 
                      question... but we were always just 
                    friends, right?  You were never 
                    looking for anything romantic. 
                      (listens, then, annoyed)
                    Oh, come on, Mark!  You were my 
                      chiropractor!  Ugh, I knew there was 
                    no such thing as a butt alignment.

                    reason she doesn t want you to have 
                    the bike is because she loves you so 
                    much.  The thought of something

                    It s just so depressing to me that 
                    men and women can t be real friends.  
                    This is like finding out that twelve 
                    hour mascara only lasts three hours.

                    just play the friend card because 
                    it s so hard to impress women.

  Jules, Grayson and Laurie talk in the kitchen.

                              JULES
                    What did I do?  Andy s never bailed 
                    like that on Ellie.  He usually just 
                    stands there, breathing through his 
                    nose harder and harder until he 
                    sounds like a little Cuban teapot...  
                      (realizing)
                    Which would be an amazing children s 
                    book.  Dibs.

                                LAURIE
                      I remember when my dad walked out on 
                    my mom.  She was devastated.  A week 
                    later, when she realized he had taken 
                    me and my sister with him to Mexico, 
                    she felt even worse.  That turned out 
                    to be the best family vacation ever.

                              GRAYSON
                    You have a gift for distorting 
                    reality.

                              JULES
                    Why couldn t I have just minded my 
                    own business?  You know what, we have 
                    to fix Andy and Ellie right now.

                              GRAYSON
                    That contradiction was so fast I 
                    think it broke the sound barrier. 

                              JULES
                    This is serious.  Andy and Ellie were 
                    fighting like Bobby and I did right 
                    before we got divorced.  Well, except 
                    Andy wasn t wearing a golf club cover 
                    over his privates.  And Ellie didn t 
                    have a truck stop waitress by the 
                    hair.  And it wasn t in a public 
                    bathroom in the Tampa airport.  But 
                      everything else was the same.

                              GRAYSON
                    My wife and I never fought, and she 
                    left me anyway.  Marriage is fragile.  
                    I m surprised Ellie and Andy even 
                    lasted this long.   Cougar Town     "Counting On You"  [117]               23.

                    Whatever.  Are those pumpkin muffins?

                              JULES
                    This is serious.  I need you and Andy 
                    to work so I know that a successful 
                    marriage is actually possible.  So I 
                    know it s not foolish to believe that 
                    one day I can have what you have.

                              ELLIE
                    First off -- lame!  Second, what s 
                    with all the doom and gloom?  Andy 
                    and I are fine.

                    Somebody say my name?  Ooh, muffins!

                              GRAYSON 
                    Wait.  You two made up?

                              ELLIE
                    Of course not.  But we ll get over 
                    it.  Even if he s a mule-headed dope.

                              ANDY
                    I love my smothering witch.

                              ELLIE
                    Oh, boy.  I see what s going on.  
                      (to Andy)
                    These two got freaked out by our 
                    fight because they have no idea what 
                    it s like to be in a solid, working 
                      relationship.

                              JULES
                    Hey, excuse me?  I was married for 
                    over fifteen years.

                              ELLIE
                    Yeah, to a serial adulterer.

                              ANDY
                    With a heart of gold.  

                              GRAYSON
                    She may be right.  My marriage can 
                    best be described as a crap sandwich 
                    with a side of depression salad and 
                    wow -- worst metaphor ever.  Cougar Town     "Counting On You"  [117]               27.

                    Look, Ellie and I have had way worse 
                    fights than this one.  But no matter 
                    how bad it gets I know she s not just 
                    going to pack up, and leave me like 
                    some pathetic beady-eyed dog.

                    For the last time, my eyes are normal 
                    size.  My head is just slightly big.

                    When you re in a good relationship 
                    you don t sweat the bumps in the 
                    road.  It s like you have a built-in 
                    safety net because you love each 
                    other so much you know you re never 
                    going anywhere.  It also helps if you 
                    have a strong desire to prove your 
                    parents wrong.  

                              JULES
                    I m happy to hear you say that.  And

                    hope that one day I find someone who

                    Two.  But that one hit a duck.  I 
                    should feel bad about that, but I 
                    don t.  It was a stupid looking duck.

                              BOBBY
                    Trav, I m sorry about earlier.  I

                    The thing is, I was hoping you d just

                    That I have more in common with Mom?

                    That s a given, what with your fair

                                TRAVIS

                    own choices.  And that just kind of 
                    weirded me out. 

                                TRAVIS
                    Good weird, right?

                              BOBBY
                    Yep.  Even though it makes me feel 
                    old, it makes me feel proud, too.  

  A nice moment.  Just then, we hear a DUCK S QUACK.  

                                TRAVIS
                    Want me to take him out?

  Bobby nods.  Travis wings a rock.  Smack!  The quacks stop.

                    That was a thing of beauty, son.
