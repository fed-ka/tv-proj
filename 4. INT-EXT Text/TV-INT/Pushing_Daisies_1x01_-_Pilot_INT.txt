      The dead fly lands on the counter top.  Young Ned's MOTHER
      sets the fly swatter down and returns to lovingly preparing
      a pie, pressing dough into the pie plate.

                                      NARRATOR
              It was a gift given to him, but not by
                anyone in particular.  There was no
                box, no instructions, no manufacturer's
                warranty.  It just was.

      Young Ned peers over the edge of the counter, reaching in
      and touching the dead fly.  There's a small ELECTRIC POP
      then the fly flies up and out the open window.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                The terms of use weren't immediately
                clear nor were they of immediate concern.

      CAMERA FOLLOWS THE FLY and Young Ned's gaze to:


      Freshly broomed, Young Ned stares out the window as filthy
      Chuck is getting hosed off in the backyard by her Father.

                                      NARRATOR
              He was under Chuck's spell... until a
                blood vessel in his mother's brain burst,
                killing her instantly.

      In the background, we see Ned's Mother cutting fruit one
      moment then abruptly dropping OUT OF FRAME.


      Young Ned turns away from the window to find his Mother dead
      on the linoleum floor next to the stove.                                                                                        4.

      EXTREME CLOSE UP - MOTHER'S OPEN AND STARING EYE

      Young Ned reaches into FRAME and touches his Mother's cheek
      just below the eye.  A BOLT OF STATIC ELECTRICITY.  Her
      constricted pupil dilates and Ned's Mother blinks.

      DING.  The timer goes off.

      ON NED

      He slowly backs away as his Mother stares at him.  A CLOCK
      appears in the corner of the OUR SCREEN and begins counting
      down from ONE MINUTE.  59 seconds... 58... 57...

                                      NARRATOR
                Young Ned's random gift that was came
                with a caveat or two...

                                      MOTHER
                Did the timer go off?

      Young Ned nods as his Mother gets to her feet, brushes off
      her apron and pulls on a pair of OVEN MITS.

                                      MOTHER (CONT'D)
                I must've slipped.  Clumsy.Hmmm.

      Ned sits at the kitchen table, unable to look away as his
      Mother pulls a pie out of the oven.  37 seconds... 36...

      Ned's Mother places the pie in the kitchen window to cool.

      ON CHUCK IN HER YARD

      She kicks over the last standing building and runs inside as
      her Father continues to water the lawn in the background. 
      The COUNTDOWN continues... 23... 22... 21...

      ON NED AND HIS MOTHER

      Ned watches as his Mother readies a second pie to go into
      the oven.  11... 10... 9... 8... 

                                      NARRATOR
              It was a gift that not only gave... it
                took.

      Ned's Mother twists the timer around, puts a new pie in the
      oven and as she closes the oven door.  The CLOCK HAND has
      traveled almost full circle: 4... 3... 2... 

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                Young Ned discovered he could only bring
                the dead back to life for one minute
                without consequence.  Any longer and
                someone else had to die.                                                                                        5.

      INCLUDE THE KITCHEN WINDOW, through which we can SEE the
      Chuck's Father drop dead.  Young Ned and his Mother don't
      immediately see this because their backs are to the window.

      Ned's Mother cuts a piece of pie, puts it on a plate, and
      sets it down in front of Young Ned.  He takes a bite.  Heaven.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
              It was the most delicious pie ever baked
                because it was the pie that was not
                meant to be.

      His Mother's GASP draws his attention to the window, where
      they can see Chuck's Father dead in the yard.


      Ned stares out the window at an AMBULANCE slowly pulling
      away from Chuck's house without its lights on, horrified.

                                      NARRATOR
                Young Ned realized somehow in the grand
                universal scheme of things, he had traded
                his mother's life for Chuck's father's.

                                      NED'S MOTHER
                Come on, big daddy, into bed.

                                      NARRATOR
                And he was horrified.

      Ned's Mother pulls up the blankets so Ned can slide into
      bed.  She draws the blanket up to his chest.  (NOTE: Never
      touching him directly.)

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                But there was one more thing about
                touching dead things that Young Ned
                didn't know.  And he learned it in the
                most unfortunate way.

      She moves to kiss Ned on his forehead.

        EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE ON - NED'S MOTHER'S LIPS

      As they're about to make contact with his forehead, we see a
      STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY.

      GO WIDE

      Ned's Mother drops dead right then and there.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                First touch, life.  Second touch, dead
                again forever.                                                                                        6.

      Ned kneels next to his dead mother, poking her cheek, waiting
      for her to open her eyes again.  She doesn't.


      Young Ned watches as his FATHER fills a steamer trunk with
      all the belongings from his room, his Rodan costume,

                                      NARRATOR
                For all intents, Young Ned was orphaned,
                too.  After a brief mourning period,
                his father panicked at raising a child
                alone.  In the wake of that panic, Ned
                was hustled off to boarding school. 


      We're on a cooling window, the shelves lined with the cloud-
      print tablecloth.  On a pillow on the floor, is DIGBY.

                                      NARRATOR
                Young Ned has become "The Pie-Maker,"
                owner and pastry chef of "The Pie Hole."

      CAMERA FINDS a PAIR OF HANDS rolling and kneading dough.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                The expression "pie in the sky" entered
                popular culture in 1911, referring to a
                dessert so sweet it can only be found
              in heaven.  But...


      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the back of the Pie Maker as he works,
      lining the pie pan with dough, not yet showing his face.

                                      NARRATOR
                The peaches never brown.  Berries ripe
              as the instant they were plucked.  If
                they weren't so delicious and eaten so
                quickly, folks might notice the pies
                stayed fresh an unusually long time.                                                                                        8.

      Dead, dying or bruised fruit is lovingly picked from a bowl
      and placed into the empty pie crust.  Bruises fade and dead
      fruit spontaneously engorges with juice, ripe and tasty.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                That's because the Pie Maker personally
                touches the contents of every one. 

      A piece of NOW FRESH fruit spills out of the pie crust. 

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                The dead fruit in his hands becomes
                ripe with ever-lasting flavor -- as
                long as he only touches it once.

      The Pie-Maker's hand snatches it before it hits the floor
      and the fruit spontaneously shrivels and darkens.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                For this reason, the Pie-Maker is a
                vegetarian.

      CAMERA FINALLY REVEALS NED'S FACE

      Simultaneously handsome and awkward, about 30 years of age. 
      Ned's lips are whistling but we don't hear a sound.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
              He bakes alone, whistling quietly to
                himself, rarely pursing his lips tight
                enough to produce a sound.

      Digby cocks his head, listening to what no one else can hear.


      Rich and textured, like the inside of a pie.  Tufted booths
    and a rounded counter bar (with spinning stools) that curves
      parallel to the pie facade exterior.  Right out of the 40's. 
    The place is dappled with customers and a single WAITRESS.

                love it.  And you know what?  By the
                end of the day I've sold more of those
                pies than any other pie in the bakery.

                                      EMERSON
                Yeah?  What pie do you love today?

                                      NARRATOR
                Emerson Cod, soon to be enjoying a slice
              of three plum pie ala mode, was the
                sole keeper of the Pie Maker's secret.


      It's after hours and the bakery is closed.  Blinds are drawn
      over the windows and the lights are dim.  As CAMERA FINDS
      Ned and Emerson sitting at a booth speaking in hushed tones. 
      Ned, forever the handsome, articulate recluse, fidgets a
      bit, uncomfortable in his own skin.Digby sits nearby
      listening to them MID-CONVERSATION:

                                    NED
                I asked you not to use the word "zombie."
                It's disrespectful.  Stumbling around,
                squawking for brains.  That's not how
                they do.  And "undead?" Nobody wants to
                beun-anything.  Why begin a statement
                with a negative?  It's like saying "I
                don't disagree."  Just say you agree.

                                      EMERSON
                Are you comfortable with "living dead?"

      Ned shakes his head for a long beat.

                                    NED
                You're either living or you're dead. 
                When you're living, you're alive.  When
                you're dead, that's what you are.  And
                when you're dead and then you're not,
                you're alive again.  Can't we say "alive
                again?"  Doesn't that sound nice?

                                      EMERSON
                Sounds like you're a narcoleptic.

                That's racial profiling.Looky here,

      AN OIL PAINTING - LEONARD GASWINT AND HIS DOG, CANTALOUPE

                                      NARRATOR
                The facts were these: one Leonard
                Gaswint, 39 years, 42 weeks, 5 days, 3
                hours and 26 minutes old, was found
                mauled to death in a parking garage.


      A chow named Cantaloupe cleans himself next to a parked car
      which partially obscures Leonard Gaswint's corpse.

                                      NARRATOR
                His dog Cantaloupe was the soul witness
                and only suspect in the murder.

      A REWARD SIGN

      There's a business photo of Leonard Gaswint with text that
      reads:  "REWARD $20,000."

                                      NARRATOR
                Convinced of her innocence, the Gaswint
                family offered a significant reward to
                find the real killer.                                                                                        12.


      Cantaloupe sits alone in her cell, awaiting execution.


      Ned and Emerson stand outside the morgue with the CORONER,
      who is filling out a series of forms on a clip board.  TWO
      COUNTY SHERIFFS stand nearby, looking official.

                                      CORONER
                You the dog expert?

                Uh-huh.

                                      CORONER

                I'm the, uh... other one.


      Emerson and Ned approach a sheet-covered body on a slab. 
      Ned peeks under the sheet and Emerson takes a step back.

                                      EMERSON
                How's he look?

                                    NED
              He looks fine, but my threshold is pretty
                high so you have to take what I say
                with a grain of salt.

      Emerson takes a peek under the sheet himself.

                                      EMERSON
                It's not a grain of salt.  It's one of
                those blocks they give cows to lick. 
                The man's tore up.

              He can't help the way he is.

                                      EMERSON
              It doesn't make it any less traumatic.

                                    NED
                For who?

                                      EMERSON
                Me.  And I'm sure him.  But mainly me. 
                I'm fine when they don't move.  It's
                when they move that I have a problem.                                                                                        13.

                                    NED
                Would it help if I turned off the light?

                                      EMERSON
                Yes.

      Ned turns off a metal floor lamp next to the drawer, casting
      a shadow over the body and obscuring it.  Emerson pulls back
      the sheet and reacts to the OFF-CAMERA corpse, mortified.

                                      EMERSON (CONT'D)
                I'm gonna wait outside.

      Ned watches as Emerson quickly disappears out the door.  As
      Ned's about to touch dead Leonard Gaswint's hand...  CAMERA
      JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP and we see the
      FAMILIAR POP OF ELECTRICITY.  Ned sets the alarm on his watch.

      A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins
      counting down from ONE MINUTE.  59 seconds... 58... 57...
      Leonard Gaswint sits upright into the light revealing he's
      been MAULED.  He couldn't be nicer.

                                      LEONARD GASWINT
                Hello.

                                    NED
                Hi.  Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gaswint.
              Or Leonard.  Do you prefer --

                                      LEONARD GASWINT
                Leo.

                                    NED
                Leo.  Your, um, current condition...

      Ned indicates the missing part of Gaswint's face.  The clock
      continues to count down: 43... 42... 41...

                                      LEONARD GASWINT
              Do I have something right here?

                                    NED
                No.  There's nothing right there.

                                      LEONARD GASWINT
                Damn dog.

                                    NED
                Cantaloupe?

                                      LEONARD GASWINT
                No, no.  Cantaloupe's docile as a kitten. 
              It was that rottweiller.  My secretary
                sicked her dog on me.  She's been upset
                since last year's Christmas party.  You
                know, it's a funny story...                                                                                        14.

      Before Gaswint can start, Ned touches him and life slips
      from his body instantly.  He stops his watch at 27 seconds.


      The Coroner and the Two Sheriff Deputies stand outside, as
      before, alone with Emerson.  Ned steps out of the morgue.

                                      CORONER
                Was it the chow?

                                    NED
                The Secretary.  With a rottweiler.


      Cantaloupe bounds out of her kennel and down the aisle, her
      fellow kenneled dogs barking M.O.S. in support.


      CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK TO REVEAL Olive sitting in a
        over-stuffed lounge chair, Digby squeezed in next to her,
      his head on her lap.  They're watching the evening news.

                                      NEWSCASTER
              An anonymous tip led to solving the
                murder of a Michigan entrepreneur
                believed to have been fatally mauled by
                a family pet.  The truth, however...

        KNOCK-KNOCK.  Someone's at the door.


      Olive opens the door to find Ned standing on her stoop. 
      Digby pokes his head out from around the lounge chair.  The
      NEWSCASTER continues to prattle on in the background.

                                      OLIVE
                How was your convention?

      She draws close to him, flirtatious and almost slightly
      desperate for him to seduce her.  He doesn't engage.

                                    NED
                  Conventional.  How was Digby?

                                      OLIVE
                Neurotic.  He's a very needy dog.

                                      OLIVE (CONT'D)
              Do you pet him?  Maybe if you pet him
                once in a while he wouldn't be so
                neurotic.


    Ned steps inside and around Olive.

                                    NED
                I pet him.  I'm allergic so I can't
                actually touch him.  But I pet him.

                                      OLIVE
                With a stick?  How do you pet him?

                                    NED
                A stick is involved, but it's more like
                a handle to a... petting device.

                                      OLIVE
                The dog needs to be touched.  We all
                need to be touched.

                                    NED
                You touch him.  Other people touch him.

                                      OLIVE
                He's your dog.  Do you touch anything?

                                    NED
              Of course I... I touch lots of things.

                                      OLIVE
                With affection?

      She reaches out and touches his shoulder, holding her hand
      there an uncomfortable beat.  Ned innocently averts his eyes.

                                      OLIVE (CONT'D)
                When was the last time someone touched
                you with affection?

                                    NED
                I get touched.

      She holds his gaze for another uncomfortable moment. He clears
      his throat, she finally pulls back her hand. 

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                Can I get Digby's leash?
                          (to Digby)
                You don't mind that I don't touch you,
              do you?

      Digby smiles and wags his tail, happy to see Ned.                                                                                        16.

                                      NARRATOR
                And then came the event that changed
                everything.

      Ned's attention is drawn away from Digby and to the television
      news broadcast.  A NEWSCASTER reports:

                                      NEWSCASTER
              In other news, the body of a young woman
                allegedly murdered aboard a cruise ship
                was recovered from the sea.  Her identity
              is being held pending notification of...

    Ned watches on the television as an image of a LIMP, LIFELESS
      WOMAN is hauled out of the water by a system of pulleys on
    the deck of the cruise ship.

                                      NARRATOR
                The Pie-Maker listened intently to the
                news, unaware that he stopped breathing. 
              He was haunted by the nameless woman
                who met her end on the high seas. 

      Olive approaches with Digby's leash in hand.

                                      OLIVE
                Here's your leash.

                                      NARRATOR
                But he didn't know why.

      OFF Ned, totally rapt, ignoring Olive...


      Ned has one eye on the pies he's making and the other on the
      small television set in the corner of his kitchen. 

                                      NEWSCASTER
                Her name still withheld, very little is
                known of the victim, who was reportedly
                traveling alone when ...

      Ned gives Digby a scratch with the petting device.

                                      NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
                ...murdered aboard a passenger ship
                returning from a tropical cruise.

      Ned looks up from the television to see Emerson through the
      porthole window in the kitchen door -- he's seated at a booth
      in the restaurant.  Their eyes connect.


      It's after hours and the bakery is closed.  Blinds are drawn
      over the windows and the lights are dim.                                                                                        17.

                the world besides a dead girl on a boat.

                                      EMERSON
                A lot's going on with that dead girl.

      The Funeral Director continues to watch MOURNERS file in. 
      CAMERA FINDS Ned and Emerson approaching in the throng of
      mourners.  Emerson begrudgingly slips the Funeral Director
      some cash, he quickly pockets it and opens the door.


      The simple, pine casket in the middle of the room surrounded
      by much fancier coffins.  The afternoon sun shines through a
      window -- a light on the pine casket.  Emerson and Ned ENTER.

                                    NED
                Um, I just wanna... I wanna... Can't I

                gain but a small amount of closure.

                Wha'cha got so open it needs closing?

                                    NED
                Just wanna say I'm sorry for something.

      Emerson walks out eyeing Ned, who closes the door behind
      him.  Alone in the room, Ned braces his back on the door and
      takes a deep breath.  Gulp.  He slowly approaches the casket. 
      Ned runs his hand over the pine frame then lifts the lid,
      bathing the body of Charlotte Charles, aka CHUCK, in sunlight.

      Even in death she's beautiful, a woman yet very much the
      little girl he once knew.

                Great thought was taken as to where to
                touch her.  The hand too impersonal,
                lips too forward, the cheek... the cheek.

      Ned's finger closes in on Chuck's alabaster cheek and CAMERA
      JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP of his slow
      caress.  A CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY between finger and cheek.

      A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins
      counting down from ONE MINUTE.  59... 

      Chuck opens her beautiful eyes and blinks.  Ned can only
      stare back at her.  The moment is as electric as his touch. 
    He smiles at her, expecting a warm smile in return but
      instead...WHAM.  She grabs him by the jacket and SLAMS HIS
      HEAD between the coffin and its lid. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM.

      Chuck scrambles out of her coffin as Ned stumbles back in a
      daze.  She grabs a chair and raises it to hit him again.

                Chuck!Wait.

                                      CHUCK
                Who are you?                                                                                        22.

              Do you remember the little boy who lived
                next door to you when your dad died?

                                      CHUCK
                Yeah...

                                    NED
              We used to destroy small villages
                together?

      Chuck stares at him a moment... confused... then...

                                      CHUCK
                Ned?  Hey.  How's it going?

      She finally puts the chair down.  46... 45... 44...

                                    NED
                Good.  You look great.  Um, do you know
                what's happening right now?

                                      CHUCK
                I had the strangest dream I was being
                strangled to death with a plastic sack.

                                    NED
              It wasn't a dream.  You were... strangled
              to death with a plastic sack.  That's
                probably an odd thing to hear but I
                wasn't quite sure how to sugar-coat it.

      It takes a moment.  She glances at her burial shroud, her
      coffin and finally the viewing room filled with caskets.

                                      CHUCK
                Oh. Oh.  And I'm...?  Neat.  How...?

                                    NED
                You only have a minute.  Less.  About
              38 seconds.

                                      CHUCK
                Huh.  What can I do in 38 seconds?

                                    NED
                You can tell me who killed you so, um,
                you know, justice can be served.

                                      CHUCK
                That is so sweet.  I just wanna put you
              in my pocket.  But I don't know who
                killed me.  I went to go get ice.  I
                was filling my bucket and I dropped my
                room key in the ice maker and just as I
                was thinking that was dumb...                                                                                        23.


      CHUCK stands at the ice machine perplexed with a bucket of
      ice under her arm.FWIP - a bag is thrown violently over
      her head.  She sucks air and it shrink-wraps to her face. 
      The ice tumbles to the deck in the FOREGROUND as Chuck is
      murdered in the BACKGROUND.

        BEEP-BEEP-BEEP: Ned's watch alarm goes off.  15 seconds left.

                I'm sorry.

      And Chuck was just starting to get used to being alive again. 
      It's weird and sad, but all she can think to say is:

                                      CHUCK
                Thanks for calling me Chuck.  Nobody's
                called me Chuck since... you.


      Emerson RAP-RAP-RAPS on the door.

                                      EMERSON
                I heard you beeping.

                Just a second.

      RESUME - VIEWING ROOM - DAY

      Chuck back in her coffin, Ned holding the lid.  11... 10... 
      He stumbles on his words, trying to speak but overwhelmed:

                                    NED
                Before you...

                                      CHUCK
                Yeah?

                                    NED
                I wanted to say I'm...

      Staring at her, Ned can't bring himself to tell her he
      inadvertently killed her father.  So instead he says:                                                                                        24.

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                I used to... when I lived next door to
                you... I had a cru... I was in...  You
                were my first kiss.

                                      CHUCK
                          (smiles, touched)
                You were my first kiss, too.  Or did
                you think I'd been around?

                                    NED
                I didn't want to assume.

                                      CHUCK
                Wanna be my last kiss?  First and last? 
              Or is that weird?

                                    NED
                It's not weird.  It's symmetrical.

      5... 4... He looks at her and slowly moves in for the kiss. 
      She closes her eyes.  Their lips are about to connect when...


      The Funeral Director scoots into the stall, pulling down his
      pants, sitting on the toilet and striking up a cigarette.

      Ned and Chuck, their lips hang in the air, centimeters apart.

                His lips went as far as they would go. 
              He couldn't will them to go any further.

      Chuck opens her eyes.  2... 1...  Minute's up.


      A beat, then THUNK -- we HEAR The Funeral Director's lifeless
      head hit the stall door.  Then the smoking cigarette drops.

      RESUME - VIEWING ROOM - DAY

      Ned slowly pulls away from Chuck, who lies there blinking. 
      He let her live and someone else died, the weight of it all
      is clearly on Ned's face when he looks back at Chuck.

                                      CHUCK
              If you don't wanna kiss me, you don't...
              It was just a... I thought it might...

                                    NED
                No.  I want to, I do... I...  What if
                you didn't have to... be dead?                                                                                        25.

                                      CHUCK
                Well, that would be preferable.

        RAP-RAP-RAP, Emerson pounds on the door.

                                    NED
                Nobody can know.  I have to think about
                how to get you outta here.  Can you lay
                really still until I get back?

                                      CHUCK
                Uh, sure --

      Before she can finish, he's closing the coffin lid.


      Ned emerges from the viewing room, quickly shutting the door
      behind him.  He's nervous and a little sweaty.

                                    NED
                She doesn't know.  Didn't know.

                Your eye's twitching.  When people aren't
                telling the truth, their eye twitches. 
                Right there.  Like yours did, just now.

                                    NED
                It's nerves.  Aggravated by a stomach
                thing.  Like acid reflux but in my eye. 
                I think I'm gonna stay for the service.

                S'that so?

                Feeling nostalgic.  I'll catch a later
                train.  Remember how to get to the
                station?  It's down the, uh... Great.


      Ned runs in and STARTLES at an ELDERLY JEWISH MAN standing
      next to where Chuck's coffin was but no longer is.  The
      Elderly Jewish Man STARTLES, as well.

                                    NED
                Where... uh, where's the deceased?                                                                                        26.

      He points to an open back door.

                                      ELDERLY JEWISH MAN
                Gone to sleep with her fathers.

                                    NED
                What?  I'm sor -- You sort of mumbled.

                                      ELDERLY JEWISH MAN
                She's getting buried.

                                    NED
                Presently?

      OFF Ned's ohshit of it all...


    Ned chases the hearse until he disappears in a cloud of dust.


    The small amount of light coming through the joints of the
      coffin barely illuminates Chuck.  She's beaming, awestruck.

                                      NARRATOR
                Only Sleeping Beauty could know how
                Chuck felt at this moment.  With a brush
              of his finger across her cheek, the
                world became a place of magic.

      Chuck is suddenly JOSTLED.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                And then the pallbearers pulled her out
              of the hearse.


      8 PALLBEARERS pick up the casket and carry it out the back
      door following the RABBI walking ahead of them.  The
      Pallbearers are unevenly matched -- tall on one side, short
    on the other -- consequently there's some slippage.


      Chuck continues to be jostled about.


      Chuck lies there, waiting patiently.

                                      NARRATOR
                Lying in the dark, Chuck considered how
                she came to be lying in the dark. 


      VIVIAN (early 50's) is cleaning a birdcage.  LILY (early

                Which made it difficult for them to
                leave the house.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL... they're surrounded by DOZENS
      AND DOZENS of CAGED BIRDS in a maze of STACKS AND STACKS of
      newspapers and magazines.  Chuck is moving through the house
      opening curtains and windows and allowing fresh air to flow.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                Which in turn made it difficult for
                Chuck to leave them.                                                                                        29.


      As Chuck sits in the window sill reading a novel, the empty
      shelves in the room FILL WITH BOOKS until the walls are
      "literally" covered.

                                      NARRATOR
                ...and read about people she could never
                be, on adventures she would never have.


      Chuck ENTERS glancing around at all the promise of adventure.

                                      NARRATOR
                Life was good enough until one day...
              it wasn't.  Chuck wanted more.

                The irony that her want for life got
                her killed was not lost.


      Chuck and Ned sit at a booth, Chuck wrapped in his coat.  He
      watches her devour a piece of pie and a large glass of milk. 
      Ned is still filthy from digging up her grave.

                                      CHUCK
                I can't even hug you?  What if you need
                a hug?  A hug can turn your day around.

                                    NED
                I'm not a fan of the hug.

                                      CHUCK
                Then you haven't been hugged properly. 
                It's an emotional Heimlich.  Someone
                puts their arms around you, gives a
                squeeze.  All your fear and anxiety
                comes shooting out of your mouth in a
                big, wet wad and you can breath again.

                                    NED
                That's fine for someone else to do, if
                I'm choking.  On something other than
                emotion.  But you can't touch me.

                                      CHUCK
              So a kiss is out of the question.
                          (off his look)
                I'm teasing.  I'm teasing you.

                                    NED
                Lost my train of thought.

                                      CHUCK
                This is the most delicious pie I've
                ever tasted... you use a lot of butter?

      He shakes his head, then touches a piece of fruit that's
      fallen out of the pie, it SHRIVELS before our very eyes.

                                      CHUCK (CONT'D)
                Never had so much in common with a pie.
                          (back to point)
                Why didn't you touch me twice?  I haven't
                seen you in 20 years.

                                    NED
                I have a very good memory.                                                                                        31.

                                      CHUCK
                How long were you thinking about this?

                                    NED
                Like thinking-thinking?  It wasn't pre-
                meditated.  I wasn't lying in wait. 
                More like I was musing on the idea. 
                Not, you know, dwelling.  But I wasn't
                seriously considering until the exact
                moment I did it.  Or, um, didn't do it.

      Chuck stares at him a moment -- this is all overwhelming.

                                      CHUCK
                I always wondered if you'd come back. 
                I guess you came back when I needed you
                most.  Well, that would've been before
                I was killed but this worked out.

                                    NED
                You understand you can't go back, right? 
                You can't see your aunts.

                                      CHUCK
                They're shut-ins, it's not like they
                talk to anybody.

                                    NED
                People aren't used to this sort of thing. 
                Issues of morality and "how come she's
                not dead anymore?"  It'd be a disaster.

                                      CHUCK
                I suppose dying is as good excuse as
                any to start living my own life.

                                    NED
              At least you're not the only Jew whose
                ever risen from the dead.

                                      CHUCK
                I am if you asked a Jew.


      Ned and Chuck stand in front of Digby, who wags his tail. 
      It's clear from Ned's slouching that he's exhausted.

                                    NED
                This is Digby.

                                      CHUCK
                Wasn't your old dog named Digby?

                                    NED
                This is him.                                                                                        32.

                                      CHUCK
                Did he...?  Did you...?  And now he's...?

                                    NED
                Yes.

                                      CHUCK
                You seem to do that a lot.  Why do you
              do that a lot?

                                    NED
                It's just the two of you.  I don't mean
              to be a bad host but I'm sort of
                exhausted from chasing your coffin.

                                      CHUCK
                Oh, oh, of course.

      Ned crosses to the couch and lays down, dirt and all.

                                    NED
                I'm gonna sleep here, you take the bed. 
                I insist.  My eyes are rolling back
                into my head.  I'm laying down now.

      But Ned is already sound asleep.  He snores quietly

                                      CHUCK
                          (softly)
                I'd kiss you if it wouldn't kill me.


      Chuck sits up in bed, watching the TELEVISION NEWS.  A candid
      "while living" PICTURE OF CHUCK's smiling face looms over
      NEWSCASTER #1'S shoulder as he recites the news:

                                      NEWSCASTER #1
              28 year-old "Lonely Tourist"  Charlotte
                Charles was laid to rest earlier today --

                                      NARRATOR
              In a strange bed watching her own funeral
              on the evening news, Chuck was struck
              by the undignified nature of celebrity.

      Every time she CLICKS the remote the NEWSCASTER changes but
      her haunting "while living" picture stays the same.

                                      NEWSCASTER #3
                A passenger heard a commotion just
                moments before the victim's body fell
                past his window --

                                      NARRATOR
                Maybe her death should be celebrated.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
              If she hadn't died, she wouldn't have
                this chance to finally live.

                                      NEWSCASTER #3
                Boutique Travel travel boutique has
                offered a 100,000 dollar reward for the
                murderer of customer Charlotte Charles. 

      Chuck reacts, no one said anything about a reward.


    Ned sleeps on the couch.  CAMERA SLOWLY REVEALS Chuck sitting
    on the big wing-back chair opposite him.

                                      CHUCK
                Ned?

                                    NED
                Hmmm?

                                      CHUCK
                Would I be alive right now if I knew
                who killed me?

                                    NED
              Of course.  Don't be silly -- That's a --
                Something on the news about the reward?

                                      CHUCK
                You said you wanted to know who killed
              me so justice could be served.  But I
                don't think justice was on the menu. 
                Maybe as a side dish.  But not an entree.

                                    NED
              It most certainly was an entree.  It
                was a special of the d -- Can we drop
                the metaphor?  I wouldn't have known
                you died if it weren't for the reward.

                                      CHUCK
                When were you gonna tell me?

                                    NED
              In the morning or when it came up. 
                Which ever didn't come first.

                                      CHUCK
                100,000 dollars makes a lotta pie.

                                    NED
              50 thousand.  I have a business partner.

                                      CHUCK
                It's a business?                                                                                        34.

                                    NED
                Not in the traditional sense.

                                      CHUCK
                You touch murder victims, ask who killed
                them, touch 'em again, they go back to
                being dead and you collect the reward?

                                    NED
                Yeah... that's it in a nutshell.

                                      CHUCK
                Are you after my reward?  I'm not mad
              at ya, I just wanna know.  I'll be mad
              at ya if you lie to me, though.  Is
                that why you're keeping me around?

                                    NED
                I don't want your reward.

                                      CHUCK
                I'll be so mad if you're lying.  You'll
                have me scratching the drapes.

                                    NED
                I'm not lying.  Please don't attack the
                window treatments.

                                      CHUCK
                Okay.  Go back to sleep. 

      Chuck stands and returns to the bedroom.  Ned lays his head
      back down on the couch, unable to shut his eyes. 


      Chuck in bed, facing the living room.  She closes her eyes
      and reaches out and puts her palm to the wall.

      CAMERA RISES TO AN OVERHEAD ANGLE FINDING NED

      ...on the other side.  He reaches out and touches the wall. 
      He and Chuck appear to be holding hands side by side.


      Chuck opens her eyes to find a note taped to the lamp shade. 
      It reads: "Please do NOT leave this apartment."


      Chuck, in long coat, scarf and sunglasses, turns and is
      surprised to see Olive standing outside her apartment
      surprised to see a woman coming out of Ned's.

                                      CHUCK
                I'm a friend of Ned's.                                                                                        35.

      Olive sizes her up for a moment, then out of curiosity:

                                      OLIVE
                Does he touch you?


      Emerson sits opposite Ned before the bakery is open.

                                      EMERSON
                How was the service?

                                    NED
                You know, just paid my respects.

                                      EMERSON
                Weren't looking to get paid?

                                    NED
                Hmmm?

                                      EMERSON
                Might see a dead woman speaking to you
              in confidence as an opportunity to make
                a whole lot of money by your lonesome. 
                Regardless of prior arrangements.

                                    NED
                There's no opportunity here.

      With that, Chuck slides into the booth next to Emerson.

                                      CHUCK
                Hi.  Are you the business partner? 

                                      EMERSON
                Yes, ma'am.

                                      CHUCK
                Charlotte Charles.  Call me Chuck.

      Emerson can only stare.  Ned buries his face in his hands.

                                      CHUCK (CONT'D)
                I've been ruminating.  And by ruminating
                I mean pondering, not chewing cud.  How
                about we solve my murder and collect
                the reward.  Wouldn't that be poetic? 
                It's certainly an anecdote.

                                      EMERSON
                She's supposed to be in the ground.

                                    NED
                          (to Chuck)
                I thought you didn't want the reward.                                                                                        36.

                                      CHUCK
                No.  I wanted you not to want the reward. 
                100,000 dollars is a lot of money.  How
                about a 3 way split?  30/30/40?  Only
                fair I get more.  I did die for it.

                                    NED
                I'm not a detective.  I make pies.

                                      CHUCK
                You can't just touch somebody's life
                and be done with it.

                                    NED
                Yes, I can.  That's how I roll.

                                      CHUCK
                For someone who brings people back to
                life, you're awfully dead inside.

      Ned reacts to that, stung.

                                      EMERSON
                I can do 30/30/40.

                                    NED
                She's supposed to be dead.
                          (to Chuck)
                You're supposed to be dead.  I think
                this is pushing your luck.

                                      CHUCK
                Yes, well, luck pushed me first.

      OFF Chuck's determination...

                She was who he wanted her to be and no
                one else... until proven otherwise.

    Ned and Emerson slide into the booth next to Chuck.                                                                                        39.

                I'm not who you think I am.

      Emerson gives Ned a side-long glance.

                                      EMERSON
                Who does he think you are?

                                      CHUCK
                The small town girl who never saw the
                world only to have her first time out
              be her last.  Well, that is who I am
                but I've been hoisted upon my own petard.

                                    NED
                What's a petard? 

                                      CHUCK
              In my case, a petard is the wander-lust
                that compromised my judgment.  That
                Tahitian getaway was a devil's bargain. 
                And the devil... was Diedre.


      Diedre Duffield holds the door open for Chuck as she ENTERS. 
      Once inside, Diedre locks the door behind her.

                All I had to do was pick up a package
                for Diedre.

                                    NED
                Are you a drug mule?

                                      CHUCK
                No.  I'm a monkey mule.  I met a man in
                a park and he gave me a brief case.

      A BRIEF CASE - FLASHBACK

      A stainless steel Halliburton molded in an alligator print. 
      The case opens to REVEAL a pair of PLASTER MONKEY STATUES.

                                    NED
                You died for a pair of plaster monkeys?                                                                                        40.

                                      CHUCK
                Diedre said their value was sentimental.

                                      EMERSON
                Those must be some emotional monkeys.

                                      CHUCK
                Yes, well, clearly he didn't want to
                part with them.  You should ask Diedre
                about all of this.  I'm very curious
                what she has to say.


      CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM Diedre the Boutique Manager to REVEAL
      she's SPEAKING M.O.S. in front of SEVERAL REPORTERS.

                                      NARRATOR
                The facts were these: in a shrewd
                marketing ploy, the Boutique Travel
                travel boutique offered a 100,000 dollar
                reward in the death of Charlotte Charles.


      Ned and Emerson open the door.  They step inside and a bell
      CHIMES.  The store appears to be empty, they look around.

                                      EMERSON
                Hello?  Anybody home?

      Ned looks around as Emerson goes into:


      Emerson ENTERS and stops short at strangled-to-death Diedre
      sitting at the break table, plastic bag over her head.

                                      NARRATOR
                Although on-line sales increased by 23
                percent, the reward fell short of
                achieving its desired goal.

                                    NED
                          (as he ENTERS)
                This is really no way to run a -- Oh.                                                                                        41.

      MOMENTS LATER

      Chuck is now staring at Diedre's dead body along with Ned
      and Emerson.  Chuck carefully pulls the bag off her head.

                                      CHUCK
                Well, I guess I can't be too mad at
                her.  Is that how they found me?  That's
                humiliating.  She looks horrible.

                                    NED
                I wonder how long she's been here.

                                      EMERSON
                Touch the poor bitch and ask her.

                                    NED
                          (hesitates, to Chuck)
                I'm sort of embarrassed to do it in
                front of you.

      Chuck turns around and Ned touches Diedre.  A familiar POP
      OF ELECTRICITY.  Diedre opens her eyes, blinks and sits up. 
      She glances around, more than a little confused -- wasn't
      she just murdered.  She locks eyes with Chuck.

      A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN:  59... 58... 

                                      DIEDRE
                Hey, Charlotte.

                                      CHUCK
                Hey, Diedre.

                                      DIEDRE
                Now why'd I know you'd be the first
                person I'd see when I got to... is
                this... which one is this?

                                      CHUCK
                This isn't either.  Or maybe it's both. 
                But here's the deal: you get to talk
                for like a minute so we're gonna catch
                up.  Then you're... not talking anymore.

                                      DIEDRE
                Does everybody get to do this?  Cause,
                girl, we got to break it down.

                                      CHUCK
                Did you know I was gonna get killed?

                                      DIEDRE
                I thought it might be a possibility. 
                And I'm real sorry about that.  I
                probably should have said something.

                But to be honest, and really?  Why not
              at this point?  If it was safe, I
                would've done it myself.  This is
                fantastic.  Being honest is fun.

      Chuck is stunned.  The clock continues: 34... 33... 32...

                                      EMERSON
                          (sotto, to Chuck)
                Ask who the dude was that killed you. 
                And her.  And what's with the monkeys.

                                      DIEDRE
                          (re: Ned and Emerson)
                Um, who are those people?

                                      CHUCK
                That's Emerson.  I don't know him really. 
                And this is Ned.  He was my first kiss.

                                      DIEDRE
                Oh, now he's adorable.  Look at this --

      Diedre reaches over and pinches Ned's cheek and THUNK!  Her
      head hits the table as she goes back to being dead INSTANTLY.

                                      EMERSON
                You couldn't have taken a step back?

                                    NED
                I didn't know she was gonna pinch my
                cheek.  Who does that?

                                      CHUCK
                She... actually, she does that a lot.

                                      EMERSON
                Whoever killed you, killed your girl
                Diedre as evidenced by the plastic sack. 
                But why would whoever killed you kill
                her if he already got his monkeys.

                                      CHUCK
                I dropped my key in the ice maker.  He
                couldn't get in my room.


      The PLASTIC SACK KILLER, his face OUT OF FRAME, stands outside
      a cabin door holding dead Chuck slumped over in his arms, as
      he fumbles through her bathrobe for her room key.

                                      PLASTIC SACK KILLER
                Oh, for Pete's sake.

      He tries the handle, it doesn't open.                                                                                        43.

      CAMERA VERY QUICKLY PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we're in:


      The room has been stripped of all personal belongings.  The
      briefcase sits on a bed, surrounded by STACKS OF BOOKS.  In
      fact, the whole room is filled with STACKS OF NEWSPAPER.

      THE HALLWAY

      Vivian is preparing a cheese platter while Lily watches an
      old television playing a NEWSREEL of the DARLING MERMAID
      DARLINGS in action, swimming in circles under water.

              It was Aunt Vivian and Aunt Lily who
                received custody of the monkeys.  And
                they were about to be paid a visit by
                the man willing to kill for them.

      DING-DONG.  The doorbell rings.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Teen Vivian and Lily loll underwater, rolling over and over
      languidly in sea-shell bikini tops and mermaid fin bottoms.

                                      NARRATOR
                They made a name for themselves as the
                "Darling Mermaid Darlings."

      Teen Vivian and Teen Lily dive, pivot, shoot out of the water
    and flip, perfectly synchronized.  The CROWD goes wild.


      30's VIVIAN and LILY loll underwater, rolling over and over
      less gracefully than before, their mermaid fins not as cute.

                                      NARRATOR
                Still holding onto their fading glory
              as under-water artists, their lives
                were changed forever...


      CAMERA MOVES PAST an advertisement for the "Darling Mermaid
      Darlings" to FIND 40's Lily cleaning the litter box as the
    cat waits patiently for her to be done.  She accidentally
      flips cat sand in her own face and recoils.

                ...when Lily cleaned the litter box and
                got dirty cat sand in her eye. 


    The cat now sits at the edge of the pool watching 30's Vivian
    and 30's Lily (with an eye patch) loll underwater with no
      indication of grace, colliding into each other.

                Not only was the eye lost but their
                careers, too.

      Vivian is preparing a cheese platter while Lily watches an
    old television playing a NEWSREEL of the DARLING MERMAID

    Ned and Emerson sit opposite Vivian, they're surrounded by
      CAGED BIRDS of all varieties and a maze of newspaper stacks.

    As Vivian sets a sad cobbled-together cheese and cracker
      plate in front of their guests, Lily prattles on:

                                    LILY
                Charlotte was a firecracker.  Always
                trying to get us out of the house,
                threatening to bake anti-depressants
                into our food.  Got to the point I was
                scared to eat anything she cooked.

                                      VIVIAN
                She was a good cook.  And a nice girl.

                                      VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                With the exception of puberty.  Which
                was unfortunately the same time Lily
                was going through her change of life. 

                                    LILY
                It's impolite to discuss a person's
                menopause in mixed company.

                                      VIVIAN
              It nearly killed me.

      Lily turns the subject back to Charlotte.

                                    LILY
                Horrible the way Charlotte died.  On a
                cruise.  Last days spent surrounded by
                middle-aged over-weight women who wear
                sweatshirts with things sewn to them. 
                Usually kittens made of felt.  And the
                food is perfectly atrocious.  Unless
                she enjoyed vomiting and diarrhea, I
                can't imagine she had a good last meal.

                                      EMERSON
                A good last meal goes a long way.  Our
                penal system makes a point of it.

                                    NED
                It's nice she had a little glimpse of
                the world before she died.

                                    LILY
                The world isn't that great.

                                      VIVIAN
              At least she had the sense not to fly. 
                Airplanes fall outta the sky every day. 
                          (to Emerson)
                Cheese?  I recommend the pure goat with
                blue ash.  Has a grassy flavor.

      Emerson takes a bite.

                                      EMERSON
              It does have a grassy flavor.

                                      VIVIAN
                It's delicious with Charlotte's honey. 
                You haven't lived until you've tasted
                her honey.  The homeless love it.

                                    LILY
                          (holds off emotion)
                We'll never taste her honey again.                                                                                        48.


      Ned reacts as he catches Chuck peering through the window. 
      He tries not to lose his focus and keep on task:

                                    NED
                Not to change the subject, but has the
                cruise line returned her belongings? 
                Specifically a stainless steel briefcase?


      Chuck opens the window, climbs inside, finds the bed with
      the suitcase and the briefcase on the springs on top.  A
      lone parrot is on its perch in the its cage in the corner. 
      Chuck opens the briefcase to reveal the twin PLASTER MONKEYS.

                                      NARRATOR
                The monkeys of indeterminate sentimental
                value took on a new sentimental value
                for Chuck.  If she couldn't keep her
                Aunts, she was going to keep them.

      She HEARS footsteps coming up the stairs.  She pulls the
      monkeys out of the briefcase.

      UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

      Lily walks up the stairs.

      CHUCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Chuck snaps the briefcase shut and moves toward the window. 
      She stops and takes a look around and slips outside.

      Lily ENTERS narrowly missing Chuck.  Lily crosses to the
      window and pulls it shut, yanking the curtains closed.                                                                                        49.


      Lily moves to the bed and picks up the briefcase.  Behind
      her, silhouetted in the door, a MAN quietly ENTERS the room.

      The parrot SQUAWKS.

                                      PARROT
                "Oh, for Pete's sake."

      Lily turns around and FWIP - a bag is thrown violently over
      her head.  She sucks air and it shrink-wraps to her face.


      Ned, Emerson and Vivian in the living room.

                                      VIVIAN
                Charlotte always wanted to get away. 
                Got away further than any of us thought.

      Ned reaches over and holds Lily's hand... 

                                      NARRATOR
              In a rare moment of sensitivity, the
                Pie-Maker reached out and touched
                someone... who didn't want to be touched.

      ...but she stiffens at his touch.  They sit there an awkward
      beat as if a social taboo has been broken.  Ned is finally
      unable to take it anymore and gets up to excuse himself.

                                    NED
                I'll go see if she needs any help
                bringing it down in case it's heavy.


      Ned climbs the stairs to the second landing.  It's eerily
      quiet upstairs.  He takes a few steps down the hall.

                                    NED
                Want me to carry that for you?

      He rounds the corner and sees the stainless steel briefcase
      in the middle of the hall when FWIP - a bag is thrown                                                                                         50.

      violently over his head, as well.  He sucks air and it shrink-
      wraps to his face.  Ned's struggles with the Killer, who
      tightens his grip, pulling Ned off his feet.

      WHAP -- Chuck comes out of nowhere and SLAMS THE STAINLESS
      STEAL BRIEFASE upside the Plastic Sack Killer's head.  It
      rings in his ears and ours.  He drops Ned with a plop.  He
      scrambles back pulling the sack off his face, gasping for
      air.  The Plastic Sack Killer spins around just as Chuck is
      taking another swing with the briefcase --

      THWAP.  The Plastic Sack Killer catches the briefcase before
    it hits his head, snapping it out of Chuck's hands.  A tense
      beat then... 

                                      PLASTIC SACK KILLER
                Didn't I kill you?

                                    LILY (O.S.)
                I can hold my breath for a long time.

    The Plastic Sack Killer turns to see Lily, still alive,
      standing at the other end of the hall cocking a shotgun.

                                    LILY (CONT'D)
              18 years of under-water ballet.

                                      PLASTIC SACK KILLER
                Oh, for Pete's sake.

      BLAM!  The shotgun KICK PROPELS Lily backward into the
      partially closed door behind her and into the next room. 
    The impact of the SHOTGUN BLAST knocks the Plastic Sack Killer
    off his feet and THROUGH THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM, the stainless
      steel briefcase clamors to the floor.

      LIVING ROOM

      Emerson and Vivian both react to the commotion upstairs.

      UPSTAIRS LANDING 

      Chuck and Ned stand with the gaping window between them,
      staring at each other.  Holy shit.  Did that just happen? 
      They look down the other end of the hall where Lily is staring
      directly at not only Ned but more importantly Chuck, her
      dead niece evidently returned from the grave.

                                      NARRATOR
                The jig appeared to be up.  Aunt Lily
                was looking directly at her niece.  Her
                niece who wasn't supposed to be alive.

      LILY'S P.O.V.  - HALL

    The corridor is partially obscured by her eye patch and she
      doesn't see Chuck at all, only Ned                                                                                        51.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                And if she possessed two good eyes, she
                would have seen her.

    ON CHUCK 

    She slinks around the corner and out the open window.


    Ned turns from the window to find Lily holding the stainless
      steel briefcase as Emerson and Vivian come up the stairs.

    ON BRIEFCASE

    The lid pops open to REVEAL there are no monkeys, but instead
      it's filled with HONEYCOMB.  A single bee flies out.

                                      NARRATOR
                And she gave a little sweetness to the
                ones she left behind.

    GO WIDE 

      Ned, Emerson, Vivian and Lily watch the lone bee fly out the
      window and into the night.


      CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK TO REVEAL Olive again sitting
      in her over-stuffed lounge chair, Digby squeezed in next to
      her.  They're watching the evening news.

                                      NEWSCASTER #1  (O.S.)
                When asked about a "Darling Mermaid
                Darlings" reunion the sisters mentioned
                a benefit performance to support "Honey
                for the Homeless" was in the works.

      Olive raises the television remote and we...

                                                                        CLICK TO BLACK


      CAMERA FINDS Ned and Chuck seated at a booth enjoying pie.

                                      CHUCK
                You know, this whole thing is sort of
                like reincarnation but more immediate.

                                    NED
                Sort of.

                                      CHUCK
              Do you believe in reincarnation?  If I
                wouldn't have come back this way, would
                I have come back some other way?

                                    NED
                I don't wanna believe in reincarnation. 
                The planet's falling apart.  Right now
                it's the children's problem, but if we
                reincarnate it's our problem.

                                      CHUCK
                Never thought of it that way.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        54.

                                      CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          (considers)
                Was this an act of kindness?  Me.  Here. 
                Were you trying to do something good
                for no other reason than to help me?

                                    NED
                          (shakes his head)
                I was being selfish.  I'd love to tell
                myself I was being unselfish but I know
                deep down in my primal sweet spot I was
                being unselfish for selfish reasons.

                                      CHUCK
                Did you want a corpse bride?

                                    NED
                No.  I just thought the world would be
                a better place if you were still in it. 

      The most romantic things she's ever heard.

                                      CHUCK
                Anything else I should know?

                                      NARRATOR
                The Pie Maker wanted to tell Chuck about
                that fateful afternoon when he brought
                his mother back and inadvertently killed
                her father, but instead he said...

                                    NED
                You know everything there is to know.

                                      NARRATOR
              He lied.

      She slides one of the Monkeys across the table.

                                      CHUCK
                I figure since they cost me my life I
                should get to keep at least one.  And
                since I wouldn't be alive if it weren't
                for you, you should have the other one.

                                    NED
                It's like those heart pendants that
                BFF's wear.  Except with monkeys.

                                      CHUCK
                Thanks for bringing me back to life.

      The word "life" hangs there.  Chuck stares at Ned a moment. 
      The attraction is palpable, but is it love or fascination? 
      Not even Chuck could tell you.  Ned's affection is clearer:                                                                                        55.

                                    NED
                Thanks for returning the favor.

      Chuck takes her Monkey and presses its face against Ned's
      Monkey.  Ned smiles returning the kiss with his Monkey.  He
      feels the weight of the plaster statue.

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                These are kinda heavy.

      Then:SMASH.  Chuck smashes her Monkey against Ned's.  The
      plaster shatters revealing SOLID GOLD MONKEYS underneath.

                                      CHUCK
              Is that...?

                                    NED
                Uh-huh.

                                      CHUCK
                Neat.


      CAMERA PUSHES PAST Emerson to find Ned and Chuck standing on
      either side of the door to the WALK-IN FREEZER.                                                                                        56.

                                      NARRATOR
                And the Pie-Maker and Chuck took a plunge
              of their own...

      CAMERA PUSHES BETWEEN Ned and Chuck to REVEAL they're standing
      over a FROZEN CORPSE.  A clean-cut white professorial type
    in his late 40's wearing a suit.  His name is MARTIN
      MILTENBERGER and he's been stabbed several times.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                The facts were these: one Martin
                  Miltenberger, Principal of the Beales
                School for Boys was found stabbed to
                death in the school's walk-in freezer.

    As Ned's about to touch dead Martin Miltenberger...  CAMERA
      JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP and we see the
      FAMILIAR POP OF ELECTRICITY.  Ned sets the alarm on his watch. 
      A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins
      counting down from ONE MINUTE.  59 seconds... 58... 57... 

      Martin Miltenberger sits up and takes in his stabbed status.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                But before Principal Miltenberger could
                get into the specifics of his demise,
                Chuck thought it would be nice to ask...

                                      CHUCK
              Do you have any last words or thoughts
              or requests?

      Ned reacts, glancing at Chuck and loving her for asking.

                                      NARRATOR
              It was something the Pie Maker never
                thought or cared enough to ask until
                Chuck back into his life.

                                      EMERSON
                You better ask who killed him first.

      As Martin Miltenberger prattles on , Ned stares at Chuck,
      his heart swelling.  He reaches behind him and holds his
      hands behind his back.

                                      NARRATOR
              As he stared at her, he reached around
                and held his hand behind his back,
                pretending he was holding hers.

      Chuck winks at Ned and reaches behind her back.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                And at that very moment she was
                pretending to be holding his.                                                                                        57.

      OFF Chuck and Ned holding their hands behind their backs...

                                                                                FADE OUT:
