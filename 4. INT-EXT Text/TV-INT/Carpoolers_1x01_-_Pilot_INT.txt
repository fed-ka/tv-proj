    LEILA and CINDY peer out at a car full of CARPOOLERS (GRACEN, 
    LAIRD, AUBREY and DOUGIE). The men sit comically motionless. 

                                CINDY
                  What are they doing out there?

                                LEILA
                  Oh, you know them. Probably talking 
                  about work...


    But the Carpoolers are listening to  riff rock  full blast.  
    They groove almost imperceptibly. After the song ends:

                                GRACEN
                  Okay. Now I m ready to face my 
                  family. 

                                AUBREY/DOUGIE
                  Me too./Let s hit it.

    Cleansed, fortified, they get out - ready for home.   

    MAIN TITLES: Music: UP-TEMPO. The CARPOOLERS move toward us, a 
    little like rock stars. As they arrive at the car and strike a 
    pose, the sprinklers explode behind them backlit by the sun. 


                                        ACT ONE


    LEILA stares at a toaster, delighted by its high-tech gleam. 
    She drops in the bread as her husband, GRACEN, enters.

                                GRACEN
                  New toaster?

                                LEILA
                  Yeah...

                                GRACEN
                  What was wrong with the old one?  

                                LEILA
                  Nothing.  But this is the new one.            CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   2.



                                GRACEN
                  Yikes...Looks expensive. I hate to 
                  ask, but- 

                                LEILA 
                  -Two hundred. But...you should taste 
                  the toast.

    They turn to see MARMADUKE dressed only in his underwear. He  
    arrives just as the toast pops. He snatches  Gracen s toast. 

                                GRACEN 
                  Hey man, what you got on for the day?

                                MARMADUKE
                  Why you asking me?

                                GRACEN
                  Because it s your day...man.

                                LEILA 
                  Marmaduke has an interview...and 
                  I m at the house. My flip s almost 
                  done. I can smell the money!

                                MARMADUKE
                  Da-ad? Can I borrow a shirt with a 
                  collar and a whatcha  call it...tie?

                                GRACEN
                  And pants?

                                MARMADUKE
                  Da-ad, I don t need pants. It s an 
                  online interview. Like they all are   
                  nowadays. Don t you know anything?

                                GRACEN
                  Apparently not...see, I didn t even 
                  know a toaster could cost two hundred 
                  dollars.

                                LEILA
                  Don t worry. I paid for it with my 
                  own money. 
                      (looking out window)
                  The boys are here!  


                                DOUGIE
                  There s a mailbox up here on the 
                  right. Is there any way I could mail 
                  a letter real quick?

                                LAIRD
                  Sure.

    Laird snatches the letter and throws it out the window. 

                                AUBREY
                  No stops. It s kind of a rule.  

                                DOUGIE
                  Laird, someday, I ll get you back for 
                  that. It may not be today, it may not 
                  be tomorrow-
                      (suddenly yanks Laird s tie)
                  -Oh! I guess it was today.

                                GRACEN
                  Children please...behave.


    The freeway is crammed. The carpool lane, a lone ribbon of 
    freedom. The car blasts down the lane.  

                                GRACEN
                  Well, this time she spent two hundred 
                  dollars on a toaster.

                                  LAIRD/AUBREY  
                    Oooh.../That s bad.

                                GRACEN 
                  That s a hundred dollars a slice. 

                                DOUGIE 
                  Two hundred s a lot. But it all 
                  depends on how much  bank  you got. 
                      (off Gracen s look)
                  Don t mean to get too personal. 

                                AUBREY     
                  -Nothing s too personal. We re 
                  Carpoolers.

                                GRACEN
                  Okay Aubrey, how much do you make?            CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   6.



                                AUBREY
                  Well, it s complicated really.  
                  There s many ways to look at it, 
                  gross, net, how much allowance my 
                  wife gives me-

                                LAIRD
                  -Why is it that us guys can get lap 
                  dances next to each other, but it s 
                   too personal  to talk about our 
                    income?...Okay guys, on three we ll 
                  all say how much money we make.

                                VARIOUS 
                    Okay./Fine./Great idea.

                                LAIRD 
                      One...two...three...

    Beat. Nobody speaks. They all break out laughing.  

                                AUBREY
                  ...Actually, my wife gets my check.  
                  I don t even know what my salary is.

                                GRACEN
                  Well you should. And maybe you should 
                  remind her that marriage is a tricky 
                  shadow dance of give and take and 
                  that lately it s like you ve been 
                  playing catch-up in your own home.

                                AUBREY
                  Okay then...


    Behind a door reading:  GRACEN BROOKER MEDIATOR,  he sits with 
    a feuding couple SUE and TED HENDZEL and RIKKI their son (8).  

                                SUE
                  -No I m talking, Ted! Gracen tell him 
                  the whole neighborhood can see that 
                  Ted s been dating cheerleaders.  

                                TED
                  What I do in my house, my hot-tub, is 
                  my business!

                                SUE
                  Yes, but if Rikki s coming over, the 
                  least you can do is pick up the pom-
                  poms and the panties!  

                                TED
                  Hey, I m just trying to teach the kid 
                  about life. In this case  the good 
                  life. 

    Ted and Rikki high-five. Gracen seems distracted.

                                GRACEN
                  I see. I wonder...is it possible that 
                  the real issue here is money?

                                GRACEN 
                  Yes, sometimes things fall apart 
                  because a man feels like he s not 
                  doing what a man s supposed to do. 

                                TED
                  Hey, that s what the cheerleaders are 
                  for!  

                                GRACEN
                  I m not talking about that. I m 
                  talking about providing. Are you two  
                  locked in a power-struggle over 
                  money?

                                SUE
                  I didn t think so...but maybe?

                                GRACEN 
                  Now, I want each of you to write down 
                  how much money you make.  
                      (to the kid)
                  You too, Rikki...

    He hands them pens and paper, then notices Laird at the door.

                  I hate to interrupt, but I already 
                  have.  

                                GRACEN
                  What?

                      (bad code)
                  I have some information about the 
                  person we were talking about this 
                  morning. You know, the married lady 
                  with the sexy legs?

                                GRACEN
                  Okay. You folks excuse me.  


                                LAIRD
                      (bursting)
                  I know how much money Leila has!

                                GRACEN 
                  Really? How d you find out?          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   10.



                                LAIRD
                  Gracen, I m a dentist. I can move in 
                  any circle. I m a healer, like a 
                  doctor. I wield the power of a cop.  
                  Yet, I m a friend of the worker, 
                  respected-

                                GRACEN
                  -You re a dentist.

                                LAIRD 
                  Yes. Yes I am...more specifically, I 
                  had a  cleaning and a sleep over  
                  with a woman who works at your bank.  
                  Apparently there s been a lot of 
                   activity  in Leila s account. You 
                  wanna know how much is in there?  

                                GRACEN 
                  No! I m not going to check up on 
                  people that I love. I m not going 
                  to...go give my son a drug test.  

                                LAIRD
                  Marmaduke? Definitely. 

                                GRACEN
                  Bad example. But it s wrong to snoop-

                                LAIRD  
                  -Tell me, is it wrong to stand on 
                  your ex-wife s wobbly fence, putting 
                  a mirror up in the hollow of a tree, 
                  trying to catch a glimpse of whose 
                  socked feet are on top of her this 
                  time? I should have seen the signs. 
                  The late night calls, the ass-print 
                  on the sliding glass door. If I had I 
                  might still be married...or divorced 
                  a whole lot sooner.

                                GRACEN
                  You might be seeing things through 
                  the prism of your own experience.

                                LAIRD
                  Maybe. But my point is...information 
                  is power. So I ll just write  the 
                  number  down, so if you want to take 
                  a peek - it s here.  

    He tucks it in Gracen s shirt.          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   11.




    At his computer sits Marmaduke, shirt, tie, but pantless.  
    He s printed and taped-up a picture of a bookcase of  smart

                  room. We will be with you shortly.

    We hear MUZAK. A picture of a plant comes on-screen. Then, the 
    broadcast switches to MR. HEGGIE (60), sitting at a desk.

                  I read your resume and I m quite

                                MARMADUKE
                  Really?   

                                MR. HEGGIE
                  Yes.  Most people with a resume this 
                  lame would lie about it. 

                                MARMADUKE
                  To tell the truth, I think it s 
                  important to be truthful.

                                MR. HEGGIE
                  Okay...you sold me. Someone from 
                  accounting will be on to talk about 
                  fees and payments. You got the job. 

                                MARMADUKE
                  Yes!

    Marmaduke jumps in the air triumphantly. As he does, Mr. 
    Heggie clearly catches him in his underwear.   


    The phone rings. Gracen picks up.

                                GRACEN
                  Hey, Leila. He did? Wow. That s 
                  great. Just out of curiosity, did he 
                  say how much he s going to make?
                      (pained beat)
                  Wow, that s a lot of money...to some 
                  people.

    Caving, he covers the phone and looks at  the number. 

                                GRACEN (CONT'D)
                  OH Christ! That s a lot of money!

                  There s no delicate way to ask this 
                  question. Does she get on top a lot?

                  happen, don t happen as often as they

                  that toaster.

    A  toast party  is in full swing. Some neighborhood women, 
    including DORINDA and Sue Hendzel, mill around the toaster.  

                                SUE  
                  Mmm, that is so good.

                                DORINDA 
                  That s mind-blowing toast.  

    The door opens. There stands Dougie s wife, CINDY.

                                LEILA
                  There she is...

                                CINDY
                      (offering a box)
                  Hi Leila. Thanks for having me over. 
                  I made you a little thank you gift.   

                                LEILA
                  Well, I wanted you to meet everybody.  

    Leila opens the present. It s oven mitts.

                                LEILA (CONT'D)
                  You made oven mitts?

                                CINDY
                  Yeah, and I made the box too.  No

                                LEILA
                  That is so...generous. Thank you.

    Leila turns to the group.

                  Oh, there s nothing much to tell,

                  All my great-grandparents are still 
                  alive, so I guess I m pretty lucky.  
                  At Christmas, I like to chop down my 
                  own Christmas tree. Then I plant one 
                  to replace it! I love being a 
                  homemaker, although I don t make my 
                  own bread, because bakers have to 
                  make a living too! I m passionate 
                  about recycling. I m crazy about 
                    scrap-booking. I m trying to get my 
                  husband to start a coin collection, 
                  but we ll see how that goes!


    Leila notices the car outside.

                                LEILA
                  Oh, hey. They re home.  

    Leila and Cindy peer out the curtains at the Carpoolers 
    sitting motionless as in the Cold Opening. 

                                CINDY
                  What are they doing out there?

                                LEILA
                  Oh you know them. Probably talking 
                  about work.  


    Gracen and Dougie enter to the sight of people eating toast. 
    Cindy runs up to Dougie and they embrace - A young couple.  

                                CINDY
                  So, how was carpooling? Anything 
                  interesting happen? 

                                DOUGIE 
                  Nothing really jumps to mind.

                  Then why did I get a call from  
                  someone who found our phone bill in a 
                  tree?

                                DOUGIE 
                  Oh right...I was going to tell you 
                  about it as soon as I got home. 

                                CINDY

                      (to Leila)
                  We re having a toast-party?

                                LEILA  
                  I made an executive decision. I knew 
                  you wouldn t mind...hungry?

    He scoffs at the toaster and spread of jellies and jams.

                                GRACEN
                  Nah, princess. I need something a 
                  little more filling than that.

    Thumbs in belt loops, he strides toward the fridge. 

                                LEILA
                      (under, confused)
                  Princess...?

    Gracen noisily opens the fridge. He grabs some milk and takes 
    a huge gulp straight from the carton.

                                GRACEN
                      (all animal)
                  Now that hits the spot...

                                LEILA
                  You re drinking my almond Lactaid 
                  now?

    Beat. He looks at the carton in horror. He gets an idea: He 
    walks away, leaving the refrigerator door wide open.  

    Shocked looks all round. But then, the fridge door swings shut 
    on it s own with hydraulic precision. The crowd coos.

                                  SUE/DORINDA 
                  Look at that!/What an amazing fridge.

                                LEILA
                  Yeah, it s new. A specialist had to 
                  come from Germany to set it up. It s 
                  kind of expensive, but it s worth it.   

                                DORINDA
                  Maybe we should all start flipping 
                  houses.

    Good-natured laughter. Gracen is thwarted. Leila smiles. A 
      ground-pounding noise comes from outside. People turn to see 
    the family car has now been  pimped out.           CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   20.



                                SUE
                  It s Ted. And look what he s done to 
                  the Taurus!?

    Then, young Rikki walks to the door. Leila opens it. 

                                LEILA
                  Hi there, Rikki.  

                                RIKKI
                  Oh, hi mom. Dad s helping me sell 
                  raffle tickets. 

                                SUE
                  I can see that. 

    Gracen sees a way to make a statement.

                                GRACEN
                  This is on me...I ll take thirty.
                      (pulling out wallet)
                  And how much are they?

                                RIKKI
                  They re twenty dollars each.

                                GRACEN
                  Oh...is that all?
                      (that hurts)
                  Then in that case...I ll need fifty.

                                LEILA
                  Gracen! Isn t that a bit much?

                                GRACEN
                  No, not for me. And, I m sure it s 
                  for a good cause.  

                                RIKKI
                  It s to buy new tennis ball-machines

    As he does, everyone turns to see a melodramatic Marmaduke. 
    He s wearing his pajamas and holding a pillow. He grabs a 
    platter of food then realizes people are staring at him.  

                                MARMADUKE
                  What are you all looking at? Haven t 
                  you ever seen a hungry kid before?

    Marmaduke turns to go back to his room but bumps into Dougie.

                                DOUGIE
                  You re Marmaduke, right?

                                MARMADUKE
                  Yeah.

                                DOUGIE
                  I m Dougie. I carpool with your Dad.  

    Dougie shakes his hand. Marmaduke finds it unnerving.

                                MARMADUKE 
                        (suspiciously)

                                MARMADUKE
                  So am I...I know you. Did you go to 
                  Rosemead High?

                                DOUGIE

                      (to Dougie upset)
                  You think you re so great with your 
                  big job and your pretty wife? I have 
                  a job where I don t wear pants!

                  The job s on the internet.  
                      (off stunned looks)
                  Oh, it s not that kind of job! 

    Marmaduke storms into his room.

                      (aside to Gracen)
                  He s really acting strange. I ll go 
                  talk to him.            CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   22.



                                GRACEN
                  No no no. It takes a man s strong 
                  hand to tame a wild horse.  

    Leila shrugs. She has no idea what to do with either of them.  


    Marmaduke lies face-down on his bed. Gracen enters.

                                GRACEN 
                  Hey. How s it going?  

                                MARMADUKE
                      (glumly)
                  Why you asking me...

                                GRACEN 
                  I heard about the job.

                                MARMADUKE 
                  You heard I lost my job?

                  No, I heard you got a job. I guess I 
                  missed something.  

                                MARMADUKE
                  Dad, it sounded like a dream job. 
                  Five thousand a week for recommending 
                  my favorite music.  

                                GRACEN
                  That does sound like a dream job.  

                                MARMADUKE
                  But then they wanted a  sign up fee  
                  of two thousand dollars. So I gave 
                  them your credit card number and 
                  expiration date. Then they fired me.

                                GRACEN
                  They fired you?

                                MARMADUKE
                  I wonder if it was some sort of scam.  

                                GRACEN 
                  Yeah. It sounds like a scam. Of 
                  course you didn t have a job where 
                  you made more than your old man.          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   23.



                                MARMADUKE
                  Wow. I feel better that it s not my 
                  fault I lost another job.  

                                GRACEN
                  You should feel better.  
                      (has to add)
                  Except for the credit card part... 


    Gracen walks in. People look at him awkwardly.

                                LEILA
                  Your card didn t go through.  

                                GRACEN
                  What? 

                                LEILA
                  They phoned it in. It was declined.  
                  Here, why don t I just get it?

                                EVERYONE

    It s a degrading spectacle as everyone scrounges for money.  

                                LEILA
                  Sweetie, go get my purse.

    Gracen, beaten, goes and grabs LEILA S PURSE.


    Gracen stands at the toilet. He is torn as he contemplates        
    leaving THE TOILET SEAT UP. He turns. There stands Leila.

                                LEILA 
                  Can t decide if you want to pee 
                  standing up or sitting down?

    Flustered he shuts the door on her. It s  on.  She storms off.


    Laird s house is, as advertised, almost empty. The glow from 
    Gracen s toaster illuminates his face. He picks up the phone.  


    A portrait of a modern disconnected family: The house is a 
    cacophony of self-absorbed kids. Aubrey, dressed in his 
    pajamas, picks up after them, cooking, handing out money etc.

                  I m holding down the fort. My wife is 
                  exhausted from watching TV.

    As he turns, we see some over-sized female feet on an ottoman.

    He hangs up. He takes a breath. This is a big moment. Grasping 
    for a plan, he grabs the garbage.

    Dougie and Cindy are asleep in bed. An angelic child sleeps in 
      a bassinet. The phone rings. Dougie answers it.

    Click. Laird hangs up. Dougie is not happy about it.


    Leila walks into the kitchen - preparing for a fight. Leila 
    just misses them as she turns and marches back upstairs.  


    Leila walks into the bedroom and stands over Gracen.

                  And the way you ve been throwing your 
                  money around.

                                LEILA 
                  So what if I ve been buying a few 
                  things? If I have money to spend-

                                GRACEN
                  -Yeah, I know how you have the money.

                  Well, I don t have that much.

                                GRACEN
                  Yes, you do. I know - I saw your 
                  balance.

                  -What are you talking about?! 

                                GRACEN
                  I was jealous...because you make more

                  I know you are and I m proud of

                  I should talk to you before I spend 
                  four hundred dollars on a toaster.

                                GRACEN 
                  Four hundred? I thought you said it 
                  was two hundred.

                                LEILA

                  Uh-uh...

      Countering, he rolls her over and gets on top.  She smiles.


    The guys crawl through the kitchen window. Immediately, they 
    get tangled in the blinds. They hear a noise and freeze. The 
    sound gets closer. The fridge door opens, revealing Marmaduke, 
    dressed only in his underwear. He notices them.

    Without missing a beat, Marmaduke takes two quarts of milk and 
    goes back to bed as though nothing were amiss. Beat. The guys 
    search through the darkened kitchen for the toaster.          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   30.

    Suddenly, the lights flip on. There stands Gracen catching  
    the guys. Dougie holds the toaster. Laird holds a blender.

                  You don t see me...we re here to get

                  willing to break into my house and 
                  rob me, but things with me and Leila 
                  are quite fine. In fact, we re having 
                  a late-night snack because we just 
                  worked up  quite an appetite.

    They freeze. Leila s coming down the stairs. Panic. In the 
    scramble to leave they drop the toaster, breaking it. Leila 
    walks in to see: the broken toaster and the Carpoolers 
    outside, scurrying off and getting doused as the sprinklers go 
    off.  

    Leila rolls her eyes and heads upstairs. A smile crosses 
    Gracen s face. He chases her back to bed triumphantly.
