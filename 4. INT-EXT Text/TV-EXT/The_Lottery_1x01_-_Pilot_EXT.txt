heavy backpack, looking over her shoulder nervously.  She s a 
research scientist and loner by nature, but this is one 
occasion where she could use a few friends.

behind her (the same Ford Fusion from the beginning).

Alison takes a left.  So does the Fusion.  Maybe following?

NAV VOICE
At the next intersection, take a 
right.  

Instead of a right, Alison takes a left...and, behind her, 
the Fusion does the same.   

Just to see what s what, Alison suddenly pulls to the side of 
the street and parks.  The Fusion continues on past.  It 
seems it was just her imagination.

A blizzard buffets a vaulted chalet in the mountains.  Tori,

Secret Service agents.  She is smoking a cigarette.  Pink is

waits for his response.

It s not clear that President Lin is even listening, absorbed 
by the eerily deserted slope passing beneath them.

to ski.  By the time I was three, I 
could go from top to bottom.  This 
mountain used to be filled with 
kids, zipping down.  We were 
fearless.  The world was a given.  


President Lin and Tori finish attaching their skis.  They are 
orbited by ear-budded Secret Servicemen on skis, ever facing 
outwards, listening to voices only they can hear.

So, Tori, tell me something.  If 
this is our moon launch, who is our

President Lin lowers his goggles, plants his poles, and 
launches himself down the slope.  His gravity pulls all the 
Secret Servicemen along with him in a synchronized descent.

Tori is left behind.  She lowers her goggles and journeys 
down the bitter mountain alone.
