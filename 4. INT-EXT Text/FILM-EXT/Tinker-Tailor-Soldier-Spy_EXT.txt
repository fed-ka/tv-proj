Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.
From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we
begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in
volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,
cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG
BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.

LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets
scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man
who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.
ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who
we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The
girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?
A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.
Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into
a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't
Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks
over, shakes hands.
Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked
shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.
Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the
two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the
road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and
sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness
and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of
contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the
corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...

Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA
building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk
up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and
head towards...

Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and
Smiley emerge onto the pavement.
11

CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each
other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands.
Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a
lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see
that he is pained by this.
7.
Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands
forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.
TITLES OVER A MONTAGE

12
THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.
A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through
his retirement.
He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a
straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through
the water.
13
13
Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the
cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little
less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY
SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than
trembling bones.
Is this his world now?
14
19
We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted
into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD.
Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles.

Tracking with the BRIEFCASE as it is carried towards the
house...
24
28
From across the street a tall good-looking man - POLYAKOV -
watches as the opened duct spills a star pattern of light
out into the night air. He walks towards the house...
29
30
Lights glowing in the early morning gloom, an ultra-modern
cube of a building sits in rather traditional grounds. This
is the unlikely home of Oliver Lacon, Permanent under-
secretary.
30A
30A
As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the
living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As
we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN
steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through
the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks
up, surprised.
As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand
behind his back.
And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.
Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON,
tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the
window. On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking.
LACON
(through glass)
This is private property. Who are
you?
He takes in the man before him - filthy and bearded, you
could mistake him for a tramp. But beneath the grime he's
tanned and his eyes have a dangerous, feral edge. This is
RICKI TARR.
RICKI TARR
Minister Lacon.
He smiles.
LACON
What do you want?
RICKI TARR
I want to talk to Control. And I
want breakfast.

Smiley on the steps to his home, stops, examines the door,
removing a WEDGE from the top of the door frame.

Smiley opens the door to PETER GUILLAM.
13.
SMILEY
(Surprised)
Hello, Peter.
They stare at each other. Smiley takes in his expression -
this is not a social call.
SMILEY (CONT'D)
Have I time to change?
Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at
a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to
examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened
letters.
39
43
Smiley and Lacon stand on the terrace alone. Lacon glances
anxiously at Smiley, trying to read him.
LACON
I was sad to see you go, George. I
thought it was shabby, very shabby.
(MORE)
16.
LACON (CONT'D)
But the Minister agreed with Sir
Percy. New broom, clean sweep,
wheat from the chaff and all that.
And to be fair, Percy has had some
marvellous results since you and
Control left...
Realizing how this sounds, he glances at Smiley to see how
much damage he's caused.
LACON (CONT'D)
Anyway, it does mean you're rather
ideally placed to look into this
matter for us now, doesn't it?
Outside the family?
Smiley looks blandly back at him.
SMILEY
I am retired, Oliver.
Silence. Lacon looks uncomfortable, something he hasn't yet
said.
LACON
Thing is, some time back, when
Control was still alive, he came to
me with a similar suggestion.
Smiley looks at him, surprised.
LACON (CONT'D)
He never mentioned his suspicions
to you?
SMILEY
No.
LACON
I just thought... with you being
"his man", so to speak.
SMILEY
What did you say to him?
LACON
(Beat)
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had got the better of him and he
was pulling his own house down.
That does happen in your business.
And that bloody mess in Budapest...
Smiley stares out over the rolling countryside, inscrutable.
LACON (CONT'D)
Damn it, George, this is your
generation, your legacy!
(MORE)
17.
LACON (CONT'D)
If there's any truth in this you'd
think you'd want to...
He controls himself.
SMILEY
(Beat)
I'll keep Peter Guillam. And
there's a retired special branch
man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.
Lacon exhales, his relief palpable.
LACON
Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping.
Good man.
He glances back at Guillam and Lacon's daughter, picking out
a melody on the grand piano.
LACON (CONT'D)
Damn thing cost a fortune. Three
years of lessons and all I hear is
Edelweiss. You and Ann never had
children, did you?
SMILEY
No, we never did.
We hear the piano playing on as we...
44

... driving through suburban DAGENHAM. We pull up in front
of a neat Tudor semi.

CLOSE ON A COLONY OF BEES
GLOVED HANDS loading a COLONY OF BEES into a new HIVE.
An APIARIST, in protective hat and gloves, turns to examine
the MAN who has appeared in his back yard - GEORGE SMILEY.
Smiley raises a hand.
The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat
to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes - INSPECTOR MENDEL.
46
46
Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered
briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to
Smiley and Guillam in the front. He begins to roll a
cigarette as Guillam drives away.
18.
A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz
around the car. Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily.
Smiley stares ahead in silence. He winds down the window
and the bee flies to safety.

Alleline stands on the rooftop, staring out over the London
skyline, his expression ambiguous - perhaps obscurely
troubled to have found himself at the top. He becomes aware
of Roy Bland standing behind him.
ALLELINE
(Without turning)
Roy.
BLAND
It's the Yanks. They want to come
in and talk.
22.
Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows
himself a small smile of triumph - and relief.
ALLELINE
Of course they do. We have
Witchcraft. And they don't.

SMILEY'S P.O.V. - LOOKING DOWN FROM A WINDOW
A ministerial car pulls up and Lacon climbs out.

Lacon stalks out of the hotel.
SMILEY (V.O.)
... Alleline's "special source."
LACON (V.O.)
There is no connection.
He climbs into the waiting car. We catch a glimpse of the
MINISTER in the back.
SMILEY (V.O.)
Everything is connected.
The car drives away.
64
65
Roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the
window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a
battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the
window - driving past.
Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness
of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.
66
66
We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue
Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and
rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring
his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and
menace. There's something odd about the way he moves,
something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of
true...
The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading
bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.
He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him.
Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded
figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.
In his palm, a MARBLE.
LATER:
Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it
rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an
improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the
centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.
Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the
Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...
The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard,
perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some
pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one
side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch
a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to
spread. It's BLOOD.
67
67
Through the window we see Smiley buying a bottle.
30.
68
69
A large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint
sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden.
Smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over-
grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked
"SACHS."
Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a
young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware
of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking
round the house.
SMILEY'S P.O.V.
A group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version
of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming
to the song `Don't' by Doris.
An older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a
prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at
the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks
into a charming smile.
ON SMILEY'S EXPRESSION
This is not a social call. Connie can't keep the
disappointment from her face.
70
76
The house we saw in the title sequence. The air duct opens
on the front of the house, spilling out its star-shape of
light.
After a moment Polyakov walks up to the door and knocks. We
hear the dog barking...
36.
77
84
Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his
odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One -
SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others.
85
86
Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where
Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised
shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.
PRIDEAUX
(After a moment)
Come down here.
Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him.
Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a
little.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
(Identifying him)
Boy with the marble.
ROACH
Yes sir.
PRIDEAUX
Gave me a turn up there, parked
on the horizon. Thought you were
a Juju man. What's your name?
BILL ROACH
Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new
boy.
PRIDEAUX
New arrival, eh? Middle of year?
What's the story?
Roach hesitates.
BILL ROACH
(Blushing)
My mother and father... my
father's left, so...
He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further.
Prideaux pretends not to notice.
PRIDEAUX
Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone
ever call you that?
BILL ROACH
No sir.
PRIDEAUX
Known a lot of Bills. They've all
been good `uns. What you good at?
Roach tries desperately to think of something.
43.
BILL ROACH
Nothing sir.
The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down,
busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.
PRIDEAUX
You're a good watcher though eh?
Us loners always are. No one else
spotted me when I turned up here.
Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as
he's got his specs on. Right?
BILL ROACH
(Gratefully)
Yes sir.
Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach.
PRIDEAUX
Free period, isn't it? Don't
waste it down here.
Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux
has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to
him, rubbing his aching shoulder.
87
87
Smiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining
the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something
more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something
up. A WEDGE.
88
90
Ricki Tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine.
Groomed, smart, that same restless energy. A car pulls up
across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British
spy, not over-bright, signals to him. Tarr pulls his shades
down and saunters over to his ride.
RICKI TARR (O.S.)
I met her in Istanbul. They'd
found some Russian trade
delegate, name of Boris. He was
spending high and wide in the
nightclubs and some idiot thought
we could turn him.
Tarr opens the back seat and gets in. Tufty's slightly
foolish smile slips a little.
90A
92
TARR'S P.O.V. - the HOTEL opposite - a Brutalist concrete
slab, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. In the
bedroom a heavy set man - BORIS - is having sex with a
MAID.
RICKI TARR (V.O.)
I took one look and saw that he
was a hood, Moscow trained.
We TRACK to one side, and see the "drawing room" of the
hotel suite, where Boris' two MINDERS, SERGEI and IVAN,
wait, smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom.
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Probably coat trailing, trying to
draw one of our men out into the
open.
We TRACK further along again and see the CORRIDOR outside
the hotel room, where a YOUNG WOMAN has just arrived. This
is IRINA.
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He had a wife with him. Common-
law.
Irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room, where
the Minders stare fixedly at the floor, trying not to
laugh. She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid
jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris
lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.
Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a
BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and
we lose her as she bends over a basin.
Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he
leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.
Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted
glass and stares straight at us...
93
93
HER P.O.V. -
RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he
should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look.
A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the
road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head
- the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible
BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else,
anger at her humiliation being observed.
47.
94
94
RICKI TARR'S P.O.V.
As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase
and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his
cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he
draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring
our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is
thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along
the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the
billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the
curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.
94A
94A
RICKI'S P.O.V.
Ricki watches the street below as Boris, Sergei and Ivan
exit the hotel, head for a night out.
Tarr pulls on his own jacket, grabs his knife.

Tarr approaches the night club, glancing around quickly
before slipping inside.

Irina is driving, exhilarated, free. Ricki Tarr is on the
back seat, sleeping.

103
109
Tarr threads his way through the crowds of evening shoppers
and tourists, holding in his head the BIGGEST SECRET of his
career. There's something new on his face - AMBITION.
110
110
We're gliding above the respectable front of a Business
OFFICE, through the RECEPTION - which maintains the cover
story of an Import/Export outfit...
...over a back-room and through a STEEL DOOR to the CYPHER
ROOM beyond where we find a drunk TUFTY THESINGER watching
Tarr send a CODED MESSAGE.
TUFTY THESINGER
You were supposed to have gone.
London stations's been on to me.
They want to know what the hell
you're doing.

RICKI TARR
(without turning)
Fuck off.

Tarr stands staring across at Irina's hotel balcony with
binoculars.

BORIS stands looking straight at him. The hint of a mocking
smile. Behind him we can just see SERGEI and IVAN sitting
in the room.

Tarr bolts down an alleyway.

Smiley swims in the placid water. We hear music. The tinkle

Smiley and Guillam sit on a bench. Smiley has his towel,
hair wet from his swim.
PETER GUILLAM
You look tired.
Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an
instinct for secrecy wins out.
SMILEY
Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat)
I want you to get something for
me, Peter. I need the duty
officer's log book for last
November. I'm sorry, but I'm
going to have to send you up a
floor, into the Lion's den.
(Beat) If you have the slightest
reservation...
PETER GUILLAM
Is feeling sick to your stomach a
slight reservation?
SMILEY
If you're caught, Peter, you
can't mention me. I'm sorry, but
you're alone.
Guillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a
moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over.
It's Mendel.
MENDEL
You're clean. Nothing on your
back. Nothing on your conscience.
132
132
A LORRY roars past, wiping frame and revealing Guillam
arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs
up the four steps.
133
136
Mendel sits in his car, watching the garage fore-court. He
looks at his watch.
137
138
Mendel is using the office phone, an ELDERLY GERMAN
MECHANIC, stands outside guarding the office door. In the
background a POP TUNE is playing on the radio.
MENDEL
Can't be done sir, you're going
to need a new gear box.
64.
139
146
Guillam drives down an alleyway full speed, screeches to a
halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past
them and on into the car body repair shop. He gets and
strides past the elderly GERMAN MECHANIC we saw earlier.
MECHANIC
(German, subtitled)
He's waiting for you.
Guillam strides on, nerves at snapping point, to the other
end of the workshop where a Vauxhall waits.
Behind him the Mechanic and his SON are already beginning
to strip the plates off Guillam's car.
147
147
Mendel appears by Guillam's side as they walk towards
another waiting car, Guillam simmering with rage.
MENDEL
(A faint smile)
All go smoothly did it? (Beat)
Where we off to?
PETER GUILLAM
The hotel. I have to see George.
MENDEL
Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel,
sir. Change of venue.
148
149
Smiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel. They sit,
in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing
building.
PETER GUILLAM
Why didn't you tell me? That you
had Tarr?
Smiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly.
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
In case I didn't make it out of
the Circus...
SMILEY
Secrecy is a habit.
Guillam rubs his eyes.
PETER GUILLAM
I should get some rest. And I
suppose you should get your
reading done.
Smiley nods. Doesn't move.
150
152
Prideaux's BLUE ALVIS bumps and jolts towards us across the
playing fields, an exhilarated ROACH at the wheel.
ROACH
(Braking)
Time sir?
Prideaux and the rest of the class stand at the "finishing
line," but Prideaux is staring down to a line of beech-
trees, where a MAN is walking. It's MENDEL.
PRIDEAUX
(Quietly)
Got your specs on Jumbo?
ROACH
Yes, sir.
PRIDEAUX
Who's the fellow down there?
Roach stares at the stranger eagerly.
ROACH
(Disappointed)
Don't know sir.
PRIDEAUX
Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why
doesn't he look this way?
(MORE)
76.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
Wouldn't you look if you saw a
bunch of boys flogging a car
around a field? Doesn't he like
boys? Anyone sees him again, let
me know. Don't hold with odd bods
hanging about. Might steal the
Alvis, which is...?
CLASS
(By rote)
Best car in England!
They dissolve into laughter, but Roach is still anxiously
watching Prideaux, noting how his expression has darkened.

girls for a while, matter of
fact.
156
168
A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls
alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other,
chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to
move.
An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger
in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of
passenger outrage.
We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.
We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street,
driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.

Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very
still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the
surface, dips in, breaks the surface...
170
170
Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off
from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD
appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An
old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings
to the edge of the platform for a moment.
OLD MAN
Just in case it's of interest,
dear. We are observed. Old Filth
in the bushes. Not very subtle
but there you are...
83.
He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the
trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley,
watched and alone.

Nobody you need concern yourself
with. An unfortunate...
REVERSE - we see Guillam and Smiley are sitting in the
parked car in the rain.
SMILEY (CONT'D)
He said when he got out, when he
was being debriefed at the
Nursery, he had a visitor.
PETER GUILLAM
Who?
SMILEY
Toby Esterhase.

crossing the grounds towards him - TOBY ESTERHASE. A man
who's come up in the world.
195

SMILEY
He gave him a thousand pounds.
Told him he was dead now and
couldn't come back. Had to become
a Lotus Eater - forget everything
that happened - Control's theory,
Tinker, Tailor... all of it.
Guillam stares at him, ALERT.
SMILEY (CONT'D)
Yes, that's what I thought. How
on earth did Esterhase hear about
"Tinker, Tailor?"
196
196
Smiley gets out of the car, into the rain. Looks around
him, uneasy.
PETER GUILLAM
You alright?
SMILEY
Will you watch my back, Peter?
Look out for a solo. Just a
feeling I've had.
PETER GUILLAM
Yes, George. I'll watch.
Guillam watches as Smiley heads off into the gloom.

Guillam is driving. The radio is on. The car pulls up on

Nobody speaks. Esterhase sits stiff, mind-whirring,
uncomfortably aware of Fawn's unsettling presence behind
him.

TRACKING SHOT - PUSHING ESTERHASE
... as he stumbles through the muddy airfield. A vast,
empty space all around. Toby starts to turn, but...
SMILEY (O.S.)
Keep walking please.
Toby stumbles on.
SMILEY (CONT'D)
I want to talk about loyalty
Toby. Control recruited you when
you were trying to escape from
Hungary didn't he? A wanted man.
Saved you from a KGB bullet,
didn't he? And yet, when the time
came, when it came to picking
sides between him and Alleline,
you didn't hesitate?
Understandable perhaps, with your
war experience. You've survived
this long, I suppose, because of
your ability to change sides,
serve any Master?
Faintly we hear the low drone of an approaching engine.
Esterhase scans the horizon, locks on the black speck in the
sky - an aircraft flying towards them. Esterhase watches the
approach with mounting anxiety.
TOBY ESTERHASE
What... what's this about George?
SMILEY
It's about which Master you've
been serving, Toby.
205
206
... as he and Guillam drive Esterhase on.
SMILEY
Intelligence has been leaked,
Toby. Someone's been taking files
from the Circus...
99.
207
208
... eyes fixed on the plane as it roars down towards them.
TOBY ESTERHASE
This is a mistake George, this is
all...
SMILEY
The files were delivered to a
Russian attache, weren't they?
209
210
TOBY ESTERHASE
Yes. And yes, I delivered them.
211
211
Alleline getting out of the cab by the railings... the dog
barking from inside the house...
TOBY ESTERHASE (V.O.)
... but so did Percy...
211A
212
Esterhase can't tear his eyes away from the propeller plane
descending onto the runway ahead of them.
TOBY ESTERHASE
Things aren't always what they
seem. You know that George.
Moscow thinks Polyakov's working
for them, so, every now and then
we give him the odd file to take
back to them, just chicken-feed,
keep his bosses happy. But
Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big
operation...
SMILEY
Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I
know.
Esterhase stops, turns to look at Smiley.
TOBY ESTERHASE
Why are we here? Why are we...?
Guillam gives him a sudden VIOLENT SHOVE in the back.
Esterhase straightens himself, runs a palm through his
hair, real fear on his face now.
TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D)
I don't... I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this George!
SMILEY
Who gave you the message for Jim
to forget about Tinker Tailor?
TOBY ESTERHASE
Bland!
SMILEY
To get rid of Connie Sachs?
Westerby?
TOBY ESTERHASE
Bland or Haydon. I don't
remember. One of them. Maybe
Percy. I don't know who.
SMILEY
You're just the messenger?
Running between them all.
Anything to serve Witchcraft?
Esterhase flinches again.
101.
SMILEY (CONT'D)
I know all about your secret
source. And I know something you
don't. I know who he is.(Beat)
He's Karla.
Esterhase turns to look at them in horror. Guillam pushes
him again. The plane has taxied to a halt ahead of them.
Unmarked. Something sinister about it.
213

... standing on the airfield.
TOBY ESTERHASE
I didn't know. I swear I...
SMILEY
Are you still a wanted man, Toby?
Toby looks back at the plane, almost hysterical.
TOBY ESTERHASE
George...!
SMILEY
You picked the wrong side, Toby.
TOBY ESTERHASE
(crying)
George, you've got to believe me. I
would never... I'm loyal, George.
I'm loyal!
Smiley watches him cry for a moment, his face impassive.
102.
SMILEY
Give me the address. Where do you
meet Polyakov?
217
217
A terrace of flat-fronted nineteenth century houses one of
them the house we have already visited.
A CAR draws up before one of them and Smiley, Fawn and
Guillam get out and head for the front door.
218
221
Establishing shot of a street in Paris.
A squat Yorkshireman - MACKELVORE - walks out of a nearby
restaurant and gets into a car.
Out of nowhere Tarr suddenly appears, climbing into the
passenger side, ramming a gun into his side.
222
227
Guillam, waits on the tow-path looking back at the house.
Someone, presumably Smiley, is moving through the house,
turning the lights off until it is in complete darkness.
MENDEL (O.S.)
Tailor...
A torch light flashes once from a downstairs window.
MENDEL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Here comes Soldier...
228
234
Guillam, nerves taut, sees three long flashes. The mole is
coming.
235
235
A long silent look at the dark house. Then the star of
light spilling into the darkness from the air vent.
236
238
Guillam waits. He turns, his nerves taut, searching the
shadows for movement. For a moment he's certain he's being
WATCHED.
Then, from the house, the signal he's been waiting for.
Three long flashes. Guillam starts to run.
239
239
A nervous Lacon is waiting on a corner, Guillam runs past.
PETER GUILLAM
He's here.
OLIVER LACON
I won't have bloodshed. I want
absolute calm!
A cab appears and Mendel jumps out. Mendel and Lacon hurry
towards the house, Guillam sprinting ahead.
240
241
109.
GUILLAM'S P.O.V.
Racing towards the FRONT DOOR and bursting through, into
the hallway and on up the stairs, taking them three at a
time, bursting through into...
242
243
Nissan huts surround a cricket field. Two cadets run laps.
Smiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline
walks out. Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him.
With a nod he walks on.
244
244
An unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt
building in a small fenced enclosure. We see Smiley walking
towards him. He's brought a box of cigarettes.
245
247
George comes up his path, looking old and tired.
248
254
The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the
circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the
dark.
Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by.
He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something,
turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind
him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each
other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.
We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only
sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.
Finally...
BILL HAYDON
(Of the runners)
Just like us Jim. (Beat) Best
days.
114.
A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same
execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force
blowing him sideways out of the frame.
As the music continues we...
CUT TO:
255
255
Frost on the grass. We find a CADET staring down at the
corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench,
outlined in silver frost.
The music ends.
256
257
Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot-
scrape made in woodwork.
ROACH
I made you something.
Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.
PRIDEAUX
I don't want you hanging around
here. Keep away from me from now
on. Go and join the others.
Roach stands frozen.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
Just bloody join in. Go and play
damn you.
He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand
mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to
kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.
257aA
257aA
Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a
cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in
the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a
moment it looks like Irina.
115.
Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares
after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again.
257A
257A
Smiley walks back into the lobby, hesitates for a moment,
then pushes on through the turnstile.
