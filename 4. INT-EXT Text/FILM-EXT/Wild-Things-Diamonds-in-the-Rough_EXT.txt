Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds
fluttering skywards...
CREDITS appear over...
ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through
the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm
themselves in the early morning sun...
MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS
stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant
waters in their deafening AIRBOATS...
Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
03/22/2004
2.
Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
Bay High School.
The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full
swing...
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Blue Bay High School would like to
welcome all participating diving teams
from the tri-county region...
Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their
school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white
bathing suit.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
First up, district champion Marie
Clifford...
The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder...
JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
row of the bleachers...
JAY
C'mon now baby, you can do it...
Marie just rolls her eyes.
JENNY
Your stepfather's just got a lot invested
in the team.
Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices
the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him...
JAY
(to Marie)
Just try to keep those legs together.
ELENA (O.S.)
Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen
Virgin.
03/22/2004
8.
Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
the world's hottest towel girl...
JAY
Excuse me?
ELENA
You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in
Clifford construction?
JAY
I am, yes, but...
ELENA
I'd love to see one of your erections...
Whoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the
platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
the air.
It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
her teammates before crossing to Jay.
JAY
Nice take off, gotta work on the
landing...
MARIE
I can't do any better...
Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.
JAY
No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.
Only better...
Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As
she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel...
ELENA
Bet you choke.
Stops Marie in her tracks.
MARIE
What's your major malfunction?
ELENA
Just wanted to make a wager. Between best
friends.
9.
Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.
ELENA
You blow this dive, I get those diamonds
of yours.
Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
ladder, shakes her head...
MARIE
How'd you know about my inheritance?
ELENA
Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's
the day, right?
MARIE
And what, pray tell, are you willing to
wager when I win?
Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile.
ELENA
I'll stay away from your stepfather. You
make it, I won't be your new stepmom
anytime soon. Whattya say?
Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.
MARIE
Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind...
ELENA
Choke!
Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on
the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below,
walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him...
Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
looming beyond...
She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
03/22/2004
10.
She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking
beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.
And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help
but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...
Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion...
Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non-
alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...
Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs
and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
J
ENNY
What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that
one judge only gave you a 9.7?
Marie forces a smile.
MARIE
Nah. I'm cool.
JENNY
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.
You got diamonds on the mind.
JAY (O.S.)
Have either of you seen my video camera?
Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a
bemused look to Jay's face.
JAY
I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against
it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...
JAY
Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass
to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
Everyone raises their fine crystal.
H
03/22/2004
11.
JAY
She's become every inch of the woman her
Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is
now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
Tears well in Marie's eyes...
JAY
And that's why, on your eighteenth
birthday, Marie, I know your mother
wanted you to have...
He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN
standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's
instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words...
JAY
... she wanted you to have... a wonderful
birthday party surrounded by all your
friends.
e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...
JAY
Please excuse me.
... and hurries after them.
Marie is left dumbfounded. So close,
but so far...
MARIE
Jay! What about my present?
She chases after him...
Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a
daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne.
Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost
sheep with open arms.
JENNY
So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue
Bay's richest bitch?
Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine.
All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake.
nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.
JENNY
Holy shit, who invited her?
Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a
screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate
partycrasher...
MARIE
This is a private party...
ELENA
Don't mind me. I ain't here for your
stupid party.
She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at
the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.
MARIE
Get the hell outta here! NOW!
Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her
back. There's a tense moment before...
03/22/2004
14.
ELENA
Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
MARIE
Stay away from my stepfather!
ELENA
Make me...
And that's it. Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. Connects on
Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. But it's ignited the street
fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming
into Marie and together they tumble to the ground...
T
he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled
and aroused. It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing
wrestling match, no holds barred. The drunken Marie has the upper
hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
JAY (O.S.)
What the hell's going on here?
And that stops the fight right there and then. Marie looks up to
see a red faced Jay standing over her.
MARIE
This...trash is just looking for a meal
ticket...
Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.
ELENA
Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little
Marie now, huh?
He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.
JAY
Party's over.
Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up.
MARIE
But...what about...my present...
Jay's already walking away.
JAY
I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off,
whydontcha?
Elena watches Jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey...
03/22/2004
15.
Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site, on
prime beachfront real estate. These places would sell for
millions, if they were ever finished...
- NIGHT
A drunken Marie brings her BMW to a swerving halt outside the
construction site. She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on
the passenger seat for dutch courage...
MARIE
(sotto)
It's present time.
She reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short. When she
looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own...
Elena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls
lock eyes. There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a
satisfied smile and walks away...
MARIE
What the hell...
Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of
the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
JAY
What are you doing here at this time of
night?
Marie stammers to find the words...
MARIE
I just...wanted to apologize for my
behavior earlier. I was out of line.
Jay's mood lightens.
JAY
When we admit our mistakes we grow.
You've made an important step.
MARIE
So...what about my present?
JAY
Meet me at the Museum. Before school
tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep,
I'm gonna finish up here...
03/22/2004
18.
He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
FADE TO BLACK:
Jay leads Marie down the stone steps outside the quaint Museum
building. But as they approach his car they're hit by...BLUE and
RED FLASHING LIGHTS.
The whine of sirens has Jay spinning around in surprise, looking
over to see four Police Cruisers come to a screeching halt...
MARIE
What the hell?
Half a dozen of Blue Bay's finest, lead by the dashing young
OFFICER ENTWISTLE, draw their badges, approach Jay.
OFFICER ENTWISTLE
Mr. Clifford?
JAY
Can I help you, Officer?
OFFICER ENTWISTLE
You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.
Jay's jaw drops to the ground.
JAY
There must be some mistake, this isn't
possible...
MARIE
Jay, what's going on?
Entwistle puts a powerful hand on Jay, leads him to the first
Police cruiser.
J
AY
Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down
the station. This is outrageous...
Entwistle gets into the Police car's passenger seat.
03/22/2004
20.
JAY
I didn't do anything, I swear.
OFFICER ENTWISTLE
I'm afraid she's got a different story.
JAY
Who's 'she'?
Police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building
site. Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph
every inch of the building...
Standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr. Barajas,
accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz. They are both on CELLPHONES,
both talking angry, fast Spanish.
03/22/2004
24.
FLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the
steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle
of sound bite hungry pressmen...
REPORTER 1
Any comment, Mr. Clifford?
Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses. He disappears
quickly into the shelter of the courthouse.
REPORTER 2
(to Marie)
Did your stepfather rape that girl? How
could he do something like that?
Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng
of reporters...
MARIE
Jay...is innocent...
Says it like she means it...
The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the
smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
Marie steps back up onto the high diving platform. Tries to focus.
Slides the soon-to-be-diamond ring off her finger and throws it
tentatively into the water...
She takes a breath and then dives, straight and true, into the
perfect blue water below.
Marie's lithe, taught body comes arcing through the water, darting
down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring...
Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the
pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an
electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg.
03/22/2004
32.
ELENA
Nice take off. Gotta work on the
landing...
Marie's blood boils.
MARIE
What the hell are you doing here?
Elena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring.
ELENA
Looks like your bling ain't blinging...
MARIE
Give me that back. It was my Mother's...
Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...
ELENA
Looks like she got ripped off Princess,
where's the rock?
Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
MARIE
Is that what this is all about?
Elena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face.
She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her...
ELENA
You're not a dumb as you look...
J
enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out
of the locker room and see the two arch-enemies confronting each
other.
JENNY
(to her team mates)
We got trouble...
Elena won't back down.
MARIE
You're ruining my life, and my
stepfather's.
ELENA
It can end. Just like that.
She snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears...
03/22/2004
33.
Jenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind
Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate...
MARIE
Why are you doing this?
ELENA
Because I can.
As she turns and walks away...
ELENA (CONT'D)
Good luck in court.
Theo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to
the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR'
trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting
trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the
mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car...
A blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round,
squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer
doorway...
E
LENA
Well, well, well. Look what the cat
dragged in...
(to Theo)
DA know you're here?
Theo squirms...
MARIE
We need to talk.
ELENA
So talk.
THEO
Somewhere private, maybe?
03/22/2004
39.
Kristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than-
welcoming trailer. She knocks.
KRISTEN
Elena. Open up.
03/22/2004
44.
No answer. She tries the door handle. It's unlocked. She takes a
deep breath, steps inside.
Morrison's unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside Kristen's car,
and the harried Detective steps out, looking extremely unhappy.
MORRISON
This couldn't wait 'til morning, Miss
Richards?
KRISTEN
Call me Kristen...
MORRISON
The Feds just arrived to take over the
Black Widow case, I'm up to my knees in
paperwork...
K
RISTEN
You remember what Elena said, right at
the end of the trial. "You won't
remember..."
MORRISON
(finishing)
"...but you'll never forget." What about
it?
KRISTEN
Elena's fucking with us.
03/22/2004
46.
The early morning sun illuminates a massive slab of windowless
concrete surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of nowhere...
Elena's airboat blasts through the reeds out into the middle of
nowhere. She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the
moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE
marked "BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY", looks them over
one last time...
ELENA
Later potato...
And tosses them into the mire, where they're soon gobbled by
ravenous Gators...
Elena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the
trailer park, stomps over to her trailer, when she sees...
Two sets of tire tracks in the mud.
The diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to
practice. Lagging behind is Marie. She's about to catch up when
she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena.
MARIE
What the...If anyone sees us together...
03/22/2004
50.
ELENA
What choice did I have? We got big
problems...
Before anyone can see them, Marie pulls her away, to the outdoor
shower area, out of sight from her teammates. She turns on all
the shower heads.
MARIE
Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's
listening. Now what's the 411?
ELENA
I...I think I fucked up...
Marie gently takes a hold of Elena's face.
MARIE
How?
ELENA
I don't know for sure...but I think that
bitch Parole officer's made me...she was
at my trailer last night...
Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
MARIE
No bigee. You disposed of everything,
right? The teeth, the video, all the
research...
Elena can't fess up. Not now...
ELENA
I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.
Wants to see me back in Juvie...
Marie kisses her softly on the forehead. Her cheek.
MARIE
I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I
promise.
Elena's damp tank top clings to her perfect body.
ELENA
I just want outta here.
Marie brushes a strand of hair away from Elena's face.
03/22/2004
51.
MARIE
Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator,
have him prepare the funds to buy back
the diamonds...
ELENA
Then we're outta here, right?
A mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips...
MARIE
Just sit back, relax, enjoy the
trip...Don't forget to come again.
T
heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...
Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's
lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until...
Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the
soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...
Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool. She places the ring onto
the deck, pulls herself out of the water.
She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with
Kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers...
MARIE
Can I help you?
KRISTEN
I was wondering if I could have a moment
of your time. Ask a couple questions.
Marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of
the diving team go about their workout.
MARIE
I'm in the middle of practice...
KRISTEN
It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might
even help Jay. Remember your loving
stepfather? You want to help him, don't
you?
MARIE
Of course.
03/22/2004
52.
Kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures...
KRISTEN
Why'd you agree to part with your
diamonds?
This time Marie can't hide her shock.
MARIE
How...
KRISTEN
Jay told me. But why? They were your
inheritance.
MARIE
Jay needed help. We're a team.
KRISTEN
Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You
must've been pretty unhappy when Jay
didn't give you those diamonds for your
birthday.
M
Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
MARIE
He said I wasn't ready.
KRISTEN
You're 18. That's heiress payday, no?
Must've crossed your mind that Jay might
never let you have them...
MARIE
No, of course not.
She's a bad liar.
KRISTEN
And then this little scam artist saunters
in and just takes them. With your help,
no less.
Kristen moves in for the kill.
KRISTEN
But what I don't get is, why wouldn't
Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name?
After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.
MARIE
How should I know?
03/22/2004
53.
Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the
ring against the back of her hand. Hard. Winces, then...
KRISTEN
I mean, the only way I can make sense of
it is if somehow getting Jay released
from prison would spoil the plan.
MARIE
What plan?
She hands the ring back to Marie. Not so lucky anymore...
KRISTEN
You tell me...
I
The blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon, the still water
of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds...
Elena sits out on her idling airboat, in the midst of the
sawgrass, smoking. The peace is shattered by her ringing
CELLPHONE.
ELENA
Yello...
Elena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her.
ELENA
ell me you're kidding...
MARIE (V.O.)
Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the
diamonds!
Elena lets out an anguished wail.
MARIE (V.O.)
Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as
it is.
ELENA
We've gotta stop him.
03/22/2004
58.
The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass,
speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly
maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair...
Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs
down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every
hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then
cuts back into the trees.
C
had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the
trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it?
The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst
fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT,
fighting to keep up...
ELENA
Pull over!
Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the
reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's
car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed
through...
Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand...
ELENA
(sternly)
We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We
just get the diamonds back...
MARIE
I
'm not gonna hurt him. No way...
Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road...
MARIE
I'm gonna kill him.
Elena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the
trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road...
ELENA
Marie! Don't do this...
She hears a scream, a girl's scream...
ELENA
Marie!
Elena sprints into the thick of the trees...
03/22/2004
60.
Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at
the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a
Christmas present.
Her piercing screams force Elena to come running...
ELENA
You okay?
Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...
MARIE
No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
She points to the front seat of the crashed car...
Elena can barely bring herself to look inside. Marie shoves her in
the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door. Elena
gasps when she looks inside the car. Chad's not there.
03/22/2004
61.
MARIE
He bolted...
Marie clambers up the wreckage of the car, stands on the roof. She
M
surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...
MARIE
With the diamonds.
Elena runs full pelt after Marie, through dense swampland, the
plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red...
03/22/2004
62.
MARIE
Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you
little weasel!
She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of
the ashen tree trunks...
MARIE
Gotcha...
She races off in hot pursuit. Elena's about to follow when she
notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet...
ELENA
This can't be happening...
Marie slows, looks back to Elena.
MARIE
What now?
ELENA
I'm more than five miles away from the
Police station. I go beyond five miles
and the alarm goes off...
Marie snarls...
MARIE
You telling me your Parole Officer knows
you're out here?
Elena can barely speak...
ELENA
She knows...
Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his
brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
swirl in the stagnant waters...
Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve
energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh.
Not far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they
notice the blood in the water.
03/22/2004
63.
The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland. Elena steps
into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
ELENA
Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or
she'll find us here...
A splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls...
MARIE
You hear that?
The sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left.
MARIE
You go that way...
Marie heads off in the opposite direction. Elena hesitates, wants
to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped
by canopy of trees...
Elena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the
horizon for any sign of Chad...
ELENA
(sotto)
Please...
A rustling sound stops her in her tracks. Dead silence, until...
A HAND GRABS HER LEG, AROUND THE FLASHING ANKLE BRACELET, DRAGS
HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP...
Marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire
iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter...
MARIE
(calling out to Elena)
You see him?
03/22/2004
64.
No reply, just her own voice echoing back...
MARIE
Elena?
She rolls her eyes.
MARIE
Useless bitch...
Kristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road.
Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for
breath. Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his
life depends on it. It does...
He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a
glance of the circling GATORS...
Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp,
climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
ground...
Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water.
The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...
CHAD
Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense
you in the water, they'll rip you to
pieces...
Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the
surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
ELENA
Hel..help me...
She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away...
H
e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing
her trembling hand. Just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop
of blood out of the open wounds on his palm...
The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena...
65.
CHAD
No.
And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...
WHACK!
Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose,
ears and mouth. He falls forward, stiff as a board, and SPLASHES
down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena. Behind him stands
Marie, the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand...
Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water. She
collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...
MARIE
What are you doing? Our diamonds are
about to become dinner...
Elena can't move, leaving Marie to wade into the swamp...
Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed. She
checks the GPS scanner. It doesn't show her which way to turn...
KRISTEN
Which way, which way...
Split second decision. Left. She spins the wheel, takes the left
hand fork...
Bad choice. Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
BMW, an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild,
wild things...
Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse
out of the trees. Marie drops the body, heads straight for her
abandoned BMW. Elena follows, stumbling through the vines, her
clothes dripping wet, shivering more from nerves than cold...
M
MARIE
Get rid of the body. And his car...
ELENA
Where are you going?
MARIE
Where do you think?
66.
ELENA
I don't...I don't have a clue...
Marie spins round, a vicious look in her eyes. She holds the blood
soaked diamonds in her hand...
MARIE
Chad made us an appointment to sell
these. I'm gonna keep it...
Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet...
ELENA
It's only a matter of time before my
Parole Officer finds me...
Marie turns back around, flings open the BMW door and gets in.
MARIE
Then I suggest you get to work...
She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust,
leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...
Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed
car. The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over
the dense thicket of overhanging trees.
ELENA
(sotto)
Jesus...
With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chad's inert body
into the driver's seat. She stumbles back, horrified at the grim
tableau before her...
Marie's car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone
Museum building.
With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car.
She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around
inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground...
She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty
feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match...
She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in
fear...
Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the
swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until,
finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
smoulders out...
ELENA
Don't do this to me, please...
03/22/2004
68.
In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately
for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight
slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her.
Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove
compartment.
ELENA
You gotta have a lighter or some...
She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT!
Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's
heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the
steering wheel.
ELENA
Jesus...
She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the
horn...
S
ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks
over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the
driver's side door...
ELENA
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...
Not as sorry as she's going to be...
The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to
smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES!
The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the
ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of
gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...
INSIDE THE CAR
Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side
door LOCKED...
She tries the handle. Tries it again. Desperately yanks it. Not
opening, no sir...
Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock...
OUTSIDE THE CAR
The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and...WHOOSH!
INSIDE THE CAR
Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of FLAMES
CRACKLING. Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of
FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in!
She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to
reach the door lock. Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable
to pull it up.
THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet
away...
Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station...
The Blue Bay High pool is illuminated in the dead of night,
casting blue ripples over the bleachers where Elena waits
nervously. She can't help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath
her shirt...
ELENA
(whispering)
Can you hear me?
Elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape
pulls her delicate skin.
ELENA
I..don't think I can do this...
MARIE (O.S.)
It's already done.
Elena looks up guiltily. Marie is standing by the side of the
pool. How much did she see?
MARIE
So?
The word's stick in Elena's throat...
ELENA
I had no choice...
MARIE
Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead.
Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it
out.
ELENA
Jay's got cash. At the building site. I
saw it.
Marie rolls her eyes.
MARIE
That's your brilliant plan? It's in a
safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have
you got magic fingers, gonna pick that
lock? I don't think so. Next.
Elena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie.
ELENA
Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him
we'll come clean, tell the police
everything, if he gives us the
combination. I'm still a minor, they'll
send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do
that time standing on my head...
Marie's wavering.
MARIE
How much money?
Elena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips.
ELENA
Enough for you and me.
Grinds against her. Slowly, sensually.
MARIE
We don't have to tell the cops anything.
We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.
ELENA
But, we got rid of the real one...
MARIE
I kept a copy. Never trusted you
backstabbers.
Elena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their
faces are inches apart.
MARIE
You're trembling.
There's no denying it. Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's
face, down her neck, to her chest. So close to the wire. Finally
places her palm over Elena's heart...
ELENA
Marie, I...
MARIE
Ssshhhh...
BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
03/22/2004
78.
Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity,
unblinking...
B
OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
Finally Marie smiles...
MARIE
Alright. Let's do it...
Marie's BMW flies down the deserted Blue Bay streets, blasting
through red lights.
Marie's BMW screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and
Marie strides towards the construction site entrance.
Elena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick. She circuitously
adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into
the dark, unfinished building
Morrison brings his clunky Police sedan to a halt around the back
of the building site.
I
The new crime scene is alive with activity. Cops, reporters,
bystanders. Morrison sips coffee as PARAMEDICS wheel Marie's
corpse to the ambulance.
One of them hands something to Morrison. A blood-splattered
digital video tape.
PARAMEDIC
We found this on the body.
Morrison takes it without a word...
KRISTEN (O.S.)
Just got off the phone with the Parole
board...
Morrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly
shaken.
K
03/22/2004
86.
KRISTEN
They want me to bring Elena back to Miami
in the morning.
She hesitates...
KRISTEN
I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
Morrison considers this, picks his words carefully.
MORRISON
Don't be. It was my gun that fired the
shots, so it must've been me who pulled
the trigger. I'll take the credit on this
one. After all the Black widow crap I had
to put up with, I've earnt it...
Kristen nods.
KRISTEN
You did the right thing...
MORRISON
We did the right thing.
risten smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the
Detective. He closes his eyes, savors the moment. As she pulls
away, she hands him a card.
K
RISTEN
You call me, promise?
Morrison beams.
MORRISON
I will. I will.
KRISTEN
Now that this is all over, maybe we can
have that drink soon...
She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. Morrison watches her
walk away. In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's
probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay.
FADE TO BLACK.
Morrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of
the County Jail. The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay
Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.
03/22/2004
87.
Morrison gets out of the car, meets Jay.
MORRISON
How you holdin' up, Jay?
JAY
Been better.
He sure has.
MORRISON
So what's next?
JAY
No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed.
Guess there's nowhere to go but up.
It's all he can do to keep from breaking down.
MORRISON
I can't help but feel partially
responsible. If there's anything I...
Jay shakes his head.
JAY
I don't think so, but thanks.
MORRISON
Can I at least give you a ride somewhere?
JAY
Ain't got nowhere to go...
Morrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to
nowhere in particular.
MORRISON
(hopeful)
... but up, right?
No reply.
The Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches
into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card. He
can't resist. Dials the number After four rings there's no
message. Just a BEEP.
MORRISON
(into phone)
Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't
heard from you. Hope you're doing okay.
Everything's fine here.
03/22/2004
88.
MORRISON(CONT'D)
Haven't been any questions asked that I
can't answer, an' no one's brought your
name up. So give me a call back and maybe
we can go for that drink...
H
e's cut off by...
RECORDED VOICE
BEEP. The mail box you are trying to
reach is full. Your message has been
deleted.
Morrison's disconnected. Puzzled, he gets into his car.
Soft waves lap against a pristine beach. Palm trees sway in the
warm breeze. A steady WHIRRING is the only sound that disturbs the
serenity. Is it a lawn mower? A leaf blower?
There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this
idyllic scene. The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical
Caribbean Sunlight.
And stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none
other than Kristen Richards, soaking up rays.
At her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a pia
colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK
WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink...
Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching
bikini.
KRISTEN
I can't believe Morrison just handed me
the key to the evidence locker...
A broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the
contents of a velvet pouch onto a table.
T
he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.
KRISTEN
These are...genuine?
Elena nods.
03/22/2004
91.
ELENA
Nothin' like the real thing. Switched
'em for the fakes right after Marie tried
to pay me off...
KRISTEN
They're...So beautiful.
Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen.
ELENA
The mother.
Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena.
KRISTEN
The daughter.
Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas
and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood...
MR. BARAJAS
Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!
Morrison stops, regards Barajas...
MORRISON
What did you say?
CICATRIZ
The foundation is sinking. The entire
site is a sink hole. It's completely
worthless.
MR. BARAJAS
I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...
MORRISON
You and me both...
Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the
sun, when a voice rouses them...
JAY (O.S.)
Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do
that to a friend. Especially one going
through such a nasty divorce.
They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of
colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...
JAY
Told me he'd never trust another woman as
long as he lived. And then along came a
spider...
KRISTEN
A black widow.
Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.
03/22/2004
93.
JAY
More like widows... Gotta say I was a
little taken aback when you wanted to
snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over
the bitch...
Elena suddenly gets to her feet.
ELENA
You want me to top you off?
JAY
That'd be fine, just fine.
He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly.
When they break...
JAY
She's got a good head on her shoulders.
Kristen doesn't reply. Just smiles, watches Elena over by the
outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...
JAY
You two got me out of a mountain of shit,
I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn
scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you
played it perfectly.
KRISTEN
My job was easy. It was Elena who had to
keep it all together...
ELENA (O.S.)
We've had some practice along the way...
Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
ELENA
Here you go, Mr. Clifford.
Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off
to the swimming pool.
JAY
Well, all that nasty business, it's
behind us. Forever. From here on out,
it's the good life.
He starts to climb the high dive. When he gets to the top, he
looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
03/22/2004
94.
JAY
You two look so good, it's difficult to
tell which one's the mother and which
one's the daughter...
Kristen calls back up at him.
KRISTEN
That's just the roofies talking...
Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the
sinister implications...
JAY
What did you say?
His eyes are blood shot. He starts to sway atop the high dive.
KRISTEN
Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party.
I'd never really tasted cocktails like
that.
Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...
JAY
I don't...whattya talking about?
KRISTEN
It was like being awake though an
operation. I could feel everything
happening, but I couldn't do anything to
stop it...
JAY
Oh...shit...
KRISTEN
You took something from me that night.
But you left something behind...
Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena.
KRISTEN
Your daughter...
He can't quite get his mind around it. Everything's becoming
blurry.
JAY
I don't remember...
03/22/2004
95.
He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before
it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below,
shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
E
lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.
KRISTEN
You may not remember...
A broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes...
ELENA
...But you'll never forget.
Jay tries to take a step forward. He stumbles. Tries in vain to
regain his balance. It's too late. He falls. 20 feet to the
unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with
vegetable soup...
ELENA
Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.
They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its
precious blood into the ice blue pool...
KRISTEN
Let's go get our money.
They gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson
red...
THE END
As the credits roll....
Elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. The getaway
driver...Kristen, of course...
ELENA
I can't believe we just gave up all that
cash.
KRISTEN
Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got
an angle on our real prey.
ELENA
We goin' to Blue Bay?
KRISTEN
He won't know what hit him.
A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...
ELENA
'bout time...
And the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet
of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank.
Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach
when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their
sizzling bodies.
KRISTEN
You're blocking our sun...
Looks over her sunglasses at...Uncle Marty...Only all cleaned up,
in a pair of Bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs...
He clutches a briefcase...
UNCLE MARTY
Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best
ever if I might be so bold...
KRISTEN
This is our biggest score. You sure you
can move it?
UNCLE MARTY
Not a problem.
Kristen nods to the briefcase in Uncle Marty's hand.
KRISTEN
Let's see the green...
Uncle Marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing
stacks of cash...
UNCLE MARTY
Got another lead, if you're interested.
Was just up in Boston, surveying a
mansion that's just been sold.
03/22/2004
100.
UNCLE MARTY(CONT'D)
Termites already eaten most of it.
Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be
an angle for the Black Widows...
Kristen and Elena look to each other.
KRISTEN
It's over. We had a good run.
Uncle Marty shrugs.
UNCLE MARTY
Shame. Guess all good things come to an
end. So, the diamonds...
Elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand. Hands them
over and is about to take the case of money when...
UNCLE MARTY
How do I know these are the real thing?
Elena looks to Kristen. They smile.
ELENA
You're going to have to trust us...
Like fuck.
THE END. AGAIN.
