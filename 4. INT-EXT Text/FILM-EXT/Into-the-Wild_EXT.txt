Tuesday, April 28th 1992
WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits
beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in
North America. This is BIG Alaska.
A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper
left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and
comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and
moves around the front of the truck. We can just make
out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a
very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from
the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.
DRIVER
Hey!
The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK,
stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of
the truck.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Come here.
BACKPACK walks back to the truck.
As he approaches the
driver's door, we
CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto
the DRIVER.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
(referring to items we see
sitting on dashboard)
You left your watch, your comb, your
change...
We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:
BACKPACK
Keep it.
DRIVER
I don't want your money.
And I already
have a watch.
BACKPACK
If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it
away. I don't want to know what time it
is, what day it is, or where I am.

BACKPACK (CONT'D)
I don't want to see anybody. None of
that matters.
The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls
out an old pair of rubber work boots.
DRIVER
(handing him the boots)
Take em.
There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the
boots.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
If you make it out alive, give me a call,
and I'll tell you how to get the boots
back to me.
We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken
the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the
driver.
BACKPACK
Hey, do me a favor, will ya?
Take a
picture of me.
Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts
walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he
maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE
until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

CU: driver
CLICK.
He snaps the shot.
Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.
Driver
hands him the camera.
DRIVER
You gonna be alright?
BACKPACK
I'll be better than that.
(I'll be who I am.)
As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the
concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the
comb, and the watch on the dash.
3.
Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE
SNOW, FADE into the distance.
BACK TO:
ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:
We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form
of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the
Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT,
turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the
direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame,

DAY
SUPER:
May 1990
The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.
Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.
INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just
feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.
One by one the names of graduates announced. Their
bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to
the podium to accept their diplomas.
INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE
MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark
striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and
CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist
length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in
sight.
INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO
CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.
From the announcement podium comes the name of their son
and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The
McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris'
absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap
and gown.
4.
Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium
platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS
leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,
frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine
"That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has
been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform
steps.
TIME CUT:
SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a
frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image
as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the
sky to focus on his parents.
(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie
delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast
to voice over:
CHRIS (V.O.)
I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges,
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch, the
red tiles glinting like bent
plates of blood behind his head,
I see my mother with a few light books at
her hip
standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the
wrought-iron gate still open behind her,
its
sword-tips black in the May air,
they are about to graduate, they are
about to get married,
they are kids, they are dumb, all they
know is they are
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
I want to go up to them and say Stop,
don't do it--she's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man, you are going to do
things
you cannot imagine you would ever do,
you are going to do bad things to
children,
you are going to suffer in ways you never
heard of,
you are going to want to die. I want to
go
up to them there in the late May sunlight
and say it,
her hungry pretty blank face turning to
me,

CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
his arrogant handsome blind face turning
to me,
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,
but I don't do it. I want to live. I
take them up like the male and female
paper dolls and bang them together
at the hips like chips of flint as if to
strike sparks from them, I say...
The last graduation cap falls out of the `blue sky'
frame, and into...

MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through the
towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days
and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West.

(In contrast to his introspection of the previous night,
Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.)

VEGAS, NEVADA - SUNSET
(CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle
of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up
through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right.
Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel,
veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast
desert.
As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon.

ANGLE: WEST-FACING
The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just
before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned
at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl.
ANGLE: EAST-FACING
The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at
the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor.
In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil
upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting
sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.
We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled
thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within.
Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant
gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts
of water.

What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile
beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.
We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA
TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash
through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint
maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.
WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's
stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as
much wilderness before us as we did behind.

Chris is on the move north through the gorgeous landscape

child.

down the hill; dirt and gravel.
Chris stops briefly to observe an over-flying commercial
airliner.

passengers)
Is that a man mommy?

Thanks a lot.
Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway
and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch
another ride.
36A

CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars
pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track
with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to
hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his
eye in the treeline beside the road.
24.
REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he
lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.
He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a
police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.
With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard
the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and
moves to Chris.
POLICEMAN
How're you doin' this evening?
CHRIS
(reluctantly)
I'm alright. What's the matter?
POLICEMAN
You wanna put your backpack down on the
hood of my car.
Chris does not oblige.
CHRIS
Why?
POLICEMAN
Because I asked you to, sir.
CHRIS
But I haven't done anything wrong.
These
are my personal items.
POLICEMAN
Do you know that it's unlawful to
hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
CHRIS
You're kidding.
POLICEMAN
Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to
stop? We got a tree-lined highway
without a substantial shoulder here. And
we've had a lot of accidents on this road
from people stopping in the traffic lane
for hitchhikers.
CHRIS
Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your
car. You're in the traffic lane. And
you can see, there's hardly any cars out
here. Plus, it's a straight road; you
can see for a long ways.
(MORE)
25.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(in disbelief)
There's really been accidents along here?
POLICEMAN
May I see some identification?
Now Chris is worried.
CHRIS
I don't have any.
POLICEMAN
You don't have any identification?
Chris shakes his head "No."
POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
(pulling out a ticket)
Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful
hitchhiking. You don't have to appear.
You can send a check directly to the
Humboldt County Clerks Office for
restitution. If you don't pay it within
30 days, you're subject to fine and
warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're
gonna give me accurate information.
What's your name?
Chris can't bring himself to lie.
CHRIS

McCandless. Christopher Johnson

SOUTH OF THE OREGON LINE - DAY (MID-AUGUST 1990)
With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his
goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead
run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's
note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles
waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the
woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early
40's, looks to be still on the long road home from
Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot
of premature grey in it.
Jan moving to the side door.
JAN
Hi. We just barely saw you there, under
that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't
back up - the van's reverse is broken.
CHRIS
(as Jan fiddles with side
door handle)
Oh.
That's okay. Thanks for stopping.
JAN
This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.
And with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony-
tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's,
definitely Woodstock...
JAN (CONT'D)
Hop in, that's Rainey.
27.
RAINEY
Hey, I'm Rainey.
JAN
And I'm Jan.
CHRIS
Hey, Rainey.
Hi Jan.
I'm Alex.
RAINEY
Alex of the hat.
CHRIS
(closing the side door)
Yeah.
Jan jumps back in passenger seat and the van rolls on.
39

Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on
blankets. Their tents loom behind them.
Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping
on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.
CHRIS
(between large swallows)
So, I just left the car. It was a great
car too. I'd driven it cross country the
first time when I got out of high school.
I had some really great adventures with
it. That thing would just go and go. I
mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it,
it would've lasted me forever.
RAINEY
So, you're a leather now.
CHRIS
I'm a leather?
Rainey nods, smiling.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(looking to Jan)
What's a leather?
JAN
You're a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it on foot. So,
we're technically rubber tramps.
29.
RAINEY
(interjecting)
As we have a vee-hi-cle.
Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes
a little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.
JAN
Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't
burn his money. Why would you want to do
that?
CHRIS
I don't need money.
It makes people
cautious.
JAN
(a little irritated)
Well, you have to be a little cautious
Alex. That book of yours is all well and
fine but you can't depend entirely on
leaves and berries.
CHRIS
I don't know if you'd want to depend on
much more than that.
JAN
Where's your mom and dad?
CHRIS
Makin' their money somewhere.
JAN
Come on Chris. You look like a loved
*
kid. Be fair.

CHRIS
Fair?
JAN
You know what I mean.
CHRIS
I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- "Rather than
*
love, than money, than fairness, give me

truth."

You look like shit.
There's the truth.

They all laugh.

We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above
the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front.
If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging
himself.
Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see
Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We
follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the
beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction
of Rainey.
ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.
Chris appears beside
him.
RAINEY
(regarding Chris wrapped up
in wood)
Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd
have warmth and dinner at the same time.
31.
But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.
CHRIS
Where's Jan going?
RAINEY
Well, my friend, all is not well on the
hippie front.
Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that
binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside
Rainey.
RAINEY (CONT'D)
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things
happen at particular times. I've loved
that woman for a lot of years. But you
know, she's got a...story. We've been
going through this thing real quietly
cause, well...So, after running into you
last night, this thing we were going
through quietly, she started talking
about. You know what I mean?
CHRIS
I think so.
RAINEY
You think what?
Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.
CHRIS
I think she's probably quietly
disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to
her to be close to you if there's a hole
of some kind somewhere else.
RAINEY
That's a helluva insight. Jesus!...
You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna
walk on that water and get her back for
me?
CHRIS
Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.
Rainey gives him a sideways glance.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
It's true. But it's something I've got
to get over sometime.
(MORE)
32.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the
firewood back to the campsite.
RAINEY
I'll carry.
Shit-yes I'll carry.
And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan.
Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they
strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean,
splashing and laughing.
ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old
lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and
heads to the campsite.
ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having
a ball.
Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness
and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the
stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends
below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and
laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of
her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re-
surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.

Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see
the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes
run shivering toward us.
Rainey sits beside the campfire.
RAINEY
I thought you guys might need a little
heat.
Jan smiles appreciatively.
JAN
(moving to Rainey)
That's not hot enough. Put your arms
around me.
As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent,
puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book.
Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit
beside the fire.
33.
CHRIS
I'm going to go down the beach a ways and
read a little bit. I'll bring the rest
of that wood back before nightfall.
RAINEY
Alright. We might take a run into town
to grab some food for tonight.
CHRIS
Sounds good.
He heads off down the beach.

He ought to come out to the Slabs this
winter.

RAINEY
Oh yeah.
Rainey takes a toke on the joint.
RAINEY (CONT'D)
You'd like that if you're still on the
road. Lot of fellow travelers.
Rainey offers the joint to Chris.
Chris passes it up
with a hand gesture.
CHRIS
What is that? The Slabs?
RAINEY
It's down in Niland, California.
You
know where the Salton Sea is?
CHRIS
Near San Diego, yeah?
RAINEY
Well about 200 miles Northeast of there,
but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of
Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed
and abandoned a base there. All that's
left is a grid of concrete foundations.
They're scattered over about a square
mile or so.
JAN
When the weather turns cold across the
rest of the country, people show up there
by the thousands: snow birds...
RAINEY
Drifters...
JAN
Sundry vagabonds...
RAINEY / JAN
Like ourselves.
JAN
Livin' on the cheap under the sun.
CHRIS
You sell your handcrafts there?
35.
JAN
Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods.
There's a swap meet. The people are
cool. There's even some kids running
around sometimes. Most everyone there,
if they're not avoiding the cold, are at
least dodging the IRS.
RAINEY
Or the FBI.
CIA! DDT!!!
The three of them laugh.
JAN
It's good. You should check it out. If
you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.
(standing, shaking out her
blanket)
Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the
old man and I are gonna get some rest.
(indicating the sleeping bag)
Looks like you got yourself a good bag
there.
CHRIS
Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.
Jan sees an almost imperceptible mother pang in Chris,
but he pushes it away quickly.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'm gonna sleep out here by the fire.
I

The fire is burning low. Chris reads from Thoreau's
WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move
slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of
what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's
tent. A gentle smile comes over Chris' face and in its
irony, he looks to the page before him.

Chris' sliding fingertip underlines the following
passage:
Chastity is the flowering of a man; and what are called
genius, heroism, holiness, and the like, are but various

Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from

campfire's death. There on the beach, Jan and Rainey's
van, their tent, and the fireless coals of last night.
But no sign of Chris, his bag or his tent.
Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a
sarong which she re-secures at the breast, then notices
that Chris has left. But where his tent had been, the
words:
THANK YOU JAN AND RAINEY
are spelled out in the sand with bits of driftwood.
CU: Jan - We see her sadness. Rainey appears at her
shoulder. He understands what is inside his woman.
JAN
He reminded me...

CARINE (V.O.)
In early September, mom and dad got a
call from the Annandale police notifying
them that Chris' abandoned car had been
identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol
after a group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert. There
were no signs that Chris had intended to
return to it. But there wasn't any
evidence of struggle. The police said
they thought Chris had chosen to leave it
behind and not that it had been taken
from him. Nonetheless, the initial
comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly
turned to their realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.

The year Chris graduated high school he
bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to
drive it cross-country and visit our old

before he left was my dad's birthday.
Chris made a speech...

A pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in,
we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE
WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in
beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a
black goatee.
WAYNE
(rolling a cigarette without
moving forward with the
truck, his knees rattling up
and down)
How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.
CHRIS
(shaking hands)
Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.
WAYNE
Seems like every time I come on this
road, there's somebody hitching out here
who looks as skinny and unfed as you.
Chris nods with a laugh.
Wayne continuing...
41.
WAYNE (CONT'D)
Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop
something off (know what I mean?)
Chris is not sure about the "drop something off" part.
WAYNE (CONT'D)
How `bout you and I grab something to eat
down there?
CHRIS
Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.
WAYNE
How long has it been since you've had
anything to eat?
CHRIS
Couple of days. I kinda ran out of
money.
WAYNE
Well, there's no choice about it.
I'm
gonna get you some dinner.
Wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and
they head down the road.
As the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the
departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds
stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:

Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field
moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double-
wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a
Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to
a stop in front of the double-wide.
As he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a
hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the
door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys.
A little thunder kicking in the distant sky.

We are TIGHT on Chris' hand atop the shifter of one of
Wayne's lumbering harvesters.

WAYNE (O.S)
Okay. Now take hold of the joystick, get
the feel of header, idle it down with the
toggle switch...
As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the
grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.
WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the
background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines
piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe
blond grain.
Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.
This time
the thing starts to move.
WAYNE (CONT'D)
That's it. That's it. Now take it on
out and make yourself some money.
Wayne jumps off the combine and Chris begins to cut his
pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.
Wayne laughs his ass off.

Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches
Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a
piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts
pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.
CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain
elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile
come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when
suddenly -
Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.
(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne
as the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid to
a dusty stop on all sides of him.)
Chris and the men of his crew look on.

Sorry boys. Gonna have to shut down for

As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and

forehead, TILTS OUR CAMERA to his trembling hands and
legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to
play.
BACK TO:
ZOOM INTO Chris' face...a decision:
Fear becomes determination
We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO,
SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the
rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's
outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings
it, he has the touch.
This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on
rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care,
no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can
hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's
no looking back now. And with every thump of the music,
we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.
With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully
shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters.
57.
We move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face
upstream. There before him, the impossible rapid he had
just completed.
CHRIS
(to himself)
I'm Superman. SuperTramp.
He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about
to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a
group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a
pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of
bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life-
vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out
at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide
gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We
ZOOM SLOWLY away from them toward the rapid.

Along the banks he sees a YOUNG BLONDE COUPLE. This is
MADS and SONJA, in their 20's, Danish. They play at the
river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a
Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the
water, topless.
MADS
(yelling out to Chris)
Hello!
CHRIS
Hello.
MADS
You can join us!
Chris doesn't know quite what to do. But Mads seems
quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence
of his topless girlfriend.
58.
MADS (CONT'D)
We have hotdogs!
Chris - can't turn that down!
He paddles to within feet
of the water's edge.
MADS (CONT'D)
I am Mads.
CHRIS
Hi. Alex.
SONJA
I am Sonja.
Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading
up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.
SONJA (CONT'D)
Hello Alex.
This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to
please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their
midst. It's everything they could've wanted.
MADS
We are from Copenhagen.
And you are from
the rapids.
CHRIS
I am.
SONJA
My Got!
MADS
Crazy man. You're a crazy man!
Sonja,
he is a crazy man.
(to Chris)
I'll make you a hotdog.
Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.
MADS (CONT'D)
Just one minute. One minute...
Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But
as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep
saying Hello.
Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his
face in the presence of these warm, open people.
59.
MADS (CONT'D)
I love this. Don't you love this? This
is nature. We see it in the American
movies. How come you're crazy?
CHRIS
Well...
MADS
(interrupting)
Because that's crazy! You come down the
rapids. What do you want on your hotdog?
Mustard and relish?
CHRIS
You have ketchup?
MADS
No, I have mustard and relish.
CHRIS
Mustard and relish it is then.
MADS
Sonja, you want a hotdog?
SONJA
(in Danish)
Of course I want a hotdog.
Why are you
stupid?
Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.
MADS
(translating)
She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say,
well...like I ask you why you're crazy
and you say "well." Where are you going?
CHRIS
I haven't decided.
MADS
We like it here very much. We went to
Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las
Vegas.
SONJA
Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is
very good.
59A.
MADS
And then, we come here.
Maybe you go to
Mexico.
(MORE)

MADS (CONT'D)
You can take kayak around Lake Mead and
then take the river down to Mexico.
Chris likes the idea.
CHRIS
How far are we from Lake Mead?
MADS
Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?
Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes
it. We follow her finger tracing the river.
SONJA
Maybe three hundred thirty
kilometers...like two hundred miles.
Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and
hands it to him. He studies it.
CHRIS
Man, I wonder if I could go all the way
down into the Gulf of California.
Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route
leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.
MADS
(entering the water with
Chris' hotdog)
I go with you. We leave Sonja here.
You
and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.
SONJA
(in Danish)
You're embarrassing.
Idiot.
Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand,
shaking it violently.
MADS
I like the meeting you.
CHRIS
Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both
of you too.
Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on
the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns
to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot.
60A.
Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver.
We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat
motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -
61.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Well, guys I really appreciate the
hospitality but I wanna make camp down-
river a ways so I better take off before
dark.

Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads
and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And
they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he
has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend
arrive the RIVER PATROL.
At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their
attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he
yells:
MADS
He went thattaway!
The crazy man - he
went thattaway!
And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face
and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly
Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As
she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge -
SONJA
Just like in the movies.

CARINE (V.O.)
It would be Christmas in a couple of
months. And the last news we'd had was
about his car being found. I woke up a
couple of days ago, and for the first
time, I was surprised to realize that it
wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard
from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't
tried to call in case I might answer. He
could've hung up if it wasn't me.
88

Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in
his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower
stretch of the river has little in common with the
unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.
Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower
Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,
through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere
country on the continent.
63.
CARINE
But why he didn't send a letter, maybe
through a friend. I got mad. But I told
myself it was good. It made me remember
that there was something more than
rebellion, more than anger that was
driving him. Chris had always been
driven, had always been an adventurer.
When he was four years old...

makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight
cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to
slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel
rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting
his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.

CARINE (V.O.)
In the nine months since Chris'
disappearance, my parents went through
enormous changes. Guilt was giving way
to pain. And pain seemed to bring them
closer. My father had humbled
dramatically. And what had always been a
sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man
who actually thought he could cancel
Christmas, had given way to the
vulnerability of a father's heart. Even
their faces had changed. It made me sad
that I couldn't share with Chris the new
closeness I felt toward our parents.

HIGH ANGLE CU: We see Chris walking the streets of
Seattle. As we WIDEN OUT, he becomes a dot in the
Seattle landscape.
CARINE
In those silent moments, with my eyes
closed trying to picture where Chris
might be at that very moment, probably
climbing some scary mountain, I want to
reach into that picture and bring him
back to see what mom and dad, what our
family might become.

But instead when I open my eyes, what I
see is my mother, sitting at the dining
room table, sifting through photo albums
and pictures of Chris. It's all she can
do to examine the snapshots. And, though
she breaks down from time to time, she
studies them with a sort of hungry
intensity - like looking at food you
can't eat, or into a window at a family
around a table that you were once a part
of and can be no more.
We see Billie driving out of the Annandale supermarket
onto the boulevard. She sees a hitchhiker roadside. She
cranes her head - is it Chris? It's not.
CARINE (V.O.)
(CONT'D)
She convinces herself it's
Chris; that
it's her son, whenever she
passes a
stray. And I fear for the
mother in
her...

We see Chris hitchhiking in a barren desert.
CARINE
Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge and irreparable that
the mind balks at taking its measure - I
begin to wonder if I do understand what
Chris is saying any longer. But I catch
myself in doubt and remember that these
are not the parents he grew up with.
That in the forced reflection that comes
with loss, indeed everything Chris is
saying, has to be said. And I trust for
him that everything he is doing has to be
done. This is our life.

Chris is in the passenger seat of a Mac truck cab. Both
Chris and the TRUCKER look outward as though to find an
address or landmark.
TRUCKER
I don't know where to drop you.
Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no
"center." You sure you don't want to be
in Laughlin? It's casinos versus
chiropractors.
CHRIS
Yeah, no.
This is good.
Right here.
TRUCKER
Alright then. Chiropractors it is.
He pulls over. Chris grabs his pack and exits the truck
in front of a laundromat. As the truck pulls away, Chris
sees a "Help Wanted" sign for Burger King on the
laundromat window.

Chris pedals up a dirt path to find many of his
belongings strewn about. And in particular, some food
supplies have been torn into. A coyote yips in the
distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds.
Across the desert, scurrying away beyond the tumbleweed,
three young coyotes head for the hills. Chris picks up
his tattered hat and smiles.

This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey
and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people
in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a
Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with
the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for
swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands.
87.
We SEE that many of the inhabitants have set up CHRISTMAS
TREES outside their trailers and tents. Kids play naked
in a mud pool.

We see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth,
their van with its backseat door open. A little dog,
Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out.
Jan exits the van after the dog.
JAN
Sunni!
Come here boy.
But Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning
against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to
recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris,
looking like a million bucks.
CHRIS
Surprise!

Big embraces all around.

An impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a
makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs
outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music.
JAN
You have to tell us everything.
(Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all
know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are
doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware
that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him,
Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA.
88.
Jan remarks, "I guess if you can figure out how to paddle
a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score
beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska
too.")
At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had
her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic
guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an
*
innocent love song of her own composition, stealing
seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance.
JAN (CONT'D)
I think you've made yourself a friend.
CHRIS

She's only a teenager.
JAN
Good luck.
The girl finishes her song.

Chris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while
Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the
goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to
all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and
Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's
Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the
*
steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth.
She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes
fixed on Chris.
RAINEY
How long can you stay with us?
CHRIS
Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last
job to come into Salton City the day
after Christmas. I've got to start
thinking about getting ready for Alaska.
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics
routine. I think after the check comes
in, I'll try to find some mountains I can
climb everyday till spring comes. I
gotta see how far the money's gonna go.
(MORE)
89.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'm going to have to pick up a lot of
supplies before spring. So, I might take
another job or I might be okay.
RAINEY
Well, you know, we'll give you a little
something for every day you work the
booth.
CHRIS
I'm not taking any money from you,
Rainey.
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two. You look like you're
doing good.
RAINEY
We are, and you were a big part of that,
coming along when you did. Yep, things
are good.
(gives a little giggle)
Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just
a bunch of reading. Speaking of which,
don't you think you ought to introduce
yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?
Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old
smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,
*
and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave-
over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,
*
putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a
little wood nymph to Chris.
TRACY

Hi.
CHRIS
Hi.
TRACY

You selling books?
CHRIS
I am.
We are.
TRACY

I read a lot.

Rainey amused by all of this.
CHRIS
You are not terrible.
TRACY

I'm not?
CHRIS
No.
You sing sweet.
TRACY

Thank you. I was going to go watch the
kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?
RAINEY
Go on.
I'll watch the store.
CHRIS
I'm sorry.
This is Rainey.
And I'm
Chris.
Whoops, a slip on the name, but...
RAINEY
Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. ("Don't
lie to her.")
TRACY

JAN
I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got
*
pregnant. And I thought my husband and I
were going to invent peace on earth and
stay together forever. But it didn't
work out that way. He left. History.
Now ancient history. And that was the
end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself
- that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And
that was really good for a while. But
Reno was already a teenager and was
becoming a man in his own way. And then,
I don't know. He kinda followed in his
father's footsteps - out the door and
gone. And I really don't know where he
is. I haven't heard from him in two
years.
CHRIS
I hope I get to meet him sometime.
Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love.
She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.
JAN
Do your folks know where you are?
Chris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the

TRACY

Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you guys

RAINEY
How the hell would you know? That poor
girl over there is about ready to vault
onto a fence post. And here you are, the
monk of Jack LaLane.
They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit-
ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down
next to him.
RAINEY (CONT'D)
I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno
and everything. Children can be harsh
judges when it comes to their parents.
They don't grant clemency easily. I
think Reno tended to see things in black
and white. I just hope he lives long
enough to forgive her.
The connection is not lost on Chris.
RAINEY (CONT'D)
But painful as it is, you turned a light
on in her and I'm grateful.
CHRIS
Me too.
RAINEY
For what?
Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big
Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.
RAINEY (CONT'D)
Do your folks know where you are?
CHRIS
No.
RAINEY
Don't you think they ought to?
CHRIS
They should. But I can't. Not yet,
anyway. I got a sister though, Carine.
She's the most beautiful girl in the
world. But, it's all got to stay behind
me until I get where I'm going.
RAINEY
Alaska?

CHRIS
Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.
Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris

Just get your pack out of the back and

Chris says nothing. He just looks at Jan. They

fiddles with the broken handle of the back door, gets it
open, gets his pack out. On top of his pack, A WRAPPED

RUNNERS. Leading the group - 17 YEAR-OLD CHRISTOPHER
MCCANDLESS. Lean, softly handsome, and graceful.
CARINE (V.O.)
In high school, Chris became captain of
the cross-country track team. They
called themselves the Road Warriors.

SERIES OF ANGLES: The runners, led by Chris, pace
unchartered trails, grassy hillsides, and shallow
streams.
CARINE
He'd take them on what he loved to refer
to as "epic" runs. The whole point was
to run until they were completely lost
and so exhausted that they were on the
verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a
little, somehow he'd find their bearings,
and lead them home again at full speed.
This was my brothers idea of fun.
We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating
point of being lost. When he has identified a most
likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the
group in the direction of return.

down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the
distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from
where he ran.

Chris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go
with him around the side of the building. There's a
water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris
pops his jug under it and fills it up.

We watch the truck bump and grind on the mangled dirt
road about a mile in.
Out the window, Ron's eye has been caught by something.
Ron's POV: Oh-My-God Hot Springs -
We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out
Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower
was in the White House. Several of those living there
mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp,
the steaming pools lined with rocks under the palm trees.
RON
You live here?
CHRIS
No, we keep going. I'm further up.
Another half-mile or so, out on the
Bajada.

Ron and Chris drive up in the truck. Ron shuts off the
ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs.
Chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at
his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. He throws his
shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.
RON
Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't
you worry about those dope smokers and
nudists down below there?
CHRIS
No, they keep to themselves pretty much
and so do I.
103.
RON
(skeptical)
Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young
man. Am I wrong about that?
CHRIS
I think I got my head on my shoulders
pretty good.
RON
That's what I mean.
How long have you
been out here?
CHRIS
Couple of weeks.
RON
And before that?
CHRIS
A lot of places. I've been moving
around.
RON
How old are you?
CHRIS
Twenty-three.
RON
Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you
think you should be getting an education?
And a job? And making something of this
life?
CHRIS
Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a
twentieth century invention and I don't
want one. You don't need to worry about
me. I have a college education. I'm not
destitute. I'm living like this by
choice.
RON
In the dirt?
CHRIS
(laughs)
Yeah, in the dirt.
RON
I just don't know.
Where's your family?
104.
CHRIS
Don't have one anymore.
RON
That's a shame.
Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.
CHRIS
Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you
something.
Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running
earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the
old-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old-
timer, at least for the moment...
ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit.
It's
getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.
RON
This is getting a little steep.
And a
little high for me kid.
CHRIS
Alright.
But look out there. Even from
half way out, it's quite a sight isn't
it?
Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way across
the Bajada.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
From the top you can see all the way to
the Salton Sea too.
Ron looks up the precarious rock wall.
He ain't gonna be
seeing the Salton Sea today.
RON
You can see the Salton Sea from up there?
CHRIS
Yes, sir.
RON
(starting his way down the
hill)
My goodness.
CHRIS
You don't want to go up?
105.
RON
Nope.
I don't do these kind of things.
Chris smiles and follows Ron.
As they approach the
bottom of the hill -
RON (CONT'D)
How about you and me take a drive? About
fifty miles or so up highway, I know a
place that's got a view, great food, and
requires no climbing. How's that sound?
Chris thinks about it.
Then -
CHRIS
Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of
minutes to clean up.

SPORADIC FIREWORKS WHISTLING AND CRACKLING into the air

its inhabitants. Chris hops out and walks around to
Ron's side of the truck.
CHRIS
Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz.
Thank you.
RON
Look here. If Charles Manson and his
buddies don't kill me on my way out of
here, I'd like to cook you up a home
cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come
out here about, say, four o'clock
tomorrow, how would that be?
CHRIS
That would be swell.
Ron is thrilled.

fishing poles.
RON (CONT'D)
(referring to the Sea)
That thing's twice as salty as the ocean.
Did you know that?

AN ISOLATED CLOUD ECLIPSES THE SUN AGAINST A BLUE DESERT
SKY.
Ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching Chris, backpack
on, climb the stone wall.
RON
Alaska?
Chris summits.
RON (CONT'D)
Son, what the hell you running from?
CHRIS
(yells down from above)
I could ask you the same question.
Except I already know the answer.
RON
You do, do you?
CHRIS
I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back
out in the world. Get out of that lonely
house of yours, that little workshop,
and go live on the road.
Ron waves him off.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Really. You're going to live a long
time, Ron. You should make a radical
change in your lifestyle. The core of
man's spirit comes with new experiences.
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.
RON
Sittin' on my butt, huh?
Ron gets up off the tailgate.
RON (CONT'D)
I'll show you sittin' on my butt.
And Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty
shoulders and all, up the stone wall.
115.
RON (CONT'D)
(mumbling)
"Stubborn old man."
Chris is laughing and clapping.
CHRIS
Come on, old man! Come on!
RON
(mumbling)
Ya little pinhead.
Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts.
Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's
walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows
he's got it in him after all.
As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a
hand. Ron swats it away.
RON (CONT'D)
Ya little pinhead.
Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let
his thumping heart slow down.
CHRIS
You alright?
Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris
sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with
himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.
RON
I'm going to miss you when you go.
CHRIS
I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong
if you think the joy of life comes
principally from human relationships.
God's placed it all around us. It's in
everything. In anything we can
experience. People just have to change
the way they think about those things.
You ought to put a little camper on the
back of your pick-up and go take a look
at some of the great work god's done out
here in the American west.
RON
Alex...You're probably right.
And I'm
going to take stock of that.
116.
Chris offers a skeptical glance.
RON (CONT'D)
No, I am.
A second skeptical glance.
Which Ron squashes with
genuine sincerity.
RON (CONT'D)
(almost to himself)
I am.
Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished
something with Ron.
RON (CONT'D)
But I'll tell you something. The bits
and pieces I've put together, you know,
what you've told me about your family.
Your mother and dad. And I know you got
your problems with the church too, but
there's some kind of bigger thing that we
can all appreciate. And it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God. But when
you forgive, you love. And when you
love...God's light shines on you.
Miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud
clears from the sun and the light shines in Ron's eyes.
Chris points at Ron's face at the light shining on him -
CHRIS
Holy Shit!
RON
I told you about that language.
The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.

We return to the area of Scene #1.
MUSIC OVER: Of religious scope.
Perhaps choral.
HELICOPTER SHOT: We travel a long ways across snowy
peaks and valleys (clearly far from anywhere) passing
between two escarpments of outer range bordering
bottomlands five miles wide until we barely see a tiny
form within it trudging through the snow. We overfly it.

Chris, crunching through two to three feet (not more) of
snow, in arctic parka, big boots, his warm hat, rifle

He moves TOWARD CAMERA. We PAN AROUND with him as he
walks past, where beyond Chris on the snow plain, rises a
tree line.
CUT TO:

Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow.
At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque
with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris
appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the
ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on
to the other side.
REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree
line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris'
POV scanning the terrain.
From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a
second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He
makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium-
sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the
trees.

CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light.
We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with)
Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just
OFF CAMERA.
Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees
something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the
underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on
into the clearing, where before him:
A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International
Harvester from the 1940's.
Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit
seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the
vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing
altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized.
Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus

223
224
We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area
of the clearing. He loves what he sees.
126.
CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER:
He runs up a berm to look down into the river.
He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area
like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee.
He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in
the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the
snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs
a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into
water, and swallows it.
CRANE SHOT:
We PULL UP from Chris to high above the
clearing.

A MOOSE appears from a nearby thicket. Chris drops the
machete and pulls his rifle from his shoulder. The moose
looks ready to charge Chris. There's no choice.
Chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into
the moose's head, dropping it. Chris can hardly believe
his own success. He puts the rifle back on his shoulder,
just staring at the dead moose. He begins back-pedalling
away from it. Bit by bit, his steps turn into a jog and
then he turns and runs back toward the bus.

In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river
is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A
building rumble.
As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika
at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing
the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt
from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque
glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had
been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume
and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide
one.
Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!
the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch
he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like
lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,
saving himself from a certain death.
135.
We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a
rocky shoot below. He pulls himself back onto the bank,
drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting
position beside it.

Birds chirp in the trees. A soft breeze sweeping down

We SLOWLY ZOOM into the bus.
CUT TO:

The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We
drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin
parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to
sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to
his feet.
Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the
hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.
From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus
and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his
mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He
drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.
138.
We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.
He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping
the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible"
beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as
almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there
might be more.
The word -
POISON
jumps off the page at him.
The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
root and warns that those with:
lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of
wild sweet peas are poisonous.
The words -
...leading to partial motor paralysis...
...inhibition of digestion...
...nausea, starvation...
ECU:
...STARVATION
CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate
plight.

A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the

Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full.
He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening.
He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs.

WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the
river's edge catching his breath framed against the
background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently
climbed with ease.

Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near
CAMERA RIGHT into frame. Bit by bit we'll realize it's a
LARGE BEAR ENTERING FRAME and moving away from camera
toward Chris. It lumbers to within feet of him.
CU OVER BEAR onto Chris: Chris, passive to the bear's
presence.
ANGLE: The bear, just as passive towards Chris, as though
he didn't represent enough of anything to eat.
