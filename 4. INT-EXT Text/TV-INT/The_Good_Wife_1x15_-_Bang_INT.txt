      Right where we left off at the end of 113: ALICIA opening her 
      apartment door, finding PETER, the SHERIFF.  And again...

                                  PETER
                    Hi.

      Alicia nods warmly...

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi.

      Peter.  His feet cross the transom, and he hugs her.  Alicia 
      hugs him back, perhaps a bit awkwardly, looks toward the 
      Sheriff, a black box in his hand, briefcase-shaped.  

                                  ZACH
                    Hey, Dad.

      ZACH peering around the corner.  Peter smiles, strides toward 
      him, bear-hugs him too.  Seeing GRACE in the living room:

                                  PETER
                    Grace.

      Grace stands uncomfortably.

                                  GRACE
                    We made you a cake.

                                  PETER
                    Upsidedown pineapple?

      Grace smiles.  He knows.  She rushes to him like a 5-year-
      old, surprising herself, holding him, burrowing her head into 
    his chest.  Whispering:

                                  GRACE
                    You smell like spaghetti.

                                  PETER
                    They air-packed my clothes.

                                  GRACE
                    This is...?

                                  PETER
                    The same suit when I left.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       2.

      CONTINUED:11


      Grace hugs him harder.  Crying.  As Alicia watches from the 
      entryway, moved.  And...

      ...Jackie, forgotten for a second in the kitchen, watches.  
      Smiling.  Then her smile slips a bit.  A bit more.  Sidelined.


    The black box.  It s positioned in a corner of the entry way.

                                  SHERIFF
                    It must remain connected at all 
                    times to your phone.  

    The Sheriff tucks phone wire against the molding, keeping his 
      voice low so the kids in the kitchen don t hear.  Just Peter 
    and Alicia in the entryway.  

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    Any tampering will result in immediate 
                      termination from the program.  The 
                      transmitter is to be worn at all times 
                    on your right ankle.

    An ankle bracelet.  Black.  Looks like a beeper.  

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    It is water proof and shock proof.  
                    It sends a signal to the HMD every 
                    five minutes.  And it must not 
                    cross this line.

    The transom.  The sheriff demonstrates, carrying the anklet 
    out the front door-- there s a small beep.

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    If you accidentally cross the line, 
                    you ll hear a beep, and a telephone 
                    call will come from our monitoring 
                    center.  You must answer within five 
                    rings or you will be terminated from 
                    the program.  Do you understand?

                                  PETER
                      I understand.

      Peter sees the kids venturing closer from the kitchen, 
      interested.  The sheriff pauses: Should I continue?  

                                  ALICIA
                    It s okay.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       3.

      CONTINUED:22


    The sheriff continues, Zach and Grace listening now.

                                  SHERIFF
                    You are confined to the apartment 
                    24 hours a day.  There is no use of 
                    cellphones or internet-based 
                    communications: passive or active.  
                    No e-mail, no web surfing.

                                  ZACH
                    How will you know?

                                  ALICIA
                    Zach.

                                  SHERIFF
                          (sticking to his script)
                    No internet communications.  Will 
                    that be a problem?

                                  PETER
                    No.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    Now I need to attach the 
                      transmitter to your ankle.  Would 
                    you like to go some place...?

    But Peter already has his foot up on a chair, raising his 
      pant leg.  The sheriff nods.  

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    You ll tell me if this is too tight?

      Peter nods as Grace watches, leans toward Alicia.

                                  GRACE
                    It s like Cinderella.

      Alicia smiles, nods.  Yep, like Cinderella.


    The room is comfortable, warm, Zach leaning in the door of 
    it, toothbrush in his mouth, Peter untying his shoes.  

                                  PETER
                    So you re really alright with this?






                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       4.

                                  ZACH
                    Yeah, it s cool.  I was studying 
                    who else was under house arrest.  
                    Roman Polanski, Aung SanKyi.*

      Peter grins, starts out, until...

                                  ZACH (CONT D)
                    Dad.  

                                  PETER
                    Yeah?

                                  ZACH
                          (quieter)
                    I-- I need to show you something. 

    But Zach hears water turned on in the kitchen, hesitates.

                                  ZACH (CONT D)
                    Maybe after school tomorrow.  If 
                    that s alright.  

                                  PETER
                    Sure, I m not going anywhere.

      Zach grins, throws a nerf football at him.  Peter catches it, 
      smiles back.  Father and son.

      Alicia rinses the cake plates as Peter enters with football.     

                                  PETER
                    I like it-- the apartment.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s a fifth the size.

                                  PETER
                    You miss the house?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Sometimes.

      Alicia finishes putting the dishes in the dishwater.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       5.

      CONTINUED:66


                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Well, I have work tomorrow.

                                  PETER
                    Weird, huh?  You going off to work.  
                    Me staying home.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yeah.  

      Alicia goes to him, kisses him on the cheek.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Good to have you home.

    And Alicia leaves the room.  Peter stays leaning against a 
      counter, alone in the kitchen.  


                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    The first thing I saw?  Well, I 
                    guess it was... the body.

      A cop on the stand.  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ (38).  Just the facts.  

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    This was the victim, Miles Wagner?

      NATHAN LANDRY, the clipped and formidable prosecutor from 
      episode 107, 112, 113.  

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    Yes, sir.  He owns Farmington Lawton 
                    Asset Management on the 75th floor; 
                    and it appeared he was gunned down 
                    on his way to his car.       

      Landry clicks a slide on a big screen: a bloodied, suited 
      body just a few yards from the elevator bank in a skyscraper 
      parking garage.  Oddly before Landry can say anything...  

                                  SPECTATOR
                    YEAH!!!

      Three spectators in the packed gallery break out in cheers, 
    one yelling  Rot in hell, Wagner!   Used to it, sighing:

      JUDGE CARMELLA ROMANO (from episode 108).  No-nonsense, 
      thoughtful, she s constantly writing notes.  Three BAILIFFS 
      move toward the cheering spectators, escorting them out.

                                  JUDGE ROMANO (CONT D)
                    Members of the jury, you are again 
                    instructed to disregard these 
                    outbursts.  Mr. Landry.

      Landry sighs: yeah, as if that s likely... 

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    What else did you find at the 
                    scene, detective?

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    Well, him.  

    And he points toward BRAD BROUSSARD (28) at the defense 
      table.  A large inmate with a doughy sweet face and cautious 
      smile, in Dockers court wear, sitting between Diane and 
      JULIUS CAIN(episode 112).   

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ (CONT D)
                    Brad Broussard.  Covered in blood.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    And how did he kill Wagner?

                                  DIANE
                    Objection.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    Two 9 mm bullets in his torso, one 
                      point-blank in his neck.

                    Bailiffs.


      Bailiffs escort out the Spectator passing Alicia with JUDITH 
      (25), the girlfriend of the accused, five months pregnant; a 
      waitress paying her way through nursing school...


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       7.

                    You ll show Brad?

      A small sonogram print-out.  B/W.  Alicia takes it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, but you should.

                                  JUDITH
                    He wanted a girl.  It s not a girl.

                                  ALICIA
                    Men don t know what they want.  

      Judith smiles.  Alicia opens the courtroom door for her, but 
      Judith hesitates...

                                  JUDITH
                    Do you think he ll ever get out on 
                    bail?

                                  ALICIA
                    We re trying.  

                                  JUDITH
                    And visitation? 

                                  ALICIA
                    ...It s hard.  

                                  JUDITH
                    Because we re not married?
                          (Alicia pauses, nods)
                    I know.  We should have.  We should 
                    have.  You ll give it to him?

    The sonogram.  Alicia nods, enters court, and...


                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    So the accused was Mr. Wagner s 
                    bodyguard?

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    Yes, sir.  

      Alicia sits on the bench behind the defense table.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    And did he carry a gun?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       8.

                    Yes.  A 9 mm.  

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    The same as the murder weapon.  And  
                    did Mr. Broussard seem agitated 
                    when you questioned him?

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    He did.  He had been encouraged to 
                    invest his life savings with Mr. 
                    Wagner, and, well, it was lost too.

      Some spectators grumble.  The judge bangs her gavel.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    Lost with the rest of Mr. Wagner s

                    Mr. Wagner and his partner ran a 
                    mutual fund that was one of the 
                    largest feeders to Bernie Madoff s 
                    Ponzi scheme.  

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    And that was, in your opinion, Mr. 
                      Broussard s motive?

                                  DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ
                    Yes.

      Click.  Landry shows another slide.  A ghastly close up of 
      Wagner s bloodied lifeless face.  No one cheers this photo.  
      Landry nods: likes the gasped responses, as... Alicia eyes 
    the reaction of the jury.  Some looking away, repulsed.  As  
      Brad sees Alicia behind him, leans toward her, whispers...

                                  BRAD BROUSSARD
                    Where s Judith?

                    She ll be in ina minute.  She 
                    wanted you to have this.

      Alicia slips him the photo and watches Brad s face as he 
      studies the sonogram, eyes suddenly wet, moved.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)

                    Detective, let s return to this 
                     motive,  shall we?  Mr. Wagner lost 
                    my client s life savings of $98,000?

      Four remote controls.  Lined up on the coffee table.  Peter

      options, he stands alone in the quiet apartment.  

    In the kitchen now, Peter stares into the fridge.  

    In Zach s room, Peter takes a glove and tennis ball.  

    In the living room, Peter sits in front of the TV, tossing

    In the entryway now, Peter has the apartment door open, his 
      anklet this side of safe-- thunk--tossing the ball out the 
      door, off the facing wall, lets it roll back to him.  Thunk--
    he does it again.  Stops, hears a quiet beep-beep-beeping.  A 
      random household sound.  An appliance?  Alarm clock? 

    In quick cuts, he pushes microwave buttons, stove buttons, 
      kitchen clock, opens cabinets, can t find the beeping.  Gives 
    up, takes the phone.  Dials.  Someone picks up.

                    door, then left.

                                  PETER
                    I-- who--?  

                                  ZACH
                    It s faked.  I can tell from the 
                    eyes.  Your eyes.  And hers.  

      Peter slowly nods, nods.Stares at it.

                                  PETER
                    Daniel.  Daniel.

      Golden and Kya come to the door.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I want to meet with Eli Gold.  Now.  
                    Today.  

                                  KYA
                    Peter, I think that s a mistake.  
                    He s wartime consigliere.  He--

                                  PETER
                    Kya.  We re at war.

                                        ACT ONE


      Alicia, Cary, Kalinda.  Finishing up a meeting...

                                  ALICIA
                    They ve lived together for the last 
                    three years-- she s pregnant with 
                      Broussard s baby-- therefore she 
                    should be granted the same visitation 
                    rights as a married couple.  That s 
                    our argument anyway.

      Cary makes a note.  Starts to get up:

                                  CARY
                    So what did you do wrong?

                                  ALICIA
                    What did I--?

                                  CARY
                    Why are you being taken off the case?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh.  They want me on the Haskin Tax 
                    thing.

      Cary stares at her: that makes no sense.  Okay.  He heads 
      out.  Kalinda starts to collect her things:

                                  KALINDA
                    So are you going to talk to her?

                                  ALICIA
                    Who?

                                  KALINDA
                    Diane.

                                  ALICIA
                    What about?

                                  KALINDA
                    Why she s favoring him over you.

                                  ALICIA
                          (studies her)
                    I don t know that she is.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       17.

                                  KALINDA
                    How long until this little competition 
                    between you and Cary is over?  

                                  ALICIA
                    A month...
                            (nonchalance dropped)
                    ...and eight days.

                                  KALINDA
                          (smiles at her specificity)
                    If Diane s showing favoritism, you 
                    need to face that head on.  And if 
                    she s not, you need to face that
                    head on.

                                  ALICIA
                    She s a partner.  I m a Junior 
                    Associate.

      Kalinda sighs, starts out.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  KALINDA
                    You re a good lawyer, Alicia.  But 
                    you re still waiting for people to 
                    give you things.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, I m not.

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay.  Then everything will work out 
                    perfectly.  

    And Kalinda leaves.  Alicia sighs: what the fuck.  Kalinda 
      sticks her head back in...

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Talk to Diane, tell her she s wrong 
                    to take you off the case and that 
                    Cary will screw it up.  Or... wait 
                    for something good to happen to you.

    And Kalinda goes.  Alicia sighs.  Considers it.  Gets up.


      Alicia starts hesitantly toward Diane s office, pauses.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       18.

      CONTINUED:1616


                                  ALICIA
                    Does she have a moment?

                                  DIANE S SECRETARY
                    She s in with the ballistic s expert.

    Oh, Alicia nods.  Waits.  Sits in a chair, while...


      ...Diane finishes up a phone call as across from her, sitting 
      patiently, with the slightest caustic smile on his face is... 
      KURT McVEIGH (45).  Two words: Marlboro Man.  Some added 
      words: smart, sly, honest, strong, a cowboy s accent.  

                                  DIANE
                    Well, it s not all-out war yet.  But 
                    Will has his troops.  I have mine.  

      McVeigh leans to look past Diane, sees the photo behind her.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    He tried to fire my tax litigator, 
                    so I had to... 

      Diane sees his look.  Glances over her shoulder-- the Hillary 
      photo-- smiles slightly.  Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Red State.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                      ...counter-attack.  Look, I have 
                    someone in my office.  No.  Lunch.  
                    Good.
                          (hangs up)
                    Sorry about that, Mr....

    She looks at his prospectus, but McVeigh just smiles...

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                      ...McVeigh.

                                  DIANE
                    My goodness, what an unfortunate 
                    name.  Hopefully no relation?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    Hopefully.

      Diane studies him.  His comic rhythms a bit... luxurious.  
    She smiles politely.  He smiles politely back.  Okay, Diane 
      looks back at his prospectus.

                                  DIANE
                    I see you were the ballistic expert 
                    on the Crown Narrows appeal.  But 
                    you left halfway through.  Why?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    I found out he was guilty.

                                  DIANE
                          (looks up)
                    Is that a deal breaker?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    It is.

      Diane considers it, looks back at his prospectus...

                                  KURT MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    That s why my rates are so... 
                      reasonable.

                                  DIANE
                    So if you find, or believe you find 
                    a client is guilty, you quit?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    Yes.  

                                  DIANE
                    And if you re on the stand?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    I will excuse myself.  

      Diane almost laughs...

                                  DIANE
                    My goodness, you re like something 
                    out of Melville.

      McVeigh suddenly gets up, walks toward the window, looks out.  
      Diane eyes him.  Inspects him.  Intrigued beyond words.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    So why should I hire you-- besides 
                    your reasonable rates?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    Because the prosecution s case 
                    rests almost exclusively on tying 
                    your client to the murder weapon, 
                    and I can prove it s not his.

                    Yes.

                                  DIANE
                    Your predecessor-- the expert you 
                    would replace-- intended to show 
                    the 9 mm was common and the shell 
                    markings negligible.  Is that not 
                    your defense?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    That s not my defense.

                    Then what is it?

                    I don t like Chicago.

                    Yes.

                    Some cabin somewhere?  Where you 
                    write angry letters to the editor?

      Kurt looks toward Diane, smiles.  Doesn t answer.  He starts 
      toward the door.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Ah, I ve offended you?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    No, we re done.  Talk to you soon.  

    And Kurt is out the door.  Diane half-laughs to herself.  
      What the hell.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you have a moment, Diane?

      Diane looks up.  Alicia peering in her door.

                    I have no idea.  I think I ve just 
                    been visited by the Marlboro Man.

                    Well, you two dohave a complicated 
                      relationship.

      Alicia stops, stares at Kalinda.  The two in her office.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    You know, an unrequited thing.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What does that even mean: an 
                    unrequited thing?

                                  KALINDA
                          (starting to leave)
                    Look, I don t deal well with this 
                    high school stuff.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And wouldn t that make him want me 
                    on the case, not off it?  

                                  KALINDA
                    I don t know.  Complicated 
                      relationships are a breeding ground 
                    for misinterpreted action.
                          (off Alicia s stare)
                    It makes sense.  You just have to 
                    untangle it.  Going now.  Bye.  

    And Kalinda goes.  Leaving a bothered Alicia.

                    So this was at 9:35?

                                  CHRIS*
                    Yes, when my shift was over.  I 
                    work as a Santa across the street.  
                    And I saw a man in a black suit 
                    enter the parking garage at 9:35.

                    Now Mr. Broussard said he didn t 
                    enter the garage until after the 
                    shooting, but this would have him 
                    entering the garage before?

                                        ACT TWO


      Boos.  A spectator yells...

                                  ANOTHER SPECTATOR (O.S.)
                    GO TO HELL!

    The Judge bangs her gavel as JEREMYKNOXwaits patiently on 
    the stand, used to it.  Mid-40s, Armani suit, the suave 
      humorlessness of an agent.  

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Bailiff.  Take that man into 
                    custody right now.  The back row.

                                  ANOTHER SPECTATOR
                    He stole my retirement!  He stole 
                      everything.  Free Brad Broussard!  

    And he s escorted out.  

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    My apologies, Mr. Knox.  

                                  KNOX
                    As I was saying, the victim and I built 
                    our investment firm up from nothing.  

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    You blame yourself for his murder?

                                  KNOX
                    Sadly.  I was the one who suggested he 
                    hire Brad as a bodyguard and driver.  
                    I like Brad.  He used to work for me.

      Knox nods to Brad who nods back.  No hard feelings.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    Now the accused phoned you on the 
                    night of the murder, didn t he?

      Diane suddenly looks up from her notes, startled:

                                  DIANE
                    Objection, your honor.  This wasn t in 
                    Mr. Knox s statement to the police.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       30.

      CONTINUED:2222


                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    Yes, your honor, Mr. Knox has since 
                    deepened his memory of the events of 
                    that night.  

                                  DIANE
                    Oh come on.   Deepened. 

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    This has been a very troubling time 
                    for Mr. Knox.  It is to be expected.

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    I ll allow.  

      Diane sits, eyeing Knox warily as he continues...

                                  KNOX
                    Yes, Brad phoned me. He was quite upset.  
                    He wanted to get married, and he needed 
                    his life savings to buy a house.

      Brad writes on a pad  Lying  as Diane nods, looks behind her, 
      sees Kalinda at the back of the court.  Motions for her.

                                  NATHAN LANDRY
                    And what did you tell him?

                                  KNOX
                    Well, I tried to calm him down.  He 
                    was talking about confronting Mr. 
                    Wagner.  I tried to explain that we 
                    were both tricked by Madoff.  But he 
                    wouldn t listen and he hung up.

      Diane leans back toward Kalinda leaning across the railing:

                                  DIANE
                    I think we ve just narrowed your 
                    suspects down to one.   


      Kalinda reads her notes to Diane, Julius, Cary, four others.

                                  KALINDA
                    Knox has an alibi. He and his wife 
                    were going to a Christmas party later 
                    that night, and were dressing at home 
                    at the time of the murder.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       31.

      CONTINUED:2323


                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    His alibi is his wife?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes. The housekeeper was off for the 
                    night, and their daughter was at a party.

                                  DIANE
                    Then let s get to the wife.  What else?

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, logically, there isa motive.  
                    I looked into the Wagner and Knox 
                    partnership. They were facing 
                      indictment, both their bank accounts 
                    were frozen, and although they swore 
                    to fight the charges together, the 
                    Feds were trying to turn one against 
                    the other.

                                  CARY
                    I like it.  Knox kills Wagner to 
                    keep him from testifying.

                                  DIANE
                    Can you get anything certain from 
                    the Feds?  

                                  KALINDA
                    I can try.  

      Kalinda exits, slows as she sees Alicia in Will s office, 
      talking with him.  Interesting.  And we re in with...


      ...them, Will at his desk signing something, Alicia standing 
      nervously: not sure how to start.

                                  ALICIA
                    I just wanted to know...

    But Alicia pauses as Will s AIDE enters, takes the signed 
      document, hands him another, waits there.

                                  WILL
                    Know what?

    Um, Alicia waits.  Will looks up.  Oh, sees the pause is 
      about the Aide.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       32.

      CONTINUED:2424


                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I ll get these out later.

      Right, the Aide goes to the door, exits.  Leaves it open.  
      Will crosses to the door, closes it.  Stays there.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?  

      Alicia doesn t want this to come out so heightened.

                                  ALICIA
                    I checked with Diane why I m no 
                    longer on the Broussard homicide, 
                    and she said it was your decision.

                                  WILL
                    Yes.

                                  ALICIA
                    I just-- I wanted to make sure I 
                    hadn t done anything wrong.

                                  WILL
                    No, of course not.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Then... I don t get it.

      Will studies Alicia.  No longer boss/employee.

                                  WILL
                    Maybe it was a mistake.  I-- I ve 
                    been feeling guilty about pulling 
                    you away on the Rucker defense and 
                    the Memorial North suit.  I thought--
                            (uncomfortable)
                      --withPeter home-- your life was 
                      complicated enough-- and I should 
                    give you a break.

      Alicia studies him.  Tries to see if that s the real reason.

                                  ALICIA
                    But I don t want a break.  I want to be 
                    here.  I want to be doing a good job. 

                                  WILL
                    And you are doing a good job.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then use me.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       33.

      CONTINUED: (2)2424


      Will and Alicia study each other.  The Aide starts to open the 
      door, but Will thrusts out a hand, keeps it closed.  Quieter...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Peter will take care of himself. He s 
                    irrelevant to this. I want to be here.

                                  WILL
                    I want you to be here.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then... I m here.

      Alicia and Will take another second, staring at each other.  
    The words prosaic, the feelings not.  Will nods.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay.


    And Alicia finally exits the office, starts away, a bit 
      flush.  Behind her, Will watches her go.


      Grace studies herself in a bedroom mirror.  Pulls all her 
      hair forward.  Then drapes one lock back over an ear.  Is 
      that better?  She can t tell.  She looks toward...

      ...her primly buttoned blouse.  Unbuttons one button, considers 
    it.  Steps out of her bedroom and peers around the corner at...

      ...Kya working with her Dad.  Kya s hair pretty.  Her stance 
      confident.  Peter paying attention to her.  Kya gets an e-
      mail, steps into the kitchen, and we go with her. 


    Eli Gold is there, leaning against a counter, eating a piece 
    of pineapple upsidedown cake.  Kya notices him.  Just the 
      two.  She decides to face it.  Puts away her Blackberry.  

                                  KYA
                    I don t think you re right, but we 
                    have someone looking into a 
                    possible Federal investigation.

    Eli Gold just eats his cake, ignores her.  Kya lowers her 
      voice, gets closer...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       34.

                                  KYA (CONT D)
                    But I just want to be clear.  If 
                    we re going to fight, you re going 
                    to lose.  Peter trusts me.   

    Eli puts his cake plate on the counter.

                                  KYA (CONT D)
                    Golden may want you here, but Peter 
                    is the ultimate decider.  He s the 
                    one who ll...

    But Kya pauses, appalled, seeing Eli undoing his belt, 
      starting to unbutton his pants.

                                  KYA (CONT D)
                    What reyou doing? 

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Lowering my pants so you can kiss 
                    my ass.

    Kya stares at him, stunned.  Immediately walks out of the 
      kitchen.  Eli buttons up his pants again, looks out, sees...

      ...Kya going to Peter, mentioning something to him, touching 
    his arm: not in an intimate way.  Just a possessive actressy-
      way.  Eli considers this, grabs his cake, eats.  As...


      Knock-knock.  Someone at Alicia s door.  Alicia looks up, 
      surprised.  It s Diane.  She leans in...

                                  DIANE
                    We need your help.

    And Diane goes.  Alicia sits there a second.  Smiles.  Gets up.


      Rachel receives Alicia and Julius in her well-appointed 
      living room.

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    I m trapped here, living in this 
                    limbo.  The first week it was the 
                    reporters.  Then they disappeared, 
                    and it was the haters.  All the 
                    people who lost their money.  I 
                    wanted to yell  He disgusts me too.

                    Then why are you supporting his alibi?

      Rachel looks up.  A smile creeps across her face.

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    Well, that s a question I ve asked

                    Were you together here all night?

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    I was here.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    He went out?

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    I will remain discreetly silent.

                    Yes, well, aren t we all?  

                                  ALICIA
                    If we got you on the stand, would we 
                    be happy with the result, Rachel?

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    Let me put it this way. Yes. But we 
                    both know you won t be getting me on 
                    the stand.  My husband won t allow it.  


      Alicia and Julius and Cary follow Diane down the hall...

                                  DIANE
                    She s right.  We ve run smack into 
                    spousal privilege.  Knox can 
                    prevent her from testifying.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    But spousal privilege is supposed 
                     to foster open communication  in a 
                    marriage, and there s no marriage 
                    here.  They sleep in separate 
                    rooms.  She hates him.  His scandal 
                    has turned her life into hell.

      This comes from Will leaning out of his office as Diane nods,

                    testify against her husband.  We do

      ...Diane sits uncomfortably in McVeigh s small and cramped 
      home office.  Looking out the window toward the farm, then 
      back at Kurt McVeigh on the phone...

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    Uh-huh, uh-huh.

      Yes, it s reversal of their earlier scene.  Diane leans 
      slightly to see the picture behind McVeigh.  Himself posing 
      with Sarah Palin.  Diane smiles to herself: clearly pointedly 
      placed there.  McVeigh sees her smile...

                    Hey, so I have a client here.

    And McVeigh hangs up.  Diane smiles...

                    Is it photoshopped? You and the Barracuda?

                    Okay.  Nothing good will come out of 
                    this conversation. So what do you 
                    have?

      McVeigh gets up, exits.

                    Am I to follow?

    No answer.  Okay, she gets up.


      Diane follows him down a hall and through a door into...


      ...a concrete bunker of a room.  A modern ballistics lab.  Diane 
      stops, stunned: the last thing she expected to find in this old 
      farmhouse.  

      McVeigh tugs a tarp from over several bright orange BALLISTIC 
      DUMMIES.  Pulls over a rolling white board covered with 
      autopsy photos of a dead Wagner.  Then another white board 
      covered with every picture he could take of the crime scene.  
      Diane studies him oddly: like an idiot savant.

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    A gun identical to your clients.  
                    Beretta 92FS.

      McVeigh pulls the gun down from a wall covered with guns.

                                  DIANE
                    You could start a war.

                    Those aren t mine.  On-going cases.

    Ah.  This is the real McVeigh.  Efficient, clinical, 
      professional.  He takes a box of ammunition from a safe 
      filled with ammunition.

                                  DIANE
                    I seem to be spending my life

                    Oh, like the movie.

      McVeigh stares at her. Diane just shrugs. Kurt offers her 
      earphones. She puts them on as he places the gun against the neck 
    of the standing dummy. And-- BOOOOOOOM! The dummy collapses.

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    Loud.  No barriers to the sound.  
                    Concrete, concrete.  Just like the 
                    garage.  There was a janitor two

    He kneels, points toward the dummy s entrance wound.

                    here, here.In a circle.

      A dark circle tattoo of the gunpowder particles on the dummy.   
      Kurt pulls over the white board: a grisly photo of Wagner s 
      neck, the entry wound.

                                  KURT MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    The victim.  A half circle of 
                    stippling.  Police say his coat 
                    collar made it a half circle.

      Diane looks up at McVeigh: loves his scientific calm.

                                  DIANE
                    You disagree?

                                  KURT MCVEIGH
                    The line here.

      McVeigh draws a felt-tip line across the wound on the photo.  

                                  DIANE
                    Meaning?

      McVeigh reaches into a drawer, pulls out something, a 
      seatbelt, walks toward another dummy seated in a chair.  
      Straps the seatbelt s shoulder strap across the dummy.  And--

                    into the automobile.  That s why the 
                    janitor didn t hear anything. Killer 
                    opened the door, and...

      McVeigh pulls the dummy off the chair, drops it on the floor.  
      Fires two more into its torso.  BAH-BOOOM!

    her cellphone.

                    But you are confident, Mr. McVeigh,

                    Yeah.  Have a lot of those.

                    Hey, good work on Broussard today.

                                  DIANE
                    Thanks.

                    I know we re going through some... 
                    turmoil here: over the direction of the 
                    firm. With Stern gone and all.  But 
                    wherever we end up. I respect you, Diane.

                                  DIANE
                    Isn t that what they said to 
                      Secretariat before putting him down?

                                  WILL
                    No. I don t think they said  Diane.   

    The two smile.  And Will leaves.  Diane looks back at the 
      gift.  Okay.  She rips it open.  Opens the box to find in the 
      middle of it: a book.  Not what she expected.  

       Going Rogue by Sarah Palin.   Diane starts to laugh, 
      relieved as much as amused.  


      Kalinda talks with Alicia, Julius, and Cary, down the stairs:

                                  KALINDA
                    Broussard thinks his gun was 
                    stolen.  He said Knox knew where he 
                    kept it: in his glove compartment.

                                  CARY
                    And it s pretty suspicious: showing 
                    up anonymously right after our best 
                    day in court.  

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Any hope on breaking spousal privilege?

                                  ALICIA
                    Nothing on the green card front.  
                    Still trying to locate the daughter, 
                    but she s out of the country.  

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Okay, meet upstairs in a half hour.  
                    This llbe a late night.

      They all nod, start toward their separate offices when Alicia 
      slows, sees...


      ...Eli Gold in her office, lying on the couch, sleeping.

                                  ALICIA

    Eli nods, sits up, studies her.

                    I thought if we re going to be in each 
                    other s lives, I should introduce myself.

                                  ALICIA
                    That isn t really necessary.

                    It s your manner. 

      Alicia crosses her arms.

                                  ALICIA
                    What does my manner suggest to you now?

                          (laughs)
                    Quick question. What do you think of Kya?

      Alicia sits at her desk, stares at Eli.  Smiles.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.

                    Not mine. Don t try to manipulate me.

                    You re right.  My apologies. 

    Eli gets up, goes to the door.  Stops there.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    You and I are going to be great

                                  ALICIA
                    I have no idea.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Because you re cautious.  And so am 
                    I.  Your husband isn t.  Nice 
                    meeting you.

    And Eli leaves.  Alicia sits there for a minute, staring at 
    the empty door. 


      Judge Romano on the bench.  Taking a second to consider a 
      motion, facing an intense Landry and Diane.  No jury.  

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Although I find the late arrival of 
                    this gun suspicious, I would be remiss 
                    if I didn t allow it into evidence.  

      Diane winces.  Hates that.  Alicia too.

                                  JUDGE ROMANO (CONT D)
                    Ms. Lockhart, I ll give you a day to 
                    review the weapon.  Mr. Landry, please 
                    make it available to the defense.

      Landry smiles as-- bang-- Romano bangs her gavel, and leaves.  
      Diane frowns, goes to the defense table, sits with Brad, 
      Julius, Alicia...

                                  DIANE
                    I think we have to start talking

                    How many years?

      They turn to see Judith at the gallery railing.  A startled 
      look on her face.  Diane hesitates.  Hates this.

                                  DIANE
                    Second degree murder.  Ten years.

      Judith slumps onto a bench as Alicia looks between the two.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    With time off for good behavior it

      Brad reaches for Judith s hand. They exchange a look.

                                  BRAD BROUSSARD
                    He d be four years old.

                                  JUDITH
                    But you didn t do it.

                                  BRAD BROUSSARD
                    To see him grow up, it d be worth it.

                                  DIANE
                    We re going to review the evidence

      Bang-- Alicia comes out the courthouse door behind Diane, 
      Julius, sees Kalinda...

                    Right.  Knox s bank account was 
                    frozen, so if Knox has that $50,000.

                    Unless he buried it somewhere--

      A moment of silence.  Judge Romano looks up from her note-

      ...McVeigh enters his office to find a gift there.  
      Beautifully wrapped.  Just like the one he sent.  He smiles.  
      Looks for a card.  There.  Reads it.   Thank you. 

    He rips open the wrapping paper.  Opens the box.  Finds a 
      book.   Going Rouge.   The Sarah Palin parody.  He smiles.


      Alicia returns home, exhausted.  Puts her laptop case down. 
      Hears the TV in the next room.  Turns the corner, finds 
      Peter, Grace, Zach watching TV.  Laughing.  Like something 
    out of a 50s sitcom.  

                                  GRACE
                    Hey, mom.

      Grace turns, sees her.  Peter jumps up too. 

                                  PETER
                    Hey, babe.  How dwork go?

    He kisses her on the cheek as Alicia smiles.  Laughs.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    That good, huh?

                                  ALICIA
                    No, it s just-- role reversal.  
                          (sees Grace s hair)
                    Hey.

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah, I m trying something 
                    different.  Dad said he liked it.

                                  ALICIA
                    It makes you look older.

                                  GRACE
                    That s good.

                                  PETER
                    Want some pizza?  We sent out.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yeah--no.I think I just want some wine.

                                  PETER
                    Good, I ll pour.  I need to talk to 
                    you for a second anyway. 

                                  ALICIA
                    About what?

      Zach trades a look with his dad.  Peter shakes his head: 
      don t worry about it.

                                  PETER
                    Just something.


      Alicia. She stares at Peter, stunned. In silence. A long silence.

                                  PETER
                    They kept it from you to protect 
                    you.

      Alicia turns to him.  Appalled.  Still finding speech.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I know. I talked to Zach. It was wrong.  

                                  ALICIA
                    It...

                                  PETER
                    Their hearts were in the right 
                    place.   

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t absorb this.

                                  PETER
                    I know.

      Alicia stands.  Angry.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Don t talk to them now.  I said 
                    we d talk tomorrow.  Okay?

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh hell, I don t know anymore.  I 
                    just don t know.

                                  PETER
                    You had a long day.  Here.

    He hands her the glass of wine, kisses her on the forehead.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    We ll work this out tomorrow.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know if we will.

                                  PETER
                    We will.

      Peter slips out the door.  Alicia sits there, staring 
      straight ahead at the wall.  The wood of the wall.  Then she 
      looks over... out the door... sees Peter sitting with the 
      kids.  Just the three of them.  A unit now. 

      Alicia gets up.  Goes to the door.  Closes the image out.  
    She looks over at her briefcase, touches it.  A moment.  
      Starts to open it, and...
