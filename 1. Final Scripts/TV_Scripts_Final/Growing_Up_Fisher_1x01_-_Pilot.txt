      EXT. BACKYARD - PASADENA - MORNING (D1)11

      A father, MEL, carries a chainsaw in his right hand while 
      holding hands with his son, HENRY, with his left.  Henry is 
      way too old to be holding his father s hand.  

                                HENRY
                ...Well, if we re definitely getting a 
                dog, I call dibs on naming him.  

                                MEL
                We re not naming the dog Optimus 
                Prime.  He already has a name.  It s 
                Elvis.

                                HENRY
                Oh, I like that.  
                      (then)
                If we ever get a cat though...

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                When I was fourteen, my parents got 
                  divorced.  Which made me like fifty 
                percent of kids in America.  One kinda 
                huge difference was... 

      Henry stops walking.  And so does Mel.    

                                MEL
                Okay, Henry, tell me what tree to cut 
                down.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...my dad was blind.  As in  what the 
                hell s a blind guy doing with a 
                  chainsaw?!   

      Henry shakes his head -- are they really doing this?  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Mom gave me that haircut.  And despite 
                what it looks like, she can see fine.

                                HENRY
                This one right here.

      Henry takes his dad's hand and puts it on the trunk of a tree.  

                                MEL
                Got it.  Two quick things:  How tall s 
                the tree and where s our house?    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           2


                                HENRY
                Super tall and over your right 
                  shoulder.

                                MEL
                My right shoulder?!

                                HENRY
                You know what, why don t we just go 
                grab some Jamba Juice?  

                                MEL
                  Nonsense.  My kids want a pool, 
                they re getting a pool.  

      Mel takes off the cover, feels for the choke and pumps it.  

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Okay, this is now a Danger Zone.  Go 
                inside until I yell  Safety Zone.   

                                HENRY
                How  bout just a hot tub?  We could--

                                MEL
                Danger Zone!

      Mel fires up the chainsaw and Henry hightails it out of 
      there.  Just as Henry reaches the deck, he turns to see:

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Timber!

      CLOSE ON Henry s face in awe as his father takes down the tree.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I met the most amazing man I ll ever 
                meet in my life when I was four and a 
                half minutes old.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Henry s been joined by his sister, KATIE, 
      16, nose ring, texting on her phone, all attitude. 

                                KATIE
                      (still texting)
                Why is he wearing safety glasses?  

                                HENRY
                Safety glasses?  That's what s 
                tripping you up?  

      The two stand and watch in silent disbelief for a beat, then:

                                HENRY
                      (duty calls)
                I gotta go.

      As Henry runs back to point out the next tree, we cut to...

      EXT. FISHER FRONT YARD   LATER (D1)22

      A HUGE pile of fresh cut firewood lines the driveway.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                The craziest part of my parents 
                getting divorced was how I found 
                out...  

                                MEL (O.S.)
                Hike!

      PAN OVER to see Henry hike a football to Mel.  Henry goes 
      long, shouting the whole way.

                                HENRY
                      (announcer voice)
                Henry Fisher explodes out of the back 
                field.  He s fast, he s quick--  

                                MEL
                He s got one more play before clarinet 
                  practice.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...But in order to fully appreciate 
                the irony, you re gonna need a little 
                  backstory:  Dad went blind when he was 
                  eleven...

      Mel tracks Henry s voice and throws a perfect spiral.  Henry 
      catches the ball and runs towards Mel who now plays defense.  

                                HENRY
                He s got one more defender to beat.  
                He s at the thirty, the twenty...

      As Henry bobs and weaves, Mel chases after Henry s voice.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                  ...Before you picture a blind guy 
                selling pencils on the corner, my dad 
                never let the fact that he couldn t 
                see keep him from doing anything...

      Mel catches Henry and tackles him to the ground, a bit too hard.     ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           4


      EXT. THE ROSE BOWL PARKING LOT - LATER (D1)33

      Katie's in the driver's seat of the family's SUV, trying to 
      parallel park but the SUV is currently jerking back and 
      forth.  Lady Gaga plays from the car stereo.  

                                MEL (O.C.)
                Clutch, clutch, clutch!

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...Even when it probably should've.

      REVEAL Mel sitting shotgun.  Mid-lesson.  The SUV stalls.

                                KATIE
                I can't do this.  I'm gonna be the 
                only sixteen-year-old in California 
                without a license!

      Mel feels for the stereo and turns off the music.

                                MEL
                Katie, sweetie...  

                                KATIE
                Get ready, everybody, here it comes.

                                MEL
                ...I went to law school blind.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                It s like he went to law school just 
                so he could say that to his kids.

      Mel opens the passenger door and gets out. 

                                HENRY (O.S.)
                Oh, God.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Henry sitting with his mother, JOYCE, on the 
      curb.  She s SMOKING A PIPE lost in her iPad.  

                                JOYCE
                      (re: iPad)
                Button, do you think I d look sexier 
                if I had bangs like Zooey Deschanel?

                                JOYCE
                Which is why I trust your opinion.

      Joyce looks up to see Mel using his hands to feel around the 
      hood as he navigates his way to the driver's side.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           5

                Mel!  You should not be--

                Relax, Joyce, there s no game today!
                      (sniffing)
                And why don t you just slap a patch on 
                like everyone else?

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Mom started smoking a pipe because she 
                thought it was better than smoking 
                  cigarettes.  Not sure  bout that.  A 
                lot of kids' moms smoked cigarettes...  

      Joyce cups her hand over the bowl of the pipe and relights it.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...No one else's mom was Popeye.

                                HENRY
                This is brutal.  Can I just walk home?

                                JOYCE
                No.  You know I don t trust this 
                  neighborhood.

                                HENRY
                Ugh.  Because of Anthony Hooper?

                                JOYCE
                He disappeared right outside Pinkberry!

                                MEL
                That was like three years ago, Joyce!
                And they found him that afternoon!

                                JOYCE
                But he was never the same!

                                MEL
                They didn t even take his yogurt!  
                      (then, to himself)
                No one wants that crap.   

      Mel is now sitting behind the wheel.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I should mention, before they got 
                  divorced, my dad actually hid his 
                  blindness from everyone outside our 
                family.  He wasn t embarrassed.  He 
                was just proud...  

      In one move, Mel dumps the SUV perfectly between two trash cans.       ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           6


                                MEL
                  Constitutional law was hard, sweetie.  
                Parallel parking is easy.

      Mel gets out to resume the lesson...

                I got it.  I got it.  
                      (hoping back in rolling car)
                Just showing you how important it is 
                to set the parking brake.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...The only person outside the family 
                who knew Dad was blind was the coolest 
                kid I knew.  My best friend Runyen...  

      INT. FISHER KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK (FB1)44

      Henry sits at the breakfast table with RUNYEN, who is 
      basically Vince Vaughn.  If Vince Vaughn were fourteen and 
      Asian.  Mel enters dressed for work.  

                                RUNYEN
                Mel Baby!  Khakis go with everything, 
                smart.  Suspenders and a belt?  I m 
                gonna give you a pass because of the 
                whole eyes no worky thing.

      Runyen takes it upon himself to pop Mel s collar.  Mel can t 
      help but smile at the kid s audacity.  

                                MEL

                Mel Fisher, I'd like you to meet-- 

      Mel extends his hand immediately, forcing the guy to meet his 
      handshake. 

                                KEN (CONT D)
                --Bill Duffy.

      INT. RESTAURANT - DAY - FLASHBACK (FB3)66

      Ken and Bill sit at a table, waiting.  Mel enters and puts a 
       playful  arm around Henry who again walks on Mel s left side.  

                                MEL
                      (making a show of it)
                Get in here!  You are not too old to 
                get a hug from your old man!  
                      (then, sotto)
                Okay, what do we got?

                                HENRY
                      (sotto)
                They re both here.  Table s ten steps 
                away, empty chair s at three o'clock.  
                And Ken s fly is wide open.

      Mel confidently walks to the table and takes the empty seat.  

                                MEL
                Ken, Bill.  Hope it's okay that I 
                brought our youngest associate.  Tae 
                Kwon Do got cancelled.
                      (sotto, gesturing)
                Ken, barn door.

      Ken quickly zips up.  Henry looks at the menu.

                Whatever you want, bud.  But I'm 
                getting the ahi burger.  Sounds 
                  delicious.

      INT. FISHER DEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK (FB4)77

      Henry and Katie stand playing Wii tennis.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I could help him with anything...

      Mel enters, plowing into a glass coffee table.  

                                MEL
                Son of a bitch!

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                  ...Except that damn coffee table.  

      Henry and Katie reset the glass for the millionth time.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                For as long as I could remember, I was 
                his human guide dog...

      INT. FISHER DINING ROOM/DEN - BACK TO PRESENT (D1)88

      Mel stands holding ELVIS, a beautiful German Shepherd that 
      wears a U-SHAPED HARNESS.  At the sight of Henry, Elvis wags 
      his tail excitedly.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...Which is why I was surprised when 
                he got a real one.  

      Mel ties the leash around a leg of the dining room table.  
      Katie texts in the den, dubious.

                                HENRY
                Sweet.  My very own seeing eye dog.  
                      (then, to Mel)
                That's actually mostly yours.

                                MEL
                The correct term is  guide dog.   He 
                doesn't see for me, he guides me.  
                Like a GPS that drools.

                                KATIE
                      (eyes still on phone)
                Perfect.  A trained animal.  That was 
                the only thing missing from this circus.

                                MEL
                Now, Henry, it may take him a while to 
                get used to you...

      Henry drops to his knees and Elvis runs into his arms, 
      dragging the table with him, licking his face like crazy.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           9

                to know your scent.  You know, first 
                date stuff.

      Henry wrestles with Elvis, then stops, realizing something.

                                HENRY
                Wait a minute.  I thought the whole 
                reason we never got a dog is because 
                Mom s allergi--

      Henry sees Joyce SNEEZING that chain of eight consecutive 
      sneezes where you stop saying,  Bless you.   

                                KATIE
                Yeah, douche.  Dad's moving out.   

                                JOYCE
                      (between sneezes)
                Don't call-- your brother-- a douche.

                                MEL
                Look, Mom and I talked about this and 
                we both agree we d be happier if--

      Mel crosses and plows into the coffee table.  CRASH!

                Aaaand that s how I found out my 
                parents were getting divorced.

      As Katie and Joyce reset the glass top, Elvis gives Henry s 
      hand a comforting lick.  But Henry moves away.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. MARRIOTT HOTEL - THAT NIGHT (N1)99

      Mel, Henry, and Elvis walk into the lobby.  Henry pushes a 
      bellman s cart while eating a sandwich. 

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                A lot of kids blame themselves for 
                their parents  divorce...

      Elvis steps up on the cart and sneaks a bite of hanging 
      turkey, ripping all the meat from the sandwich.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...but I was pretty certain this one 
                was the dog s fault.

                                HENRY
                You re really pushing it, dude.

      They approach the CLERK at the registration desk.

                                MEL
                Checking in.

                                CLERK
                Okay, no, no, no.  No dogs allowed.

                                MEL
                It s okay, he s a guide dog.

                                CLERK
                Yeah... No.  We have a strict  no pet  
                policy.

                                MEL
                And I have a strict  don t break the 
                law  policy.

                                HENRY
                  Ohhhhh... 
                      (reading clerk s nametag)
                Kevin.  If you can still take a sick 
                day, I d do it.

                                MEL
                I m a blind attorney--  

                                HENRY
                Can t see a thing.

      To prove it, Henry waves his hand in front of Mel s face.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           11


                                MEL
                And California Civil Code 54.1 makes it 
                illegal to deny lodging to someone using 
                  a service animal.

                                HENRY
                It s a civil code, Kev.  Our hands are 
                tied.

                                MEL
                If you don't give me a room right now, I 
                will sue you so fast that by the time 
                the dust settles this place will be 
                called the Mel Fisher Hotel.  

                                HENRY
                Maybe Fisher & Son.  

                                MEL
                We ll see how the logo looks.

      As Kevin quickly types into his computer, Mel and Henry stand 
      there, savoring their win. 

      INT. HOTEL SUITE - A LITTLE LATER (N1)1010

      An amazing suite.  Henry and Mel kick back on a king-sized 
      bed, scraping the last of the fudge from their sundaes. 

                                MEL
                I gotta hand it to Kevin.  He really 
                redeemed himself with these hot fudge 
                sundaes.  I might even post a nice 
                comment on Yelp.  Nah, probably not. 
                Kinda bloated.

      Just then, Mel s talking watch announces the time.

                                  ELECTRONIC WATCH VOICE 
                It s - nine - o clock - PM.

                                HENRY
                Or... I could stay here and we could 
                get Kevin to send up some sweet potato 
                fries.  Huh?  Huh?  We re eating out 
                of order, but it could be fun.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           12


                                MEL
                Buddy, I can t think of a better way 
                to have started off our new life, but 
                you ve got school tomorrow, I ve got a 
                  deposition.  And most importantly, we 
                gotta get you home before Mom thinks 
                you got Hooper-ed.

                                HENRY
                But doesn t it make more sense-- just 
                thinking logically here-- for me to 
                stay and help you navigate the new 
                place.

                                MEL
                      (getting up)
                Don t worry about me.  I ve got Elvis. 

      As Henry gets up, Elvis takes Henry s place on the bed.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                And before I even got the hot fudge 
                off my face, my job had just been 
                  outsourced to a dog.

      EXT. / INT. FISHER HOUSE - LATER (N1)1111

      Henry exits the cab to find Joyce sitting on the front steps, 
      smoking her pipe.  She blocks his way.  

                                JOYCE
                Welcome home.  Take off your clothes. 

                                HENRY
                What?

                                JOYCE
                      (through sneezes)
                Your clothes-- are covered-- in dander.

      A beat.  She s serious.  Henry takes off his shirt.

                                JOYCE (CONT D)
                Look, Button--

                                JOYCE
                  I promise, once Dad finds a real 
                  apartment, you can stay with him as 
                much as you want.  Pants.  

      He does a quick look to make sure no neighbors are watching, 
      waves hi to Mrs. Goldfein, then reluctantly removes his jeans.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           13


                                HENRY
                What s wrong with the hotel?

                                JOYCE
                Hotels are where rock stars go to do 
                their pot.  Look at me.

                                HENRY
                Please don t do  look at me. 

                                JOYCE
                Look at me.  
                      (holding his face)
                I know there re a lot of changes going 
                on right now, but we re still going to 
                be the same family we always were.  

                                HENRY
                Did you... get braces?

      Joyce smiles, proudly displaying her new metal mouth.  Katie 
      appears at the screen door.

                                KATIE
                That s right, Button.  And apparently, 
                as a personal favor to you and me, she 
                turned down the Invisaligns.  

      Joyce dumps tobacco out of her pipe and crosses over to her. 

                                JOYCE
                Oh, there you are, Kitten.  What are 
                you doing Thursday after school?

                                KATIE
                I told you.  I m going to the mall 
                with Meagan.

                                JOYCE
                Perfect.  
                      (then, heading in)
                I need to get clothes too.  We can all 
                go together.  

                                KATIE
                Perfect?  We?  What?

      Too late.  Joyce s gone.

1212INT. SCHOOL BUS - THE NEXT DAY (D2) 

      Henry sits on the back of the bus with Runyen who is eating 
      some crazy Korean dish out of tupperware.

                                RUNYEN
                Wow, so Joyce got braces and Mel got a 
                guide dog.  Big week for the Fisher 
                family, huh?

                Elvis but--

                                RUNYEN
                I get it.  You feel like you re being 
                  replaced.  

      Henry stares out the window and sighs.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Are you gonna be like this the whole 
                field trip,  cause if so, I ll go sit 
                with Bobby Lacito.  I will not have you 
                wrecking the botanical gardens for me.

      INT. BUS / EXT. UPSCALE STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER (D2)1313

      Henry and Runyen are filing off the bus with the rest of the 
      students who are lining up on the sidewalk.  

                                RUNYEN
                I ll tell you what you gotta do.  You 
                gotta find something you can do that 
                Mr. Costello-- I refuse to call him 
                Elvis-- can t.  

                                HENRY
                Like what?

      Henry and Runyen exit the bus.

                                RUNYEN
                I don t know.  Like opposable thumb 
                stuff.  Open olive jars, fold socks 
                into balls, challenge Mel Baby to some 
                pretty intense thumb wrestling.  

      Henry spots something across the street.

                                HENRY
                Oh my God, that s it.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           15


                                RUNYEN
                Yeah.  Even your best trained dogs 
                can t thumb wrestle.  

                                HENRY
                No.  Look.  

      Henry points to a sign that says  Apartment for Rent. 

                                HENRY (CONT D)
                I m going to get my dad an apartment.  
                That s something a dog can t do.

                                RUNYEN
                That s also something a fourteen year 
                old can t do.

      Henry starts to walk towards the apartment.  

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                What are you doing?  You can t leave a 
                field trip.  We signed a permission 
                slip!

                                HENRY
                      (crossing off)
                Put away the spicy pork and cover for me!

      Runyen tries to psych himself up like a boxer about to enter 
      the ring as he walks over to the TEACHER.  Just as he gets 
      there... he takes off his backpack, undoes the strap and drops 
      to the sidewalk,  wailing  in a full Korean meltdown.

                                RUNYEN
                Puloju soyo!  Puloju soyo!  My 
                backpack broke!

      The teacher immediately puts all her focus on consoling him.

                                TEACHER
                It s okay, it s okay.  We can fix it.  
                Or we ll get you a new one!

                                RUNYEN
                Nega wha nasoyo!  Nega wha nasoyo!  
                Jansport doesn t make this one anymore!

      Runyen looks and sees Henry has made it to the apartment 
      building and, on a dime, pulls himself together.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Oh, wait, it just snaps back together.

      INT. RENTAL OFFICE - A MINUTE OR TWO LATER (D2)1414

      Henry stands in the doorway.  The building manager, FRED, mid-
      40s, African-American, sits behind a big desk on his cell phone.  

                                FRED
                      (into phone, intense)
                  ...That s just it, everyone brings 
                wine to a dinner party.  But I m not 
                  everyone.  That s why I brought the 
                cactus.   

      He sees Henry and covers the phone.

                                FRED (CONT D)
                Can I help you?

                                HENRY
                Is the apartment still available?

                                FRED
                You running away from home?  

                                HENRY
                  Actually, my dad is.  

      Fred gets what Henry means.

                                FRED
                Well, bring him back, I'll give him a 
                tour.  And a stress ball.  

      Henry starts to walk away and Fred returns to his call.

                                FRED (CONT D)
                      (into phone)
                Manny, a bottle of wine lasts one 
                night.  Cacti outlive most people.  
                You know what, tell Cindy I want my 
                cactus back.  

      Henry turns back.

                                HENRY
                Here's the deal, my dad's blind.  I'm 
                going to be his eyes on this.  If I 
                like the place, he'll like the place.  
                So how  bout you go ahead and give me 
                that tour.

                                HENRY
                Very nice.  This would hold a lot of 
                  Twizzlers.

      Fred isn t sure if Henry is kidding.  He laughs.  So does 
      Henry.  Who then immediately goes back to business.

                                HENRY (CONT D)
                Are dogs allowed in the building?

                                FRED
                No pets.  

                                HENRY
                What about guide dogs?  There's a 
                penal code law that says you have to 
                allow them.

                                FRED
                      (with a smile)
                Then I guess we're going to allow 
                them.  How old are you?  

                                HENRY
                Fourteen and a half.

                      (off Henry's skeptical look)
                And a half. 

      Satisfied, Henry flips the switch and tests the garbage disposal.

                The place is great, Dad.  You gotta 
                see it.  I tried to give the guy a 
                  nineteen-dollar deposit, but he

                gotten out of the principal s office 
                with very little collateral damage.

                                MEL
                ...And when I went to get his food 
                from the pantry, I must have left the 
                front door open--  

                                JOYCE
                This place is great.  Is that fridge 
                  Sub-Zero?!

                                MEL
                How  bout we find the missing dog, 
                then check out the appliances?

      As Joyce packs her pipe, Katie grabs her keys.

                                KATIE
                      (to Henry, sotto)
                I ll drive with Sherlock, you take 
                Magoo.

      Henry, Joyce and Katie start to head down the hall.

      Henry turns to see his dad standing with his left arm out.  
      Henry s needed again.  With renewed purpose, he assumes his 
      position on Mel s left side and proudly leads him out the door.

      Henry and Mel, arm in arm, quickly walk the street. 

                                MEL
                Elvis!  Elvis!

                                HENRY
                Elvis, where are you?!

      An attractive WOMAN, late 30s, is locking up her bike.  

                                WOMAN
                      (playful)
                Have you tried Graceland?

                                MEL
                      (to Henry, sotto)
                Is that a woman on a bike?

                                HENRY
                Yeah, late thirties, pretty cute--

                                MEL
                No, I m not talking about that-- But I 
                like where your heads at.  
                      (to woman)
                Miss, we need to borrow your bike.  

                                WOMAN
                Excuse me?

                                MEL
                  I wouldn t ask, but there s a little 
                boy who s lost his dog.  And he s 
                very, very sad.

      She looks at Henry who willingly plays the part.

                                WOMAN
                Ohhhh.

                                MEL
                      (with a smile)
                Little confession.  That boy is me.

      She smiles.

                                WOMAN
                Of course, take my bike.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           24


      She gives Henry the bike.

                                MEL
                Thanks.  Here s my card in case you 
                ever need legal advice.  Or want to 
                grab some sushi.

                That s ridiculous.  Elvis was not 
                  kidnapped!

                                JOYCE
                He s a beautiful dog.  A lot better 
                looking than that Anthony Hooper.

                                KATIE
                Just look for him.

                                JOYCE
                Elvis!  Here boy!  If we find him, 
                make sure you don t run him over with 
                the car.

                                KATIE
                Don t kill Dad s guide dog.  Got it.

                What do you mean?  We re looking for 
                Elvis.

                                KATIE
                But why?  Why does Dad have a guide 
                dog?  Why does he have an apartment?  
                Why are you dressed like me?!

                That's just it, I didn't.  I went from

                Good call.

      Mel reaches back and tugs the strings on Henry s hoodie.

                Thanks for doing this.

                Henry, hand me the phone.

      Henry picks up the cordless phone and hands it to Mel.  As 
      Mel dials, Henry notices Elvis s dog bowl by his feet.

      Katie takes off the belt she's wearing and wraps it around her 
      mom's waist.  Joyce delights in it.  Then eyes Katie s earrings.

      INT. MEL S APARTMENT - SAME TIME (N3)3232

      A ball rolls into frame.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...For Dad, this would be the 
                  beginning of an amazing journey...  

      As Elvis is about to get the ball, Henry grabs it, and he and 
      Mel play  keep away  the way they played football before.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...As much as his pride didn t want 
                him to admit to the world he was 
                blind, it was even more important for 
                him to be a good father...

                                MEL
                Hey, I got you something.

      Mel feels for something on the empty table.  Henry sees an 
      envelope sitting on the mantle that says,  Henry.   Henry 
      quietly takes the envelope and puts it on the coffee table for 
      Mel to  find.   He does.  Mel hands it to Henry.  Outside, 
      there s a LONG CAR HORN.  They share a laugh.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Don't let them kill each other.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...At the time, I would have changed 
                just about everything that was 
                  happening...

      Henry quickly hugs Mel and exits with the envelope.  

      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS3333

      Henry stops, opens the envelope and reaches in. 

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...But looking back... 

      He pulls out a key marked  Henry s.   

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I wouldn t change a thing...       ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           31


      He clenches it in his hand and looks back at the apartment, 
      beaming.  Just then, Elvis scampers out, eager to say goodbye.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I learned something that I would 
                have to learn over and over again...

                                HENRY
                      (calling back to Mel)
                Guide dog out here!

      He gets down on one knee and gives Elvis a proper hug goodbye.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...That more often than not, the tough 
                things that happen in life often make 
                way for greater things than you could 
                possibly imagine. 

      Henry turns to see the most beautiful fourteen-year-old GIRL 
      he s ever seen opening the door to the apartment next door.

                                GIRL
                Do you live here?  

      He looks at the key and then back at her.

                                HENRY
                Yeah.  I guess I do.

                                GIRL
                      (petting Elvis)
                You re lucky your dad s blind.
                      (off Henry s confused look)
                They don t let us have dogs in the 
                  building.

      An awkward beat, then: 

                                HENRY
                My mom smokes a pipe.

                                GIRL
                What?

                                HENRY
                I just want you to know everything.

      She smiles.

                                GIRL
                I m Jenny.

      Henry smiles.  Until... CRASH!     ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           32


                                MEL (O.S.)
                Son of a bitch!

                                HENRY
                      (duty calls)
                I gotta go.

      As Henry runs back in the apartment, we...
