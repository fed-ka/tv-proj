NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.
At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the
jukebox we hear one of her songs.
The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an
overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.
There are several people at the counter with him, including
GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT
REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.
A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full
or dishes. This is WADE.
WADE
(to SUELEEN)
You want a ride into town?
SUELEEN
You bet.
REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the
TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and
checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his
newspaper.
SUELEEN
Got me an audition tonight.
WADE
Well, you just remember, if you
can't kick front, kick back, 'cause
at least you're kicking... Ten
minutes, okay?
She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking
looks at her.
SUELEEN
I've just been waiting for the
right spot to sing in... I'm so
nervous...
She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.
SUELEEN
I'm good, though. There ain't but
one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to
be conceited, but really it's true.
I've been taking special coaching
lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's
just wonderful. Teaches you how to
phrase; that's really important.
And breathing. Well, you know all
about that. Anyway, I wrote this
song.
She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do
all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some
glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every
time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through
the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks
away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished
his meal.
SUELEEN
Oh, listen, I really do go on.
Here's your check. Sure has been
nice talking to you.
As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the
jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."
The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.
CUT TO:
We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN,
who is recording.
He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY
PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is
accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater.
HAVEN is not too happy with him.
6	ANOTHER ANGLE
OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape
recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and
the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming
instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.
OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.
BUD
Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and
gets upset.
She looks at him.
BUD
He's my father.
OPAL
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can
you arrange an interview?
They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording
portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song.
OPAL asks BUD who this group is.
BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and
starts to leave, yelling at the producer.
HAVEN
Who the hell is playing piano? Get
that hippie out of here... He's got
a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit.
I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to
the airport. When you get my
backups straight, then we'll talk
about cutting this tune here.
He heads for the hallway.
It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates
being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white
knight. OPAL moves near.
OPAL
Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting
together a film. I would like to
ask some questions.
She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.
HAVEN
Foreigner?
OPAL
I'm from BBC television.
HAVEN
Where the hell is that?
HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and
PEARL. He spots LINNEA.
HAVEN
Linnea.
LINNEA
How you doing, Haven?
HAVEN
oh, fine. Couldn't be better.
11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE
They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

GREEN
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad,

L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor
radio.
L.A. JOAN
Uh huh.
GREEN
She's been in the hospital two
weeks yesterday.
L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes.
L.A. JOAN
You know anything about the
stations here?
GREEN
(hasn't heard)
It's hard to say. Doctors thought
she'd come home a week ago. All it
was was appendix.
L.A. JOAN
All they got is advertisements.
Just like L.A.
GREEN
Did an exploratory and according to
them, she needed an overhaul.
He chuckles at his prepared joke.
L.A. JOAN
Well, I could use one, especially
if I'm pregnant.
GREEN
What did you say?
L.A. JOAN
I said, maybe I'll change my name
again.
GREEN
I see... Well, those doctors are
real miracle workers.
L.A. JOAN
But not unless Nashville really
inspires me.
GREEN
Maybe you can look after me a
little.

PEARL
We had these two city boys come in
last week. One or them said his
Ford truck had cut off his foot.
The other one said that wasn't true.
Then the first said he looked just
like Eddie Black when he said
that...
HAVEN
Bud, would you be sure to get the
oil changed?
BUD
Ya... where do you want me to take
it?
PEARL
Do you remember Eddie Black? He had
those blue eyes.
HAVEN
Where you always take it. There's
nothing special about this time.
PEARL
And they started pounding on each
other. But the one without the foot
was strongest.
HAVEN
Bud, you're going to have to show
up at the hospital tar me I gotta
get back to that session.
BUD
Okay. Anything you want me to say?
HAVEN
Say I had to get back to the
session. ~ God -- All school did
for you, you can put in a thimble.
PEARL
The cops came through and broke it
up. I finally just had to call Chet
and say, 'Chet, get over here. There
are two old bays here breaking up
the furniture...'
CUT TO:
SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.
WADE
Is that what you're going to sing?
She laughs.
SUELEEN
No -- That's exercises. My coach
says you have to do exercise because
the vocal chords are muscle and need
to be stretched. Every time you
stretch them, the middle part sets
stronger. That's the place where I
sing.
WADE
You think I got any kind of a
voice?
He breaks into a scale.
SUELEEN
You sure do it loud.
WADE
Is that good?
SUELEEN
It's not bad.
WADE
You think I should take lessons?
SUELEEN
If you're serious. Being serious
is real important.
WADE
You serious?
SUELEEN
Wade -- I've been working toward
this audition for years.
WADE
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes
your way then.
SUELEEN
You think it will?
WADE
Sure thing.

STEW #1
Ya - I even recognized them.
STEW #2
How long have you been together?
TOM

Too long.
STEW #3
Is your rather really an actor?
TOM

All his life.
STEW #3
Really?
TOM
Me, too.
They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because
of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.
TOM
You having any fun?
She shrieks and practically drives off the road. They all laugh.
TOM
That's the most important thing --
to have -- fun
STEW #2
How long are you going to be here?
TOM
Long enough to have fun.
They laugh.
CUT TO:
TRIPLETTE
What do you think of him?
REESE
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been
friends for a long time.
TRIPLETTE
You go to school together?
REESE
No, we never did that
TRIPLETTE
Oh --
REESE
We're connected by a relative. One
time, one of his aunts married one
of my uncles. That was a long time
ago, though. How'd you come to work
for him?
TRIPLETTE
Well, I really think he's got a
chance.
REESE
You do?
TRIPLETTE
Oh yea -- There has never been a
better time for something new.
REESE
He ain't really new.
TRIPLETTE
He is to a lot of people.
REESE
He was a good Judge, but that was a
long time ago.
TRIPLETTE
You know, I'll bet you he makes it
with a majority.
REESE
Where are you from?
TRIPLETTE
Southern California.
REESE
You always live there?
TRIPLETTE
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
REESE
Well, I admire your optimism, and I
just wondered if it was regional.
You ever see any movie stars?
TRIPLETTE
I know a couple.
REESE
No kidding -- Wait till I tell
Linnea. Who?
TRIPLETTE
Ah... Peter Finch.
REESE
Who?
TRIPLETTE
Peter Finch -- he's English.
REESE
I never heard of him. Name
somebody else.
TRIPLETTE
Ryan O'Neal.
REESE
You really do?
~ God -- How come
you know them?
TRIPLETTE
Oh, you meet them at parties and
stuff.
REESE
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could
get Ryan to say something about Hal
Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be
something?
TRIPLETTE
Well -- maybe. Let's see what

REESE

GLENN is at the window. "Connie White" ads are present.
34	MOBILE HOME
Part of normal traffic. It belongs to TOMMY BROWN, who lounges
with four very black associates, playing serious poker.
Joining the procession from an auxiliary route. With her is
OPAL, who interviews LINNEA.
OPAL
Have your children been deaf since
birth?
LINNEA
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a
real shock at first, especially
since my daddy's a preacher, but
Delbert and I have been blessed by
their being here.
OPAL
When did you start singing?
LINNEA
When I was little, in church.
OPAL
Isn't it unusual for you to be
working with a black choir?
LINNEA
Yes, it is --
OPAL
Well, can you tell me why?
LINNEA
It just is.
OPAL
(not getting the
answer she wants)
How long have you been with them?
LINNEA
About three years.
OPAL
And before?
LINNEA
Just my church and my boys. We all
had to go to school and learn hand
talking. I just thank the Lord they
can see.
OPAL
Do you ever do any writing?
LINNEA
No, I don't.
OPAL
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
LINNEA
No, mostly his wife's. She's in
Paris, France, right now. My
husband Delbert is real friendly
with him. Delbert's in law. Does
work for him.
OPAL
Do you like him?
LINNEA
He's a member of our congregation.

36	KENNY'S NASH
KENNY is caught up in the crowd entering Nashville.
MARY sits erect.
NORMAN
Oh, my God!
BILL climbs out.
BILL
Norman, just sit there and don't
puke.
He runs toward the truck. At this point, the TRICYCLE MAN
appears through all the cars.
40	ANGLE AT BRIDGE
The TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed
from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and
runs off.
41	ANGLE NEAR KENNY'S CAR
It overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin
case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near.
ALBUQUERQUE
Hey, mind if I walk with ya?
She looks at his violin case.
ALBUQUERQUE
You a musician?
KENNY
No.
ALBUQUERQUE
Do you have people in Nashville?
KENNY
No -- Just coming to Nashville,
that's all.
BARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to
BARBARA JEAN
BARNETT
I don't care. I pay you people
twenty-five bucks an hour and keep
you working steady. Now either go on
or turn around. But move.
BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of
publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE,
BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is
stifling.
DOCTOR
Barbara, I'd like to talk to you
and Barnett alone.
BARNETT
Anything you say.
He turns to the visitors.
BARNETT
Doctor says you'll have to go on
out now
There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved
in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but
can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as
the people start to leave.
TRIPLETTE
Excuse me, Barnett, how's she
doing?
BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers
who he is. He doesn't.
TRIPLETTE
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you.
I'm John Triplette... a friend of
Del Reese... I was at the airport.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm a great fan of hers. If there's
anything you need, just give me a
call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
BARNETT
She's going to rest now.
TRIPLETTE
Okay, I just wanted to see if I
could help out at all.
The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he
steps into the hallway.
BARNETT
I appreciate your concern, but she
has to rest, so you can go on home.
TRIPLETTE
Oh, sure.
He stands there too long.
BARNETT
What do you really want?
TRIPLETTE
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I
need a little information. But, ah,
it can wait.
BARNETT
You bet.
TRIPLETTE
Okay. Thanks.
BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE.
BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.
DOCTOR
Well, it's exhaustion, pure and
simple, and you're going to have to
take a rest or you're going to be in
big trouble.
BARNETT
She has to be at the opera tomorrow
night and then she can go home.
DOCTOR
She's not going anywhere, Barnett.
This is precisely what I'm talking
about. She is collapsing. She
cannot go on without a rest or she
will have to stop altogether for a
long time.
BARBARA JEAN
Well, I have to go:
It's too late
to be replaced, and, besides, I just
can't do that. Those people get
disappointed. They've come in from
all over, you know, and this Miss
Foxy who's been writing to me for
years is going to be there from
Michigan.
DOCTOR
You cannot leave this bed until I
say so. The two of you have to
understand that. Barnett, you've
got to stop this dovetailing and
give her some rest. You don't need
to make that much more money.
BARNETT
It's not the money. The friends
and neighbors love her and they want
to see her. We got a debt to the
public.
DOCTOR
Well, they are not going to see her
tomorrow night, and I suggest you
get on the phone and make the
necessary arrangements.
CUT TO:
A few of the people still remain, among them GLENN, who has just
finished another postcard. Near BARBARA JEANS' hospital room in
MRS. GREEN'S. GREEN is visiting her now and LA. JOAN waits in
the hall, smoking a cigarette. BUD is talking with a few people.
L.A. JOAN brings out a new cigarette and asks GLENN for a 1ight.
He doesn't have one, so she moves to BUD. She scares him, but he
lights her fresh cigarette anyway. She asks him for a ride, and
they leave together as GREEN comes out. GREEN begins to look for
L.A. JOAN.
CUT TO:
SUELEEN is auditioning. The TRICYCLE MAN goes to the bar and
listens. He is one of the few people who do. SUELEEN directs
her performance to him.
Also at the bar is TOM, being interviewed by OPAL.
TOM
We just got a gold record.
OPAL
Do they have a show to give it to
you?
TOM
No
Hell, some secretary in New
York just hands it to you. Only
this one kept dropping it out of the
box.
OPAL
Did it break?
TOM
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she
couldn1t even find it. She had a
hamburger on her desk that looked
three weeks old.
OPAL
How long have you been together?
TOM
Probably a little too long.
OPAL
Do you study at all?
TOM
Depends on what I'm studying.
STAR is down at the end, drinking alone and looking for
ALBUQUERQUE. The phone rings and the MANAGER answers it.

Sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly.
SUELEEN
I can do benefits
MANAGER

How much?
DELBERT
Twenty dollars for her and ten for
you.
The MANAGER keeps looking at SUELEEN
MANAGZR
Well, do you want a blonde?
DELBERT
How does she look?
MANAGER
You know... blonde.
DELBERT
Okay, I'll get you your money.
Both hang up the telephones.
The MANAGER carefully looks at SUELEEM.
MANAGER
I can only give you fifty a week
here and ten bucks for the benefit.
SUELEEN
Money's no object.
She kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of
paper.
MANAGER
You go here Monday night and be
there at eight sharp and look flashy
you know what I mean?
She nods "yes" and takes the paper.
MANAGER
Are you sure you know what you're
doing?
SUELEEN
Hundreds of times.
MANAGER
Well, there's a couple of girls in
Printers Alley if you got any
questions. I know I've seen that G-
string stuff for sale someplace
around.
SUELEEN
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
She isn't convincing.
MANAGER
That's for sure. At the airport -
that's where it was. At the
airport, there in one of those gift
shops... Anyway, you better take a
break.
SUELEEN
Thanks. You are just a wonderful
person.
53	ANOTHER ANGLE
ALBUQUERQUE enters. STAR sees her and chases her outside.
BUD and L.A. JOAN go to the bar as SUELEEN sings another song.
TOM has moved away from OPAL to the telephone.

laughter)
I'm not sure. Where?
TOM
Remember, about a month ago, your
church choir cut a record?
LINNEA
Yes.
TOM
Well, I met you that afternoon in
the control room and we...
LINNEA
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you
doing in Nashville?
T0M
Cutting a record.
Pauses.
TOM
I'd really like to see you.
LINNEA
Or course. You should come over to
the house. The boys would love to
meet you.
TOM
(laughs)
That's not quite what I had in
mind.
She tries not to hear what he's saying.
LINNEA
Well...How have you been?
TOM
Well, they removed my heart last
week, but I'm doing fine except my
nose fell off. Looks a little
funny.
She laughs.
TOM
Look, I find you attractive and I
want to see you, so I'll call you
when I get to my place.
He hangs up the phone. LINNEA looks at the dinner table and
DELBERT and the kids.
TOM moves back to the bar and OPAL. L.A. JOAN has found the
TRICYCLE MAN more interesting than BUD and slides close to him.
BUD takes the opportunity to sneak out.
CUT TO:
NORMAN is on stage doing his routine, a series of imitations and
jokes, with help from Bluegrass pickers, who introduce him to the
audience. BILL and MARY are in the audience, watching NORMAN.
At another table sit BARNETT, TOMMY BROWN, PEARL, HAVEN
negotiating a deal and watching NORMAN as a potential warm-up
act. They think he stinks
59	ANOTHER ANGLE
KENNY enters with his violin case and sits. Near the back WADE
is drunk, leaning against the wall. ALBUQUERQUE enters from the
back door. She hangs around the kitchen, stealing food. WADE
notices her and starts to talk to her.
WADE
Hey, what are you doing?
ALBUQUERQUE pretends she's fixing her purse.
ALBUQUERQUE
Just fixing this strap here
WADE
I know what you're doing. I've
done it too long not to know. But if
you're going to hunt down food, get
enough so you won't have to do it
again right away. Peanut butter's
good. Man can last a long time on
peanut butter.
ALBURQUERQUE can't find any, so she grabs whatever she can that
will fit into her purse.
60	ANOTHER ANGLE
NORMAN caters his material to TOMMY BROWN, hoping to get the Job.
WADE
(quite drunk and
yelling)
Tommy Brown, you are the whitest
nigger I have ever seen.
TOMMY turns in his chair and looks at WADE. BARNETT leans into
TOMMY.
BARNETT
Let's go --
TOMMY
I don't think Norman's done yet.
BARNETT
We've heard enough. Come on.
WADE
Hell, you're whiter than that old
boy up there.
TOMMY and BARNETT leave.
WADE
Where the hell are you going, Oreo
cookie?
The Bluegrass players pick up the tempo by playing music. KENNY
tries to calm WADE down, but WADE belts him. NORMAN sings the
National Anthem. PEARL gets mad and tosses WADE out the back
door. ALBUQUERQUE goes after WADE to soothe him. BILL, MARY and
NORMAN leave together out the front. ALBUQUERQUE watches from the
alley.
GLENN walks past the desk, holding the bouquet so no one will see
it. He enters the elevator.
PAGE MISSING
in the most despicable kind of condition. ALBUQUERQUE wades
through the waste, uses the John, then discovers it won't flush.
She goes to wash her hands but there is only a trickle. She
takes some Kleenex from her purse and dries her face and hands,
exiting the bathroom with the key still in the door.
CUT TO:
GLENN eases out of the chair where he has been sitting all night.
He has been writing a letter and puts it near the glass of
flowers. He looks at BARBARA JEAN for the last time, puts the
chair back, and leaves, bumping into an entering NURSE.
NURSE
Who are you?
GLENN is too scared to say anything and takes off down the hall.
The NURSE checks BARBARA JEAN and lets it go at that.
CUT TO:
TOM is in bed with OPAL. He gets up and goes to the window. We
see the TRICYCLE MAN'S machine parked outside.
OPAL
Come on back to bed.
TOM
Yeah, you bet. You're really
terrific. You know what I mean?
OPAL
Come on.
TOM
Just a minute.
He goes to his Jacket and pulls out a phone number, then starts
to dial.
REESE (V.0.)
Hello.
TOM
Hiya. Listen, is Linnea there?
There is a long pause.
LINNEA (V.0.)
Hello.
TOM
Hi.
Another long pause.
TOM
Listen, 1'm sorry I didn't call a
little sooner. I sorta got tied up.
Listen...
OPAL is getting dressed and gathering her things.
LINNEA (V.O.)
Who is thin?
TOM
Who is this?
It's Tom.
LINNEA (V.0.)
I don't know who you are.
TOM
What do you mean?
You said you
wanted to see me.
OPAL is almost ready to leave. She sees the tricycle parked
outside. LINNEA has hung up on TOM and he dials again.
TOM
What the hell is going on?
REESE (V.0.)
What is this?
TOM
I would like to talk to...
REESE (V.O.)
You call again and I'm calling the
police.
The phone is hung up in TOM'S ear. TOM studies the phone number
for an instant, then tosses it in the ashtray. OPAL has left and
perhaps we even HEAR the ROAR of the tricycle.
CUT TO:
KENNY follows GREEN down the hall.
GREEN
Green's the name.
They shake hands.
KENNY
Kenneth Fraser. Glad to meet
you...
L.A. JOAN'S VOICE gets louder.
GREEN
My wire's been in the hospital so
things might be a little dusty, but
the sheets are clean and the bath's
down the hall.
(looks at Kenny's
violin case)
You're in music, I guess, aren't
you?
'Cause my niece sings most of
the day. That won't bother you,
will it?
KENNY starts to answer.
GREEN
I didn't think it would. She's
calling herself L.A. Joan this-
week. Last week it was Dakota.
Guess if you have to change your
name a state's as good as anything.
KENNY
She sure sings nice.
GREEN
My wife and I think so, but we're
family. Your family's always good
or bad depending on how you look at
your family. What do you do, pick or
sing?
KENNY
Oh... a little of both. Just
thought I'd look around at Nashville
for a while.
GREEN doesn't hear him. L.A. JOAN wanders in and out, catching
KENNY'S eye.
GREEN
When you run out or money, 'cause
you will here, you can go sing at
Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the
hat. All these kids do that. Most
every place doesn't want to bother
with you.
KENNY
I'm not really a musician.
GREEN smiles.
GREEN
Well, don't be shy. I got the
address here. Anytime you need it.
Room's twenty-five dollar! a week
and you can have breakfast with me
if you like.
KENNY
Suits me.
He hands over the money.
KENNY
Listen, do you know anything about
cars?
GREEN
A little. What do you need?
76	ANOTHER ANGLE
As KENNY starts to explain, L.A. JOAN appears.

Oh, don't you worry. You sure done
your best. It'll be fine. I just
know it.
ENGINEER
Okay, you're on.
She smiles at the backup trio: bass violin, piano, violin.
ALBUQUERQUE
Hi... This here is Albuquerque
speaking. You don't know me yet but
ya will after I sing you this song
that I've wrote called...
We HEAR the intro and she begins.
After the song finishes, the trio ends and the red light goes
out. The PLAYBACK BLARES.
ENGINEER
Okay, come in the booth. You'll
have to wait for the disc.
CUT TO:
GLENN is there writing yet another post card. GREEN and JOAN
enter. JOAN eyes GLENN. GREEN talks to the NURSE. He carries
flowers.
NURSE
HI. Look at those flowers. Did
you grow those.
GREEN
Ester and me did;
My niece picked
then. She's just here from
California.
NURSE
That's good,
I've never seen
anything so healthy.
He hands one to her.
NURSE
You sit there for a moment and let
me see if she's sleeping.
GREEN goes over and joins GLENN and JOAN in the waiting area.
80	ANOTHER ANGLE
JOAN is coaxing GLENN into going to the Opera.
GREEN
(to Glenn)
Excuse me. Are you in music?
GLENN
No.
GREEN
Well, neither am I. But my niece
is.
CUT TO:
81	BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM - DAY
BARNETT enters with a basket of fruit.
BARNETT
Wake up. You'll sleep the day
away.
BARBARA JEAN rolls over and opens her eyes. She sees GLENN'S
flowers and the note that says, "When I die I want you to come
along and be an angel with me."
BARNETT
I called Connie and she said not to
worry, She'll fill in for you.
BARBARA JEAN
I see.
She gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom.
BARBARA JEAN suddenly starts to cry loudly. She covers the SOUND
by FLUSHING the TOILET. When that cycle fades, she FLUSHES
again.
CUT TO:
NORMAN picks up the house phone, then sees MARY.
NORMAN
Sorry I'm late.
MARY
You're not.
NORMAN
Where's Bill?
MARY
Sleeping.
NORMAN
Where are you going?
MARY
Out.
She exits without stopping.
CUT TO:
BUD gives OPAL a tour of the house. She carries her big
recorder.
BUD
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
OPAL
Your brother?
BUD
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at
Harvard.
OPAL
Harvard?
BUD
Business School so I can run
Haven's business.
OPAL
What is a turkey shoot.
BUD
You go out in the woods and shoot
targets -- Whoever shoots the most
wins a live turkey
OPAL
How in the world did he get shot?
BUD
Some guy was drunk and hit him.
Accident. Haven almost killed him.
DELBERT enters after having had a meeting with HAVEN in another
room.
REESE
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
BUD
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
They nod.
REESE
Need to have you check these out
before he goes on that Walker
benefit.
BUD
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll
take them.
REESE
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to
your mom.
BUD
She's in Paris.
REESE
Oh... Well... Have you heard from
Barnett?
BUD
Not yet.
REESE
Let me know when you do, all right?
REESE starts for another room.
BUD
You bet.
REESE
I'll just be in here.
He catches OPAL'S eye and doesn't leave.
OPAL
Do you know Barbara Jean?
BUD
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
OPAL
Haven's not going to talk to me.
BUD
Sure he will.
REESE looks at OPAL.
CUT TO:
We SEE TOM and MARY make love. Not a word is spoken.
CUT TO:
L.A. JOAN and GLENN are in the audience. KENNY sits near them.
STAR is present also.
ALBUQUERQUE sneaks in as the guards check TRIPLETTE'S ID. TOMMY
BROWN is backstage, next to perform. An ANNOUNCER introduces the
acts.
91	NEW ANGLE - TOWARD AUDIENCE
ALBUQUERQUE looks to see who is present.
92	ANGLE BACKSTAGE
CONNIE WHITE and her entourage are gathered. HAVEN, BUD and
PEARL talk. OPAL and REESE arrive. As TOMMY BROWN performs,
TRIPLETTE makes the rounds. OPAL comes near. They are handed
pieces of anniversary cake.
OPAL
Hi.
TRIPLETTE
Hello.
OPAL
I'm Opal.
TRIPLETTE
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
OPAL
I'm gathering information about the
characteristics of music people. I
just finished a documentary on
Gandi.
He looks puzzled.
OPAL
The architect
His buildings are
drippy. You know, like sand and
castles. Then I got this
assignment. They want to start in
two weeks.
TRIPLETTE
Why?
OPAL
Why?
TRIPLETTE
What?
OPAL
What? Oh. A film.
At this point, HAVEN walks up.
BARNETT
Where'd you get the cake?
They are taken quite off guard.
TRIPLETTE
Someone gave it... Here, you want
this... I'll...
HAVEN
No.
Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is.
HAVEN
A little worried. Fine, though.
TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and
continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off.
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, Haven
Hamilton.
93	NEW ANGLE
HAVEN grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous
songs, then overlaps it with another. At the finish, he accepts
applause and begins to speak about BARBARA JEAN.
HAVEN
We want to send special wishes to
Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist
Hospital. She collapsed yesterday
morning at the plane christening.
Send your prayers and letters to
Baptist Hospital, Nashville,
Tennessee. Barnett said she wept
because she couldn't be here with
you friends and neighbors. But your
faith in the great Almighty will
bring her back here just to be what
you want her to be... And her good
friend, Connie White, has given up
some time with her own mother, who
is sick with a kidney disorder, to
fill in and send her warmth to you
wonderful friends and neighbors so
you won't be too disappointed after
this message from teeth-sticken,
good, gooey clusters.
94	ANGLE TOWARD GLENN
GLENN politely leaves when CONNIE WHITE is announced. The
TRICYCLE MAN takes his seat, next to L.A. JOAN.
CUT TO:
ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.
ALBUQUERQUE
I know it's here somewhere. I had
it when I walked in, but you weren't
here. My name's Albuquerque, and
I'm here cutting a record. My
people said it would be all right.
POLICEMAN
Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given
you a pass.
ALBUQUERQUE
They did. I know I'll find it
here.
We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.
96	NEW ANGLE
CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to
the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.
ALBUQUERQUE
Sister Connie... Connie. Hi, I saw
you out there. I just think you're
so beautiful. What do you think?
I
can't find my pass. I'm here
cutting a record, you know, and
these policemen here...
The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is
lying.
CONNIE
I'm so glad you come for a little
while, and thank you.
ALBUQUERQUE
I could just sit where I was. I
wasn't bothering anybody. That guy
asking everybody questions made more
noise than I ever did. You saw me
there. You signed this program.
A MAN walks into the group.
MAN
Miss Connie, you're next.
CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.
CONNIE
Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for
coming. You read what I wrote you
now.
ALBUQUERQUE
I did. You said, 'your friend,
Connie.'
CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out
ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:
Connie White starts to sing. She does a few of her tunes.
CUT TO:
After everyone else has gone, KENNY sits alone in the audience.
INTERCUT WITH
SEQUENCE IN OPERA:
SUELEEN is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the
stars of the forties. She is listening to the OPERA ON the RADIO
and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans. Her room is tilled
with photographs of herself and Catholic symbols. She goes to
the closet and selects a gown. She is preparing an outfit and
face for the benefit.
CUT TO:
We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT
is intently listening.
BARBARA JEAN
Would you turn that off
He continues to listen until the end.
BARBARA JEAN
Barnett, please -
BARNETT
What's wrong honey.
BARBARA JEAN
I don't want to listen to her sing
-
BARNETT
Don't feel that way, honey.
BARBARA JEAN
Then why are you listening to her -
BARNETT
Well, I have to go thank her for
filling in and it's nice to know the
tune she sang.
BARBARA JEAN
You have to what?
BARNETT
Go to the King Of the Road and
thank her.
BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.
BARBARA JEAN
Well here, why don't you take her
some of these flowers while you're
at it.
She begins pulling flowers from various vases.
BARBARA JEAN
Maybe you'd like to work out
something with her, too... Split us
up... Her on the road and me in town
or in the hospital --
(she wails)
Barnett!
She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to
cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding,
she is not about to receive it.
BARNETT
What the hell is wrong with you?
Huh?
He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse
owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.
BARNETT
Wait a minute. You're not going
nutsey on me, are you?
Huh...?
You're not going to have one of
those nervous breakdowns or
anything, are you?
Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries
to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her
own panic of being left.
BARBARA JEAN
A... No... No, I'm just... I'm
really fine... I just.
(she gets up)
don't want you to think I'm giving
up or anything like that...
BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of
secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the
floor.
BARNETT
I'll just take these on over to
her. Show her your appreciation.
BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding
affirmatively.
BARBARA JEAN
Sure... you go on and do that.
She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no
attempt to come any closer.
BARBARA JEAN
(very small)
Barnett?
He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.
BARNETT
I'll tell her thank you, for you.
BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.
BARBARA JEAN
(please hold me
voice)
Barnett?
BARNETT
What?
She senses he can't go any further.
BARBARA JEAN
Bye, bye.
He looks at her again and leaves.
BARNETT
Bye. bye.
He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns
into her pillow so he won't hear her.
GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down
the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA
JEAN'S room.
We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to
control herself, but is not having much luck with it.
BARBARA JEAN
(to the pillow)
I just get so afraid sometimes.
Then I get more afraid. : Just want
you to hold me.
MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a
minute and then figures what the hell.
GREEN
Hello.
She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be
discounted as totally insane.
GREEN
Am I disturbing you?
BARBARA JEAN
I'm really all right, Barnett.
Don't you worry really... I just
don't want you to leave me that's
all.
She turns and screams at GREEN.
BARBARA JEAN
Oh, my God.
She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.
GREEN
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare
you.
BARBARA JEAN
How did you come in here?
GREEN
Well, my wife, Ester's down the
hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I
was just talking to Ester about your
being here.	She loves you so much,
I just had to come down and say
hello. We've been following you
since you were a girl. Well, I just
scared you to death. I didn't mean
to do that.
She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins
to laugh.
BARBARA JEAN
Well, I guess you caught me at a
weak moment.
GREEN
You'll have to speak up.
Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more
secure.
BARBARA JEAN
(louder)
I said, I've been real tired.
GREEN
Eater
says she doesn't see how you
do it.
BARBARA JEAN
(loudly)
What's wrong with her.
GREEN
Oh just about everything, I guess.
Those doctors started on an overhaul
and don't want to quit. They keep
taking things out. She's going to
come home an egg shell. Tough,
though.. She's tough.
BARBARA JEAN
What did you say your name was?
GREEN
Green.
BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that
whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three
times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for
her, she'd be well in a minute.
A NURSE enters.
NURSE
Well, Mr. Green.
GREEN
Hi, Sherry.
NURSE
How'd you get in here.
BARBARA JEAN
It's fine. We were just talking
about Vitamin S.
GREEN
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
BARBARA JEAN
You remember what I said about the
Vitamins.
She watches as he leaves, sorry to see him go.
CUT TO:
LINNEA is getting ready for bed. She wishes TOM would call. The
PHONE RINGS.
LINNEA
Hello.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Linnea?
LINNEA
(disappointed)
Yes.
WOMAN'S VOICE
You sound different. Is that
really you?
LINNEA
It's me. What is it?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Can you make a rehearsal in the
morning...?
Courtland wants to...
LINNEA
What time?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
LINNEA
I'll be there.
She hangs up and sighs.
CUT TO:
NORMAN and BILL are there. An ENTERTAINER is singing the CONNIE
WHITE song that CONNIE is doing at the Opera. BILL is eager to
know where MARY is.
NORMAN
Maybe she's at the Opera.
BILL
Why the hell would she be there?
NORMAN shrugs.
106	NEW ANGLE
BILL
You know goddamn well where she is.
BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge.
107	ANOTHER ANGLE
It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.
OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also
HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL
speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying
much in one language and she might just be talking to the
OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.
108	NEW ANGLE
CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the
lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and
singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and
thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is
there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA
JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill.
After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and
TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian.
109	NEW ANGLE
As CONNIE and group step out of the lounge, MARY enters. BILL and
NORMAN see her. BILL reacts.
END OF TUESDAY.

STAR, PEARL and WADE.
A small chapel service for patients and families. FEATURED are
BARBARA JEAN, BARNETT, GREEN and GLENN.
CUT TO:
BILL and MARY are having a violent fight, broken dishes and all.
BILL throws something else.
BILL
Bastard
MARY
Stop it!
She spins him around, but he tosses her onto the bed. He calls
her all kinds of things. The PHONE RINGS. BILL wants it to be
TOM, so he can yell at him, too.
BILL
Tom!
TRIPLETTE'S VOICE
No, ah, Bill?
BILL
What?
TRIPLETTE'S VOICE
I'm with ABC-TV. Like to come up
and talk to you for a minute if I
could.
BILL starts to laugh. TRIPLETTE starts to laugh. BILL stops
BILL
Sure.
He hangs up the phone and goes to the mirror, yelling at MARY.
Momentarily, there is a KNOCK on the door.
119	NEW ANGLE
BILL walks to the door and opens it on TRIPLETTE'S sincere smile
and extended hand.
TRIPLETTE
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
BILL
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
TRIPLETTE enters the room and starts to take it in. MARY comes
from the bathroom, her face swollen. BILL and MARY act as if
nothing has happened.
TRIPLETTE
Hello. John Triplette.
MARY
Hello.
TRIPLETTE
Glad to meet you.
BILL
You want anything?
A drink?
TRIPLETTE
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.
BILL
Don't you worry. We're just having
a quiet Sunday at home.
TRIPLETTE laughs nervously.
TRIPLETTE
Well, I'm here putting together a
show. It's a benefit really.
BILL
Whose?
TRIPLETTE
Hal Phillip Walker.
MARY
Oh, no.
TRIPLETTE
He's pretty well known down here.
BILL
He's pretty well known all over.
TRIPLETTE laughs again. BILL and MARY will be tough to convince.
TRIPLETTE
I was wondering if you'd like to be
in it. It's going to be televised
and...
BILL lights a cigarette and takes a shot of tequilla out of the
bottle on the floor.
BILL
What's he running for?
TRIPLETTE
President.
MARY
(horrified)
President?
BILL
When is it?
TRIPLETTE
Wednesday at the park. We've got a
lot of names coming in...
MARY
For him?
TRIPLETTE
Yes.
MARY smiles.
MARY
Well, we can't. We're registered
Democrats.
BILL ignores her.
BILL
National television?
TRIPLETTE
ABC.
BILL
How much?
TRIPLETTE
Minimum.
MARY looks at BILL.
MARY
We can't support him
We're
registered Democrats.
BILL begins the fight again.
BILL
It's an appearance. It has nothing
to do with support. I don't even
like him.
MARY
Bill, he's a crazy man.
TRIPLETTE moves in fast.
TRIPLETTE
Well, he- expressed a particular
wish to have you on.
They stop and look at him suspiciously.
MARY
What for?
TRIPLETTE
You're real favorites of his.
They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.
MARY
You're kidding.
BILL
How come?
TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.
TRIPLETTE
First you have to understand how
much he admires you.
MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity.
TRIPLETTE
You sing for people and that's what
he's about. He wants to help
people. Especially now, you know.
BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER.
BILL
Where'd he ever see us?
TRIPLETTE
(bluffing)
D.C.
BILL
D.C.?
Tammany Hall?
He came
there?
TRIPLETTE
Sure thing.
MARY
What National TV...?
TRIPLETTE
You're doing some recording here,
aren't you?
MARY
An album.
TRIPLETTE
Might be good for you.
BILL takes another shot of tequilla.
BILL
We'll sing.
TRIPLETTE shakes his hand.
TRIPLETTE
You don't know how pleased he'll
be.
MARY
(can't believe
it)
What!
BILL ignores her.
BILL
Okay.
TRIPLETTE
Okay.
They shake.
CUT TO:
TOM is having a serious attack of too much of everything. He
takes a handful of vitamins, some aspirin and follows it with a
couple of uppers. Then he looks for LINNEA'S phone number.
There is a KNOCK on the door.
TOM
Come on in.
NORMAN enters and they shake.
TOM
How's your stomach?
NORMAN
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to
hear from you. You talk to Bill?
TOM
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
NORMAN
They're looking all over for you.
Do you have a copy of the album.
TOM hands over a copy of their last album.
NORMAN
You know Bill is really mad at you.
TOM
Oh?
NORMAN
I mean...
TOM
Mary?
TOM looks NORMAN down. NORMAN cheerfully changes the subject.
NORMAN
You know, I've got my own act now.
I'm going on tour.
TOM has found the phone number and dials.
TOM
Good...
The PHONE RINGS but no one answers.
NORMAN
Listen, Tom, I have a tour to
drive.
CUT TO:
We HEAR JOAN singing from her room. GREEN'S dog is on the bed.
KENNY finds a dime, then steps into the hallway.
KENNY calls his MOTHER collect in Indiana. After the rundown
with the operator, they finally speak.
KENNY
Mom?
MOTHER (V.0.)
I've been so worried, dear. where
are you?
KENNY
Nashville.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Oh... Well.
KENNY
The car broke down.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Oh, well, I knew that before you-
even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that
old Nash won't make it down the
road.'
But you had to go.
KENNY
Well, I got to Nashville. That's
pretty far.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Next you'll be sick.
KENNY
I feel really good.
MOTHER (V.0.)
How are you going to pay when you
get sick?
KENNY
I'm in a rooming house with Mr.
Green.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Green?
Not Owen Green. Owen Green
embezzled money from your
grandfather
KENNY
I don't know his first name.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Bet the sheets are grey.
KENNY
No. No, they're white. He's got a
nice dog.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Worst time at year for dogs is when
they get fungus.
KENNY
Fungus?
MOTHER (V.0.)
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
KENNY
I don't think so.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Well, you'll get it, skin as
sensitive as yours.
KENNY
How do you know if they do?
He looks suspiciously at the dog in his room.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Weather's been awful. All those
bombs dropping. It changes our
weather. Sure not like the good old
days.
KENNY
(still looking at
the dog)
Does their hair fall out?
MOTHER (V.0.)
Your hair fell out? Just like your
father. Weak hair.
KENNY signals the dog to get off the bed. He's getting worried.
L.A. JOAN will have wandered in and out during this phone call.
KENNY
Listen. Maybe I should go...
MOTHER (V.0.)
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
KENNY
I want to get the dog off my bed.
MOTHER (V.0.)
But, I'll take some of that
Nyquil... you know it puts you right
to sleep no matter what's wrong, you
go right off...
KENNY is really impatient to get the dog oft his bed.
KENNY
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
MOTHER (V.0.)
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from
you.
KENNY

MOTHER (V.0.)
Bye.
125	NEW ANGLE

KENNY
Well, okay...

ALBUQUERQUE is eating everything in sight. LINNEA approaches.
LINNEA
This your first time?
ALBUQUERQUE'S mouth is full and she nods, "yes."
LINNEA
You're from out of town?
ALBUQUERQUE
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
LINNEA
We have a Bible study meeting
tonight if you'd like to come.
ALBUQUERQUE
Is there food?
LINNEA
No.
ALBUQUERQUE
Well, I just wondered 'cause being
from out or town I wouldn't be able
to make anything.
LINNEA
No, those are socials you're
thinking of... Saturday's usually.
The MINISTER is nearby.
MINISTER
This is your first time, isn't it?
ALBUQUERQUE
Yes sir. I'm from Tallahassee.
MINISTER
I see.
ALBUQUERQUE
And I want you to know I round
Jesus today, right here.
MINISTER
Bless you. I hope we see you
again, then.
He walks to the next person. ALBUQUERQUE passes LINNEA and
DELBERT and goes to the street.
CUT TO:
NORMAN is giving TRIPLETTE a tour.
NORMAN
Now in the cemetery Roy already has
his stone, it's a fiddle... right as
you drive in you can see it in front
there.
TRIPLETTE
Oh?
NORMAN
Lot of them do. Fans start
chipping at them, though.... Johnny
cash has a $100,000 fence around his
house. Well, the fans are stealing
the rocks right out of it. Haven
Hamilton has a $700,000 fence. It
has spikes.
129	NEW ANGLE
They pass a house with a red pickup truck in the driveway.
NORMAN
That house over there is where I
live. The one with the red truck.
My aunt drives the school bus. 600
kids a day.
TRIPLETTE cranes to look as a car with "Just Married" and "We've
only just begun" painted on it drives by them. Norman looks at
it, too.
NORMAN
Some black folks wanted to paint
this car once. I didn't let them.
They also wanted me to kiss the
bride. I declined.
130	NEW ANGLE
He makes another turn on to a street that looks like a series of
parks strung together. He slows down.
NORMAN
In the city of Nashville, there are
a total of hundred and twenty
millionaires some of them inhabit
these beautiful home sites to make
Nashville known as the Athens of the
South. Here on the right you see
the home of Haven Hamilton's mother.
He built it for her after his Daddy
passed away three years ago of lung
cancer. Haven contributes time and
money to the cancer foundation, now.
You can see some of his records
handing there in the living room.
TRIPLETTE struggles to see. NORMAN pulls up a little further and
stops.
NORMAN
Look, now you can see it.
Sure enough you can.
NORMAN
He got that one in 1962. Song
called 'Smokey Heart.'
131	ANOTHER SECTION 0F ROAD - DAY
The limo passes OPAL and continues down the road.
We SEE OPAL hitching a ride. He starts past, but she yells,
forcing him to stop.
133	NEW ANGLE
OPAL opens the door and gets in.
OPAL
You weren't really going to drive
off?
STAR just looks at her. She smiles back.
OPAL
My name's Opal. What's yours?
STAR drives off.
OPAL
You going to Nashville?
He grunts.
OPAL
Good. I came out here to meet some
underground singer. They say she
only writes in those trees over
there.
There is a long pause. STAR doesn't respond, so OPAL continues.
OPAL
She never came. I'm trying to
gather some information about the
characteristics of music people for
English television. I started in
San Francisco. Some friends were
making an anti-war film about 'Nam,
you know, and I just love marine
movies. It is really the consummate
art form, all those parts of the
puzzle to make the whole. All that
energy being collective, you know
what I mean?
She removes same of her clothes because or the heat
OPAL

States now except for Maine and
Vermont.
STAR looks at her body and changes lanes.
OPAL
What did you say your name was?
STAR
Star.
OPAL
Star - oh! that's a fantastic name.
Almost as good as Opal. I changed
my name in Taos. This man that was
really into low budget movies said
my eyes were opalistic.
She reaches over and turns on the RADIO. He reaches over and
turns it off.
OPAL
I'm going to make the consummate
documentary as soon as I finish
gathering information. You know
it's so nice not to feel oppressed
in a society that is male oriented.
STAR
Are you in music?
OPAL
No, I told you that.

She ignores him.
KENNY

TOM is singing alone. L.A. JOAN enters the studio and begins
talking to one of the engineers. when TOM finishes she enters
the booth.
JOAN
Hope you don't mind me coming. I
just love your music.
NORMAN, BILL and MARY enter the studio.
The studio door is burst open on TOM who is singing. BILL is
forced to stand still. TOM doesn't look up until he in finished.
TOM
Howdy.
BILL
Where the hell have you been?
TOM and MARY bounce a look, her face is a little discolored.
TOM
You guys been having any fun?
He gets up and starts out the door. BILL is very anxious.
BILL
Where are you going?
TOM
To the bathroom.
He goes through the swinging door.
BILL
Hat!
TOM is on the phone. MARY makes her way toward his back. There
is no answer to his call, so he hangs up and faces her.
MARY
Hi.
Long pause.
TOM
You look terrific.
Another pause. BILL sticks his head out from the studio room.
BILL
Hey!
TOM
It's the den mother.
MARY walks pant TOM into the studio room. TOM holds up a finger
to indicate he'll be a minute and walks toward the bathroom.
MARY reaches BILL.
BILL
Come on, dammit. They want to
check levels.
L.A. JOAN goes and waits outside the bathroom. When TOM comes out
they exit together.
MARY is at her mike with her instrument. The engineer asks for a
level so BILL and MARY sing their hit song. When they finish,
BILL
Where is he!
CUT TO:
BARBARA JEAN is sitting at the foot of the bed. A NURSE in there
talking to BARNETT.
NURSE
The doctor is out of town.
BARNETT
I know that and don't you worry,
I'm going to get her right into bed.
NURSE
She must rest.
BARNETT
I have this release form signed by

The PHONE RINGS.
BARNETT
Yes.
TRIPLETTE (V.0.)
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she
doing?
BARNETT
She's fine.
TRIPLETTE
Well, I just thought I'd call.
BARNETT
Well, you did and she's fine.
Thanks.
He hangs up. The NURSE is reading the forms. BARBARA JEAN is
going through the flowers... She finds GLENN'S and reads the
note.
NURSE
Well, I don't know.
BARNETT
I have a nurse waiting for her in
the bus.
BARBARA JEAN
Who brought these?
NURSE
I don't remember seeing those.
BARNETT
Somebody brought them. Come on,
honey, let's go.
She puts them on the gurney with the others.
BARBARA JEAN
Well, thank you all so much. You
tell the other ladies thank you.
NURSE
Well all right.
As they start out, DELBERT enters.
REESE
How is she?
BARNETT
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
REESE
Have you talked to Triplette?
BARNETT
Who the hell is he?
REESE
He's lining up talent for Hal
Phillip Walker.
BARNETT
Who the hell is he?
REESE
He's going to run for president.
BARNETT
Third party?
REESE
He has that sign with the tree.
BARNETT
What does he want?
REESE
Barbara Jean.
BARNETT
What!
REESE
That's what he wants.
BARNETT
You know better than that.
REESE
It's on National television,
Barnett.
BARNETT
I don't care. She's always been
neutral in politics and that's not
going to change.
There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from
BARBARA JEAN.
REESE
Well, how about the shopping
center?
BARNETT
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
REESE
Okay, then we'll see you there.
BARNETT
Okay.
REESE leaves. BARNETT returns to BARBARA JEAN and the NURSE.
BARNETT
Okay, come on, honey. How are you
feeling?
BARNETT and BARBARA JEAN come from the elevator. GLENN is there
writing. He sees her,
As BARRETT and BARBARA JEAN leave, GREEN
arrives with flowers for his wife. He sees BARBRA JEAN and hands
her a flower.
GREEN
You going today?
BARBARA JEAN
(loudly)
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
GREEN
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled
I saw you again.
BARBARA JEAN
(loudly)
You get her those Vitamin E right
away.
GREEN
(shows her the
bottle)
I got them right here.
BARBARA JEAN feels BARNETT'S impatience to go.
BARBARA JEAN
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
GREEN
Bye, Bye.
She goes on out the door as he walks to the desk.
146A	NEW ANGLE
GREEN
Where have you got her hidden
today?
He hands the NURSE a flower. She looks up in disbelief.
NURSE
Mr. Green?
GREEN
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
NURSE
Didn't you get?... How are you?
GREEN
I'm fine. Can I go up?
NURSE
Let me see if I can get the doctor
hold on one second.
She makes several phone calls and can't locate anyone. She sighs
and hangs up.
GREEN
You want me to wait?
NURSE
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to
tell you this -- your wire passed
away -- I thought they'd called you
at home.
GREEN has and hasn't heard.
GREEN
What?
NURSE
(louder)
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
He is stunned.
NURSE
If you'll wait Just a minute I'll
get everything from the business
office.
146B	ANOTHER ANGLE
He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the
window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and
begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register
GREEN'S grief.
GLENN
(loudly)
My mamma used to know her... They
lived next door to each other... she
said she was always nursing the sick
animals.
GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his
hand.
GLENN
I really learned all about her from
my Momma -- She's been saving this
scrap book about her since she got
to be famous.
GREEN nods.
GLENN
The one thing she said to me when I
joined was "When you're doing your
travels you be sure you see Barbara
Jean. You don't have to say
anything about me but you be sure
you see her."
So that's what I've
been doing. Now I'm going to hitch
a ride so I can see her in Memphis.
GREEN nods.
GLENN
You give my test to your wife1
GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls
from the desk.
NURSE
Mr. Green, the doctor is on his way
and the business office has your
bill ready.
CUT TO:
The PHONE RINGS SEVERAL TIMES before LINNEA answers it.
LINNEA
Hello.
INTERCUT:
TOM
Wow!
LINNEA
What?
TOM
Who is this, right?
I called you
last night.
LINNEA
Oh.
TOM
I've got a gig tonight.
LINNEA
Oh?
TOM
End of Church Street. Next to a
grocery store.
LINNEA
Doesn't it have a name?
TOM
I can't remember. In out/out in,
something like that. Around eight.
Again she is left with a dead receiver.
TOM exits. Behind him is Percy Warner Park and the Parthenon.
L.A. JOAN is with TOM.
CUT TO:
SUELEEN works her way through a crowd of men trying to get into
the banquet hall. There is a sign that says "Benefit Banquet."
SUELEEN finally makes it through the crowd and enters the room.
She walks past the tables and steps on the stage. She checks the
curtain to find that there is no backstage. She enters the
kitchen.
SUELEEN almost trips over REESE and TRIPLETTE and another man who
are talking.
SUELEEN
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
TRIPLETTE
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I
got all caught up in looking at you.
You'll be fine.
SUELEEN
Oh, why thank you.
TRIPLETTE
May I see your costume?
She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a
picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day.
TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands
off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of
survival.
SUELEEN
You like it?
Listen, where is the
pianist?
I need to go over this
with him.
She hands over a stack of music.
SUELEEN
You all didn't say what you wanted
to hear.
TRIPLETTE smiles.
SUELEEN
Someday I'm gonna be a star like
Barbara Jean.
TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.
154	NEW ANGLE
TRIPLETTE
Sueleen, you're prettier and
probably sing better. Besides, she
is unusually sick. And tonight you
have the opportunity to work in
front of some grateful gentlemen.
They continue to walk past the many places.
TRIPLETTE
Have you ever done this before?
She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.
TRIPLETTE
Well, it's not too hard. You'll
sing whatever it is you want to
sing. They'll applaud like crazy
'cause I can tell them that you're
really something and then the piano
and drum will give you a little
fanfare and you can sing and take
off your clothes or not sing. It
really doesn't make much difference,
really. But since you've never done
this before, singing might help.
They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the
oven.
TRIPLETTE
Now this is to raise funds for
someone who can help people who are
less fortunate than yourself. The
more you take off, you see, more
money we can raise.
SUELEEN
(like a robot)
I see.
TRIPLETTE
I know that you are an artist and I
am sure you are very religious.
She nods "yes."
TRIPLETTE
Well, this is for people who have a
kind of religious belief in the way
they live.
155	NEW ANGLE
The waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef
starts to carve the meat. We FOLLOW one of the waiters into the
banquet hall.
It is almost full. The pianist and the drummer are on the non-
stage. At the far end of the roam, we SEE someone enter from the
street, go to the sign and read it.
157	NEW ANGLE - DOORWAY AND CORRIDOR
It is ALBUQUERQUE reading "banquet." The door to the room closes
and she goes down another corridor and disappears.
The men have finished their dinner and SUELEEN finishes her song.
The applause is thunderous. SUELEEN looks to the kitchen door.
159	ANGLE AT KITCHEN DOOR
TRIPLETTE is applauding like crazy. REESE in beside him.
160	ANGLE AT SUELEEN
She blows kisses then runs to TRIPLETTE.
SUELEEN
Don't you think they'd just love
another song instead?
TRIPLETTE
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not
what we talked about right here in
this very room.
It's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks.
ANNOUNCER
We're ready to striiippppp... for
cash, gentlemen. The time has come
to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in
going to dig deep for you.
There are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds
her and kisses her hair.
Page missing
165	NEW ANGLE
TRIPLETTE encases her in her coat. TRIPLETTE yells something
about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy.
166	NEW ANGLE
ALBUQUERQUE is totally fascinated and delighted, applauding to
the point of almost giving herself away. She picks up SUELEEN'S
clothes.
CUT TO:
REESE drives SUSLEEN home. He is drunk. He double-parks.
REESE
Here we are, Sueleen.
She looks out the window and nods. He gets out and opens the
door as LADY PEARL walks past them on her way to the lounge.
STAR drives up behind REESE'S double-parked ear and has to move
around it. SUELEEN starts for her room, but REESE follows very
close. Finally, he turns her around.
REESE
Sueleen... Sueleen Gay.
His look says what he wants. She is terrified.
SUELEEN
Oh, no.
She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm.
REESE
Wait a minute!
I want to look at
you. C'mon.
SUELEEN
Oh, please, Oh, God.
He pushes her against one or the storefronts.
REESE
C'mon! I Just wanna look...
He squeezes her arm and she screams.
167	CONTINUED:
REESE
Good. I wanna look really good.
You know what I mean? Do you?
Huh?
She is about to pass out from terror, when all or a sudden he
eases of.
168	NEW ANGLE
The TRICYCLE MAN stands and watches a few feet away. SUELEEN'S
terror now is divided between the two men. REESE can't handle
the way the TRICYCLE MAN looks at all.
REESE
Oh.
He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides
down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.
SUELEEN
It'll be okay... It'll be okay... I
know it'll be fine...
After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to
her room. The TRICYCLE MAN watches until she is gone, then walks
across the street.
((THE FOLLOWING IS INTERCUT WITH BANQUET)
TOM enters with L.A. JOAN. The place in crowded. WADE sits at a
table with LINNEA. She hasn't seen TOM.
WADE
I was in prison for twenty-eight
years.
LINNEA

WADE
Premeditated murder.
LINNEA
Oh.
WADE

Are you heavy?
LINNEA
I'm not sure...
WADE
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go
up or down?
LINNEA
What?
WADE
High?
Do you ever get high? A walk
on the wild side. Ever do dust?
Before TOM can sit down he is called on stage by the MC. Also
present are BILL, MARY and NORMAN, talking about NORMAN'S act and
OPAL, who interviews them. LINNEA sees TOM.
WADE
All I need is fifteen minutes a
night.
LINNEA
Fifteen minutes?
WADE
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't
want to waste no time sleeping. You
married?
LINNEA
What...?
0h, yes.
WADE
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody.
Ain't never been married. Won't
either.
170	ANGLE TOWARD STAGE
TOM stands at the mike.
TOM
Good evening. Thanks. I used to
be part of a group. You remember?
Everybody laughs.
TON
Well, they're here, Bill and Mary. We're cutting a record here.
So far, they've done all the work. It's an accident they're here.
I've been hiding from them for days now, right?
Everybody laughs.
BILL
You bet your sweet ass.
Everyone laughs.
171	ANGLE - LINNEA AND WADE
She in lost in the sound of his voice.
WADE
You know who that is?
LINNEA
Yea.
WADE
I see.
172	ANGLE - STAGE
WADE
TOM calls BILL and MARY to the stage. The three of them burst
into:
"Since You've Gone."
When they finish, BILL and MARY sit
down again.
TOM
I'd like to sing a new song for
you. I threw away a good one I wrote
yesterday. maybe it was the day
before -- anyway.. Let's go here,
'I'm Easy.'
173	NEW ANGLE
TOM seems to know where LINNEA is sitting and directs the song to
her. After he finishes, he gives the guitar back to its owner
and Joins L.-A. JOAN to walk out.
174	NEW ANGLE
WADE starts in again.
WADE
Love, that's a word that's been
overused. I'll say I sure like you.
Maybe...
LINNEA is wiping her eyes with a hanky.
A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and
L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL
and MARY catch him there. All the while he is talking to them,
he writes a note and places it in LINNEA'S lap. OPAL walks past
TOM. They look at each other.
BILL
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV
day after tomorrow. At the park...
TOM
National?
BILL
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
MARY
Where are you staying?
TOM
Is that for that Walker guy?
BILL
Yes, but we're just singing.
MARY
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
TOM
Come on. He's a crook.
BILL
What crook?
WADE
I'm a Roman Catholic. You're
Baptist, I bet. Catholic means
universal, everything, know what I
mean?
She nods again. She can't make out the writing with out her
glasses and she doesn't want to put them now.
WADE
I'm a scholar of the Bible as well
and we're all going to answer to
God. Have you read the book of
Revelations?
She nods 'yes.'
WADE
You ever read the 'Apocalypse
Unsealed?'
She is too curious. She takes out her glasses and looks through
them lorgnette style as WADE continues to talk.
TOM
I'm not coming anywhere near that
place. He's a rotten guy.
MARY
That's not true.
TOM
He's a politician.
BILL
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
TOM
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see
you in the morning.
MARY
Really?
TOM
You bet. Nine, right?
But count
me out of that other thing.
175	NEW ANGLE
TOM takes L.A. JOAN and leaves. LINNEA panics, BILL burns, OPAL
and MARY watch after TOM, NORMAN keeps silent.
WADE
My mother. died in '72. They told
me after. They said they couldn't
find me before, so they told us
after.
LINNEA
What?
WADE
They said go see the chaplain.
LINNEA
I'm sorry but I have to go.
She gets up quickly and leaves. Everybody is gone, too.
WADE
(to self)
I'm a hundred years old and when
I'm two hundred, I'll die.
CUT TO:
BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the
back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then
decides she'll be all right.
BARBARA JEAN
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
BARNETT
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel
now?
BARBARA JEAN
All those people...
She fights back the tears.
BARNETT
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
BARBARA JEAN
You're so good.
He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.
CUT TO:
There is some lovemaking going on in Tom's bed.
TOM
You're really terrific, you know

faces him.
LINNEA
I have to go.
TOM

LINNEA
I have to go. He sighs.
TOM

She makes a more to leave.
TOM
Stay.
LINNEA
I can't.
TOM
Car pool?
She laughs and eases out of the bed.
TOM
When did you think it would happen?
LINNEA
I'm not sure.
TOM
I knew when I first met you.
LINNEA
Oh.
She starts to go into the bathroom.
TOM
How old are you?
LINNEA
Older.
TOM
Thirty?
LINNEA
Well...
TOM
I'm twenty-eight
LINNEA
Oh.
TOM
Older than thirty?
She nods.
TOM
Terrific!
Who was that black guy?
A friend of yours?
LINNEA
That's unkind.
TOM
Come on, you ever been attracted to
a black guy?
She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the
door.
We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps
it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to
find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts
the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath.
She leaves the bathroom quickly.
TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her
slip. She finishes and heads for the door.
TOM
(into phone)
Just a minute.
He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her.
TOM
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
LINNEA
That's what you said before.
TOM
I know. Goodbye.
He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the
door, she is hit with something,
It is her slip.
TOM
Maybe you better keep that.
He smiles and she walks out the door.
GREEN is in bed. KENNY takes away a tray of cookies and hot
chocolate.
You okay?
GREEN
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you
really are.
KENNY
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see
you in the morning. Good night.
GREEN
Good night,
KENNY turns out the light and calls the dog. GREEN settles into
his pillow.
END OF TUESDAY.

As it speeds to the hospital. BARNETT is calm. He knows none of
it matters anyway.
