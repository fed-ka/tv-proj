Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
investigator...
Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
Mathews to see it looks official.
WELLES
I've been hired as an independent
contractor by the U.S. Resource
Center for Missing Persons as part
of an internal audit.
If you have
any time over the next few days, I'd
like to make an appointment to ask
some questions about the
disappearance of your daughter.
MRS MATHEWS
I don't understand, who are... ?
WELLES
I'm sorry, let me explain, the
R.C.M.P. is a support organization
and archive, not unlike the Center
for Missing and Exploited Children
in Washington.
I'm sure you've
dealt with them before?
MRS MATHEWS
Yes, but...
WELLES
These volunteer organizations are
sort of interconnected, functioning
hand in hand with law enforcement.
The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
their investigations...
(holds up clipboard)
... fact-check their records, see if
there's anything they missed,
anything they should be doing
different.
I'm here for a few days,
before I head back up to Virginia.
These reports go to the Justice
Department eventually.
I spoke to
your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
uh...
Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...
WELLES
What was the name... ? I've got it
here somewhere...
MRS MATHEWS
Neil... Neil Cole.
WELLES
(pretends he found it)
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
and let you know to expect me.
He
didn't call?
MRS MATHEWS
No.
WELLES
(looking on legal pad)
Well, I'm following up on your
daughter, Mary, height; five four,
weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
eyes, blonde hair.
Born April 24,
1976.
Missing June 11th, 1992.
A
runaway, that's how she's listed.
Is this information correct... ?
Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.
WELLES
I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
Is there a more convenient time... ?
(looks at watch)
Can I buy you lunch, would that be
alright?
Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.
DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY
Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.
WELLES
It's very important you don't let
this raise your expectations.
It's
not going to effect any ongoing
efforts.
All I'm saying is, please
know, I'm not here to create any
false hope.
MRS MATHEWS
They hired you.
You're like, a
private detective?
WELLES
That's exactly what I am.
Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.
MRS MATHEWS
I didn't think there were private
detectives anymore, except on TV.
WELLES
You probably expect me to be wearing
a trench coat and a hat.
Drinking
whiskey, chasing women and getting
beaten up by guys with broken noses.
Want to know what it's really like?
It's sitting in a car and staring at
a hotel window for three days
straight, pissing in a plastic
bottle, pardon me, because some guy
thinks his wife's cheating on him.
Glamorous, huh?
And the guy who
hired you, he has a hair-lip,
dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
could have told him the minute you
laid eyes on him his wife's
cheating, and you don't blame her.
Mrs. Mathews smiles.
WELLES
It's refreshing to actually sit down
and meet someone face to face,
someone nice like you.
Welles smiles.
Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.
Welles
lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.
WELLES
So, she didn't leave a note?
She
never gave any indication where she
might go, before she left?
MRS MATHEWS
No.
WELLES
She just seemed... depressed... ?
MRS MATHEWS
She didn't seem herself.
For months
there never was any way to get her
to talk about it.
One night we went
to bed... the next morning she was
gone.
She took some clothes.
WELLES
What was she running from?
MRS MATHEWS
I don't know.
WELLES
If there's anything you feel
uncomfortable talking about, tell
me, but I have to ask.
Your
husband... he committed suicide?
MRS MATHEWS
Yes.
WELLES
September 4th, 1993.
About a year
after Mary disappeared.
MRS MATHEWS
We were divorced by then.
Things
fell apart... he was living with a
friend...
WELLES
Why do you think he did it?
MRS MATHEWS
It got to be too much for him.
WELLES
You have to forgive me, but in these
circumstances... with your
daughter...
(pause)
Were there any indications of... any
sort of abuse?
MRS MATHEWS
There wasn't anything like that.
The police and the FBI people asked,
but there wasn't anything happened
like that, never.
My husband... his
heart broke when Mary left...
WELLES
I didn't mean to...
MRS MATHEWS
You try going through what we did.
Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
Christ, there's times when it still
seems like I can't either.
WELLES
I had to ask.
I apologize.
MRS MATHEWS
No one knows what it's like.
You
can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Welles is miserable.
A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
Mrs. Mathews.
She tries not to notice then noticing.
MRS MATHEWS

Can you drive me back now?
WELLES
Of course.

Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE
ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.
Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.
DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT
Heavy forests border close to the road.
Welles' car travels
alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.
IN THE CAR
Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
neon and peeled paint: "Big Bear Motor Lodge."
Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...
ON THE ROADWAY
Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.
Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...
BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.
IN THE CAR
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the
abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
with attached wings of rooms on both sides.
The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
skeleton.
What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
boarded over, falling apart.
No window has gone unbroken.
IN THE LOT
Welles turns out headlights and parks.
He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.
A CAR is HEARD.
HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
forest as the CAR PASSES.
Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.
BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and
flashlight, into the dense forest...
EDDIE
What are you thinking you're gonna
do... ?
Welles shoves Eddie ahead.
WELLES
Keep moving.
EDDIE
Where do you think you're taking
this, huh?
Gonna be a big hero,
avenge that little girl's death?
Gonna make everything right with the
world?
How you gonna do that... ?
FURTHER ON
Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...
EDDIE
You can't go to the cops.
All you
can do is cut me loose and walk
away, because you got nothing...
WELLES
Stop talking.
EDDIE
You got absolute zero.
WELLES
Show me where you buried her.
EDDIE
I don't know...
(nods to forest)
... out there somewhere.
WELLES
Where?
Show me where.
EDDIE
I fucking don't know.
What do you
think... we weren't burying
treasure.
We didn't pace it out so
we could come back and get it.
We
dug a hole and we put her in it.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.
EDDIE
You'll never find her.
Nobody ever
will, and even if they did, it
doesn't mean nothing.
Bring in the
cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
all.
Without the film, it never
happened.
Don't you get it?
It's
over.
You can't do anything.
Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.
WELLES
I can kill you.
I can leave you out
here, just like you left her.
Eddie's not backing down.
EDDIE
Do it.
WELLES
Don't think I won't.
EDDIE
Do it!
Put me out of my misery so
I don't have to listen to you
whining anymore.
You think it's so
easy?
WELLES
Easy enough for you.
EDDIE
I never killed anyone.
WELLES
That's right, you just stood there
and watched, because you "felt like
it."
Almost makes you worse.
EDDIE
What do you want?
You want me to
fall to my knees and start crying
like a baby... ?
Eddie walks towards Welles.
Welles backs away...
EDDIE
Where you going?
You're the one
with the gun.
Aren't I defenseless
enough?
Come on...
Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.
EDDIE
Go ahead and kill me.
Kill me with
that gun, your gun, right,
registered in your name?
Dig the
hole yourself, with your bare hands,
bury the body with your bullets in
it.
Fucking do it!
Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
forehead, pulls back the hammer...
Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.
Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...
MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.
IN THE CAR
Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
wit's end.
He opens the glove compartment, finds
cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.
He looks back to the motel room.
He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
PHONE.
After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
it in his hand.
IN THE LOT
Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
staring at the sky.
He closes his eyes, smokes.
Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
pages through, studies one page.
Welles sits up.
He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
(from phone)
Hello... ?
WELLES
(into phone)
Mrs. Mathews?
It's Thomas.
Do you
remember, I was there a few weeks
ago... asking about your daughter...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
(from phone)
I remember.
You just left...
WELLES
(into phone)
I have to tell you something.
It
won't be easy for you to hear.
It's
about your daughter... Mary Anne...
(struggling)
When I... when I was there with you,
her diary, in your attic, in
silverware.
If you read it, you'll
know what I'm telling you is true...
Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
What are you talking about... ?
WELLES
She went to California, to Los
Angeles... she wanted to start over.
She wanted to be an actress...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
What... ?
Tears comes to Welles' eyes.
It's the hardest thing he's
ever had to do in his entire life.
WELLES
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
She's dead.
MRS MATHEWS
Who is this... ?
WELLES
Someone... some men, they took your
daughter and they drugged her, and
they took her to a motel room...
they did terrible things to her...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
Who are you?
WELLES
They brought her into the room...
one man, he put a knife to her
throat and he raped her...
MRS MATHEWS
No...
WELLES
He raped her and...and...and he
murdered her...he cut her up with
knifes...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
No... no... no...
WELLES
They killed her, and they took her
out in the forest somewhere and they
buried her...
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
Why... why are you doing this to
me... ?
WELLES
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
sorry.
It happened a month after
she ran away.
She's been dead all
this time...
MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...
WELLES
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
wasn't anything anyone could do...
Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
ground, utterly drained.
He puts his forearm over his eyes,
gasping, sucking air...
He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
it to fuel his rage...
He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
gun and pours the bullets out.
He closes the gun and walks
towards the motel room...
MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.
CRICKETS and
distant BIRDS.
We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
through the open door of the room.
A CAR is HEARD, getting
LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.
Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
red.
His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.
Welles looks back into the room, backing away.
He turns and
goes to his car...
IN THE CAR
Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
shirt, revolted.
He starts the car.
EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT
Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...
EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT
Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...
EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.
He
gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
headlights off.
BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle
HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.
MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT
The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...
QUEENS STREET -- DAY
A relatively quiet residential street.
HOMES are small, two
story affairs, close together, each very much like its
neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.
Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.
CHILDREN in
school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.
Welles parallel parks.
IN THE CAR
Welles turns off the engine.
He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.
The
house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.
Cars pass in the street.
Welles watches school children
pass on the near sidewalk.
He slumps down a little in his
seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
mirror, rolling up the window.
Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
pours bullets out and pockets them.
He picks up a PAPER BAG
off the passenger seat and opens it.
He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.
Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
the gun's inner barrel.
DISSOLVE TO:
QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY
Welles crosses the street, going to his car.
He gets into
his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.
WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY
BIRDS SING.
KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the
street.
Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.
WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY
Dusk.
A CAR comes down the street, slows...
IN THE CAR
Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.
Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.
WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY
Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing
his yard.
He has done some healing, though his face is
still swollen and terribly bruised.
WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT
Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,
leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.
SUPERMARKET -- DAY
Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
into the back seat of his Ford.
HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.
