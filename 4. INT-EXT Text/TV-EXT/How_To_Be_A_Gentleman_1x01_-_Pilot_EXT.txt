      Alan walks down the street carrying a bag of GROCERIES. He 
      approaches a HOMELESS MAN. 

                                  ALAN (V.O.)
                    While a gentleman finds great 
                    pleasure in helping the less 
                      fortunate...  

      Alan stops and gives an APPLE from his bag to the homeless 
      man.  As Alan walks off he is PEGGED in the back of the head 
      with the apple.                                                                                        3.

                                  ALAN (V.O.)
                    ... he never expects praise in 
                    return. 


      Alan walks into Bert s gym to find Bert training J.J.

                                  BERT
                    C mon, J.J.!  It s the magic hour!
                          (seeing Alan)
                    Alan, hey buddy!  So?  How d it go 
                    last night?  Any nippage?

                                  ALAN
                    No.  Dating my neighbor was a 
                    mistake, Bert.

                                  BERT
                    In retrospect, it does seem like a 
                    bad idea. 

      Alan glares back at him.  

                                  ALAN
                    I m glad we agree.  
                          (forging on)
                    Here.  This is for you.  

      Alan hands Bert a GREETING CARD.  Bert opens it.

                                  BERT
                          (reading card slowly)
                     For Bert.  Thanks for your fried 
                    shit?                                                                                       34.

                                  ALAN
                       Friendship.   The word is 
                       friendship. 

                                  BERT
                    That makes more sense.  You have 
                    the handwriting of a pirate.  

                                  ALAN
                    It s calligraphy.  

      Bert holds up a PIECE OF PAPER from inside the card.

                                  BERT
                    What s this? 

                                  ALAN
                    My credit card info.  I d like to 
                    become a member of Bert s Body shop.   

                                  BERT
                    No shit?  

                                  ALAN
                    No shit. 

      Bert is touched.

                                  BERT
                    Ya know, when I took over this 
                    place, my pops told me I d probably 
                    screw it up like I have everything 
                    else.  But this right here... this 
                    says I m not a screw up. It says you 
                    trust me.  It says  eff you, pops! 
                    Look at me now, you son of a bitch!   
                          (sincerely)
                    Thanks, Alan, for helping me rub it 
                    my old man s face.    

                                  ALAN
                    ... You re welcome?

                                  BERT
                    Alright, enough with the gab.  Let s 
                    sweat.  

                                  ALAN (V.O.)
                    Because he is a gentleman, he is 
                    open to a new adventure. 

      MUSIC KICKS IN underneath the following MONTAGE:                                                                                    35.
