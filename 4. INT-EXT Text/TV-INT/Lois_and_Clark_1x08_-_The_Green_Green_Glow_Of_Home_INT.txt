		Wait!  Wayne!

		He couldn't wait to get off the

				CLARK
		Wayne's never been much of a

	Perry, in a yoga-like posture, listens to what sound like	*
	BIRDS, FALLING RAIN and INSECTS.  Jimmy knocks and enters.
	He moves into the office, then stops.  A very curious
	expression crosses his face.

				JIMMY
		Chief?

				PERRY
		The Rain Forest, Jimmy.  The	*
		sounds of nature promote harmony	*
		in all living things.  There are no
		wild animals with high blood
		pressure.

				JIMMY
		Still stressing, huh?

				PERRY
			(stressing)
		I am not 'stressing.'
			(really stressing)
		What do you want?

				JIMMY
		Clark's on the line.

	Perry punches up the line.

				PERRY
		Kent? What have you got for me?

28	INTERCUT: PERRY'S OFFICE / KENT HOME		28

	Clark sits at the kitchen table, talking.

				CLARK
		Not much.  Lois probably ought to	*
		head back and I can wrap up.	*

	Cat enters Perry's office. Mouths "Lois", holds up two
	fingers.  She rolls her eyes at Jimmy, like she's just
	said something distasteful, then exits.

				PERRY
		Kent.  Hang on a second.
			(punches up a second

		Lois, is that you?

				LOIS
		Something tells me we got a big one

				PERRY
		Could you hold on?

	Perry puts Lois on hold, punches up Clark.

				PERRY
			(continuing)
		Now, Kent, you talked to Lois about
		this?

				CLARK
		Yeah.

				PERRY
		And she agrees with you?

				CLARK
		Well, you know Lois.  Anything she
		puts time into, she expects to be a
		big story.

				PERRY
		I see.  Be right with you.
			(to Lois)
		Lois, you and Kent, you discussed
		all this and he's with you.

	As Lois talks, she begins to wander the house, toward the
	kitchen.

				LOIS
		You know Clark, he doesn't have the
		experience yet to see when
		somebody's feeding him a line.

				PERRY
		Lois, I'm going to call you right

			(punches another line)

	And, suddenly, they know.



	Back in Perry's office, he slowly hangs up, turns to
	Jimmy.

				PERRY
		Uh, Jimmy, I think I need a photog
		out there.

				JIMMY
		Ready, Chief.

				PERRY
		Let's see.  What's Johnston up to?

				JIMMY
		Johnston's in Utah.  But I'd

				PERRY
		I got it.  Sevison?

				JIMMY
		Winnipeg.

				PERRY
		Photographers! Just when you need

				JIMMY
		Maybe there's a new guy looking for
		an opportunity.

				PERRY
		No.  Don't want to take the chance.

				JIMMY
		Somebody had to take a chance on
		you once, didn't they?

	Perry looks up at Jimmy, weighing this small insurrection,
	but appreciating the desire behind it.  Finally:

				PERRY
		All right, all right. You go.

	Jimmy breaks into a big smile, impulsively hugs Perry.

				JIMMY
		Thanks, Chief.

	Trask has Clark under guard, glares at him.

				TRASK
		I'm going to make you a deal,
		trusting that your stay in
		Metropolis has put some sense in
		your head.  Give up the alien and
		I'll let you live.

				CLARK
		What makes you think I could do

				TRASK
		Superman came to Smallville around
		the time you were born.  There has
		to be a connection.  Tell me and
		you live.

				CLARK
		There's nothing to tell. I'm
		learning all this for the first

	Trask slams the palm of his hand on the table.

				CLARK
		Nobody's infused me with power.
		Nobody's taken over my mind.

	Sherman enters, whispers to Trask.

				SHERMAN
		We've got a location on Irig.
			(looks at Clark)
		He's heading down the access road
		to the home of a Jonathan Kent.

	Trask looks hard at Clark.

				TRASK
		You should have told me it was a
		family affair.  I would have gone
		easier on you.

	Now Trask is in motion, hurling orders to his agents.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Put him in the van with me.  Make
		sure the phone lines are cut at the
		Kent house.  I'll take two men with
		me.  The rest of you break camp.
		Meet at Delta rendezvous at 1800.

				SHERMAN
		What about me?

				TRASK
			(with contempt)
		What about you?  You'll stay and
		help move the operation.

		Let's go.

	OFF Clark's reaction, we:

					CUT TO:



	Jonathan sits on a bail of hay, staring at the tool box
	with the green rock.  Martha watches.

				JONATHAN
		I don't know what to do with it.  I
		can't give it to anybody but I sure
		as heck don't want to keep this
		anywhere near Clark.

				MARTHA
		Sometimes I don't understand why
		things happen.  How all his life
		he's always talked about being
		'normal.'  Now he is.  It's what
		he says he wants, but...

				JONATHAN
		It doesn't feel right.  Because
		Clark's not normal.  Normal for him
		is being super.  Until I opened
		that box...

	Jonathan's voice trails off, still blaming himself.
	Martha moves to comfort him.

				MARTHA
		You didn't do this to him.

	There are FOOTSTEPS outside in the yard.  Then they hear a
	shout:

				IRIG
		Jonathan!  It's Wayne Irig!

				JONATHAN
		Wayne!

	Irig enters, looking the worse for wear.  He has a	*
	bandana wrapped around his broken hand.  Jonathan tries	*
	to calm him.

				JONATHAN
			(continuing)
		Wayne!  My God, look at you.  What
		did they do to you?

				IRIG
		We've got a problem, Jonathan.  A

		No, I'm all right.  But, there's

		They're looking for that rock I

			(more emphatic)
		We've got to get to the police.

		We been friends for years, Wayne.
		You trust me, don't you?

				IRIG
		Sure.

				JONATHAN
		Then believe me.  That green rock

		What do you mean, 'dangerous?'
		What does it do?

		It makes some people sick, that's

		You and me, we're going to go

	Trask kicks open the door to the shed.  He is backed-up by
	several agents.

				TRASK
		I don't think so.
