        A CRAPHOLE.  MOVING BOXES everywhere.  Two indifferent 
        MOVING MEN struggle to move a large CABINET out the front 
        door.  SMASH!  Into the doorway--

        SARAH BRAVERMAN (37), pretty but worn and constantly on 
      edge from years of single parenting, follows them out to 
        the hallway stairs. 

                                        SARAH
                      Like I said it s been in the family for 
                      years, are you sure--

                                        SARAH
                      --Well, I have to tell you, I don t like 
                      that angle.  Maybe if we just had a 
                      little strategy session here--

        SLAM!  Into the metal railing.

                                        SARAH
                      Okay, okay.  I m not going to watch this--

      MOVE with Sarah as she heads into her apartment where 
      DREW (12) at that awkward pre-teen period of having 
        recently discovered his penis, plays Nintendo.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Drew, could you pretend to help?  Amber, 
                      we are moving in a half hour, I do not 
                      want to hit that traffic... Amber!

        She flings open the door to Amber s room and stops cold.  
        EMPTY!  The window leading to the fire escape is open 
        wide.  Sarah just stares, dumbfounded.  Then recovers. 
        Smiles.  She s isn t going to let this get to her.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)

        Where we find ADAM BRAVERMAN (41).  Beneath this affable, 
        humane, good looking guy there is an insane lunatic, 
        driven beyond reason to have a normal, happy family.  
        Adam, dressed in his coach s jacket and baseball cap, 
        kneels next to his son, adjusting his uniform which is a 
        little askew as usual.  MAX (8) is sweet, quirky, a bit 
         off,  as Adam continues.

                                        ADAM
                      This season is all about learning.  
                      Taking swings.  Going for it.  If you 
                      strike out, you strike out.  I want to 
                      see you take your cuts.  Sound good?

        Max looks at Adam and says simply.

                                        MAX
                      Do I have to go?

                                        ADAM
                      Max, you don t have to go.  This is not a 
                      have to.  This is a want to.

                                        MAX
                      Do I have to want to?

        KRISTINA (37), Adam's pretty, wise and quietly forceful 
        wife, who loves her husband and kids, but would also love 
      at some point to get her life back, witnesses this.  A 
      look is shared between Adam and Kristina -- one that says 
        they re both concerned about this little boy.  

        HADDIE (15), their pretty, good-girl daughter walks by on 
        her way out, cell phone in one hand, iPod in the other. 

                                        HADDIE

                      game.

                      Honey, she s fifteen.  

                                        ADAM
                      You realize in three years she ll be in 
                      college.  After that we will never see 
                      our daughter again.  We have a hundred 
                      and fifty weekends left and then it s 
                      game over.

                                        KRISTINA
                      That s such a healthy perspective.

        Max comes out in his uniform, still looking slightly 
        disheveled -- shirt half untucked, etc.  Adam looks at 
        Max with a big smile.

                                        ADAM
                      You look great.  The glove goes on the

        JULIA BRAVERMAN (32) is beautiful, successful smart, even 
      in her sweats and a ponytail she could still do a 
        magazine shoot.  She has meticulously packed the back of 
        their SUV-hybrid with picnic lunch, frisbee, picnic 
        blankets, etc.  Her angelic looking daughter SYDNEY (5)  
        comes out, still sleepy eyed, and Julia kisses her all 
      over her body.

      JOEL (early 30s), Sydney's startling good looking stay-at-
        home-dad husband walks out--

                      three of us.  I m talking frisbee.  I m 
                      talking kids concert in the park.  I m 
                      talking crazy ass bonding.

                      That s today?  Oh no.  Do we really want 
                      to eat pizza at ten in the morning?  I

                      google.  Like infinity tokens.

        Julia looks at the picnic lunch she just worked for hours 
        preparing.  Then at Sydney s pleading eyes, Julia does 
      what is harder for her than most people, switch gears.  
        She reaches for a large bottle of Purell and puts on a 
        brave smile--

        Crosby hangs up and reaches into the freezer and grabs 
        the coffee.  He stops, seeing something odd:

                      Whatever.  Could you not floss in front 
                      of me.  It s gross.

                                        SARAH
                      Do not whatever me.  You know that you 
                      are not allowed to smoke.  And you are 
                      certainly not to smoke in your grandma 
                      and grandpa s house.  We are guests here.

                      Screw this up.  And I ll kill you.

        Sarah walks out--



        Where she is set up to sleep.  She stops to look at 
        Zeek's fondest memories -- he as a soldier, an actor, 
      with all his children.  Sarah smiles sadly.  She reaches 
      into the small middle drawer in his desk and looks 
        around, finds a scissor, cuts off a tag on her pajamas.  
        She puts the scissor back, is about to close the drawer 
      when she notices something disturbing--

        She reaches in and pulls out a box of condoms.  OFF 
        Sarah, looking completely confused on the way to being 
        devastated, we,

                      scrambled eggs.  How am I supposed to

                      This is like oppressive.

        Max comes in dressed for school, which in his case means 
      he is in full pirate regalia.  Haddie looks at her 
        parents to see what they re going to say.

                      Hey, pal.  I made you eggs.

      Adam puts the eggs on a plate in front of him.  Max 
        shakes some salt and pepper on them, takes a forkful, 
      puts them in his mouth, starts to chew, and then spits 
      them out all over the table.

      Adam just looks at him for a long beat, then--

      with a bunch of girlfriends.  They re all pretty enough 
      to not seem like dorks, but too well behaved to be 
        considered cool.  Amber notices Haddie whispering 
        something to her friends, and they all look over to 
        Amber.  Amber smiles back, annoyed.  Haddie rises and 
        walks over to Amber.

        PAN a 2nd grade class doing an art project.  Jeans, t-
        shirts, sneaks, until we reach Max, the pirate.  They are 
        cutting out pieces of construction paper in different 
        shapes -- maybe for a kite.  Max is having trouble 
        cutting a straight line.  Embarrassed, he takes the 
        construction paper and hides it under him, sitting on it, 
        and tries his luck on another piece of paper.  He screws 
      up again, and with building anxiety, hides another piece 
      of paper under him and starts again.  AMOS a kid next to

                      us.

        Max doesn t respond.  He stars to cut another piece of 
        paper, again he isn t satisfied with the result and he 
        starts again.  A NICE GIRL next to him, notices--

                      Max, do you want me to help you?

        But Max experiences this as more embarrassment.  Max 
        starts to cut another piece of construction paper, messes 
      up again.  Now a few other KIDS are noticing.  Whispers.  
      He messes up one more time, and Amos just slaps his own 
      face with his hand in frustration.

        All of a sudden Max loses it.  He lunges for Amos and 
        attacks him.

        The Teacher, MS. A (20s), earnest and NPR-like, makes a

        The Teacher pulls Max off Amos and looks at the entire 
        class who is out of their seats, staring at Max.

                      anxiety, that he doesn t feel safe.

                      we re not sure Sullivan Elementary is the 
                      right fit for Max.

                      He may need an environment where he gets 
                      more support.

        Kristina and Adam look at the room, suddenly the whole 
        dynamic has shifted as they realize this was the purpose 
        for this whole meeting.

                                        ADAM
                      Are you giving us the boot?  Are we

                      I think we need more information.  We d 
                      like you to bring Max in for educational

        Kristina and Adam stare at them, barely able to process 
      this news.

        crack up, she totally knows how to work it.  She points 
      over to Haddie and the others, and the guys all look 
        over.  Haddie, Georgia and Stella wave back lamely.  And 
        Amber walks back over.

        Sarah walks the gauntlet past scary looking guys in

        are there with a cluster of PARENTS.  Amber, Haddie,

        But Kristina is a little less warm than usual, and Sarah 
        feels stares from some of the other Moms.   Amber glares 
      at Haddie who does nothing to dispel the myth that this 
      is all Haddie s fault.

                      Hi... / Welcome to Philadelphia.

        But they re decidedly cool, which is not lost on Sarah.  
        Clearly Amber is taking the blame for all this, and Sarah 
      is guilty by association.

                      I want her to have this.  I competed until 
                      I was twelve.  Gymnastics was an incredibly 
                      powerful part of my growing up.

                      I feel like I m not getting to raise my 
                      daughter.  It s not fair.

        Max sits at a table across from DR. CAROLINE SANCHEZ a 
        warm, empathic developmental pediatrician.  Adam and 
        Kristina sit on the other side of the office, observing, 
        trying not to look tense, nervous and emotional. 

                                        DR. SANCHEZ

        Dr. Sanchez takes a series of small, wooden blocks and 
        places them one after the other.  She puts four in a row, 
        and then takes the fifth block and places it on top.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Choo!  Choo!  Look what I did, Max.  I 
                      made a train.  Choo, choo!  See that?

        Max nods indicating he does.  Then Dr. Sanchez takes the 
        blocks and scrambles them up on the table.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Okay, now you do it!

        Max looks at Dr. Sanchez, unsure.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Go ahead, try to make a train just like I 
                      did.

        Max tentatively reaches out and starts to move the blocks 
        around.  This is painful because he isn t able to make 
        the train.  Adam watches, squirming out of his skin.  
        Kristina too.  Max finishes.  It s totally wrong.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      That s good.  Okay, let s try again, Max.  

        She makes the exact same train.  

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      See it?  Okay.  Take a really good look 
                      at it.  Okay, now you try.

        She scrambles up the blocks again.  

                                        ADAM
                      Max, focus, dude.

        Dr. Sanchez looks over to Adam and smiles--

                      Of course it s a test.  This is 
                      ridiculous.  Who cares about blocks?

                      Jim!  Oh, my God...

        JIM has gained a lot of weight, lost a lot of hair and 
        way less dressed than for the occasion than Sarah.  Sarah 
          overcompensates for her shocked disappointment with 
        unbridled enthusiasm--

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Jim!  Wow.

                      You look great.

                                        SARAH
                      And you... You look so different.  

      They do one of those sort or handshakes, sort of hugs, 
        and end up bumping heads.

                      That was.  I didn t realize you were 
                      approaching from the right.

                                        SARAH

                      Yeah, I take the kids here all the time 
                      back in Trenton, so it s 
                        really...familiar.  Anyway, Julia told me 
                      you ran into her at Starbucks near her 
                      office.  Do you work downtown too?

                      Oh, no, it s fine, I ll order some 
                      appetizers.

        Sarah is speed dialing on her cell as she heads out to--



        Crosby is leaving the studio for the night and he sees a 
        light on in Katie s office.  He stands out there, makes a 
        decision and gives two short knocks and walks in.  Katie 
        looks up wearily from her laptop -- she s paying the 
        bills.

        late, she s already coming into him and kissing him, all

                      That s okay.

        Sarah goes to her father s desk and takes out his sinful,

                      Hey, you think your dad still has that

                      Let s find out.

        Sarah puts on Jim's flannel shirt, and they sneak out 
        into--



      They walk into the kitchen, and start looking through all 
        the cabinets.  It s sweet and fun and super-immature.

                      Ooh, chocolate covered pretzels.  Yum.

                      I really couldn t.

      He says as he shoves a few into his mouth.  

                                        SARAH
                      Eureka.  

        Sarah pulls out a bottle of really gross looking 
        blackberry Brandy.

                      Yesssss!

      As Sarah takes a big hit off the bottle, LIGHT goes on.  
      It s Drew.  He looks at his mom wearing nothing but a 
        man s flannel shirt and holding a fifth of booze.  Then 
      he looks at Jim, wearing only his white Hanes briefs that 
        probably are a size too small.  Mortified, the only words 
        out of Sarah s mouth are:

                                        SARAH
                      Hey, honey, how was your dinner with 
                      Uncle Adam?

      Drew just turns and goes back into his room.

                               ACT THREE



        Sarah pulls to a stop outside the school and Drew is 
        about to get out.  Sort of a moment of truth.  She s got 
      to say something.

                                        SARAH
                      Drew...?

      He stops for a moment, his hand still on the door handle, 
        indicating he s not up for a big talk.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      About what happened last night.

                                        DREW
                      It s okay.  I don t want to--

                                        SARAH
                      I know I m your mom, but I m also a 
                      woman... Oh God, delete, delete, delete.  
                      What I m trying to say is that no matter 
                      what you saw last night, and no matter 
                      what permanent indelible mark it might 
                      have left on your memory, that I m first 
                      and foremost your mother and that you and 
                      Amber are my number one priorities.  
                      Always.  

        There s a long beat, Drew seems thoughtful, then--

                                        DREW
                      I want to move back in with Dad.

        Sarah s expression freezes.  She is completely blind-
        sided. 

                                        SARAH
                      What?

                                        DREW
                      Look, I m glad you re able to be with 
                      your brothers and sisters and your old 
                      boyfriends or whatever, but this isn t 
                      home to me.  I want to be back in 
                      Trenton.  So I figure it makes sense.

                                        SARAH
                      Drew, you don t even know your father.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   50.



                                        DREW
                      Yes I do. 

      Drew gets out of the car and closes the door.  Sarah sits 
        there, flabbergasted.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Julia is getting ready for the day (Joel and Sydney have 
        already left) and she walks by Joel s office.  She stops 
        for a minute, looking at his computer.  She walks up to 
        it.  It s opened to his AOL account.  She sits.  Looks at 
        the screen.  Growing disturbed.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Joel s laptop now sits on the kitchen island.  Julia 
        paces back and forth as Kristina and Sarah crowd around 
        the computer reading through it.

                                        JULIA
                      Tell me I m crazy.  Am I over reacting?

                                        SARAH
                      You re not over reacting.

                                        KRISTINA
                      I m seeing a trend here.  First they re 
                      very formal.  Who s picking up who, who s 
                      bringing the coffee, and then they get 
                      more and more friendly.

                                        SARAH
                         Joelskies ?  What is that about?

                                        KRISTINA
                      And those insidious little smiley faces.

                                        SARAH
                      And you see right here, on this November

                      Sarah s right, that s significant.  You 
                       xoxo  girlfriends, you could do it to 
                      your husband, you don t do it to a person

                                        JULIA
                      Joel would never have a...a thing.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      Well, you must have called us for a 
                      reason, Julia.

        Julia looks at them, then--

                                        JULIA
                      Read the most recent one.

        Sarah and Kristina open an e-mail, each of them filling 
      with rage as they read--

                                        SARAH
                      Oh no--

                                        KRISTINA
                      This is not good.



        Julia drives by in her car and cranes her neck looking 
        through the window of this groovy, cafe.  She gets 
        distracted seeing Joel and Racquel at a table.  A honk.  
        A swerve.  A near miss.  Julia pulls over and a car goes 
      by flipping her the bird.  Julia has landed in a good 
      spot from which to spy on.  Feeling like an idiot she 
        takes out a pair of binoculars and looks through them.  

      IN THE RESTAURANT Joel and Racquel, smile at each other.  
        They re fighting over the check.  Their hands touch, 
        their eyes meet.  Julia watches, feeling ill.

      Adam pulls to a stop with Max, in his pirate costume.  
        Max walks out of the car, is about to close the door--

                                        ADAM
                      Max.  Your bookbag.

        Max reaches in and gets his bookbag.  Adam gets out and 
        starts walking Max up the block to the school.  Adam 
        looks his son, watching everything in a new way.  Another 
        student passes Max--

                                        OTHER STUDENT
                      Hey Max!

        Max doesn t respond.

                                        ADAM
                      Max.  That kid just said hello to you.  
                      If you don t say hello he ll think you re 
                      being rude.

                                        MAX
                      Okay.

                                        ADAM
                      Did you hear him say hello?

                                        MAX
                      Uh-huh.

        Adam s heart is breaking in two.  The bell rings.  Max 
        turns to leave.

                                        ADAM
                      Max? -- Max!

        Max turns.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      I love you.

        Max smiles, and turns around and walks away.  Adam 
        watches.  Devastated.  The whole thing is sinking in on 
      him.  Hitting him like a ton of bricks.  PAUL, another 
      dad, approaches somberly.

                                        ADAM
                      Hey, Paul.

                                        PAUL
                      Listen this is a little uncomfortable.  
                      The board at the Little League had a 
                      meeting last night.  The consensus was it 
                      might be better if you stepped aside.  
                      Let someone else coach the rest of the 
                      year.  Jordan Shefranick s dad is able to 
                      step in.

      Adam nods.  Not entirely thrilled.  Not surprised either.  
      Then the tough part--

                                        PAUL (CONT D)
                      And Adam, they ve also asked me to tell 
                      you that you can t be present at future 
                      games.  They ve gotten some complaints 
                      from some parents.  Apparently, the 
                      Umpire is threatening a lawsuit.  Really 
                      sorry, Adam.  
                                (then, compelled)
                      It was a bad call.

      Paul walks away.  HOLD on Adam.

        away.  She grabs it again.  Doesn t let go.  She s going 
      to have a family moment if she has to pull their hands 
        out of their sockets.  Zeek seated next to Camille -- he

                      Shut up.

        Everyone looks over to Crosby who is rolling Haddie s pot 
      into two joints.

                      What are you doing?      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   64.

                      I think the most parental thing we can do 
                      right now is see exactly what kind of 
                      mischief Haddie has been getting herself 
                      involved in.  From the look of things, I 
                      think it s Columbian mischief.  But 
                      there s a slight possibility this could 
                      be Hawaiian mischief.

                                        ADAM

                                        SARAH
                      You really are turning into Dad.

                                        ADAM
                      Who says I m turning into Dad?

                      Everyone.

        A joint is lit.  It s passed.  Some smoke.  Some don t.  
        (Look forward do many conversations with standards and 
        practices.)  Adam shakes his head, grows thoughtful, 
        looks at Kristina, then he just says to everyone.

                                        ADAM
                      Max is autistic.  He s got, what is that 
                      called...?

                      Aspergers.

        Everyone takes this in.  Then Sarah reaches out and takes 
        Kristina s hand.  Crosby puts an arm around Adam s back.  
        Julia takes his hand.  Somehow a joint gets lit.  Passed 
        around.  Adam doesn t smoke, but he just sort of shakes 
        his head, not really judging it.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)

                      that.

                      It s okay.

      Adam walks in with a big bag of bagels and other brunch

                      They were out of salt bagels again.  I 
                      know we don t like to have this 
                        conversation, but I think we may need to 
                      consider changing our bagelry.

        But Kristina stares at the window.  She indicates for 
      Adam to come over.  Adam does and the two of them look 
        out the window at 

      ZEEK & MAX

        They re playing in the backyard.  Zeek is throwing tennis 
        balls to Max who joyfully swings at them with a 
        broomstick.  Max is having fun.  Zeek is having fun.  We 
      hear Zeek say things like,  That s okay, you ll hit the 
      next one.   We see Max hit a crappy grounder and Zeek 
        says,  That s a hit, baby...   Etc.  

      Adam watches, moved, he takes Kristina s hand.

        Brunch is on.  Everyone but Crosby is here.  Lots of 
        reaching for bagels.  Sarah looks at Camille for a beat, 
      then makes a decision.  She walks up to Zeek and speaks, 
      very quietly very firmly--

                      talk to Mom.  If you don t, I will.

        And she walks away.  Hold on Zeek for a beat.  Crosby 
        walks in, goes to Adam.

                      Listen, I just want to let you know I m 
                      sorry.  I blamed you for the whole thing 
                      with Haddie.  And I shouldn t have.

                                        AMBER
                      Good.  Listen, I have good news.  I 
                      decided not to move back to Trenton with 
                      Damien.

                                        SARAH
                      That is so great.

                                        AMBER
                      He s moving here.  Turns out the music 
                      scene in Philly blows Trenton out of the 
                      water.  The entire band s coming.  

        Sarah s smile freezes.

                                        SARAH
                      We ll talk about it.

                                        AMBER
                      What are we going to talk about?  They re 
                      on their way.

                                        SARAH
                      They are not on their way.

                                        AMBER
                      How do I say this?  They re on their way.  

        And in the middle of it all Max walks in and says.

                                        MAX
                      Isn t the game today?

      Adam is shocked.  Everyone is shocked.

                                        ADAM
                      Buddy, I thought you were done with 
                      baseball.

                                        MAX
                      It s my team.

      Adam exchanges looks with his brothers and sisters, Mom 
        and Dad.  He looks at his watch.

                                        ADAM
                      Game starts in ten minutes.

        And everyone snaps into gear.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   71.



                                        KRISTINA
                      Haddie his uniform s in--

                                        HADDIE
                      Laundry room, got it--

                                        CROSBY
                      I ll pull the car up.

      Adam tosses him the keys.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Oh shit, shit, shit, I m the snack mom 
                      today.   

                                        JULIA & SARAH
                      We got it.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      Come on, Max, let s go upstairs and start 
                      getting ready.  Shoot, could someone find 
                      his glove?  I think it s in the garage.

        A voice out of nowhere.

                                        DREW
                      I ll find it.

        And everyone is shocked, most of all Sarah.

                                        ADAM
                      Good man.

        And Drew goes off to the garage.

      As we begin to hear the song FOREVER YOUNG begins, we go 
      to a...

        MONTAGE

      Of snacks being slapped together; gloves being found; a 
        desperate search for a matching pair of baseball socks, 
        and... 

        The faces, the faces, the faces... 

                                        THE SONG
                      May God bless and keep you always/May 
                      your wishes all come true/May you always 
                      do for others/And let others do for 
                      you...      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   72.



        ... the beautiful absurdity of twelve people coming 
        together to get one eight-year-old boy to a baseball 
        game.

        THE FAMILY makes it outside and they load into TWO 
        MINIVANS

      AT THE FIELD

        The entire family bails out of the MINIVANS and run with 
        Max to join his team in the dugout.  

        Except ADAM who has been banned from the game.  He has to 
        watch through a hole in the fence. 

                                        THE SONG (CONT D)
                      ...May you build a ladder to the 
                      stars/And climb on every rung...

        Max steps to the plate.  Adam closes his eyes, and 
        consults with God...  Please.   He opens his eyes, and 
        mutters to himself, willing Max from a distance:

                                        ADAM
                      Bend your knees, not that much, bat back, 
                      elbow up...

      As the Pitcher winds, delivers, we move close on Adam s 
        face.  As we HEAR the crack of a bat hitting a ball and 
      HOLD ON Adam s amazed face, we...

                                                                          BLACK OUT.

                                          THE END
