      Behind the wheel is CASSIE BLAKE, 16, having a private moment 
      with the STEREO.  Singing her heart out.  Something she d 
      never do around anyone else.  But alone -- she s a rock star.  
      An extremely off-key rock star.  Ridiculously cute.   

      CLOSE ON HER FACE.  A scrubbed clean natural beauty.  She has 
      that loner stare.  All question and doubt.  

      She s startled by a HONKING HORN.  Headlights blind.  As a 
      car WHIZZES by, passing her.  She road rages. 

                                  CASSIE
                    C mon.  Really?  Asshole.

      But then -- her front wheel EXPLODES.  A blowout.  The car 
      jerks and skids, careening off the road.  

      Cassie responds instantly.  She lets off the gas, turns into 
      the skid, and the car jerks and grinds to a stop. 


      A small, comfortable home.  Cozy is the key word.  Eclectic 
      is runner up.   A phone RINGS.  AMELIA BLAKE answers it. Mid-
      30 s, effortless beauty.

      She s cooking.  Boiling pasta, sauce, salad fixings, etc.

                                  CASSIE
                          (from phone)
                    I got a flat.

                                  AMELIA
                    Where are you?  

      SCENE INTERCUTS:


      Back inside the house, Amelia continues with Cassie.

                                  CASSIE
                    Can you wait til I get home to yell 
                    at me?  This was a courtesy call.                                                                                      3.

      CONTINUED:

      INSTANT PHONE STATIC.  The call drops.  

                        CASSIEAMELIA
      Hello?Cassie?  

      Amelia hangs up.  Starts to redial as she goes to the sink to 
      rinse some vegetables.


      Water SPRAYS from the faucet unexpectedly.  Dousing Amelia.  

                                  AMELIA
                    Dammit.  

      She goes to turn off the faucet.  But a pipe s busted.  It 
      gushes water onto the floor... everywhere.  

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      He withdraws a box of matches.  Strikes a SINGLE MATCH.

      IN THE KITCHEN

      A burner on the stove IGNITES -- the FLAMES SHOOTING HIGH 
      ABOVE THE STOVE.  Amelia quickly turns it off.

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      He strikes another match.  

      IN THE KITCHEN 

      Another burner IGNITES.  The flames SHOOT UP.  

      An INTERCUT of matches and fire.  As all four burners SPIT 
      FLAMES OF FIRE.  Amelia steps back.  Stunned.  Terrified.  

      The flames quickly begin to CLIMB THE WALL to the ceiling.  

      There s recognition on Amelia s face.  Pure horror.  And then 
      the slightest whisper...                                                                                       4.

      CONTINUED:

                                  AMELIA (CONT D)
                    Cassie...

      She turns to run... She takes one step and SLIPS on the wet 
      floor.  Her feet fly from under, she lands hard ON HER BACK.  
      Her head CRACKS against the kitchen floor.  She goes still.  
      As the fire SPREADS.  Up the walls, to the ceiling.

      Amelia s eyes flicker open.  She tries to rise up.  Only semi-
      conscious.  She rolls over and crawls to her knees.  She s 
      wet and her head is bleeding. 

      But she s determined.  She half crawls, half stumbles to the 
      living room where she knocks over a LAMP.  Its BULB EXPLODES 
      catching fire.  The fire quickly leaps onto drapes nearby.  

      In seconds, the drapes and entire wall go up in flames.

      ON THE MAN OUTSIDE

      As he holds a burning match.  He drops it.  Then withdraws 
      MANY MATCHES.  He moves to strike them all at once.

      INSIDE THE HOUSE

      Amelia, weak and horror-stricken, limps to the front door.  
      She barely reaches it when the MATCHES IGNITE.

      A moment of pure silence.  And then, the house EXPLODES INTO 
      FLAMES, ENGULFING Amelia.  

      ON THE MAN as he watches the house burn a moment.  Then, he 
      gets into his car and drives away.  Beat.  


      Cassie drives down the street, turning a corner.  She hears 
      SIRENS.  Sees the FLASHING LIGHTS.  The fire trucks.  An 
      OFFICER in the road stops her.  

      CLOSE ON CASSIE S FACE.  As the realization sinks in.  The 
      next moments are a blur as Cassie steps from the car.  Sees 
      HER HOUSE.  The flames.  The firemen at work.  

      Her knees buckle, she begins to sway...  

      She tries to speak...  But all sound...  All motion...  

      Everything comes to a horrifying halt.  As Cassie Blake s 
      world is destroyed.  


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                      5.


                                        ACT ONE


      Cassie is behind the wheel.  Her car is packed full of 
      luggage and belongings.  She takes in the view.  Her eyes are 
      still alive with curiosity.  But there s a sadness that lives 
      within her now.  

      The car passes a sign.  WELCOME TO NEW SALEM, MAINE.  EST. 
      1692.


      An old and elegant home.  Full of history.  Cassie looks 
      around.  

                                  CASSIE
                    So.  This is where my mom grew up.

                                  JANE
                    She took her first steps right 
                    there.  And just kept right on 
                    going.  I ll show you your room.

      Cassie follows her grandmother up the stairs with her bags.  


      Jane clicks on the light to reveal Amelia s bedroom - 
      untouched since the day she left.  A shrine to a teenage girl 
      from the 80 s.  Cassie takes it all in, wide-eyed.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s like a mom museum.                                                                                      7.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE
                    We can move everything out.  I 
                    should have by now.  It s only 
                    been... sixteen years.  

      Cassie runs her hand along an old STONE FIREPLACE.  Ornate 
      ETCHED PATTERNS carved in the stone.  It s beautiful.  Framed 
      photos line the mantle.  The photos feature Amelia and a 
      TIGHT CIRCLE OF FRIENDS.  

                                  CASSIE
                    There s so much about her I didn t 
                    know... why did she leave here? 

                                  JANE
                    She told you nothing at all.

      This is more of a question.  As Jane studies her.  Cassie 
      shakes her head.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I asked but she was always so full 
                    of non-answers.  I gave up.

                                  JANE
                    Things got difficult for her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Is that code for pregnant?

      Jane simply smiles.  She doesn t confirm or deny.  

                                  JANE
                    I ll let you get settled.  I ll be 
                      downstairs.  

      Jane leaves her.  Cassie looks around.  To the wall of 
      photos.  A beautiful RED-HAIRED GIRL appears with Amelia in 
      most of the photos, but Cassie is drawn to ONE BOY in 
      particular who is featured prominently.

      Cassie stares at a photo of her mother.  The hurt shows all 
      over her face.  This is a real pain that s not going away 
      anytime soon.  Beat.  


      Cassie can be seen in the adjoining bathroom.  She s brushing 
      her teeth.  She wears a night shirt.  She finishes up and 
      clicks the light and starts for her bed.  She notices the 
      curtain open.   

      She goes to the window -- looks out -- she can see into the 
      house next door.  Into a bedroom like hers.  It s the same 
      house from earlier.  But now the light is on.

      She can see a YOUNG MAN (NICK) staring at her.  He doesn t 
      wear a shirt.  Just gym shorts.  He s handsome.  Good 
      physique.  And he knows it.  He gives her a nod.  Cassie 
      closes the drapes. 

      Cassie opens a suitcase.  She s unpacking.  She takes some 
      clothes and opens a dresser.  Fills it up, all while HUMMING.  
      She closes a drawer but it s JAMMED.  She reaches in to see 
      what s causing the problem and is surprised when she pulls 
      out the culprit.  

      A SILVER NECKLACE with a CIRCLE PENDANT.  It s made up of 
      eight blue stones and connected by a CRYSTAL PATTERN.  It s 
      beautiful.  Cassie puts it on, continuing to HUM when...

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    Your mom used to hum that.  

      Jane s standing in the doorway.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I stole it from her.  She used to 
                    hum it all the time.  

      A shared smile.  

                                  JANE
                    Ready for your first day of school?  

                                  CASSIE
                    Is anyone ever?

                                  JANE
                    If you have trouble sleeping, your 
                    mom used to count the stars.  
                    Night, honey.

      Stars?  Cassie s not sure what she means.  Jane smiles, 
      closes the door as Cassie crawls into bed, clutching her 
      newly found PENDANT.  She turns out the side lamp.                                                                                      9.

      CONTINUED:

      Falls back into bed.  Staring up.  As the ceiling ILLUMINATES 
      before her eyes.  As she discovers a GLOW-IN-THE-DARK SOLAR 
      SYSTEM.  She smiles.  Now, she understands what Jane was 
      referring to.  There s something magical about it.  She 
      stares at it in wonder, feeling a little closer to her mom. 


      Cassie walks down the hall.  She's nervous and avoids eye 
      contact but can't shake the feeling that everyone's staring.  
      And judging.  She wears her mom's pendant.

                                  DAWN (O.S.)
                    We re happy to have you, Cassie.


      Cassie sits across from the RED-HAIRED GIRL from her mom's 
      photos - but 16 years older.  Vice Principal DAWN 
        CHAMBERLAIN, a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 30's.

                                  DAWN
                    I m Vice Principal Chamberlain.  
                    It's so great to meet you.  I knew 
                    your mother.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yes, I was looking at pictures in 
                    her room last night.  I recognize 
                    you.  

                                  DAWN
                    Not my Sheena Easton period, I 
                    hope?  I guess she didn't talk 
                    about me much.

      Cassie feels badly for having brought it up.

                                  CASSIE
                    She didn't talk about New Salem at 
                    all.  

      This affects Dawn.  She feels the loss too.                                                                                      10.

                    my heart.  Whatever I can do to 
                    help with your transition.  

      There's a KNOCK at the door.  SALLY WALTMAN enters.  African 
      American, 16.  A never-changing expression of dubiousness.

                                  DAWN (CONT D)
                    Sally's going to give you a tour.  
                    Junior editor at the paper and 
                    knows this place better then I do.


      The hallway is full of STUDENTS.  TWO GIRLS walk and talk.  
      Both 17 and stylishly sexy.  FAYE, can play the danger card, 
      has sharp eyes.  Sees everything.  MELISSA, African-American, 
      steely, disinterested.

                                    MELISSA
                    Have you seen her yet?

                                  FAYE
                    No, have you?

      Melissa shakes her head.  Nope.  They reach NICK ARMSTRONG, 
      17, who stands with TWO PREPPIE FRESHMEN.  He s the guy 
      Cassie saw in the window.  The freshmen slink off as Nick 
      pockets a WAD OF CASH.

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    Five to ten by the time you re

                                  NICK
                    Loosen up, Faye.

                                  FAYE
                    So? 

                                  NICK
                    What? 

                                  FAYE
                    Your new neighbor.  Did you see 
                    her? 

                                  NICK
                    She got in last night.                                                                                    11.

                          (to irritate Faye)
                    Ugly.  Real, real ugly.  Unless 
                    you re looking at her hot little 
                    body or her sexy, cute face.  

                                  FAYE
                    Anything else?

      Nick looks at Faye coolly.  Shrugs.  Off Faye, as Nick walks 
      away --


      Cassie struggles to keep up with a bubbly Sally who walks 
      briskly through the crowded hall, pointing as she goes...

                                  SALLY
                      Auditorium.  Study Hall.  One of 
                    two blind spots in the questionably 
                    legal surveillance system.

                                  CASSIE
                    I hope the other one's the girl's 
                    bathroom.

      Sally registers the comment.  Smiles.

                                  SALLY
                    The cliques are pretty standard.  
                    So no surprises there.  I m more 
                    the artsy crowd.  What about you?  
                    Who do you gravitate towards?

                                  CASSIE
                    The loner crowd are my people.  

                                  SALLY
                    That would be just you.

      Cassie taps her head.

                                  CASSIE
                    And the voices.

      Sally stares at her, weirdly.  

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Yeah, I didn t think that would 
                    land.                                                                                      12.

      CONTINUED:

      Sally smiles.  Cassie s oddly cool.  She likes her.  Sally 
      stops in front of a locker, indicates --

                                  SALLY
                    This one s yours.  

      Cassie takes out the combination, tries to open the locker.

      She s referring to Faye and Melissa who are coming down the 
      hall, right towards them.  As Cassie struggles with the lock--

                                  SALLY (CONT D)
                    Snobby, self-centered, and a little 
                    creepy.  Definitely unique.

      As Faye and Melissa approach, they can t help but look Cassie 
      up and down.  It makes her uncomfortable.  Cassie gives up on 
      the lock.

                                  SALLY (CONT D)
                    Bad news.  I d stay clear.  Your 
                    first class is Econ.  Down the 
                    hall.  Good luck.

      As Sally walks away, Cassie turns to steal another glance at 
      Faye and Melissa, only to find them walking straight up to 
      her.  Faye s stare is chilling.

                                  FAYE
                    So you re the new girl.

                                  CASSIE
                    I m Cassie.

                                  FAYE
                      Interesting.
                          (then, re: lock)
                    Try it again. 

      Faye walks away.  Cassie tries the lock.  It SLIDES OPEN.  
      Weird.  Off Cassie, what just happened? 


      Cassie enters the classroom as STUDENTS take their seats.  
      She sees a girl waving her over.  This is DIANA MEADE, 18.  
      Smart.  Sexy.  Not overly done up.  More of a classic beauty.                                                                                       13.

      CONTINUED:

                                  DIANA
                    Over here, sit.  I saved it for 
                    you.  I m Diana.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Cassie.

                                  DIANA
                    I know.  I live on your block.  Two 
                    doors down.  Your Grandmother told 
                    me you were coming.  I m so glad 
                    you re here.

                                  CASSIE
                    You are?

      Cassie stares at her.  Finds Diana s friendliness infectious.

                                  DIANA
                    Oh yeah, it just so happens I was 
                    in the market for a new friend.  
                    And Voila.  Fate.  

      Diana smiles.  It s genuine.  Cassie likes her instantly.  
      Across the room, Cassie sees DOUG, 17, a jock, spinning an up-
      ended FOOTBALL on his desk.  He takes his hand away.  The 
      FOOTBALL keeps SPINNING.  

      Just as the football seems to be spinning a little too long 
      of its own accord, Doug s eyes meet Diana s.  The football 
      wobbles.  As Cassie takes this in --

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing tonight?  We all 
                    hang out at the Marina.  Will you 
                    come?  I ll introduce you around.

      Cassie has a good feeling about Diana.  She can sense she has 
      a good heart.  Cassie smiles, happy to have connected with 
      someone.  Her official  first friend. 


      Old wooden tables, sawdust on the floor.  TEENS and OTHER 
      PATRONS loiter about, eating, etc.  It s the local hot spot.                                                                                    14.

      CONTINUED:

      Diana sits at a BACK BOOTH.  Melissa, Doug, and Nick play 
      pool in the b.g.  Faye approaches Diana --

                                  FAYE
                    How s the new girl? 

                                  DIANA
                    You should get to know her.  

                                  FAYE
                    I don t know if she s worth getting 
                    to know yet.

                                  DIANA
                    She s a Blake.

                                  FAYE
                    Every family has duds.  Maybe we 
                    should nudge her, see what she s 
                    made of.

      As Cassie enters and walks toward them --

                                  DIANA
                    Her mom just died.  Give her time.  
                          (then)
                    I mean it, Faye.

      Cassie approaches.  Faye gives her a big smile.  

                                  FAYE
                    Hi, I m Faye Chamberlain. 

      Cassie has no intention of kissing ass.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yeah, we met.  Sort of. 

                                  FAYE
                    And I m sure you met my mother.  
                    The Vice-Principal.  Red hair?  
                    Bitchy? 

                                  CASSIE
                    She seemed nice to me.

                                  DIANA
                    Have a seat, Cassie.  Faye was just 
                    leaving.  

      Cassie sits.  Faye eyes her pendant.                                                                                        15.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  FAYE
                    That s a beautiful necklace.  

      She gives Diana a  knowing  look.

                                  CASSIE
                    It was my mom s.  

                                  FAYE
                    I heard.  I m so sorry.  How did 
                    she die exactly?

                                  DIANA
                    Faye.  Manners. 

                                  FAYE
                    Too soon?

                                  CASSIE
                    There was a fire.  Faulty wiring.  

      Diana shoots a disbelieving stare at Faye. 

                                  FAYE
                    And your father?  Where s he?

      Beat.  That s always a tough question for Cassie.

                                  CASSIE
                    I don t know my father. 

                                  DIANA
                    Stop badgering the new girl.  

      Faye looks at Diana.  Cassie senses a power struggle between 
      these too.  But Faye relaxes.  Smiles, warmly, changing her 
      demeanor completely.

                                  FAYE
                    I make a horrible first impression, 
                    Cassie.  It s the cliche in me.  
                    Give me a chance, I turn into a 
                    real person.  You ll see. 

      Cassie is completely won over by this honesty.  It s so real 
      and insightful. 

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    You guys have fun.

      Faye gets up and leaves but not before looking at Diana.  
       Happy?   Faye goes to join Nick, Melissa, and Doug, who are 
      watching Cassie from the back of the tavern.                                                                                     16.

      CONTINUED: (3)

                                  CASSIE
                    They re all your friends?

                                  DIANA
                    Depends on the day.    

      Cassie feels on display.  She looks around, uncomfortably.  
      Notices a MAN sitting at the bar, staring at her.   This is 
      ETHAN, late 30 s, haggard.  His intense gaze adds to her 
      general feeling of uneasiness. 

                                  CASSIE
                    I m sorry.  I don t think I m in 
                    the mood for being social, after 
                    all.  It s been a long day and...

      As Cassie starts to get up --

                                  DIANA
                    At least meet my boyfriend.  He s 
                    around here somewhere. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Next time.  Promise.

      Diana nods, very understanding.  


      Faye is at the FRONT WINDOW, watching Cassie walk to her car.   
      Melissa walks up beside her.  

                                    MELISSA
                    What do you think? 

      Faye doesn t answer.  Just keeps watching Cassie.


      Faye is at the window, quietly watching, whispering...

                                  FAYE
                    Put it out, put it out...


      Cassie BEATS and KICKS on the door.  Why won t it unlock?  
      She s freaking out.  COUGHING.  CHOKING.  The inside of the 
      car is full of smoke.  She can t breathe.  Pure horror... 

      A YOUNG MAN appears at the window.  He s there to help her.  
      As he pulls on the locked car door, he directs a RAISED HAND 
      at the FLAMES, which seem to recede.    

      It all happens very fast, but as the Young Man stares 
      INTENSELY at the car, the doors UNLOCK.  Quickly, he rips the 
      door open and pulls Cassie from the car. 

      He takes her in his arms and carries her several feet from 
      the car and lays her down on the ground where Cassie s 
      COUGHING subsides.  Her eyes flutter open and she stares into 
      her savior s face. 

      Handsome.  Square jaw.  Sexy dimple.  Million dollar smile.  

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Are you okay?

      Off Cassie -- as she contemplates her answer.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    18.


                                        ACT TWO


      Cassie is still a little shaken.  She reaches for the door.

                                  DIANA
                    I m sorry about your car.

                                  CASSIE
                    I just don t understand it.

                                  DIANA
                    Maybe the mechanic will have an 
                    answer.   

      Cassie starts to get out when--

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    I know what it s like, Cassie.  To 
                    lose your mom.  Or at least what 
                    it s like to grow up not having 
                    one.

      Cassie turns to her.  Listens.

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    My mom died when I was little.  I 
                    never even knew her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    What happened?

                                  DIANA
                    It s a long story, but I ll tell ya 
                    sometime, just know... 
                          (beat)
                    you re not alone here in New Salem.

      Beat.  As Cassie lets this sink in.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thanks for the ride, Diana.                                                                                    20.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie gets out and starts for the house.  


      Cassie is filling Jane in on the events of the evening. 

                                  JANE
                    And the car just caught fire?

                                  CASSIE
                    When I turned the ignition.

                                  JANE
                    Maybe you blew the engine on the 
                    drive from Florida?  

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe.  Maybe, I m losing my mind.  
                    The whole night was weird.  The 
                    kids here.  I m not used to the  
                    small town groove yet.

                                  JANE
                    Well, tomorrow s a new day.

      Cassie nods.  Starts for the foyer but turns.

                                  CASSIE
                    Grandma, do you know my father?

      This makes Jane stop in her tracks.  She looks at Cassie.

                                  JANE
                    Why would you ask that?

                                  CASSIE
                    It s been on my mind, that s all.  
                    Mom said she didn t know him.  She 
                    claimed it was one night and a 
                    bottle of tequila.  Which is fine.  
                    I can accept that.

                                  JANE
                    Better than I can.

      Cassie tries not to tear up.  But this is emotional stuff.

                                  CASSIE
                    I can also accept she was lying.  
                    For whatever reasons.  So if you 
                    know who he might be--                                                                                    21.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE
                    Oh honey...

                                  CASSIE
                    You could tell me.  I can take it.

                                  JANE
                    Your mother never told me who he 
                    was, Cassie.  I m sorry.

      Cassie nods.  Appreciates her Grandmother s honesty.  


      MUSIC PLAYS.  As TWO NAKED BODIES go at it, heatedly.  They 
      reach their moment and collapse onto each other.  Beat.  
      Then, the guy rolls out of bed. REVEAL NICK.

                                  NICK
                    Not bad. I give it a 7. There was a 
                    lack of focus in your key moves.

                                  FAYE
                    I give it a 6. You meandered. 

                                  NICK
                    I m getting points deducted for 
                    stamina? There s a first.

      Nick pulls on his shorts. Goes to the window.

                                  FAYE
                    Can you see her over there?

                                  NICK
                    Nope.

      But Nick is lying.  NICK S POV -- he can see directly into 
      Cassie s bedroom.  He watches as she emerges from the 
      bathroom, wearing just a towel.


      Cassie emerges from the bathroom.  She s just showered.  She 
      has a towel wrapped around her as she brushes her hair.  She 
      moves about her room when she sees her CURTAINS are open.  
      She goes to them.  Sees Nick watching her.

      Cassie pulls the DRAPES closed but not before giving Nick a 
       fuck off  look.                                                                                    22.



      Nick smiles at Cassie s dissing.  Appreciates it.

                                  NICK
                    You should be more careful with 
                    her.

                                  FAYE
                    Oh please... you sound like Diana.

                                  NICK
                    Diana s not wrong.  She s one of 
                    us, Faye. 

                                  FAYE
                    Diana does things her way, I do 
                    things mine.  Anyway, from what I 
                    saw tonight, Cassie s a waste of 
                    time.  

      Nick doesn t agree.  He continues to stare out the window.


      Cassie digs through a drawer and finds a tee shirt.  She 
      drops her towel and pulls it on, then turns to find--

      THE CURTAINS ARE OPEN AGAIN.

      CASSIE FREEZES. As a chill races down her spine.  But... how?  
      She races to the window.  Sees Nick still staring.  It s 
      beyond eerie.  She pulls the DRAPES CLOSED again.  Confused.  
      Did she close them?  That moment of rational debate. 


      Now, Nick turns away from the window. He smiles at Faye. 

                                  NICK
                    How about I give you a chance to 
                    beat our score?

                                  FAYE
                    Why don t you practice by yourself.

      As Faye gets up, dresses to leave. 


      Cassie goes to her bed.  It s been a very bizarre and weird 
      day.                                                                                      23.

      CONTINUED:

      A brief moment as she stares at her MOM S PHOTO on the night 
      stand.  She CLICKS off the lamp and crawls under the covers.  

      She lies flat, staring up at the ceiling.  There s something 
      lost and pained about her face.  As she stares at the GLOW-IN- 
      THE-DARK-STARS above her.  She begins to HUM her mother s 
      MELODY when--

      THE STARS BEGIN TO MOVE -- EMERGE MORE PROMINENTLY.

      Cassie audibly GASPS.  She stops HUMMING.  The stars stop 
      moving.  Upon realizing-- 

      She begins to HUM again.  The stars begin to move again.  Or 
      is it an illusion?  Cassie can t tell.  Not sure she s seeing 
      what she thinks she s seeing.  She continues to HUM... 
        nervously... curiously...

      THE STARS BEGIN TO FORM A PATTERN.  It s a SYMBOL.  She 
      stares at it long and hard.  

      Then, suddenly, she leaps up.  Turns on the side lamp.  She 
      gets out of bed and goes to the fire place where she sees the  
      SAME SYMBOL etched in stone.  

      She touches it.  Presses on it.  It moves slightly.  She 
      pulls on it.  The stone moves.  Cassie pulls harder, removing 
      it from the fire place to find--

      A secret hiding place.  She reaches in and pulls out a VERY 
      OLD BOUND BOOK.  Verging on ancient.  It s crammed full of 
      papers, hand-written notes, drawings, pictures, etc.  A 
      record of the last three hundred plus years.  

      On its cover it says -- BLAKE.   

      CLOSE ON THE BOOK -- certain words and phrases are seen.

      Spells... Potions... Herbs... Witchcraft...

      Off Cassie s stunned expression--


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    24.


                                      ACT THREE


      Shafts of sunlight stream through Cassie s window.  As she 
      sits on the bed with her FAMILY S BOOK.  Her face a mix of 
      curiosity and disbelief.  

      CLOSE ON THE BOOK -- page after page of spells.  Mostly 
        handwritten.  She comes across a picture of her mom and a 
      MAN.  She studies it.  The face is familiar.  (Ethan)  

      She sees writing -- THE CIRCLE, then names after it.  John 
      Conant, Rebecca Meade, Mavis Chamberlain, etc.  

      She continues to peruse the book, fascinated. 


      Cassie enters the kitchen.  Looks around.  Sees a note on the 
      fridge.  AT MARINA.  JOIN ME.  With a smiley face.

      Cassie opens her MOM S BOOK.  Reads from it.  

                                  CASSIE
                          (reading)
                    Spell... let s see... boil water.                                                                                     26.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie has a sense of humor about this.  As she finds a small 
      sauce pot.  She fills it with water and sits it on the stove.  

      She reads more -- 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Water... Fire... 

      Cassie grabs some matches from the stove and lights one.  She 
      holds it in her hand as she recites from the book. 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                          (reading)
                    Lazerth, ointe, sette, foah...

      Cassie repeats this several times, eyeing the water.  But 
      nothing happens to it.  The match burns to her fingers.  She 
      drops it.  Lights another.  She tries it again.  But still 
      nothing.  Beat.

      Finally, she laughs at herself.  She can t believe she s 
      actually trying to boil water.  She blows the match out, 
      grabs the book, turns to exit when she sees... 

      Dirty dishes in the sink.  And then -- Cassie s eyes widen to 
      discover a glass of water -- SIZZLING.  She reaches down to 
      touch it.  But she already knows -- it s boiling hot. 

      Cassie GASPS, shaken.  A long, sustained moment.  Then Cassie 
      grabs the book and races out.


      Cassie enters the empty tavern, looks around.  Sees no one.  
      They re not open yet.  She hears a NOISE in the back.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Hello?

      She ventures to the back of the bar.  Sees a swinging door.  
      Does she dare?  But before she can decide --

      IT BURSTS OPEN.  Cassie jumps.  As ETHAN CONANT, plows 
      through.  Rugged and worn.  Adam s dad-- the man who was 
      staring at Cassie last night.  He s drunk.  And it s early in 
      the day.  That sums him up.

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  I was looking for 
                    someone.

      Ethan stares at her a moment.  As if he s seen a ghost.                                                                                      27.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ETHAN
                    My god, girl.  You look just like 
                    her.

                                  CASSIE
                    I m sorry?

                                  ETHAN
                    Amelia.  I can see her in you.

      Cassie begins to put it together. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Did you know my mother?

      Beat.  As Ethan nods, full of regret.  

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes, I knew her.

      Ethan heads behind the bar, to pour himself a drink.  Cassie 
      turns to him, wanting to know more.

                                  CASSIE
                    You were friends?

      Ethan looks at her.  How should he answer?  And then-- 

                                  ETHAN
                    That s one way to put it.
                          (then)
                    I loved your mother very much.

      Before Cassie can ask anything else -- Adam enters from the 
      back, carrying cases of beer.  He sees Cassie.  

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, Cassie?  What s up?  

                                  CASSIE
                    I didn t see my car outside... 

                                  ADAM
                    Your grandma came by earlier, had 
                    it towed to the station.

      Oh.  Cassie nods.  That explains it.

                                  ETHAN
                    She s pretty, son.  And I sense a 
                    big heart.  Just like Amelia.  
                          (to Cassie)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    28.

      CONTINUED: (2)
                                  ETHAN (CONT'D)
                    Your mom and me were meant to be 
                      together--

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, dad, you re talking too much.  
                    We gotta open soon.  Why don t you 
                    go clean up?

      Ethan eyes Cassie, intently.  Adam helps him through the 
      swinging door.  Adam looks to Cassie, apologetic.

                                  CASSIE
                    It was nice to meet you, sir.

                                  ADAM
                    Sorry about that.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s okay.  

      Silence.  An awkward tension.  It s felt by both. 

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    Do you know where Diana is?  

                                  ADAM
                    Did you check the wharf?  The 
                      Festival s today.  

      Cassie nods.  Cassie starts out but stops--

                                  CASSIE
                    Question.  My car last night?  How 
                    did the fire go out?  

                                  ADAM
                    It just went out.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You looked at it and it went out.

                                  ADAM
                    I looked at it when it went out.

                                  CASSIE
                    And how did the doors unlock?

                                  ADAM
                    I dunno.  How did they lock in the 
                    first place?

                                  CASSIE
                    Got it.  Thanks.                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED: (3)

      An annoyed Cassie starts out.  But now Adam stops her. 

                                  ADAM
                    What do you think happened?

      Cassie turns back -- challenging. 

                                  CASSIE
                    Gee, I don t know.   A shot in the 
                    dark.  Witchcraft?  Seeya later.

      Cassie exits to great effect.  It catches Adam off guard.  He 
      races after her.   


      Candles have been lit.  They illuminate the surroundings.  
      Peeling wallpaper, torn furniture, dust and such...

      Adam and Cassie enter and start up the staircase. 


      A large room.  With high arched ceilings.  Broken windows.  

      Candles are everywhere.  Cassie and Adam enter to find --

      Faye and Melissa.  Nick and Doug are outside, on a veranda, 
      smoking a joint.  

                                  ADAM
                    You know Melissa and Faye...

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi.

                                  FAYE
                          (to Adam, suggestive)
                    I m impressed.  I couldn t get a 
                    rise with a burning car, what did 
                    you do?  Wait, let me guess...

      Cassie reacts.  Faye made the fire happen?

                                  DIANA (O.C.)
                    Cassie came to it on her own.  She 
                    found her mother s Book of Shadows.

      Both Melissa and Faye are shocked by the statement.

      Cassie turns to see Diana enter.  She smiles at Cassie.  A 
      warm, comforting smile.  

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    I m glad you re here.

                                    MELISSA
                    Can I see it?

      Cassie withdraws the book.  Melissa takes it and feverishly 
      looks through it.  Faye eyes it too.  Adam explains.

                                  ADAM
                    Our families hid them from us.  So 
                    we wouldn t know who we are.                                                                                    36.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie doesn t like how Melissa is handling her mom s book. 
      She takes it from her.

                                    MELISSA
                    Diana s the only one who has one.

                                  FAYE
                    Not anymore.

      The pleasure she gets from this new reality isn t lost on 
      Diana.  Adam breaks the moment.  Gives Diana a kiss.

                                  ADAM
                    Thanks for calling everyone.  I 
                    wasn t sure what to do.

      Diana understands.  Cassie looks around.  Sees herbs and pots 
      and all sorts of objects.  It s unsettling.

                                  CASSIE
                    What goes on here?  Is this where 
                    you practice black magic?

                                  DIANA
                    It s not like that.

                                  FAYE
                    No, Diana has lots of rules to make 
                    things less fun.  More wholesome.

                                  DIANA
                    Faye--

      Doug and Nick enter from the deck -- they eye Cassie.  Doug 
      walks straight over to Cassie.  Introduces himself.

                                  DOUG
                    Hi, I m Doug, we haven t met. 

                                  NICK
                    Cassie.  Always a pleasure to see 
                    you.

      He gives her a knowing look.  It makes her uncomfortable.  
      She backs away.  Looks to Diana, then Adam.

                    Listen, I m sorry for getting you 
                    all out here, but I don t think 
                    this is for me.  I m not really 
                    into groups.  Glee clubs, magic 
                    covens, any of them.                                                                                    37.

                    Get over it.  You ve been signed up 
                    for this since before you were 
                    born.  This is who you are.

                                  CASSIE
                    Setting people on fire?  I don t 
                    think so.  My mother left here and 
                    I m starting to guess it s because 
                    she wanted no part of this. 

                                  DIANA
                    What Faye did was a mistake.  

      She glares at Faye.  Silently demanding an apology.

                                  FAYE
                    I meant it as a gentle nudge... But 
                    may have gotten carried away.

      It s not much of an apology.  And Cassie doesn t accept it.  
      Diana tries to answer her fears.  Carefully.

                                  DIANA
                    Your mom... with the rest of our

                    We re careful.  We re still 
                    learning and we re taking things

                    Those are just some of the rules.  
                    Diana will carve them into tablets

                    We blended a spell to help Melissa 
                    open her mind to chemistry and 
                      understand it.

                                  ADAM
                    We found a spell that would help 
                    enhance Doug s natural ability in 
                    sports.

                                  DIANA
                    We use our craft to help each other

                                  FAYE
                    But the more of us there are, the 
                    more powerful the spells.

                                    MELISSA
                    In the old days circles had one

                    You joining might really help us 
                    step up our game. 

      They all look at her, expectantly.  It s too overwhelming.

                                  CASSIE
                    Sorry.  You ve got the wrong girl.

                                  DIANA
                    No, it s okay.  Take your time.  
                    Think about it.  We re here for 
                    you, Cassie.  We re your friends.                                                                                      39.

                    I won t.  I ll keep your secret, 
                    but I don t want any part of it.

      And with that Cassie takes her FAMILY BOOK and exits.   Adam 
      looks to Diana.  Faye simmers.  


      The tavern is empty.  Dark.  The party is long over.  Just 
      the drunken form of Ethan Conant as he reaches for his drink.  
      He has trouble steadying it in his hands.   

      Behind him, the door opens.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Ethan turns.

                                  ETHAN
                    We re closed.  

      But then, THOMAS MEADE comes into view.  Beat.                                                                                      51.

                                  THOMAS
                    We have a problem, Ethan.  You re 
                    ruining things for me.

                                  ETHAN
                    Huh?  What?  

      A drunken Ethan stares at him, confused. 

                                  THOMAS
                    You drink too much, which makes you 
                    talk too much.  And I can t have 
                    that.  

                                  ETHAN
                    What the hell you doing here?

                                  THOMAS
                    What would happen if you slipped 
                    and fell off that dock outside? You 
                    would drown.  No one would find 
                    your body for days.

      Ethan stares at him.  

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You know what drowning is like?  
                    That feeling of not being able to 
                      breathe... grasping for air...

      Ethan begins to GAG... COUGH... CHOKE... he can no longer 
      breathe.  He falls over, unable to find air.  Just then, he 
      COUGHS UP WATER... it pours from his mouth.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You panic as your lungs fill up 
                    with water.  It s a horrible death.

      Thomas has spelled Ethan.  He s DROWNING.  Ethan s eyes roll 
      back, he falls back against the bar.  Thomas watches as Ethan 
      takes his last breath.  His eyes as cold as death.   


      Cassie enters to find Jane sleeping on the couch.  She pauses 
      for a beat, wanting to wake her grandmother, talk to her, ask 
      her advice...                                                                                      52.

      CONTINUED:

      But she can t.  She made a promise.  Cassie turns and goes up 
      the stairs.


      Cassie enters her room, drops her backpack on the bed.  

      She slides the Book of Shadows from her backpack, then looks 
      up to find Nick at his window.  

      Nick holds a piece of paper up to the window.  Cassie walks 
      over to read:  R U OK? 

      A beat as Nick and Cassie look at each other.  Touched, 
      Cassie nods.  She s okay.  Nick smiles quietly, moves away 
      from the window.

      A beat, then Cassie returns to the Book of Shadows.  It s 
      time to return it to its hiding place.  She moves to the 
      fireplace, then glances over her shoulder to the window.

      The drape is closed.  Cassie smiles.

      She removes the tile on the fireplace, revealing the hidden 
        compartment.  As she puts the Book of Shadows away, her hand 
      settles on a SMALL ENVELOPE tucked at the back of the 
        compartment.  

      She pulls it out, sees  Cassie  written in her mother s 
        handwriting.  

      AS Cassie stares at the envelope--


      Dawn puts a kettle on the stove, reaches for the knob to turn 
      on the gas burner.  

      But before she can even touch it, the BURNER FLAMES TO LIFE.

      Instead of reacting with fear, Dawn just turns... to find 
      Thomas, standing behind her.

                                  DAWN
                    You and your tricks.

                                  THOMAS
                    They come in handy.

                                  DAWN
                    Ethan?                                                                                    53.

                    Good.  We were right to bring her 
                    here.  She s got the gift.

                          (yes, she does)
                    She s her father s daughter.

                                  DAWN
                      Unfortunately, she s her mother s 
                    daughter too.

                                  THOMAS
                    Are you sure you can get Cassie to 
                    do what we need?   

                                  DAWN
                    I don t have to get her to do a 
                    thing.
                          (beat)
                    The Circle will take care of 
                      everything... without even knowing 
                    it.

      OFF Dawn and Thomas, plotting--


      Cassie sits on her bed, her mother s letter on her lap. 

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    My sweet Cassie.  You finding this 
                    means I'm gone and for that I am so 
                    sorry.  I didn't want you to have 
                    this life.  I didn't want it for 
                    myself either, but destiny's not 
                    easy to avoid...


      Adam is parked in front of Diana s house.  They re kissing 
      good-night.  Beat.  As Diana gets a TEXT MESSAGE.  

                                  DIANA
                    It s Cassie.

                    I thought keeping you in the dark 
                    would keep you safe, but all I ve 
                    done is left you unprotected...                                                                                    54.



      Nick finishes rolling a joint.  He goes to light it when he 
      gets a TEXT MESSAGE.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    You have incredible power inside
