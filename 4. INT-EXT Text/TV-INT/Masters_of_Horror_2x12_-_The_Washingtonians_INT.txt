    ...STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM SPATTERING ONTO A CHILD S T-SHIRT...

  We PULL BACK to find AMY FRANKS, a very young 10, sitting in 
  the backseat, licking an ice cream cone.

  Her mother, PAM, turns and smiles at her from the front 
  passenger seat.

                              PAM
                Oh my. Look at the mess you re 
                making.
                  (she cleans up Amy with a napkin)
                When did my princess turn into such 
                a little slob? Just like her Daddy.

  They both LAUGH and look over at Daddy in the driver s seat -- 
  but he doesn t join in on the fun.

  MIKE FRANKS looks tired. A little sad. He remains focused on 
  the road ahead, listening intently to the radio.

                                GEORGE RATHBUN (ON RADIO)
                  C MON...WAKE UP, PEOPLE, AND GIVE 
                ME A BREAK, WILL YA! You people 
                should know me better than that by 
                now. GEORGE RATHBUN SPEAKS THE 
                TRUTH! THE SIMPLE TRUTH! I am 
                amazed -- no, I am FLABBERGASTED -- 
                at how many American citizens 
                continue to believe the horsecrap 
                our government is feeding us...



  Mike takes a drink of soda. Rubs his eyes. 

                                GEORGE RATHBUN (ON RADIO)
                I LL TELL YOU WHY! Because our news 
                is controlled and filtered by our 
                  government. Did you SEE bodies on 
                the news? Did you SEE blood? NO! OF 
                COURSE NOT! AND GUESS WHY? Because 
                our government didn t want you to 
                see it. It s as simple as that. The 
                bottom line is this, folks...we are 
                cattle. We believe what we are 
                told. I mean, C MON, doesn t anyone 
                want the TRUTH these days?

                              AMY (O.S.)
                Are we there yet?

  Mike glances up at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees Amy s face 
  smeared with ice cream. He finally cracks a smile.

                              MIKE
                Almost, honey.

                              AMY
                  Daddy...can we turn that off? That 
                man is giving me a headache.

  Pam gives him a look.

                              PAM
                All that talk about dead bodies and 
                blood might be a little much. Don t 
                you think?

  Mike gets the hint -- and quickly turns off the radio.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  4.

                              MIKE
                Sorry about that, princess. It s 
                been a long drive. Daddy s just 
                trying to stay awake. 

                              AMY
                That s okay.

                              MIKE
                Hey, you two remember the last time 
                we all came out to Grandma s?

                              AMY
                    (nods, smart as a whip)
                I was eight and Great-Grams fell 
                and broke her hip. She couldn t 
                come see us for Christmas, so we 
                went to see her. That was the year 
                she gave me my big doll house.

  Mike smiles...lost in the memory...

                              AMY (O.S.) (cont d)
                I m sure gonna miss Great-Grams.

  His smile fades.

                              MIKE
                Me too, princess. Me too.

  Pam leans over and kisses Mike on the cheek. He looks at her  
  -- tries to muster a smile.



  Mike turns into a long dirt driveway, and there it is in the 
  distance -- GRANDMA S HOUSE. Big. Old. Two stories with a 
  peaked roof. And creepy as hell.

                              PAM
                Here it is. Do you remember it, 
                Amy?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  5.

    CONTINUED:66


                              AMY 
                Yeah, I remember. It gave me the 
                creeps back then, and it s giving 
                me the creeps right now.

  Mike looks back at Amy.

                              MIKE
                Remember what we talked about...try 
                not to be so scared of everything, 
                honey. Try to be brave.

                              AMY
                I m not scared, Daddy. I promise.

  But you can tell by the look on her face...she s fibbing.

  Mike notices a white convertible Cadillac parked beside the 
  house -- a big, shiny beast of a car. 

                              MIKE
                That must be the guy I talked to on 
                the phone.

  He pulls in front of the house and parks.



  Pam and Amy are looking at old photos on the wall. The house 
  is tidy, but has a stale feel to it. Mike comes in, carrying 
    suitcases. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  9.

    CONTINUED:88


                              MIKE
                Car s unloaded. Anybody hungry?

                              AMY
                I have to use the bathroom.

                              MIKE
                Just down the hallway. On the 
                right.

  Amy starts down the hall. Slowly. A little nervous. She comes 
  to an open doorway. It s dark inside and she can see...

  ...stairs leading down to a pitch-black BASEMENT. 

  Amy looks down the hallway at the bathroom door, then back to 
  the stairs again. It s dark down there all right. And there s 
  no light switch on the wall. She s not going down there. No 
  way. 

  But she did say she would be a brave girl. She promised. So 
  she takes a step. Then another. A brave young lady exploring.



                              AMY
                    (whispering)
                I m not afraid. I m not afraid.

  She reaches the bottom step and starts looking for a 
  light...but it s too dark to see much of anything. She turns 
  around...

  ...and there are TWO EYES staring right at her.

  She SCREAMS. 



  Mike and Pam are sitting on the sofa. Talking. Their heads 
  whip around at the sound of Amy s scream. 

                              PAM
                Amy!

  They rush into the HALLWAY...

  ...and meet Amy as she comes running up the stairs as fast as 
  her little legs can carry her. She leaps into her father s 
  arms, shaking.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  10.

    CONTINUED:1010


                              AMY
                There s a man downstairs!

  Mike eyes go wide. He hands off Amy to Pam and starts for the 
    basement...and then he pauses...and we see him relax.



  Mike and Pam lead a very reluctant Amy down the stairs. 

  Mike pulls a string hanging from the ceiling. A light comes 
  on...and we see very clearly that the man is actually a LIFE-
  SIZE PAINTING OF GEORGE WASHINGTON. Propped up on a chair. 

                              MIKE
                See. It s just a painting, 
                  princess.

  Amy nods her head. Embarrassed. Mike puts his arm around her.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                I have to tell you...you re a lot 
                braver than I used to be. I never 
                came down here when I was little. 
                That old painting creeped me out 
                too much. 

  Mike glances back up the stairs. Shakes his head.

                              MIKE (cont d)
                I don t know why that door was even 
                open. Grandma always kept it 
                locked.

  We PUSH IN on George Washington s intense guarding EYES.



  Mike is at the window, watching Amy outside -- she is sitting 
  in a sofa style swing in the back yard garden, staring out at 
  her new environment, alone and unsure. Pam comes into the 
  room, lays her head on Mike s shoulder.

                              PAM
                Doing okay?

                              MIKE
                I was just thinking...we ll be the 
                only relatives at the funeral. 
                There s no one else left. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  11.

    CONTINUED:1212


  Pam gives him a hug.



  Mike and Pam are going through Grandpa s stuff. Boxes are 
  everywhere. Most of them taped up and covered with dust.

                              MIKE
                After Grandpa died she had 
                  everything from the store packed up 
                and moved down here. I think it was 
                her way of keeping him around.

                              PAM
                He had a tobacco shop when you were 
                growing up, right? In town?

                              MIKE
                It wasn t just a tobacco shop. He 
                had shelves and shelves of 
                  artifacts from all different time 
                periods of American history. It was 
                like his own little museum.

  Mike comes across a torn open box. He looks inside and sees a 
  jumbled stack of old legal papers.

                              MIKE (cont d)
                Looks like someone already gave 
                this one a once-over. 

  Mike checks out another opened box, a frown on his face.

  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BASEMENT... 

  Amy stands in front of the George Washington painting, 
  staring up into those intense eyes. The painting towers over 
  her.

  She narrows her eyes, puffs out her chest...

                              AMY
                I m not afraid of you!

  ...and then she steps forward and KICKS the chair holding the 
  painting...

  ...and falls backward, flat on her butt...

  ...as the painting begins to tilt forward...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  12.

    CONTINUED:1313


    ...falling directly at her, those eyes getting closer...

    ...closer...

  Amy SCREAMS and puts her arms up to shield herself...

  ...and just in time she is yanked out of harm s way...

  ...as the painting CRASHES to the floor.

  Amy looks up into her Daddy s worried face.

                              MIKE
                Are you okay?

  Her mother rushes over.

                              PAM
                What in the world were you doing?

                              AMY
                I was trying...to not be scared.

  Amy bursts into tears. Buries her face in Daddy s chest. 

                              MIKE
                It s okay, princess. It s okay.

  Pam gives Mike a look. 

                              PAM
                Nice catch.

  He nods his head. Hands Amy over to her mother.

                              PAM (cont d)
                Let s go get you cleaned up.

  Pam carries Amy up the stairs. 

  Mike watches them go, then looks down at the painting and 
  exhales. That was a close one.

  He leans down to pick up the painting...and notices that the 
  frame is broken. 

  And then he notices something else. Where the wood has 
  separated from the brown paper covering the back side of the 
    canvas...there is a piece of rolled parchment sticking out.

  Mike reaches down and pulls out the parchment, which has been 
  tied up with a small red ribbon. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  13.

  CONTINUED: (2)1313


  Puzzled, he puts his hand inside the hole and feels 
    around...and finds something else hidden behind the 
    canvas...a primitive-looking fork. It s old and pale ivory. 
  Looks hand carved.

  Mike slowly unties the ribbon and uncurls the parchment. We 
  see several lines of old-fashioned script. And as we read the 
  words, we also hear them spoken aloud in the dignified voice 
  of the man who wrote them. 

                                LETTER WRITER (V.O.)
                I will Skin your Children and Eat 
                Them. Upon Finishing, I will 
                Fashion Utensils of Their Bones.

  Below the words are initials written in the same script -- GW

                              PAM (O.S.)
                Is it damaged?

  Mike jumps. Pam is coming down the stairs behind him.

                              MIKE
                Jesus. You scared me.

                              PAM
                Sorry.

                              MIKE
                Take a look at this.

  He hands over the letter. Pam reads it. Makes a face.

                              PAM
                This is bizarre. 

                              MIKE
                I found it hidden behind the 
                canvas. 

  Mike lifts the painting upright, leans it against the chair. 

                              PAM
                    (looking at the letter)
                GW? Friend of your grandfather s?

                              MIKE
                I have no idea.

  Mike glances up at the painting...and we see the thought 
  blossom in his brain. He looks at Pam. Gestures to the 
  painting.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  14.

                              MIKE (cont d)
                GW?

                              PAM
                No way.

  She laughs.

                              PAM (cont d)
                George Washington was the father of 
                our country. He chopped up cherry 
                  trees...not the arms and legs of 
                  children.

  Mike isn t as amused. He hands her the fork.

                              MIKE
                What do you make of this thing? 
                Looks like bone to me.

                              PAM
                Yeah...

  She makes a face and speaks in a spooky voice.

                              PAM (cont'd)
                ...maybe even human bone!

  And now Mike can t help it -- he starts to laugh.



  Mike is reading to Amy in bed. Her eyes are getting 
    droopy...and finally closing. Mike turns one last page and we 
  see a cartoon image of a young GEORGE WASHINGTON STANDING BY 
  A CHERRY TREE, HOLDING A HATCHET. Mike stares at it for a 
  moment, then snaps the book closed, and turns off the light.



  The diner is starting to fill up, the dinner crowd just 
  arriving. Mike is sitting across a table from Samuel. Signing 
  documents. Samuel is leaning back in the booth, smoking a 
  cigar. Mike puts down a pen and slides him a stack of papers.

                              SAMUEL
                If I might ask...what do you plan 
                to do with your grandfather s 
                  belongings?

                              MIKE
                Probably keep a few things. Sell 
                the rest.

                              SAMUEL
                You do realize your grandfather was 
                quite a collector. There may be 
                something there worth more than an 
                  unexperienced eye can see. 

  He gives Mike a big charming smile.

                              SAMUEL (cont d)

  Mike smiles back and pulls out his wallet. Samuel waves him 
  away. 

                                SAMUEL (cont d)
                The coffee s on me.

                              MIKE
                Thanks. At least let me leave the 
                tip.

  He pulls out a couple dollar bills, drops them on the 
  table...and GEORGE WASHINGTON grins up at him with that smug 
  smile. Mike stares for just a beat, and then he gets up to 
  leave.

                              MIKE (cont d)
                Well...I appreciate all your help. 
                You ve been very kind.

  Samuel stands up and gives one of his little bows.

                                SAMUEL
                The pleasure was mine, good sir.

  Mike turns to leave...and hesitates. He reaches into his coat 
  pocket and pulls out the parchment letter.

                              MIKE
                I did come across something in my 
                  grandmother s house. Maybe you can 
                tell me what you make of it. 

  He hands over the old letter. Samuel studies it closely. 
  Lifts it dramatically up to the light. 

                                SAMUEL
                Where did you find this?

                              MIKE
                Down in the basement.

                                SAMUEL
                GW?

  Mike raises his eyebrows.

                              MIKE
                George Washington?

                                SAMUEL
                You think George Washington wrote 
                this?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  20.

                Probably not, huh.

                                SAMUEL
                Well, you never know. This 
                  parchment looks old enough to date 
                from that time period. So does the 
                  penmanship. You know Washington was 
                born around these parts? Up north 
                to a Virginian planter family. 

                              MIKE
                         (nods)
                My grandfather told me that story 
                many times.

  Samuel holds the letter up to the light again.

                                SAMUEL
                This letter could very well be an 
                  authentic piece of American 
                history. May I ask what you intend 
                to do with it?

                              MIKE
                  I haven t given it much thought.

                                SAMUEL
                Would you like me to hold onto it? 
                Check with some colleagues of mine? 

  Mike thinks about it. Shakes his head and puts his hand out 
  for the letter.

                              MIKE
                  I appreciate the offer...but I 
                should discuss it with my wife.

  Samuel reluctantly hands over the letter.

                                SAMUEL
                If you d consider selling it, I 
                could probably find some interested 
                parties.

                              MIKE
                I don t think--

                                SAMUEL
                Come to think of it...I know a 
                  collector who might offer top 
                dollar for something like this.

  Samuel pulls out a cell phone, tempting Mike.

                                SAMUEL (cont d)
                Would you mind if I gave him a 
                call? He s very discreet, very 
                  powerful, and I have reason to 
                believe, very generous.

  Mike places the note back in his jacket.

                              MIKE
                I don t think so. But thanks again--

                                SAMUEL
                I ll call him for you right now. 
                Set it all up.

                              MIKE
                    (shakes his head)
                If this letter is the real thing, 
                it should probably be in a museum 
                  somewhere.

                                SAMUEL
                I m not sure you realize what you 
                have here, Mr. Franks.

  Samuel s friendly smile and southern charm are suddenly gone. 
  He looks intense and deadly serious.

                                SAMUEL (cont'd)
                With this one sheet of paper, you 
                could entirely rewrite the history 
                of our country. This letter could 
                forever change the image we have of 
                George Washington. That s an 
                immense responsibility, Mr. Franks. 
                Think about it. Do you want this 
                  knowledge to be known?

  Mike is stunned by the man s reaction.

                              MIKE
                  I ll...talk it over with my wife 
                and let you know what we decide. I 
                thank you again for being so prompt 
                with my grandmother s estate.

  Samuel keeps pushing. Eyes feverish. Voice harsh.

                                SAMUEL
                If I may, Mr. Franks, I d like to 
                suggest you do something.

  Mike turns back at the door.

                              MIKE
                What s that?

                                SAMUEL
                Sleep on it.

  Mike walks out of the diner...all eyes following him.



  Mike is driving. His thoughts focused on the letter, he 
  reaches in his pocket and pulls it out. Could it actually be 
  real? Could it actually change history?

  He shakes his head...

                              MIKE
                Sleep on this, old man.

  ...and leans over to put the letter in the glove 
    compartment...

  ...and as he bends over, we see a RIDER ON HORSEBACK appear 
  outside the driver s side window...



  Mike sits upright again and catches movement in his 
    peripheral vision. He glances to the side... 

  ...and sees the RIDER staring directly at him...

  ...the rider s face an eerie mask of white make-up, which 
  glows in the night...

  Mike is startled. He swerves onto the shoulder.                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  23.





  Mike BANGS the front door open. Charges into the house. The 
  letter in his hand.

                              MIKE
                Pam! 

  A faint voice from the basement.

                              PAM (O.S.)
                I m down here.



  Mike heads down the stairs. Finds Pam carrying an armload of 
  boxes to a big pile stacked neatly by the stairway. 

                              PAM 
                What are you yelling about? Is 
                  everything okay?

  She puts the boxes down.

                              MIKE
                No, everything s not okay. 
                  Something weird is going on in this 
                place. 

                              PAM
                What do you mean weird?

                              MIKE
                Well, first, our friendly lawyer, 
                Colonel Sanders, turns into a 
                raving lunatic. And then I m 
                followed home by a freak on 
                  horseback.

                              PAM
                What?

                              MIKE
                  I swear...it was the weirdest thing 
                I ve ever seen. I look up and 
                there s a guy riding right next to 
                the car. He was wearing some kind 
                of make-up on his face. It was 
                creepy as hell.

                              PAM
                Probably some local having a laugh.

                              MIKE
                I almost wrecked the damn car.

  Pam stifles a giggle. Mike gives her a dirty look.

                              PAM
                Go on. What happened with Samuel?

                              MIKE
                I showed him the letter and he 
                freaked out. 

                              PAM
                He thinks it s real?

                              MIKE
                You should have seen him, honey. 
                For a minute, I didn t think he was 
                going to give it back to me. 

                              PAM
                That sweet old man? You re kidding.

                              MIKE
                Sweet old man nothing. He looked 
                like he wanted to eat me for lunch.

  Pam laughs.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                It s not funny. He went on and on 
                about how this letter could change 
                the course of American history. The 
                idea that Washington s image would 
                be ruined if the letter was made 
                public.

                              PAM
                So he really thinks George 
                  Washington was...some kind of 
                  cannibal?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  25.

  Mike stares at the painting leaning against the wall. Takes a 
  deep breath. George Washington a cannibal? 



  The diner is still crowded at this late hour. Mike, Pam, and 
  Amy are sitting in a booth. Mike is looking at a menu.

                              MIKE 
                Nothing but meat as far as the eye 
                can see. Rabbit meat! Squirrel 
                meat! Puppy meat!

  Pam laughs. Amy playfully smacks him on the arm.

                              AMY
                Daddy!

    A WAITRESS comes over to the booth.

                              WAITRESS
                How you folks doing tonight?

                              PAM
                We re doing just fine, thank you.

                Do you have any chocolate milk?

  The waitress turns to Amy with a big smile.

                              WAITRESS
                Why yes we do. 

  She reaches out and pinches Amy s cheeks.

                Oh my, little sweetie, you re about 
                cute enough to eat.

  Amy smiles -- but she doesn t look particularly happy. And 
  neither does her father.

                Be right back to take your orders.

  Mike watches the waitress go, an uneasy look on his face. He 
  glances around the diner. EVERYONE is smiling and laughing. 
  But the smiles look fake. The laughter too loud. 

  Mike stares at the other CUSTOMERS EATING...

  ...hungry mouths munching on dripping burgers...stripping 
  chicken meat off the bone...gnawing on barbecue ribs...

                              WAITRESS (V.O.) (cont d)
                You re about cute enough to eat.

                Here we go.

  The waitress is back with their drinks.

  Mike blinks his eyes. Tries to snap himself out of it.



  Pam and Amy are singing and being silly. Mike pulls into 
  Grandma s driveway, looking a lot more relaxed than the last 
  time we saw him... 

  ...until he parks in front of the house and sees the front 
  door standing wide open.



  Mike, Pam, and Amy stand in the middle of the room. They all 
  look stunned. The house has been ransacked.

                              MIKE
                     (quietly to Pam)
                They were looking for the letter.

                Who? 

                              MIKE
                It was Samuel and the guy on the 
                horse, I m telling you.

                              PAM
                Where is the letter?

  He touches his jacket pocket.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  27.

  Mike doesn t finish -- he takes off running up the stairs.



  Mike is rustling through his shaving kit when Pam comes in.

                              PAM
                What on earth are you doing?

  He stops and looks up at her. His face pale.

                              MIKE
                It s gone.

                              PAM
                What is?

                              MIKE
                The fork. The bone. Whatever the 
                hell it is! I hid it in my shaving 
                  kit...and now it s gone. They took 
                it.

  A SCREAM echoes from downstairs.

  They rush out...



  ...and find Amy standing in the kitchen doorway...eyes 
    wide...staring down at the table...at a BLOODY HUMAN HEART.



  An exhausted Mike enters, carrying Amy. He tucks her into 
  bed. Safe and sound. He gives her a kiss on the forehead, and 
  she rolls over and snuggles with a big teddy bear. Mike 
  smiles and closes the door behind him.



  Mike and Pam climb into bed. Mike places the letter on the 
    nightstand and turns off the light...and the room goes BLACK.



  ...Amy fast asleep in bed. Still hugging her bear.

  RAP. RAP. RAP.

  She stirs under the covers.

  She lifts her head from the pillow. Rubs her eyes.

                              AMY
                Daddy?

  RAP. RAP. RAP. Coming from the window.

  Amy climbs out of bed. Walks slowly over to the window. She s 
    afraid...but she s trying to be brave.

  She pushes back the curtains...

    ...squints out at the moonlit yard...

  ...and sees GEORGE WASHINGTON standing outside her window!

  He s wearing satin colonial garb, buckle shoes, a powdered 
  wig, white face make-up...and honest to goodness...he s 
  standing right outside her window!

  Amy stands there in shock. Wide awake now. Mouth hanging 
  open.

  George doesn t move at first. He stands perfectly still. 
  Bathed in moonlight. Almost as if someone is painting his 
  portrait...

  ...and then...slowly...he lifts his hand...and points to the 
  front door.

                              AMY (cont'd)
                  (starting to smile)
                You want to come in?

  He nods his head...

  ...and smiles back...

  ...exposing hideously yellow, big false teeth...

  Amy SCREAMS.



  Mike and Pam sit bolt upright in bed.



  Mike and Pam run into the room. Find Amy standing by her bed. 
  She looks terrified.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  32.

                              MIKE
                What s wrong?!

                              AMY
                There s a man outside my window.

  Mike hurries to the window. Looks outside. The yard is empty.

                              MIKE
                There s no one out there.

  Pam hugs Amy.

                              PAM
                Are you sure it wasn t just a 
                dream, honey?

                              AMY
                    (shakes her head)
                It wasn t a dream, I promise. 
                George Washington was standing 
                right outside my window.

  Mike and Pam look at each other...



  Mike runs out into the hallway. Pam grabs Amy by the hand and 
  they follow him into the...



  ...where the POUNDING continues. Louder now. ANGRY VOICES can 
  be heard from the other side of the door. 

                              VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                Give us the letter!

                              VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                We know you have it!

  BAM! BAM! BAM!

  Mike stops in front of the door. Looks back at Pam and Amy. 
  Puts a finger to his lips -- shhh. And then he peeks into the 
  door s peephole...

                              MIKE
                What the fuck?!

  ...and sees a distorted fish-eye view of FOUR LARGE MEN 
  standing on the porch...wearing white powdered wigs and 
  colonial garb...carrying swords and hatchets.

                              AMY
                       (whispers)
                Is it George Washington, Daddy?

                              VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                We know you re in there, Franks! 
                Give us the letter and you and your 
                family will not be harmed!

  BAM! BAM! BAM!

  Mike flinches back from the peephole. Scared now.

                              PAM
                Just give it to them, Mike!

                              AMY
                Did you see his teeth, Daddy? 

  Mike peeks out the peephole again...

  ...all four men glare at him...their skin ghoulishly pale in 
  the porchlight...their eyes wide and brightly fanatic...

  ...and then Mike notices their teeth...uniformly false... 
    disgustingly yellow...and very sharp...

  ...and then the man up front is pointing directly at the 
    peephole...his face twisting with rage...

                              VOICE 1
                Give us the damn letter or we ll 
                carve you into pieces!

  BAM! BAM! BAM!

  This time Mike doesn t flinch. He turns and yells to Pam. 
  Loud enough to be heard.

                              MIKE
                Call the police! Now!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  34.

  Pam runs for the phone. Mike looks out the peephole again...

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                We re calling the police! They ll 
                be here any minute!

  ...and the man up front leans close to the door. Mike can see 
  an insignia patch on his uniform -- a hatchet and a cherry 
  tree. The man smiles and it is a hideous sight.

                              VOICE 1
                We will skin your child and eat 
                her.

  And then he begins to LAUGH. 

                              THE OTHER MEN
                Here! Here!

                              VOICE 1
                This is your final warning, Mr. 
                Franks. Hand over the--

  SIRENS can suddenly be heard in the distance. The four men 
  look down the street. The lead man turns back and stares 
  directly at the peephole.

                              VOICE 1 (cont d)
                We will be back.

  BAM! The door shakes one final time. And then they re gone.

  Mike hurries to a window. Peeks outside. The porch and yard 
  are empty. TIRES SQUEAL somewhere down the street. Mike 
  closes the curtains. Goes to Pam and Amy and embraces them.



  Pam is sitting at the table, a cup of coffee in front of her. 
  Mike sits down next to her with a box of cereal and a carton 
  of milk. He fills a bowl with cereal.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  35.

                        (angry)
                I still don t understand why you 
                didn t tell the police about the 
                letter. 

  He pours the milk. 

                              MIKE
                I told you, honey. I don t know who 
                we can trust and who we can t. We 
                can t just give it to anyone. 

  He takes a bite of cereal.

                              PAM
                I don t care who we give it to. I 
                just don t want it in this house. 

                              MIKE
                I ll call-- 

                              PAM
                Why don t we just burn the damn 
                thing?

                              MIKE
                We can t burn it! Not if it s the 
                truth! We have an obligation--

                              PAM
                You saw those men, Mike! You heard 
                what they said!

                              MIKE
                Okay, honey, okay. Let me call 
                  Professor Hartkinson. He knew more 
                about colonial history than anyone 
                    I knew...including my grandfather. 
                I can trust him.

  He gives Pam a tired smile, but she just glares at him.

  Mike lifts the spoon to his mouth again...

  ...pauses when he sees Pam s eyes go wide...

  ...and then he notices A SEVERED HUMAN FINGER resting on his 
  spoon...

  He flings the spoon onto the floor and jerks up from the 
  table.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  36.

  Pam stares at the bowl, horrified, hands covering her mouth.

  CLOSE UP: The bowl sits in a puddle of spilled milk...and 
  floating amongst the cereal, we see TWO MORE SEVERED FINGERS. 
  Pale. Small (like from a child). The fingers look like they 
  have been chewed.



  Mike is pacing. Talking on the telephone.

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                Michael Franks! What a nice 
                  surprise! 



  PROFESSOR HARTKINSON, 50 s, British, is sitting behind a 
  messy desk. Books and papers everywhere. A big smile on his 
  face.

                                HARTKINSON
                How the hell are you?

  Pam walks into the room. Mike keeps pacing.

                              MIKE
                I ve been better, professor. Thanks 
                for taking my call.

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                Of course. Christ, how long s it 
                been? Ten, fifteen years?

                              MIKE
                Fifteen sounds about right.

                                HARTKINSON
                You still ticked I gave you a B on 
                your final thesis?

  Mike can t help it -- he cracks a smile.

                              MIKE
                It was a B+. And no. History was 
                never my forte.

  Pam gives Mike a look -- c mon, get on with it. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  37.

                Listen, professor, the reason I 
                called--

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                My secretary said it was urgent.

                              MIKE
                It is.

  Mike takes a deep breath. 

                              MIKE (cont d)
                I know this is going to sound 
                crazy...

  He gives Pam a look. It s the moment of truth.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                Last night...my wife and I were 
                woken up by our daughter...she said 
                she saw someone standing outside 
                her window...and then someone 
                started pounding on the door...

    Hartkinson is listening intently.

                              MIKE (O.S.) (cont d)
                ...I looked outside and there were 
                four men on the porch...wearing 
                powdered wigs and what looked like 
                  Revolutionary War clothes...

    Hartkinson s eyes widen.

                                HARTKINSON
                Did you see their teeth? What did 
                they look--

  Mike stops pacing.

                              MIKE 
                How did you know about that?

    Hartkinson gets to his feet...and we see an old painting of a 
  British officer on the wall behind him.

                                HARTKINSON
                Tell me about their teeth, Michael.

                              MIKE (O.S.)
                They were fake. Horrible looking.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  38.

                              MIKE
                  Washingtonians?

  Pam walks closer. Tries to listen in on the conversation.

                                HARTKINSON
                You re lucky you came to me. They 
                have spies everywhere. 

  He lowers his voice.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                What do you have?

                              MIKE (O.S.)
                What?

                                HARTKINSON
                They wouldn t have come after you 
                unless you had something they 
                wanted. What is it?

                I...I d rather not say on the 
                phone.

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                Can we meet somewhere? Today?

  Mike glances at Pam.

                              MIKE
                I can t leave my family.

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                Of course. Of course. I ll come to 
                you.

    Hartkinson glances at his watch.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                My last class ends at six-thirty.             
                And Michael...please be careful. 
                You and your family could be in 
                grave danger.                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  39.





  Mike opens the door and lets Hartkinson in. They shake hands 
  and walk into the den.

                              MIKE
                Thanks for coming, professor. 

                                HARTKINSON
                Of course, Michael.

                              MIKE 
                The Washingtonians...who the hell 
                are they?

                                HARTKINSON
                They re the fringe of the fringe. 
                Sworn to protect Washington s true 
                legacy.

  Mike stares at Hartkinson for a moment...making sure...and 
  then he reaches into his pocket and takes out the letter. 
  Hands it to him. Hartkinson reads it.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                          (awed)
                I will Skin your Children and Eat 
                Them.

                              MIKE
                What does it mean, professor?

    Hartkinson s eyes are afire. His cheeks flushed.

                                HARTKINSON
                The truth. That s what s in this 
                letter.

    Hartkinson moves to the sofa. Sits down.

                                HARTKINSON (cont'd)
                I want to show you something.

  He opens his briefcase. 

                                HARTKINSON (cont'd)
                George Washington was a cannibal.  
                He was a fiend and a murderer and a 
                child eater. But he was also chosen 
                to be the father of our country, 
                and that image is more important 
                than the actuality.

  He pulls out a stack of old documents.

                                HARTKINSON (cont'd)
                History is myth, Michael. It s not 
                just a collection of names and 
                dates and facts. It s a belief 
                system that ultimately tells more 
                about the people buying into it 
                than it does about the historical 
                  participants. 

  He starts flipping through the papers.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                We were taught in school that 
                  Washington was the father of our 
                country. That Lincoln freed the 
                slaves. Those are our lasting 
                  impressions. We are who we are as a 
                nation because of what we believe 
                they were. Because of what we were 
                told they were.

    Hartkinson looks hard at Mike.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                But let me tell you something about 
                  historians, Michael. Historians, 
                for the most part, are not 
                  interested in truth. They re not 
                  interested in learning facts and 
                teaching people what really 
                  happened.

                They re more concerned with 
                  perpetuating the lies they ve been 
                sworn to defend. They re a lot like 
                  politicians in that regard.

  The professor pulls out an old, tattered book.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                It s an exclusive club, the people 
                who know why our wars were really 
                fought, what really happened behind 
                the closed doors of our world s 
                leaders, and most of them want to 
                keep it that way. 

    Hartkinson hands Mike the book. 

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                There are a few of us altruists, 
                people like myself who got into 
                this business to learn and share 
                our learning. But the majority of 
                  historians are nothing but PR 
                people for the past.

  He gestures to the book. 

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                  Americans wanted to believe that 
                George Washington was a great man. 
                They wanted him to be the father of 
                our country, needed him to be the 
                father of our country, and they 
                were only too happy to believe what 
                we historians told them.

  Mike opens the book. Starts flipping through the pages...

                                                                        CUT TO:



  George Washington dines alone, happily slicing flesh from a 
  severed human leg that sits on a serving platter.

                                HARTKINSON (V.O.)
                But Washington was not the gentle 
                old man we made him out to be.

  He takes a sliver of meat and slurps it into his mouth.

  A British Redcoat SCREAMS in agony. He is lashed to a table 
  and his stomach cavity is being ripped apart by bare hands

                As were his inner circle.

  Mike stares at Hartkinson in horror.

                                HARTKINSON
                You ve stumbled upon something very 
                  important here. They re not going 
                to give up. That note s like a leak 
                from Nixon s White House, and the 
                  President s going to make damn sure 
                it goes no further than you and 
                your family.

    Hartkinson glances around the room. Lowers his voice.

                                HARTKINSON (cont d)
                You said you have a daughter...

                She s ten years old!

                                HARTKINSON
                That s not good.

                              MIKE
                Why isn t that good?

                                HARTKINSON
                The Washingtonians wear an insignia 
                on their arms. A hatchet and a 
                cherry tree.

                I saw one just like it. 

                                HARTKINSON
                But in this case the cherry tree 
                  represents Washington s well-
                  documented fondness for the meat of 
                virgins.

  Mike looks like he might be sick.

  BAM! BAM! BAM!

    Hartkinson and Mike jerk toward the door.

                We know you re in there, Franks!

  They get to their feet. The professor grabs the documents. 
  Starts stuffing them back into his briefcase. 

                              MIKE
                Get out of here. Keep the letter. 
                If it s the truth, you need to get

  Mike runs to the stairway.

  He turns back to Hartkinson.

  CRASH! A hatchet blade splinters the door. 

                                HARTKINSON
                Kill us. And eat us.

  Mike points toward the back of the house.

                              MIKE
                Go on! Get out of here!

    Hartkinson runs toward the back of the house...

  ...as Pam and Amy hurry down the stairs, looking terrified. 
  Mike takes them into his arms.

  The hatchet blade continues to eat away at the door. CRASH! 
  The door splinters and cracks -- a hole starts to appear.

  Mike looks toward the back of the house, searching for a way 
  to escape...

  ...but at every window they find MORE WASHINGTONIANS... 

  The WASHINGTONIAN gives the front door one final whack -- 
  CRASH! -- then pokes his head through the hole and lets out 
  an insane laugh. HEREEE S JOHNNY!

  And then the lights go out, plunging the house into darkness.

  Amy SCREAMS.

  Mike pulls his family close...backs away from the door...

  ...and suddenly a HALF-DOZEN WASHINGTONIANS are upon them...

    ...surrounding them...

  ...and then a CLUB IS RAISED...

  ...striking Mike on the head.



  Mike s head BANGS against the van floor as they hit a bump...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  45.

  ...stirring him awake.

  He slowly opens his eyes, sees blurry images of Pam and Amy 
  staring down at him. WASHINGTONIANS sit on either side of 
  them.

                              PAM
                Mike? Are you okay, honey?

  He starts to groggily sit up...when the van jerks to a sudden 
  stop. The back doors are yanked open from the outside and TWO 
  MORE WASHINGTONIANS appear -- one is holding up a lantern, 
  the other is pointing an old musket.

  Amy GASPS and cringes against her father.

                                WASHINGTONIAN #1
                C mon now, princess. We re not

                That s right. We re just gonna eat 
                you!

  HARSH LAUGHTER from all the Washingtonians.



  Mike, Pam, and Amy are pushed inside the doorway. A FAT 
    WASHINGTONIAN is there to greet them.

                              FAT WASHINGTONIAN
                We ve been awaiting your arrival.

  They are escorted down a long DARK HALLWAY, lit only by 
    flickering candelabras. Mike spots bright light coming from a 
  doorway up ahead and hears SOUNDS OF A CELEBRATION.

                              MIKE
                Where are you taking us? 

  The fat Washingtonian stops in the brightly-lit doorway...

  ...and allows the family to be pushed ahead of him into a...                      "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  46.

                Lodge of George Washington! We are 
                thrilled to have you for dinner!

  The room is lit by hundreds of candles. A DOZEN 
    WASHINGTONIANS sit around a huge banquet table. A BELL RINGS 
  and THREE MORE WASHINGTONIANS enter -- carrying big steaming 
  trays of meat...

  ...and then the feast begins!

  A great circle of blood-smeared men and women. Feasting on 
  piles of human flesh and ragged body parts. Ripping meat from 
  the bone with their teeth. Slicing fresh cuts from a human 
  carcass sitting atop the table. All of them dressed in 
  colonial garb. All of them smiling and laughing with wet, red 
  mouths. 

                                                                                          *

  A BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN gets up from the table, wiping blood 
  and gore from his beard. He smiles at Mike and his family, 
  obviously very happy to see them.

                and without supplies or

                                                                        CUT TO:



  A screaming Thomas Jefferson is roped to a big wooden table. 
  His chest and stomach and groin laid open. Bloody entrails 
  steaming. Surrounded by feasting Washingtonians.

                                DEPUTY 1 (V.O.)
                He allowed Washingtonians to rip 
                him apart with their teeth.

                                                                        CUT TO:



  The bearded Washingtonian walks over to a small table in the 
  corner.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN 
                Now this is our prize possession.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  49.

  A tiny light shines down on a glass dome sitting atop a set 
  of ancient-looking wooden teeth. The teeth are filed to sharp 
  points.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN (cont d)
                These belonged to President 
                  Washington himself.

  He lifts the dome and actually sniffs the air, like sampling 
  a fine wine.

                              MIKE
                You re insane! All of you! And your 
                hero George Washington was nothing 
                but a filthy monster!

  A loud MURMUR of disapproval from all the Washingtonians.

  The bearded man replaces the dome and walks calmly over to 
    Mike...and punches him in the stomach.

  Mike doubles over. Pam and Amy both GASP. 

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN
                You are not a guest here, Mr. 
                Franks. You are a prisoner. For 
                now. Later you may be supper.

  He looks at Pam and Amy. Smiles.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN (cont d)
                And you two may be dessert.

  He runs his fingers through Amy s hair.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN (cont d)
                  Especially this one.

  A CHEER goes up from all the other Washingtonians.

                              MIKE
                Don t you touch them! It s me you 
                want. Eat me, you sons-of-bitches!

                                CHUBBY WAITRESS
                Don t worry! We will!

  Samuel Madisson steps forward. Shaking his head.

                                SAMUEL
                Your grandfather would be so 
                  disappointed with you, Michael.

                              SAMUEL (cont'd)
                   (off Mike s stunned look)
                Why yes, son, of course...he was a 
                proud Washingtonian. A good and 
                loyal comrade, and he is dearly 
                missed.

                              SEVERAL WASHINGTONIANS
                Hear! Hear! *

  The bearded man steps forward again.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN
                  Now...I m only going to ask you 
                this one time, Mr. Franks. What 
                have you done with the letter?

                              MIKE
                I ll never tell you.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN
                As you wish.

  He signals a Washingtonian. The man pulls out a wicked- *
  looking carving knife...

  ...walks over to Pam...nicks her on the cheek...and licks the 
  blood from her skin...

  ...then he walks over to Amy...and places the blade close to 
  her face.

  Mike struggles to break free, but is held tight.

                              MIKE
                I swear to God...if you touch them 
                one more time you ll never see that 
                letter again.

                              BEARDED WASHINGTONIAN
                I hardly think you are in a 
                position to make--

                              BOOMING BRITISH VOICE (O.S.)
                Unhand those civilians!

  Everyone turns in the direction of the doorway...

  ...in time to see PROFESSOR HARTKINSON enter the room...

  ...and filing into the room right behind him are THREE LARGE 
  MEN, dressed in dark clothes, wearing SWAT-team body armor, 
  and carrying automatic weapons.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  51.

                                HARTKINSON
                  I said...unhand them!

  The three armed men look shocked at what they see. Hartkinson 
  does not -- he looks downright heroic. 

  And then the SOUND OF A MUSKET BEING COCKED ECHOES THROUGHOUT 
  THE FEASTING LODGE...

  ...as a WASHINGTONIAN comes up behind Mike and presses the 
  barrel against his head.

                                WASHINGTONIAN
                Say your prayers, traitor!

  CRASH! A vase is broken over the man s head. He falls...

  ...and we see young Amy standing behind him. Looking very 
  brave indeed.

  Mike shakes his head and grabs his little girl...

  ...and the room erupts.

    Washingtonians pull out swords and old muskets, all in 
  unison...

  ...but a volley of automatic gunfire cuts them down in a 
  matter of seconds.

  When the gunfire stops and the smoke clears there are only 
  sounds of MOANING and SCREAMING men.

  Most of the Washingtonians have been killed or gravely  *
  wounded. Chewed limbs lay scattered among the dead.  *

  Mike hugs Pam and Amy close to his chest. *

    Hartkinson approaches. Flecks of blood all over his face. He  *
  starts to lead them out of the room. *

                                HARTKINSON
                You need to take your family and 
                leave now. They ll take care of 
                this mess. 

  MORE AGENTS hurry past them and immediately start cleaning up  *
  the room. Gobs of meat and ragged body parts are placed in  *
  evidence bags. Paintings are taken down from the walls.  *

                              MIKE (O.S.)
                Who are they? 

                                HARTKINSON (O.S.)
                They re federal agents.

                              MIKE
                     (looking around)
                How will they ever explain...all 
                this?

    Hartkinson gives an ironic smile.

                                HARTKINSON
                They work for the government, 
                Michael. Like the Roswell incident  *
                and so many other cover-ups, this  *
                event will never have taken place.   *
                They ll sweep it right under the  *
                carpet. They re good at that, 
                  remember?

  Mike nods. *

                              MIKE
                  Professor...what about the letter? *

    Hartkinson cautiously looks around. From inside his coat, he 
  withdraws the letter, wrapped in plastic. He speaks low and 
  filled with reverence.

                                HARTKINSON
                Tell the world. It's history, 
                Michael.

  Mike takes the letter. Shoves it into his pocket.

    Hartkinson gives a proud salute and leads them away...

  Mike, Pam, and Amy are busy getting ready for dinner. Pouring  *
  drinks. Setting the table. Smiling and laughing.

  The doorbell RINGS.

                              MIKE
                I got it.

  Mike turns up the volume on the radio sitting on the kitchen 
    counter...

                                GEORGE RATHBUN (ON RADIO)
                Listen, MORON...I mean mister...I

                my good buddy, Jack Nicholson...
                    (he clears his throat)
                THE TRUTH! YOU CAN T HANDLE THE 
                TRUTH!

  ...and then he heads for the front door. Smiling.
