                                  DANIEL
                    Hey there. I know how you like your 
                    morning coffee.

                                  EMILY
                    You know how I like everything. I 
                    missed you last night. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Me, too. I already sleep better 
                    with you next to me.

                                  EMILY
                    Anything to report on Tyler?

                                  DANIEL
                    He never came home last night. 

                                  EMILY
                    How s your mom holding up?

                                  DANIEL
                    All right, under the circumstances. 
                    She s past the initial shock of the 
                    divorce papers, and now she s 
                      redirecting her energies into

                                  EMILY
                    Which is... a problem?

                                  DANIEL
                    For my 21st she hired the cast of 
                    Cirque de Soleil to perform. 
                    Subtlety is not her strong suit when 
                    it comes to parties.

                                  EMILY
                    Then why don t we do something 
                    small here instead? Maybe a 
                    clambake on the beach? 

                                  DANIEL
                    Perfect. I ll call my mom, tell her 
                    it was my idea.

                                  EMILY
                    And I ll make sure she feels included.

      There s a KNOCK at the open door. It s Conrad. Daniel is 
      wary, still furious with him about Tyler.

                                  CONRAD
                    Hello?

                                  DANIEL
                    Dad, what are you doing here?

                                  CONRAD
                    I m on my way to sit down with your 
                    mother and our lawyers; but I was 
                    hoping you and I could talk first.

      Emily senses the tension and grabs her bag, kisses Daniel.

                                  EMILY
                    And I was just on my way out. Call 
                    me later. 
                          (as she goes)
                    Mr. Grayson.

      Conrad gives her a smile as she leaves. A long, tense beat.

                                  DANIEL
                    What do you want me to say, dad?

                                  CONRAD
                    Nothing, I m just asking you to listen.

                    I have enough people hating me,

                    you re everything to me. I m not 
                    asking you to take my side against 
                    your mother, or even agree with my 
                    actions. But please, don t cut me 
                    out. Not completely.

                                  DANIEL
                    What about Tyler? Clearly he was 
                    just using me to get to you, but 
                    you hired him with full knowledge-- 

                                  CONRAD
                    And admittedly, it was a mistake; I 
                    wasn t thinking clearly. 
                          (taking a calculated risk)
                    Consider him gone.

                                  DANIEL
                    Then consider me back on board.

      Daniel puts out his hand. Conrad shakes it. As Conrad leaves, 
      Daniel s smile fades. He picks up the phone, dials, then...

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)

                    No. But I agree; he s overstayed 
                    his welcome. I ll be asking him to

                      everything that s going on, I 
                    wanted to keep it simple. So

                    concepts for Daniel s birthday

                    narrowed it down to--

                    Clambake.

                    Anything else?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes, as a matter of fact. A young 
                    woman named Amanda Clarke has quite 
                      unexpectedly returned to the 
                    Hamptons after a long absence. 
                    She s the daughter of an old family 
                    friend, and from what Daniel told 
                    me, the current girlfriend of that 
                    boy who runs the Stowaway Tavern. 
                    I d be very interested in catching 
                    up with her while she s in town.

                    Rather than wasting more time, let 
                    me make this simple: my client is 
                    willing to forfeit her rights to 
                    every piece of property except 
                    Grayson Manor...

                    worth all the other homes combined.

                    As for the art, all she s asking 
                    for is the Renoir, the Pollock and 
                    the Henry Moores.

                    you for your 40th? The one you

                    Against my advice, Ms. Grayson is 
                    being more than fair here. In 
                    addition to her share of the

                    Charlotte came to live with me of 
                    her own volition. I m just trying 
                    to honor that choice.

                                  VICTORIA
                    The only thing you ve ever honored 
                    is your own ego. You ve been on a 
                    campaign to alienate her from me 
                    for years. 

                                  CONRAD
                    Charlotte needed no provocation.
                          (to Ryan and Barbara)
                    She and Victoria have never gotten 
                    along. Victoria was even caught on 
                    tape recently saying she wished 
                    Charlotte had never been born.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (glares at him)
                    You re reprehensible. 

      Ryan subtly places his hand on Victoria s wrist. Stay cool.

                    Why don t we table this for now. 

                                    BARBARA
                    I concur. I took the liberty of 
                    glancing through the pre-nup 
                    Victoria signed back in  86. We ll 
                    be using that as the basis for any 
                    financial discussions going forward.

                                  RYAN
                    Actually, Barbara, we won t. Victoria 
                    was pregnant when she signed the pre-
                    nup. Which by any court s definition 
                    would qualify as  duress. 

      Conrad rises, swelling with panic.

                                  CONRAD
                    What exactly does that mean?

                                  RYAN
                    It means, Mr. Grayson, that Mrs. 
                    Grayson is therefore entitled to a 
                    full fifty percent of all assets 
                    accrued during the marriage. We ll

                    and I can t call in sick. I m the boss.

                                  AMANDA
                    So be the boss and put Declan to work.

                    Then I d get shut down for putting 
                    a minor at the helm.

                    So what inspired the idea for a

      Victoria with Ryan, debriefing after their meeting.

                                  RYAN
                    It s obvious after this initial 
                    meeting that Conrad has no intention 
                    of simply handing over what we re 
                    asking for. You should be prepared 
                    for this to proceed to trial. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    No, we ll handle the matter privately. 
                    Neither one of us has any interest in 
                    airing our laundry in public. 

                                  RYAN
                    Then you may want to consider what 
                    you re willing to give up to avoid 
                    that eventuality. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I ve given up far too much already. 

                                  RYAN
                    I m afraid you can t have it both 
                    ways. If talks break down in 
                      mediation, our best chance of 
                    defeating Conrad will be to expose 
                    his infidelities in open court. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    A point you ve made abundantly clear.
                    There are other considerations.

                                  RYAN

                    your self interest. You re playing 
                    right into their hands.

                    You re not going to lose anything. 
                    I m quite good at what I do, 
                    Victoria, but I can t do anything  
                    unless you start trusting me. You 
                    said you were willing to get your 
                    hands dirty, that time is fast 
                      approaching.

                                  VICTORIA
                    My hands already are dirty. That 
                    pre-nup I signed before we were

                                  VICTORIA

                    Amanda s the little girl who lived 
                    in my cottage in the early 90 s. *
                    Daniel tells me her father worked 
                    for Conrad s company before he--

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes. It was a horrible time.

                                  EMILY
                    Do you remember Amanda at all?

                    If it isn t too awkward, I was 
                    thinking of inviting them to stay 
                    for the party after set up. Jack s 
                    become a good friend, and it looks 
                    like Amanda could use one, so--

                                  VICTORIA
                    Sounds like your mind s made up. I 
                    certainly won t stand in the way.

                                  EMILY
                    Great. Mind if I grab Daniel s 
                    squash racquet out of the pool 
                    house for him?

                    Of course. You should know the way 
                    by now. 

      Emily starts out the back. OFF Victoria, staring after her...


      Emily enters, phone to her ear as it rings. The place is a 
      mess, Tyler s belongings are scattered about everywhere. As 
      she goes about searching the room, Nolan answers.

                                  EMILY
                    Any luck drying your computer out?

      ON SCREEN - whale cam POV of the pool house. The image is the 
      interior of a duffel bag, peaking out at a corner of the room.


                                  EMILY

                    guessing back pack or duffel bag on 
                    the floor in the North West corner. 

      Emily looks toward the whale cam. Appears in the corner of 
      Nolan s screen.

                                  NOLAN (CONT D)
                    I see you. Turn 10 degrees to your 
                    right and walk forward. 

      Emily arrives at the duffel bag. Finds the figurine inside 
      the duffel. Puts Shamu in her purse.

                                  EMILY

      She hangs up and Nolan s computer screen goes black as she *
      puts Shamu in her purse. Something else in the duffel catches 
      Emily s eye. An EMPTY PILL BOTTLE. She reads: CLOZAPINE: ANTI-
      PSYCHOTIC. Dr. M. Kutsch, MD. SAN FRANCISCO, CA and a phone *
      number. Off Emily --  


      Emily has the pill bottle in one hand, her cell in the other.  *

                    minute? I m going to connect you 
                    with the detective in charge of Dr.

                    Of course, I ll hold.

      But when Emily looks through the window, she sees Tyler 
      walking up the patio towards the house. Emily quickly hangs 
      her phone up and slides out the back door, with the whale cam 
      and pill bottle in hand, just as Tyler enters. He makes an 
      immediate bee line for the duffel bag. Searches and finds 
      nothing. Dumps the contents on the floor, drops to his hands 
      and knees and pores over the mess, which includes the FRAMED 
      NEWSPAPER CLIP FROM THE TIMES IN 107. And as Tyler realizes 
      that the whale cam and his pill bottle are missing, we cut to 
      another POV FROM OUTSIDE THE BACK WINDOW, where Emily peers 
      through, watching Tyler losing it. Tyler topples the coffee 
      table over, then picks up the framed photo of Daniel and 
      Emily off the ground. Stands, studies it a moment, then HURLS 
      it at the mirror behind the bar. The mirror cracks on impact. 
      And OFF Tyler, staring at his reflection, his personality 
      literally fracturing in front of us...

                                  DANIEL
                    He needs to go away. I m gonna get 
                    rid of him once and for all. 

                                  EMILY
                    Be careful. I ll come with you.

                    So will I.

                                  DANIEL
                    No. It s my fault he s here in the 
                    first place.  
                          (to Ashley)
                    I m so sorry, Ashley. 

      And Daniel goes. Ashley looks at Emily --


      Tyler sits on the coffee table, staring into space. Daniel *
      comes in, turns on the lights. The room is perfectly clean. 
      Tyler is out on the edge, mentally.

                                  DANIEL
                    What are you still doing here?

                          (eerily calm)
                    Waiting for you, Danny. Always 
                    waiting for you. 

                                  DANIEL
                    You need to go. Now. 

                                  TYLER
                    Step ahead of you. Got myself a 
                    ticket back to Cali tonight. 
                    Thought maybe you d come with me.

                                  DANIEL
                    We re nothing, Tyler. We re done.

                    Yeah, I do. 

      Tyler stands, Daniel takes a step back.  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  28.

                          (laughs)
                    Wow. What are you afraid of? Me? 

      Tyler reaches up to touch Daniel s face. Daniel swats him.

                                  DANIEL
                    Stop it. I want you out of here. 
                    Out of my life.

                                  TYLER
                    That s impossible. We know way too 
                    much about each other. And I know 
                    way too much about your family. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Are you threatening me?

                                  TYLER
                    I don t know. Do I need to? 
                          (chuckles)
                    Look at you. So perfect. You really *
                    do lead a charmed life, you know 
                    that? I mean, you re not very 
                    bright, but Daddy s money takes up 
                    the slack. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Shut the hell up, you pathetic *
                    wannabe.*

                                  TYLER
                    I d watch my mouth if I were you. 
                    Pretty as it is, it could end up 
                    getting you into more trouble than 
                    you can handle. 

      Daniel pulls out his phone.

                    Who you calling?

                    Wow. Guess you really are afraid of me. 

      Tyler starts to take a step, then suddenly shoves Daniel 
      against the wall. Fierce --

      Daniel is coming down the stairs holding her gun as Emily 
      enters.

                                  EMILY
                    What are you doing?

                                  DANIEL
                    Making sure the gun stays handy. I 
                    think Tyler s completely lost it. 

                                  EMILY
                    Are you sure that s necessary?

                                  DANIEL
                    He s got no job, no place to live, 
                    and nothing left to lose. Said he 
                    was getting on a plane for the west 
                    coast, but there s no way to know 
                    for sure.

                    I can t believe I never saw this

                    There s no way you could have, the 
                    meds kept it hidden. 

      Emily s phone RINGS. As she takes it, Daniel heads to the *
      kitchen.*


      Nolan heads downstairs on his iPad, checking the tracking *

                                  EMILY
                    Are you sure?

                                  NOLAN*
                    Positive. Unlike people, technology 
                    never lets me down.

      REVEAL TYLER beneath the stairs, but Nolan doesn t see him.*

                                  EMILY
                    What about his brother? Is he still *
                    on his way?

                                  NOLAN*
                    Yeah. Bit of a wild goose chase, 
                    but the Hamptons can always use a 
                    sexy new surgeon. Have fun tonight.

                                  EMILY*
                    Hey. Why don t you come by?

                                  NOLAN
                          (beat, fishing)*
                    Thought it was just supposed to be 
                    friends and family.

                                  EMILY
                    Which means you qualify. See you soon.

      Nolan smiles big, hangs up, and closes the door to the pool. *
      He senses someone behind him and turns to find... Tyler is *
      standing there, holding a serrated hunting KNIFE. Nolan drops *
      the iPad.*

                                  TYLER*
                      Surprise.*

      Nolan jumps back, freaked out. Tyler edges closer, he s 
      sweaty, his eyes shining.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                    I want every copy of the videos you *

                    Where s the camera, Nolan?*

      Nolan swallows hard, his eyes on the knife. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Put that thing down, and we can *
                    talk about this like reasonable

                                  NOLAN

                    on the J. Edgar side of things, and 
                    I usually back stuff up. But those 
                    files are different-- and I swear, *
                    I don t have the camera.*

      Quick as a flash, Tyler swipes the knife at Nolan, cutting his *
      arm through his shirt. It immediately starts to bleed. Tyler *
      shoves Nolan into a chair. As he removes the loosely pulled *
      tie from around his neck, Nolan stares up at Tyler, his eyes *
      wide with shock and pain. Tyler hears Emily s faint voice. *

                    That was Nolan. Tyler s on a plane *
                    to San Francisco*

      Tyler moves to the desk, where Nolan s laptop displays a live *
      WHALECAM FEED from Emily s house. He turns up the volume and *
      watches the screen where...*

      Nolan, now bound and gagged, tied to the chair, rocks back *
      and forth, until he finally crashes to the floor. His hands *
      struggle against the ropes, but to no avail. *


      Emily and Daniel come down the stairs, kiss and split off. 
      Emily finds Ashley arranging hors d oeuvres in the kitchen.

                                  EMILY (CONT'D)
                    Must be awful, realizing you spent 
                    the summer dating Dr. Jekyll and 
                    Mr. Hyde. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    He s not a monster, he s sick.

                                  EMILY
                    That s very generous of you--

                                  ASHLEY
                    It s called empathy-- Tyler needs 
                    help, not character assassination.

      Ashley moves off, annoyed, as across the room...*

      CONRAD has his arm around Daniel. *

                                  CONRAD
                    I d like to send you to Paris for 
                    the Du Maurier conference next 
                    month. I need someone there I can 
                    really count on. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Thanks, Dad. That means a lot.

      Victoria walks up with a gift, kisses Daniel.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Happy birthday, sweetheart. I hope 
                    this year brings you everything you 
                    could ever want.

      Emily joins them, as if on cue.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Emily, hello. Ashley told me you 
                    didn t hire any wait staff for the 
                    party. That s so... rustic.

      On that, Ashley brings Amanda over to Conrad and Victoria.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Victoria and Conrad Grayson, I d 
                    like you to meet Amanda Clarke.

      Conrad is flat-footed but manages to recover.

                                  CONRAD
                    Nice to meet you. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes, a pleasure.  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  37.


      Amanda shakes Victoria s hand and holds it a beat longer. *
      Victoria manages a smile as the memories flood back...

      Victoria s hand drops as Amanda glances at the two of them.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What brings you to town?

                                  AMANDA
                    I just came for a visit. But I m 
                    thinking about making it permanent.

      And OFF Conrad and Victoria exchanging a horrible look...


      Nolan is still trapped on the floor as the doorbell RINGS. He 
      tries again to free his hands but he can t. *

                                  ALEXANDER (O.S.)*
                    Hello? Mr. Ross? 

      ON THE FLOOR - Nolan rubs his head against his shoulder, 
      trying to loosen the gag.

                                  ALEXANDER (O.S.) (CONT D)*
                    Is anyone there?

      Off Nolan, his efforts still fruitless. 


      Nolan finally manages to loosen the gag.

                                  NOLAN
                    Help! Alexander!


      Tyler scans the mantle, where the whale cam should be. But 
      it s not there. He starts searching the house frantically. 
      Emily s cell rings, it s sitting on the kitchen counter: 
      Nolan. Tyler picks up the phone.

                                  NOLAN (O.S.)
                    Emily, Tyler s on his way to your 
                    house!

                                  TYLER
                    Don t worry Nolan, I ll make sure 
                    she gets the message.

      Tyler hangs up, resumes his search.  REVENGE EP 111   "DURESS"  Blue Production Draft   11/3/11  41.



      Tyler is still searching for the whale cam. As he crosses the 
      room, he steps on the floorboard above the Infinity Box. It 
      SQUEAKS. He stops, curious. Drops to pull back the rug as --

      EMILY enters, not seeing him. She lights the candles, then as 
      she picks up the cake, she turns. He s right in front of her.

                                  TYLER
                    Where is it? 

                                  EMILY
                    Tyler, what are you doing in here? 

                                  TYLER
                    You do not want to mess with me 
                    right now. Where s that whale video 
                    camera thing you stole from me. 

                                  EMILY
                    Whale camera? I have no idea what 
                    you re talking about.

                                  TYLER
                    I saw the video feed from your BFF 
                    Nolan s house, I know it s here. 

                                  EMILY
                    God, you re even more deluded than 
                    we thought. Better pop a couple 
                    Clozapine before you hallucinate 
                    yourself right into the ocean.

                                  TYLER
                          (in her face)
                    Give it to me now, you bitch!

                                  EMILY
                    I have a better idea, I m calling the 
                    police, I know they re dying to grill 
                    you about what you did to poor Dr. 
                    Kutsch. Then they ll lock your crazy 
                    ass in a loony bin and throw away the 
                    key. 

      She pockets her cell, brushes past him and starts for the *

      Emily is standing by the open window, having heard Amanda and 
      Victoria s conversation. Nolan walks up.

                                  NOLAN
                    Emily Thorne, displaying emotion 
                    and withholding your inner ninja 
                    while at gunpoint. You almost 
                    seemed like a mere mortal tonight.

                                  EMILY
                    There s a first -- and last -- time 
                    for everything.
                          (lowering her voice)
                    It wasn t loaded. The gun. I took 
                    the bullets out before the party.

                                  NOLAN
                          (whistling)
                    You never cease to amaze-- and 
                    slightly terrify-- me.*

                    Small world, Frank s wallet showing *
                    up in Tyler s jacket. You had this *

                                  EMILY*
                    Did I?*

      Ashley walks up, still rattled.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Talk about the party from hell.
                          (noticing Nolan s blood)
                    What happened to you?

                                  NOLAN
                    Tyler used me for carving practice.

      He moves off, Ashley following.

      Daniel and Emily are getting into bed.

                    But it didn t. We re both okay.

                                  DANIEL
                    Still. I don t know what I did to 
                    deserve you, Emily Thorne, but I 
                    can t imagine my life without you.

                                  EMILY
                    Lucky for you, you don t have to.

      And then she is in his arms.
