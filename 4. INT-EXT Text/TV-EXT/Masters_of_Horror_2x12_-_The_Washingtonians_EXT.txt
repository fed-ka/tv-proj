  We PAN from an OWL sitting high atop a tree to... 

  ...A PRETTY GIRL, early 20 s, walking down a lonely, moonlit 
  country road. Carrying a knapsack.

    HEADLIGHTS approach from behind. She sticks her thumb out...

  ...and the CAR passes...

    ...leaving her alone again. The owl HOOTS high in the tree.

  The girl turns and keeps walking...until she hears something. 
  She stops, looks over her shoulder. Sees nothing. Hears 
  nothing. Starts walking again...

  ...until she hears something a second time. She glances over 
  her shoulder again, but this time she doesn t stop. She s 
  spooked. She starts to walk faster...

  ...and then she s almost jogging, because whatever she hears 
  is getting closer...

  She drops her knapsack, fumbles to pick it up, in a panic 
  now...and before she can start running again...

  ...a RIDER ON HORSEBACK hurtles over a split-rail fence...

  ...we hear a CLASH OF METAL...

  ...and then a shiny SABER flashes in the moonlight...

  ...and we follow the GIRL S SEVERED HEAD as it cartwheels 
  through the air and lands in the middle of the country road.

  The BLOODY HEAD (eyes wide open) rolls to a stop and we HOLD 
  on it for a quiet beat...then the owl HOOTS again...and we 
  slowly PAN back to the girl s crumpled body on the side of 
  the road...

  ...where the RIDER dismounts in the background. We only see 
  him in silhouette, framed by moonlight. 

  And then the sound of an APPROACHING HORSE fills the night...

  ...and A SECOND RIDER arrives and dismounts. Once again his 
  identity is hidden in silhouette.

  The second rider picks up the BODY and starts to wrestle it 
  atop his horse. The man with the saber walks to the severed 
  head and picks it up. Carries it back to his horse...

  We follow the Franks  VOLVO down a familiar country road. 
    Surrounded by rolling hills, woods, and farmland.

                Okay, folks, take a deep breath and

                And despite what we did or did not 
                hear, not all of them were soldiers 
                or little Husseins-in-training. 
                Many of them were just ordinary 
                men, women, and children who 
                happened to live in the same 
                  geographical areas in which we were 
                dropping our bombs. Now...did we 
                know that? NO! WE CERTAINLY DID 
                NOT! AND WHY? 



  We follow the car as they drive down a wooded country lane --
  to grandmother s house they go. 



  The Franks family steps out of the car. Everyone stretching 
  from the long drive.

                              MIKE
                Hello? 

  No one answers. Mike heads for the porch...

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                Hello? Anyone here?

  ...and notices an ELDERLY MAN sound asleep on a rocking 
  chair. Mike slowly approaches.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                Sir?

  Mike touches the elderly man s shoulder -- and he GASPS and 
  startles awake. Jerks to his feet. He looks a lot like 
  Colonel Sanders, the fried chicken proprietor. Tall. 
  Brilliant white hair and beard. Dressed in a white suit, 
  complete with pocket watch. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  6.

  His face erupts into a big smile when he sees that he has 
  company. He speaks with a deep southern accent.

                              ELDERLY MAN
                Well, hey there, folks. I didn t 
                hear you drive up.  

  Pam and Amy step onto the porch. Amy scoots behind her 
  father.

                              MIKE
                Sorry to interrupt your nap. We 
                just--

                              ELDERLY MAN
                No need to be sorry, son. I m 
                always happy to see new faces.
                   (he looks at Pam and Amy) 
                  Especially when they re as pretty 
                as these two.

  He winks at Amy and she GIGGLES. This guy s a charmer.

                              MIKE
                I m Mike Franks. I believe we spoke 
                on the telephone.

  Mike puts his hand out to shake, but instead the old man 
  places both his hands on Mike s shoulders. 

                              ELDERLY MAN
                Mr. Franks. I am so sorry for your 
                loss. 

  Mike nods and shifts uncomfortably, but the old man doesn t 
  let go of his shoulders.

                              ELDERLY MAN (cont d)
                I knew your grandmother very well, 
                son. She was a special lady. It s 
                never easy when someone crosses 
                over to the other side...but I 
                thank the Lord she shed that mortal 
                coil without pain or suffering. We 
                all should be so lucky.

                              MIKE
                Thank you.

  The old guy finally lets go of Mike s shoulders. He takes a 
  step back and actually gives a little bow.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  7.

                My name is Samuel Madisson III. It 
                is my honor to meet you and your 
                family.

  Mike and Pam smile. They re very charmed indeed.

                              MIKE
                This is my wife, Pam. And our 
                  daughter, Amy.

  Samuel gives another little bow. He bends down and puts his 
  hand out for Amy to shake.

                                SAMUEL
                Hi there, cupcake. You can call me 
                Sam.

  Amy smiles, but doesn t budge from behind her dad.

                              MIKE
                It s okay, Amy. Go ahead, shake his 
                hand.

  Amy doesn t move. Mike smiles, embarrassed.

                              MIKE (cont'd)
                Please don t be offended. This 
                one s scared of her own shadow.

                                SAMUEL
                    (winks at her again)
                And a pretty shadow it must be.

  Samuel stands up. Reaches into his suit pocket and extracts a 
  key ring.

                                SAMUEL (cont'd)
                I do believe these belong to you 
                now. 

  He places the keys in Mike s hand.

                                SAMUEL (cont'd)
                We can discuss the necessary 
                  paperwork tomorrow after the 
                service. No rush from my end. I 
                just hope your stay will be as 
                peaceful as can be.

  He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a lollipop. 
  Kneels down again.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  8.

                  Now...I ve been saving this for 
                just the most perfect day. Just the 
                most perfect occasion. I think I d 
                like to give it to you. 

  He holds out the lollipop. Amy pokes her head out. Just a 
  little. She is torn. Should she take it?

                                SAMUEL (cont d)
                It s my favorite flavor. Cherry. 

  Then...very slowly...her hand reaches out. Takes the candy.

                              AMY
                         (quietly)
                Thank you...Sam.

  The grown-ups all share a LAUGH. 

                                SAMUEL
                Just let me know if there s 
                anything else I can do for you 
                folks.

  Samuel tips an imaginary hat and makes his way off the porch.

                              MIKE & PAM
                Thank you.

  Samuel gets into his Cadillac. Drives away with a wave.

  Mike and Pam return the wave and watch him leave...then Mike 
  turns to the door and uses the key to open it. Amy, licking 
  her lollipop, takes a wary step back. Mike looks down at her.

                              MIKE
                I told you...there s nothing to be 
                scared of, honey. Not everyone is 
                going to reach out and bite you.

  Mike and Pam step inside the house. Amy lingers just a moment 
    longer...before mustering the courage to follow them. 

                                                                  TIME CUT TO:



  Mike and Pam sit out on the porch, sipping wine.

                              PAM
                You re serious? You really think it 
                was written by George Washington?

                              MIKE
                I said it could have been.

                It s probably just a joke, honey. A 
                dumb prank. 

                              MIKE
                Why go to the trouble of hiding it 
                so well if it s just a joke? 

                              PAM
                Why did some people used to dress 
                up as Bigfoot and tromp around out 
                in the woods? Just in case someone 
                saw them and snapped a picture. Or 
                found one of their footprints and 
                called the newspapers. This is the 
                same thing. A dumb prank.

                              MIKE
                I don t know. That paper looked 
                awfully old. 

                              PAM
                Where did the painting come from?

                              MIKE
                It s been around since before I was 
                born, I think. You know Washington 
                was born around here?

                              PAM
                I didn t know that.

    A comfortable silence...as they both take sips of 
    wine...stare up at the stars...

  ...until Mike jerks his head toward the woods.  

                              MIKE
                Did you hear that?

                              PAM
                Hear what?

  He puts a finger to his lips. Stares out at the woods. 
    Listening.

                              PAM (cont d)
                What is it?

                              MIKE

                in the trees.

                Ha. Ha.

  She smiles and kisses him on the cheek -- and gets up.

                Come inside. We ve got a long day 
                  tomorrow. 

  Mike gets up and starts to follow her inside. At the doorway, 
  he hesitates and looks back at the dark woods.



  From inside the treeline, we watch Mike go inside and close 
  the door. And then we see the NOSTRILS OF A HORSE move across 
  frame. Branches break -- SNAP! CRUNCH!

  Mike and Pam hold hands with Amy as they walk up a grassy

  ...where a DOZEN OR SO TOWNSPEOPLE are gathered. Samuel 
  Madisson is the only person Mike recognizes.  

  Mike lets go of Amy s hand and waves somberly at Samuel.

  Samuel -- and the entire crowd -- wave back. Mike and Pam

  They reach the burial plot and Samuel approaches.

                This is Nancy Arnold.

                  community.

  She turns to Amy. A big smile crosses her face.

                And you must be little Amy. I ve 
                heard precious things about you.

  An OLDER MAN, 80 s, skinny as hell, approaches.

                              JARED
                Name s Jared Barkish. I knew your

                shop. Shared many a cigar and many 
                a meal with him.

  He exchanges a look with another ELDERLY MAN and they CACKLE. 

                              MIKE
                    (a little unnerved)

                How old is your daughter, Mr. 
                Franks?

  Mike realizes that both men (and most of the townspeople) are 
  staring at Amy. Big smiles on their faces -- maybe too big.

                              MIKE
                  She s...Amy just turned ten. A

  Everyone turns to the MINISTER. He is holding a bible in one 
  hand. Using the other hand to wave everyone closer.

                the memory of...

  Mike takes Amy s hand again. Glances around at the 
    townspeople. It s a funeral...but everyone is still smiling. 

  Off Mike s uneasy look, we 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  The horse is galloping fast, HOOFBEATS LIKE THUNDER, keeping 
  pace with Mike s car. The rider s POV is focused directly on 
  the LETTER as Mike places it into the glove compartment.



  The car regains control of the road and speeds away, leaving 
  the rider behind...

  ...and we watch as the rider leaps a split-rail fence, 
  gallops across a field and disappears into the woods.



  Pam and Amy stand next to a police car in the front yard. Red 
  emergency lights flashing.

  Mike and TWO LOCAL DEPUTIES stand on the front porch. They 
  watch as a THIRD DEPUTY walks out the door -- carrying the 
  bloody heart in a clear Evidence bag.

                                DEPUTY 1
                And you said this is your 
                  grandmother s house? You re here 
                because she recently passed away?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  28.

                              MIKE
                That s right.

                                DEPUTY 2
                Is it possible this happened 
                because of something your 
                  grandmother did? Do you know if she 
                had any enemies?

                                DEPUTY 1
                She involved in drugs?

                              MIKE
                Guys, my grandmother was eighty-six 
                years old. Everyone around here 
                loved her.

                                DEPUTY 1
                Did they take anything from the 
                  house...anything at all...maybe 
                  something that the heart could be 
                  considered some sort of trade for?

  Mike has already decided he s not going to say a word about 
  the letter or the bone.

                              MIKE
                Trade?

                                DEPUTY 1
                A trade? An exchange? Or maybe the 
                heart was a gift. 

                                DEPUTY 2
                Seems more like a warning to me.

                                DEPUTY 1
                If it was a warning, don t you 
                think they woulda left a head 
                instead?

                                DEPUTY 2
                You re right. A head would be 
                better.

                              MIKE
                What in the hell are you two 
                talking about?






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  29.

  CONTINUED: (2)3131


                                DEPUTY 1
                Do you think it was a warning? You 
                having problems with anyone here in 
                town?

  Mike doesn t know what to say -- he can t believe what he is 
  hearing. This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

                              MIKE
                I don t even know anyone in town. 
                We just got here yesterday.

                                DEPUTY 1
                Okay, listen, Mr. Franks. We re 
                going to do one more search of the 
                house. And then tomorrow we ll come 
                back and look around in the 
                  daylight.

                                DEPUTY 2
                And if you think of anything else, 
                feel free to call us.

                              MIKE
                  I will...thank you.

                                DEPUTY 1
                Just do us one favor, Mr. Franks?

                              MIKE
                What s that?

                                DEPUTY 1 & DEPUTY 2
                Sleep on it.

  Mike stares at the deputies as they walk away. Speechless. 
  Pam and Amy walk up. Mike turns to them.

                              MIKE
                We re getting out of here. Right 
                now.

  We follow their car down a mostly deserted highway.

  And then we follow their car into a very nice suburban 
    neighborhood...and into the driveway of a very nice suburban 
  house.

  Mike and Pam get out -- and Mike carries a sleeping Amy into 
  the house.


  OMITTED3737



  We slowly creep into a window to find...



  A white gloved hand POUNDS on the front door. BAM! BAM!



  Mike stands on the porch, watching two police cars drive 
  away. A cruiser remains parked at the curb, an OFFICER 
  sitting inside. The sun is just breaking the horizon.



  A car drives slowly past the police cruiser parked at the 
  curb, pulls into the driveway.

  The porch light turns on...illuminating Professor Hartkinson 
  as he gets out and makes his way to the door, carrying a 
    briefcase.

    Hartkinson glances over at the officer. Gives him a nod. The 
  officer responds with a friendly wave...

  ...and we stay with the officer long enough to glimpse a 
  white wig dangling from a shotgun in the front seat.



  We follow a BLACK VAN down a familiar stretch of country 
  road. The van hits a bump in the road...



  The Washingtonians push the family toward a massive, columned 
  house -- reminiscent of colonial times.




  A TITLE CARD APPEARS OVER BLACK *

                                  SIX MONTHS LATER

                                                                        CUT TO:

  Quick establishing shot of the house. We watch as a Chinese 
  DELIVERY MAN pulls up to the curb and gets out. He leaves the 
  car running and the radio blaring. 

                                IRRITATED CALLER (ON CAR RADIO)
                No way. I m still not buying it. 
                There s no way you can tell me that 
                two hundred and fifty years of 
                American history is bullcrap. It 
                CAN T be the truth...

  The delivery man rings the DOORBELL.



  The door opens and Mike is standing in the foyer. The  *
  delivery man holds up two bags of food.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                Two order fried tofu, two order 
                  vegetable lo mein, one order white 
                rice. That right?

                              MIKE
                That s right.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                You no like meat, huh?

  Mike just smiles and hands over the money. The delivery man 
  makes change.

                              MIKE
                  (glancing at his change)
                What s this?

                              DELIVERY MAN
                That the new dollar bill! They 
                traded Georges!

  Mike holds up the crisp dollar bill to the light...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                     "The Washingtonians," Green, 10/20/2006  56.

    CONTINUED:6363


  ...and we see that George Washington has been replaced by 
  GEORGE W. BUSH.

                              MIKE (O.S.)
                No shit!

  The dollar bill is snatched from his hand...

  ...and we PULL BACK to find Pam standing next to him, holding 
  the dollar up. Eyes wide.

                              PAM (O.S.)
                No shit!

  And then the dollar bill is snatched from her hand...

  ...and we PULL BACK again to find Amy standing next to her 
  mother, holding the dollar up. Eyes wide.

                              AMY
                No shit is right!

  Mike looks at Pam...they both look down at their brave little 
    girl...and they all crack up laughing. Mike closes the door.


  THE END.
