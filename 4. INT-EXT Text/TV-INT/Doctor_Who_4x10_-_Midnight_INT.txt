      Pool, pillars, luxury.  DONNA's on a sunlounger, in a posh-
      hotel-type fluffy white robe.  SMART WAITER brings her a
      PHONE on a tray.  She takes it:

                                      DONNA
                    I said, no.

      SCENE CONTINUES INTERCUT WITH SC.3

      CLOSE ON THE DOCTOR on a wall-phone.  All around him, dark,
      grimy concrete and smoke.
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR
                      A sapphire waterfall!  A waterfall,
                    made of sapphires!  This enormous
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    jewel, the size of a glacier,
                    reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion,
                    and then shatters into sapphires
                    at the edge, they fall a hundred
                    thousand feet into a crystal ravine.

                                      DONNA
                    Bet you say that to all the girls.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh come on, they're boarding now.

      Two women (the HOSTESS & SKY) walk behind the Doctor -

      FX: DMP WIDE SHOT.  A big BUS-TRUCK, 'Crusader 50,' parked
      in an industrial garage.  It's a solid, chunky tank, like
      the Mobiles in U.F.O., but twice the size; caterpillar
      treads, big headlights.  Hostess & Sky walking across a
      gantry to get in, THE DOCTOR at the far end of the gantry,
      on a concrete loading bay, on the wall-phone.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    It's no fun if I see it on my own! 
                    Four hours, that's all it takes.

                                      DONNA
                    No, that's four hours there and
                    four hours back, it's like a school
                    trip.  I'd rather go sunbathing!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You be careful.  That's X-tonic
                    sunlight.

                                      DONNA
                    Oh, I'm safe.  It says in the
                    brochure, this glass is fifteen
                    feet thick.

      FX: WIDE SHOT FOYER, Donna on her sunlounger in front of
      the massive curve of a glass bubble; shafts of sunlight.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    All right, I give up.  I'll be
                    back for dinner, we'll try that
                      antigravity restaurant.  With bibs.

                                      DONNA
                    That's a date.  Well, not a date. 
                    You know what I mean, get off!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    See you later -

                                      DONNA
                    Oy!  And you be careful, all right?
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Naaah.  Taking a big space truck
                    with a bunch of strangers across a
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    diamond planet called Midnight...
                    what could possibly go wrong?!

      And as he hangs up, with a smile, steps out of frame -

      CUT TO TITLES

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE INTERIOR of the Crusader 50: a passenger-vehicle, with
      elements of smartness and comfort, but really, it's more
      of a tough explorer vehicle - basically a big, rectangular
      box, all rivetted, studded metal.  Left-to-right: two seats,
      then aisle, then two more seats.  This repeating back for
      two rows, then with another central aisle bisecting across,
      then two more rows going back.  The tough-metal, sliding
      ENTRANCE DOOR is centre of the right-hand-wall, a couple
      of steps leading down.

      At the back: the HOSTESS AREA, a little kitchen to one
      side, plus TOILETS.  Back wall: a solid EMERGENCY DOOR.

      Other end, front wall: a bigger, more airlock-type door,
      leading through to the DRIVER'S CABIN.

      WINDOWS all along right and left-hand walls; murky glass,
      just the darkness of the garage outside.


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 8 - SHOOTING SCRIPT 16/11/2007    Page 3.

      THE DOCTOR in his seat, towards the front, left, all smiles.

      The HOSTESS, on duty in the aisle.  Beautiful, professional,
      a bit too sharp, smart uniform.

      Just getting into two seats behind the Doctor: PROFESSOR
      HOBBES, late 50s, a bit shambolic, glasses, all enthusiasm. 
      And his Plain Jane assistant, DEE DEE BLASCO, 20s, shy.

      Just walking down the steps: BIFF CANE & VAL CANE - 40s, a
      nice, smiling couple, classic holidaymakers, and their 18
      y/o son, JETHRO, bit of a Goth, sullen, moping.  They find
      seats in the back half, right hand side.

      At the front-right: SKY SILVESTRY, 40s, a businesswoman,
      in a suit.  Strong, but quiet, alone, withdrawn.

      HOSTESS bombarding the Doctor with plastic packets -

                                      HOSTESS
                    - that's the headphones for Channels
                    1 to 36, modem link for 3D vidgames,
                      complimentary earplugs,
                      complimentary slippers,
                      complimentary juicepack, and
                      complimentary peanuts, I must warn
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    you that some products may contain
                    nuts.

                                    THE DOCTOR
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    That'll be the peanuts.

                                      HOSTESS
                    Enjoy your trip.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh, I can't wait!  Allons-y!

                                      HOSTESS
                    I'm sorry..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's French, for let's go!

                                      HOSTESS
                      Fascinating.

      A frosty smile, she moves on to bombard the Professor -

                                      HOSTESS (CONT'D)
                    That's the headphones for -

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    No thank you!  Not for us!

      Hostess moves off to the Cane family; stay on the Professor
      & Dee Dee, settling in with bags, etc, the Doctor listening:

                    ...they call it a sapphire
                      waterfall, it's no such thing,
                      sapphire's an aluminium oxide, but
                    the glacier's just a compound silica
                    with iron pigmentation, have you
                    got that pillow for my neck?

                                    DEE DEE

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES

              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh!  My first.

                                    DEE DEE

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Now don't bother the man, where's
                    my water bottle..? 

      Prof & Dee Dee settle, the Doctor catches Sky's eye, smiles. 
      She's not a smiler, gets back to her book.

      Mrs Cane's calling across to Jethro, who's sitting apart,
      on his own towards the back, left-hand-side.

                                    VAL CANE
                    Now don't be silly, come and sit

                    I'm sitting here.

                                    BIFF CANE
                    Oh, he's ashamed of us.  But he
                    doesn't mind us paying, does he?

                    save the juicepack or have it now? 
                    Look, it's peach and clementine!

      Hostess now back at the front, giving her spiel.  Intercut
      with everyone; the Doctor, Dee Dee & the Canes loving it,
      Jethro bored, the Professor dismissive, Sky ignoring it.

                    I'm afraid the view is shielded

        www.thewriterstale.com
                    orbits an X-tonic star, which has
                    fused the planet's surface into
                    solid diamonds.  Can't risk a little
                    sunburn!  And a reminder that
                    Midnight has no air, so please
                    don't touch the exterior door seals. 
                    The fire exit is at the rear,
                    though, should we ever need to use
                    it...  You first.  Ha ha.  Now

                    see on the map.

      On the front wall, PLASMA SCREENS, one either side of the
      the CREW CABIN DOOR.  Now lighting up with:

      GRAPHICS: a simple representation of the CRUSADER 50, and
      its path, with arrows, over jagged contours.  Hostess points

      She pulls down a BIG WHITE SCREEN from the roof, in front
      of the CREW CABIN DOOR.  PROJECTED on to it: those odd

      It's now a BOX OF NOISE & COLOUR.  The pop song, the oil
      wheel, comedy boings from the cartoon.  The Doctor in
      sensory overload!  Dee Dee handing the Professor ear plugs. 
      Val with headphones on, trying to hear Biff, 'What?  What
      did you say?,' Jethro even more sullen.

      The Doctor catchs a look from Sky.  She rolls her eyes.

      The Doctor gets out his sonic.

      Discreet little whirr.

                    to have had a failure of the
                      Entertainment System...

                    But what do we do?!

                    We've got four hours of this! 
                    Four hours of just sitting here!

      The Doctor pops his head up, over the seat, to all:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Tell you what!  We'll have to talk
                    to each other instead!  How about
                    that, then?  Eh?

      And on his smile, FADE TO BLACK.

      Less formal, now, THE DOCTOR, PROFESSOR HOBBES, DEE DEE,
      BIFF & VAL have moved to new seats, more-or-less in a circle
      at the central aisle crossroads, chatting, BIFF & VAL
      holding court.  JETHRO sits a bit apart, HOSTESS at the
      back, bored.  SKY stays front, reading.  Mid-anecdote:

                                    VAL CANE
                    - so Biff said, I'm going swimming -

                                    BIFF CANE
                    Oh, I was all ready, trunks and
                      everything!  Nose plug!

                                    VAL CANE
                    He had this little nose plug, you
                    should've seen him -

                                    BIFF CANE
                    So I went marching up to the
                      lifeguard, and he was a Shamboni,
                    you know, those big foreheads? -

                                    VAL CANE
                    - great big forehead! -

                    And he said -

                                    VAL & BIFF
                    'The pool... is abstract!'

      The Doctor, Prof, Dee Dee, Biff, Val, hooting!  Hostess
      too, a little.  Even a grudging smile from Jethro.

                                    VAL CANE
                    It wasn't a real pool!

                                    BIFF CANE
                    It was a concept!

                                    VAL CANE
                    It wasn't real!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And you had a nose plug!

      THE DOCTOR & DEE DEE at the back of the cabin, making
      themselves Max-pax-type coffees.  Everyone else in b/g
      dotted about in their seats, the HOSTESS taking orders.

                    ...I'm just a second-year student,
                    but I wrote a paper on the Lost
                    Moon of Poosh.  Professor Hobbes
                    read it, and he liked it, so he
                    took me on as a researcher.  Just
                    for the holidays.  Well, I say
                      researcher, most of the time he's 
                    got me fetching and carrying.  But
                    it's all good experience!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And did they ever find it?

                    recently.  Not by choice.

                                    THE DOCTOR

      down the aisle.  Simple Open University-type slides.  THE

      joined by HOSTESS, all listening, intent.  Even JETHRO's
      closer, loving this, SKY distant, but half-paying attention.

                    The history is fascinating, because
                    there is no history.  There's no
                    life in this entire system, there
                    couldn't be.  Not ever.  Before
                    the Leisure Palace Company moved
                    in, no one had come here.  In all
                    eternity.  No living thing...

                    what's the problem, Driver Joe?

                                      DRIVER JOE
                    We're just stabilising the engine
                    feeds, won't take long.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um.  No.  Cos... that's the engine
                    feed, that light there, and it's
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    fine, and it's a micropetrol engine,
                    so 'stabilising' doesn't really
                    make sense, does it?  Sorry!  I'm
                    the Doctor.  I'm very clever.  So
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    what's wrong?

                                      CAPTAIN JOE
                    Well.  Don't tell the others, but,
                    uh...  No idea.

                                      MECHANIC CLAUDE
                    We just stopped.  Everything's
                    working, look, all systems fine. 
                    But we're not moving.

      During this, the Doctor sonicking the dashboard.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You're right.  No faults.  And who
                    are you?

                                      MECHANIC CLAUDE
                    Claude, I'm the mechanic.  Trainee.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nice to meet you. 

                                      DRIVER JOE
                    I've sent a distress signal, they'll
                    dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    How long till they get here?

                    About an hour.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well.  Since we're waiting... 
                    Shall we take a look outside? 
                    Just... lift the screens a bit?

                                      DRIVER JOE
                    It's 100% X-tonic out there, we'd
                    get vapourised.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, those windows are Finitoglass,
                    they'd give you a couple of minutes.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Joe, you said you took a detour?

                                      DRIVER JOE
                    Just 40 kliks to the West.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Is that a recognised path?

                                      DRIVER JOE
                    No, it's a new one, the computer
                    worked it out, on automatic.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    Now come on!  That's enough. 
                    Doctor, back to your seat.  And
                    not a word.  Let's not panic them,
                    the rescue's on its way.  If you
                    could close the door, thank you.

      The Doctor doesn't argue, steps back through -

                                                                            CUT TO:

      seats (the slide-projector cleared away), HOSTESS at the
      back.  Sky more on edge than anyone -

                    What did they say?  Did they tell

                    you?  What is it, what's wrong?

                                    THE DOCTOR

                                    SKY
                    I don't need this.  I'm on a

                    Back to your seat, thank you.

      And the Doctor does so.  Dee Dee leaning forward, quiet:

                                    DEE DEE
                    Excuse me, Doctor, but they're
                      micropetrol engines, aren't they?

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Now, don't bother the man.

                                    DEE DEE
                    But my father was a mechanic, and... 
                      micropetrol doesn't stabilise,
                    what does 'stabilise' mean?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well.  Bit of flim-flam.  Don't

                    What I want to know is, how long
                    do we have to sit here -

      Tap tap.

      A bit louder.  Everyone tense.

                                    SKY
                    What is it?

                                    VAL CANE
                    Someone's out there.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Now, don't be ridiculous.

                                    DEE DEE
                    Like I said, it could be rocks.

                                      HOSTESS
                    We're out in the open.  Nothing
                    could fall against the side.

      Tap tap.

      It's moved, three feet back.  Everyone's stare following. 
      The Doctor grim, but fascinated; Jethro too, both spooky:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Knock knock.

                                      JETHRO
                    Who's there?
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
      Sky's wound up tight, brittle:

                                    SKY
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Is there something out there? 
                    Well?  Anyone?  What the hell is
                    making that noise?

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Excuse me!  I must insist.  I'm
                    sorry, but the light out there is
                    X-tonic, that means it would destroy
                    any living thing, in a split-second,
                    I mean any sort of lifeform - carbon-
                    based, hydrogen-based, silicates,
                    gaseous, every form of life in the
                    known universe, it's impossible,
                    literally impossible, for someone
                    to be outside -

      TAP TAP!  Louder.  Further back, left.  All flinch, look
      in that direction (though it's hard to tell exactly where
      it came from - all look at slightly different points).

                                    SKY
                    What the hell is that then?!

      The Doctor scoots round to where the last tap came from,
      presses his face against the wall -

                                      HOSTESS
                    Sir!  You really should stay in
                    your seat -

                    Bit late for that!

      On the Doctor.  Listening.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Hello...?

      Tap tap.  Further back, left wall.  All faces following.

                                      JETHRO
                    It's moving...

      Tap tap.  Even further back, left wall.

      And then...

      Tap tap.  On the back-wall EMERGENCY DOOR.  Pause, then
      worse, the door gives a tiny rattle.

      The Hostess backs away from the back-wall.

                                    VAL CANE
                    It's trying the door.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    There is no 'it', there's nothing
                    out there.  Can't be.

      Another tiny rattle of the door.
        www.thewriterstale.com

      Hold the pause.  All staring at the door...

      Then all jump - as the next tap tap comes from the middle
      of the ceiling!

      All looking up...

      Tap tap.  Crossing over to the right hand corner....

      Tap tap.  On the right hand wall, the ENTRANCE DOOR.

                                    VAL CANE
                    That's the entrance.  Can it get
                    in?

                                    DEE DEE
                    No, that door's on two hundredweight
                    of hydraulics.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Stop it.  Don't encourage them.

                                    DEE DEE
                    Then what do you think it is?

      Biff walks towards the door...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Mr Cane, better not...

                    Naah, cast iron, that door...

      He knocks on it.  Three times.  Tap tap tap.

      Pause.

      Hold.

      Then the knock's returned, tap tap tap.

      Woah!  That really freaks everyone, Biff retreating, all
      (except Sky) shifting away to the left-hand-side -

                                    VAL CANE
                    Three times!  Did you hear that,
                    three times?!

                                      JETHRO

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    All right, everyone, calm down -

                                    SKY
                    But it answered, that was an answer,
                    don't tell me that thing's not
                    alive, it answered him!

      TAP TAP TAP!!!  Louder!

      Everyone flinching back further, against the left-hand
      wall, but the Doctor runs to the Entrance Door, to listen -

                                      HOSTESS
                    I really must insist, get back to
                    your seat - 

      But Sky's really losing it, terrified:

                                    SKY
                    Don't just sit there telling us
                    the rules, you're the Hostess,
                    you're supposed to do something!

      The Doctor knocks four times, tap tap tap tap.

      In reply, TAP TAP TAP TAP!!! 

      All freaked out!  But now losing it completely -

      But her panic triggers the others to focus their fear on
      her - all speeches simultaneously, Sky standing, backing
      into the front-right-corner, accusing them all -

      But all silenced as -

      The tapping becomes constant.  Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
      tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap - 

      The Doctor moving back from the door, to study it,
      everyone's faces following the noise, as ...

      Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap, moving up and down, tracing a
      path like a snake, but heading forwards, all the way along
      the right-hand-wall...

      All scared, eyes trying to follow its path...

      And their eyes flick ahead, to the noise's destination -

      Sky.  At the very front.  It's heading for her!

      And she shrinks down into her corner, sinking down on to
      the floor, helpless, wailing -

                                    SKY (CONT'D)
                    - it's coming for me, it's coming
                    for me, it's coming for me - !

      The Doctor running forward -

      But before he can reach her -

      WHAM!!!!!  PRAC FX, the wall above Sky buckles -

      She screams -

      And the whole room plunges into DARKNESS!

      And the whole bus MOVES!  Glimpses of the chaos as the
      whole room LURCHES RIGHT - everyone tumbling, holding on -

      PRAC SPARKS EXPLODING from wall-panels, illuminating them
      all for sudden seconds, then dark again -

      Whole room lurches left, everyone flying -

      Whole room lurches level again -

      And... stops.

      Silence.

      On the Doctor, slowly lifting himself up...
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

                    I'm fine, everyone else?
        www.thewriterstale.com

      But he's distracted by...

      A broken TV-pivot-arm is in front of him.  For a second,
      it flickers into life.  Rafaella again, distorted; an echoey
      pop song, haunting.  The Doctor staring.  Then it dies.

      The Doctor shakes it off, stands -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    How are we?  Everyone all right?

      Stay on the TV screen for a second.  A flash, a glimpse of -

      ROSE.  To CAMERA.  Desperate, mute, but mouthing 'Doctor!'

      Then it's gone.  The Doctor didn't see it. 

      In the rest of the cabin: whimpering and moans from all
      round, but everyone's survived, now standing, dazed.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                      ...earthquake, must be...

      Then torchlight lances out, from the Hostess -

                                      HOSTESS
                    We've got torches, everyone, take
                    a torch, they're in the back of
                    the seats... /

      The Doctor grabs one, then the Professor, Dee Dee, Val,
      Biff, Jethro - pitch darkness, torchbeams lancing across -

      CU faces caught in torchlight, everyone checking everyone
      else, all bewildered.

      Val going to Jethro, hugging him - 

                                    VAL CANE
                    Oh sweetheart, come here...

                    Never mind me, what about her?

      He's shining his torch over at Sky.

              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
      The Doctor does the same.  Then heads over to her.

      Sky's still huddled on the floor, in the corner, but now
      facing the wall.  Like a child, thinking they're hidden. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
      Visibly breathing hard.  NB, during the camera shake &
      darkness, the seats around Sky have been flattened, so
      she's huddled in a little clearing - crucially, with no
      seats blocking everyone's view of her.

                                    VAL CANE
                    What happened to the seats?

                                    BIFF CANE
                    Who did that..?

      The Doctor reaches her, strokes the top of her head, kind:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's all right, it's over, we're
                    still alive, look...

      He shines his torch on the wall above her.  A big DENT,
      like something's punched in.  But the metal's not broken.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    The wall's still intact.  D'you
                    see?  We're safe.

      Front wall, she opens the DRIVER'S CABIN DOOR -

      WHOOOSH!  For a second, the doorframe is full of PRAC FX:
      WIND, SMOKE BLASTING ACROSS, like a contained hurricane,
      RAW WHITE LIGHT, with only BLACK BEYOND, outside the door -

      The Hostess backing away down the aisle, horrified.  All
      shining torches on her, and the sealed door.  (Except
      Jethro; keeping his torch on Sky throughout, watching.) 
      At the same time, the Doctor's leaping across to a wall-
      panel on the front wall, left-hand-side, sonicking.

      All tense now, but low-level.  Grim, not hysterical:

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    Don't be ridiculous.  It can't be
                    gone, how can it be gone?

                    Well you saw it!

                                      HOSTESS
                    There was nothing there, like...
                    it's been ripped away.

      Biff shines his torch at the Doctor.

                                    BIFF CANE
                    What are you doing?

      And now all (except Jethro) turn their torches on the
      Doctor, moving forward, just a little, to look at him.

      He's opened the panel, is digging through wiring.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That's better, little bit of light,
                    thank you.  Molto bene!

                                    VAL CANE

                    But the cabin's gone, you'd better
                    leave that wall alone -

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    - the cabin can't be gone - !

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, it's safe, any rupture would
                      automatically seal itself, but...

      He pulls out thick, severed wires.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Something sliced it off.  You're
                    right.  The cabin has gone.

                                      HOSTESS
                    But if it gets separated...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It loses integrity.  I'm sorry. 
                    They've been reduced to dust.  The
                    driver, and the mechanic.

      Quiet, awful reaction; stillness, just a moan from Val.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    But they sent a distress signal. 
                    Help is on its way.  They saved
                    our lives!  We're gonna get out of
                    here, I promise, we're still alive,
                    and they're gonna find us.
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
      But all through this, Jethro keeps his torch on Sky.

      She's still facing the wall.  Breathing.

                                      JETHRO
                    Doctor.  Look at her.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Right, yes, sorry - have we got a
                    medical kit?

                                      JETHRO
                    Why won't she turn around?

      And now everyone shines their torches on Sky.

      All unnerved.  Just... something strange about her.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    What's her name?

                                      HOSTESS
                      Silvestry.  Mrs Sky Silvestry.

      With everyone a good distance back from Sky, still pointing
      torches, the Doctor moves round, to approach her.  Crouches
      down, gentle.  Though keeping a distance back, wary.

      She's just breathing.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Sky?  Can you hear me?  Are you
                    all right?  Can you move?  Sky,
                    just look at me.

                                      JETHRO
                    That noise, from outside, it's
                    stopped.

                                    VAL CANE
                    Well thank God for that.

                                      JETHRO
                    But what if it's not outside any
                    more?  What if it's inside?

                                    VAL CANE
                    Inside where?

                                      JETHRO
                    It was heading for her.

      Everyone sick with dread, now.  Staring.  Torches.

      As the Doctor inches forward, just a little.

              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's all right, Sky.  I just want
                    you to turn around.  And face me.

        www.thewriterstale.com
      And she starts to turn.  Swivelling round.

      Slowly.

      The Doctor, Jethro, Professor Hobbes, Dee Dee, Hostess,
      Val and Biff all staring....

      And slowly, shifting her body...

      Sky turns her head...

      Stares at them.  In the light of all the torches.

      And she's insane. 

      Eyes wild and glittering.  But clever.  No special make-
      up, no FX, just the stare of something... different.

      All shocked.  Val & Biff step back.  Keep aiming torches.

      But the Doctor is fascinated.

      Absolute silence.

      Sky barely moving, still shrunk into the corner - as though
      her body has little power - but her eyes do all the work. 
      Darting at the Doctor, Professor Hobbes, Dee Dee, Jethro,
      Hostess, Val, Biff; all of them, one by one.

      Like they're new.

      Hold the silence.  The Doctor shifting forward, just an
      inch.  She suddenly whips her stare back to him -

      Val flinches, Sky's slightest move scaring her -

      Sky concentrates on the Doctor now.  Tilts her head left,
      then right, as though studying every detail of him.  The
      Doctor mimicking the move, gently, calmly.

      Then, quietly:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Sky?

      Pause.  As though Sky is wondering.  And then...

                                    SKY
                    Sky?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Are you all right?

      Pause.

                    You don't have to talk.

      And now, no pauses, Sky's responses right on the line -

                                    SKY
                    You don't have to talk.

          telling you to stop -it down -

      But during this, Sky's eyes darting like crazy, as she
      repeats all voices.  4 speeches at once - ie, technically:
      shoot Sky's version of all 4 speeches and INTERCUT with
      the others, fast, cut-cut-cut, so it's simultaneous:

                                    SKY
                    Driving me mad/scaring my wife/
                    Doctor did you plan/keep it down -

      And without stopping, this runs into the below, with Sky's
      ability panicking everyone, now with SIX speeches colliding,
      simultaneous, the volume rising and rising -

                      JETHROphysically impossible,
        She can copy anything! that's not the same woman,

        look at her, one
          million seven hundred
        www.thewriterstale.com
        and twenty six!

      The Doctor boggling at Sky, transfixed as simultaneously,
      with the above, she's even faster, all 6 speeches at once:

                                    SKY
                    Stop talking/so help me/
                      Silvestry/sixteen, thirty
                      five!/scaring the passengers/Doctor
                    look/not the same woman/I'm ordering
                    you!/stop repeating/rescue
                      services/one million seven/else
                    inside her/make her stop - !

      Rising, rising, voices at fever pitch until -

      The lights come back on!

      Low-level, darker, emergency lighting (though not coloured). 
      Everyone shocked into silence, looking up and round - and
      with their attention away from Sky, for the next few lines,
      they don't immediately notice what's happened...

      Because Sky's repetition has now caught up with them.  The
      frenzy above has got her up to speed; she now says lines
      with people.  Not after, no delay, not just repeating;
      she's absolutely synchronised.  (Speech headings denote
      this from now on, as Sky says every line.



                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 8 - SHOOTING SCRIPT 16/11/2007    Page 32.

      EG, instead of THE DOCTOR, it's THE DOCTOR & SKY, as they
      say the lines together.  Sky a little quieter, so she's an
      undertone.)

      So, looking round, at the lights, clicking off torches:

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    It's the back-up systems.

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    Well!  That's a bit better.

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    What about the rescue, how long's
                    it going to take?

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    About sixty minutes, that's all.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY
                    Then I suggest we all calm down. 
                    This panic isn't helping.  And
                    that poor woman is evidently in a
                    state of self-induced hysteria, we
                    should leave her alone.  Now sit
                    down!  Deep breaths.  Hostess, I
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    think a nice hot drink might do us
                    all the power of good.

      But Jethro's still watching Sky.  Even he's unnerved, now:
        www.thewriterstale.com

                                      JETHRO & SKY

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    I know.

      Because he's been watching her too.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY
                    Doctor, now step back, I think you
                    should leave her alone -

      But in looking at Sky, the Professor sees her saying his
      own words.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY (CONT'D)
                    What's she doing..?
                          (pause)
                    How can she do that?

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    But... she's talking with you -
                          (horrified)
                    And with me!  Oh my God!  Biff,
                    what's she doing?

                    She's repeating at exactly the
                    same time.

                                    DEE DEE & SKY
                    That's impossible.

                      ...there's not even a delay.

                                      JETHRO & SKY
                    Ohh man, that is weird.

      Sudden stop, hoping she'll race on to 'P'.  But Sky stops

      Horror.  Val puts her hands to her mouth, starting to cry. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
      Little sobbing noises, as Biff holds her.

      Sky stares at her.  Little sobbing noises, in synch.  Though
      throughout all this she never loses that slight smile.

      The Doctor stands, carefully backing away from her.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY (CONT'D)
                    I think, the more we talk, the
                    more she learns.  Now, I'm all for
                      education, but in this case, maybe
                    not.  Let's just... move back. 
                    Come on.  Come with me.

      He's heading for the back -

                    Everyone, get back, all of you, as

      All moving to the back of the bus, still glancing back at
      Sky, so scared of her.

      Sky stays where she is.  Staring.

      The others huddle at the back, as far away from Sky as
      possible.  She still keeps saying everything they say, in
      synch.  But more of a mutter, now.  Speech designations
      stay as 'THE DOCTOR & SKY', but with the Doctor easily
      more prominent now; use Sky and her muttering as a CUTAWAY,
      as and when, because the others can't help glancing back
      at her, throughout.  The Devil in the corner.

      And now, the back-of-the-bus becomes a drama in itself. 
      The Doctor, Professor Hobbes, Val, Biff, Jethro, Dee Dee,
      Hostess, all quiet, intense.  With such a sense of dread.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY (CONT'D)
                    Fify minutes.  That's all we need. 
                    Fifty minutes till the rescue
                    arrives.  And she's not exactly
                    strong, look at her, all she's got
                    is our voices.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                      Professor, I'm glad you've got a
                    absolute definition of life in the
                    universe, but perhaps the universe
                    has got ideas of its own.  Now
                    trust me.  I've got previous!  I
                    think there might well be some...
                      consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry,
                    but maybe she's still in there. 
                    And it's our job to help her.

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    Well you can help her, I'm not
                    going near.
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    No, I've got to stay back.  Cos if
                    she's copying us, maybe the final
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    stage is becoming us.  I don't
                    want her becoming me, or things
                    could get a whole lot worse.

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    Oh, like you're so special.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    As it happens, yes I am.  So that's
                    decided.  We stay back.  And we
                    wait.  When the rescue ship comes,
                    we can get her to hospital -

      But given the tension, the Doctor, for once, hasn't got
      authority.  The Hostess is cold, fixed:

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    We should throw her out.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY
                    I beg your pardon?

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    Can we do that?

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Don't be ridiculous -

                    That thing, whatever it is, killed
                    the driver, and the mechanic, and
                    I don't think she's finished yet -

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    She can't even move!

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    Oh just look at her!

      They all look.  Sky's eyes; her muttering; the slight smile.

                                      HOSTESS & SKY (CONT'D)
                    Look at her eyes!  She killed Joe,
                    and she killed Claude, and we're
                    next.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    No one is getting thrown out!

                                    DEE DEE & SKY
                    Yes we can.

      All looking at Dee Dee, now.  Nervous, but determined:

                                    DEE DEE & SKY (CONT'D)
                      Cos...there's an air pressure seal.
                          (to the Hostess)
                    Like when you opened the cabin
                    door, you weren't pulled out, you
                    had a couple of seconds, cos it
                    takes the pressure-wall about six
                    seconds to collapse.  Well, six
                    seconds exactly.  That's enough
                    time to throw someone out.  

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Thanks Dee Dee, just what we needed -

                    Would it kill her?  Outside?

                    I don't know, but she's got a body
                    now, it would certainly kill the
                    physical form -

                      I wouldn't risk the cabin door

      The Emergency Door, right behind them.

                    All we need to do is grab hold of
                    her.  And throw her out.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Now listen!  All of you!  For all
                    we know, that's a brand new lifeform
                    over there.  And if it's come
                    inside, to discover us, than what's
                    it found?  This little bunch of
                    Humans, what d'you amount to? 
                    Murder?  Cos this is where you
                    decide.  You decide who you are. 
                    Could you actually murder her? 
                    Any of you?  Really?  Or are you
                    better than that?

      Pause.  But just as he should be changing their minds:

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    I'd do it.

                    ...thing is though, Doctor.  You've
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    been loving this. 

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Ohh, Jethro, not you -

                                      JETHRO & SKY
                    No, but ever since the trouble
                    started, you've been loving it.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY
                    It has to be said, you do seem to
                    have a certain... glee.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    All right, I'm interested, yes, I
                    can't help it, cos whatever's inside
                    her, it's brand new, and that's
                      fascinating -

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    What, you wanted this to happen?

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    No!

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    And you were talking to her, all
                    on your own, before the trouble,

                    right at the front, you were talking
                    to that Sky woman, the two of you
                    together, I saw you -

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    We all did!

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    - and you went into the cabin -

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    - what did you say to her?

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    I was just talking!

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    Saying what??

                                      JETHRO & SKY
                    You called us Humans like you're
                    not one of us.

                                    VAL CANE & SKY
                    He did!  That's what he said!
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                                    DEE DEE & SKY
                    And the wiring, he went into that
                    panel and opened up the wiring -

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    That was after!

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    But how did you know what to do??!

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                          (exasperated)
                    Because I'm clever!

      Which makes them all step away from him a fraction.  Colder,
      now.  Hostile.  The Doctor truly unnerved, for once.  Quiet:

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES & SKY
                    I see.
                          (pause)
                    Well.  That makes things clear.

                                    BIFF CANE & SKY
                    What are we, then?  Idiots?

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    That's not what I meant -

                    If you're clever then what are we?

                    You've been looking down on us
                    from the moment we walked in.

                                      HOSTESS & SKY
                    If he goes, then he's practically
                      volunteered.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Ohh come on, just listen to youself,

                    If we have to.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Look, just... right, sorry, yes,
                    hold on, just...  I know, you're
                    scared, and so am I, look at me, I
                    am, I swear!  But we all need to
                    calm down, and cool off, and think.

                    Perhaps if you told us your name.

                    Then tell us.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    ...John Smith.

      Scorn and 'hah!' from all.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Your real name.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Doctor John Smith.

                                    BIFF CANE
                    He's lying, look at his face.

                                    VAL CANE
                    His eyes are the same as hers.

                                      JETHRO
                    Why won't you tell us?!

      Still hushed, fierce - four of them burst into -

                    VAL CANE
        He's been lying to
        us, right from the
        start -

                    BIFF CANE
        No one's called John
        Smith!  Come off it!



                                                              JETHRO
                                                    Just tell us, Doctor,
                                                    just say it.

                                                                HOSTESS

                                                    name??

      All attacking the Doctor, breaking off when -

      The Doctor steps back.  Scared of them.  So he's now between
      Sky and the others, with his back to Sky.  Furious:

              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    Now listen to me!  Listen to me,
                    right now, because you need me,
                    all of you, if we're going to get
                    out of this, then you need me -

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    So you keep saying!  You've been
                    repeating yourself more than her -

                                    VAL CANE
                    If anyone's in charge, it should
                    be the Professor, he's an expert!

                    Mum, just stop, just look...

                                    VAL CANE
                    You keep out of this, Jethro.

                                      JETHRO
                    But look at her!

                                    DEE DEE
                    She's stopped...

      Jethro and Dee Dee have been staring past the Doctor...

      The Doctor turns round to look at Sky, everyone else staring
      too.  Because for the last page or so, discreetly, Sky has
      stopped talking in synch.  Except for the Doctor's speeches.

                    look, she's still doing it.

                    Oh she's stopped!  Look, I'm

                    Doctor.  It's you.  She's only
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    copying you.

      The Doctor facing Sky properly now.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Why me..?   Why are you doing this?

                                    VAL CANE
                          (vicious)
                    She won't leave him alone!  D'you
                    see?!  I said so, she's with him.

                                    BIFF CANE
                    They're together!

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    How d'you explain it, Doctor?  If
                    you're so clever.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    I don't know.
                          (unnerved)
                    Sky, stop it.  I said stop it. 
                    Just stop it!!

      He stops himself, almost losing it, for the first time. 

      Then approaches her; he's got to.  Val contemptuous:

                    Look at the two of them...

      He kneels in front of her.  Everyone craning forward to
      watch, just a little, now scared of both Sky and the Doctor.

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY
                    Mrs Silvestry.  I'm trying to
                      understand.  You've captured my
                    speech, what for?  What d'you need?
                          (realising)
                    You need my voice in particular. 
                    The cleverest voice in the room. 
                    Why?  Cos I'm the only one who can
                    help?  Ohh, I'd love that to be
                    true.  But your eyes.  They're
                    saying something else.

      He moves closer.  Face to face.  More his old self:

                                    THE DOCTOR & SKY (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me.  Whatever you want,
                    if it's life, or form, or
                      consciousness, or voice, you don't
                    have to steal it.  You can find
                    it, without hurting anyone.  And
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    I'll help you.  That's a promise. 
                    So.  What d'you think?

      Pause, and then as he goes to finish his speech:
        www.thewriterstale.com

                    SKYTHE DOCTOR
        Do we / have a deal?/ Do we have a deal?

      Because then, Sky spoke first.  The Doctor just two words
      behind.  He's copying her!  (The / denoting where, in Sky's
      speech, the Doctor starts his repeat.)

      Silence, both staring, as this sinks in.  

      And the others saw it too:

                                    DEE DEE
                    Hold on, did she just..?

                                      JETHRO

                                      JETHRO
                    He's copying her.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Doctor..?  What's happening?

                    SKYTHE DOCTOR
          I think it's moved./ I think it's moved.

      She's getting stronger.  The delay in the synch slightly
      longer, the Doctor now a few words behind.  And the Doctor
      knows it.  Fear in his eyes.  Boggling!  His face is trying
      to say: this is wrong!  But he can't stop his mouth from
      saying what Sky says, and nothing else.

      And at the same time, Sky is getting physically stronger, 
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
      Sitting upright.  The Doctor, weaker.  Stuck, kneeling.

                                    DEE DEE
                    What does that mean, letting you

                                    BIFF CANE
                    But he's repeating now, he's the
                    one doing it!  It's him!

                                      JETHRO
                    They're separating.

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    Mrs Silvestry?  Is that you?

                    SKYTHE DOCTOR

        me/, I'm coming back. me, I'm coming back. 
          Listen.  It's me!Listen.  It's me!

      But saying that, the Doctor's face is saying, no no no!

                                      JETHRO
                    Like... it's passed into the Doctor. 
                    It's transferred.  Whatever it is,
                    it's gone inside him.

      But Dee Dee's very still, quiet, watching carefully:

                                    DEE DEE
                    No, that's not what happened.

                    But look at her!

      Sky flexing an arm, like she's waking.

                    SKYTHE DOCTOR
        I can move...  I can/ I can move...  I can

        look at him.  Heat him.  He can't move.
        can't move.

      Sky goes to stand, feeble, reaches out for help - and now
      the Doctor's losing his overlap, he's a plain repeat:

                                    SKY
                    Help me.

                                    THE DOCTOR

      The Professor holding back, still scared of her...  But
      she's weak, begging, and he can't help himself -

      He goes to her, helps her to stand.  She clasps hold -

                                    SKY
                    Ohh thank you.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ohh thank you.

      He leads her away from the Doctor.  The Doctor, with no
      strength, still on his knees, now has his back to everyone,
      so they can't see the panic on his face.  And it's easier
      to blame him, when they don't have to look at him.  

                                      JETHRO
                    They've completely separated.

                    Well, um, I'd say, from
                      observation...  The Doctor can't
                    move, and when she was possessed,
                    she couldn't move, so...

                          (upset)
                    And she's the voice!  She stole
                    it!  Listen to her!  It's not
                      possessing him, it's draining him!

      Quiet, more to herself; the Hostess is the only one who
      believes her, no one paying her any attention:

                                      HOSTESS
                    She's got his voice...

                    No, but that's not true, cos it
                    can't be, cos I saw it pass into
                    him, I saw it with my own eyes!

      Dee Dee scared, shrinking back, useless from now on.  Her
      moment has come, and she's failed.

        www.thewriterstale.com
      Biff now hauling the Doctor up - panic on the Doctor's
      face - but he's a dead weight, no strength - though that
      actually makes him very difficult to pick up -

      Biff hauling him round, into the centre aisle - and everyone
      can see the Doctor's face now -

      The Hostess stepping forward -

                                      HOSTESS
                    I don't think we should do this -

      Which shuts the Hostess up: it's true.  (NB, Hostess now
      standing halfway down the cabin.)

      Biff's shunting the Doctor forward, all the Doctor can do
      is try to dig his feet in -

      And the Professor's too weak - he runs, to help Biff -

      - though he's never done anything like this before, he's
      not strong, and he's upset, moaning with fear - he tries
      to hook himself under one of the Doctor's arms, but it's
      so clumsy, he's more of a hindrance - it's a mess, like
      any murder - Biff taking the weight, yelling -

                    - just, grab hold of him - not
                    like that, are you stupid?!, don't -

      And at exactly the same time:

      Val is a constant voice, standing to the side, never
      stopping, improvising around:

      watching, crying, but useless.

      At the same time, Jethro staring, frozen, horrified.

      But Sky stands centre aisle!  Vicious!  Facing the Doctor
      but taking steps back with every line, towards the Emergency
      Door, as though physically leading Biff, the Professor and
      the Doctor towards the door by strength of will -

      (There's a clear line between the Doctor & Sky, and as Sky
      backs away, the Hostess is now positioned between the Doctor
      & Sky, to the side - watching everything, so sharp.)

      She looks round: 

      Biff, the Professor, Jethro clumsily hauling the Doctor
      forwards - Val yelling - Dee Dee crying - Sky exultant,
      moving back:

                                    SKY
                    The starlight waits!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The starlight waits!

                                    SKY
                    The emptiness!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The emptiness!

                                    SKY
                    The Midnight sky!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The Midnight sky!

      And the Hostess know what has to be done.

      In one, fluid action, no struggle -



                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 8 - SHOOTING SCRIPT 16/11/2007    Page 58.

      The Hostess strides forward, towards Sky -

      - grabs hold of Sky, keeps marching, fast, just the last
      few steps towards the EMERGENCY DOOR, Sky taken with her -

      The Doctor, Biff, Professor, Jethro, Dee Dee, Val, all
      frozen mid-action, seeing this - 

      The Hostess slams the BUTTON -

      EMERGENCY DOOR whooshes open -

      Both women in the doorway, which becomes a frame of LIGHT
      AND WIND AND SMOKE - 

      - the Hostess now holding Sky tight, face to face -

                                    SKY
                    No - !

      And it's like the Doctor, helpless, means this repeat:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No - !

                                      HOSTESS
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    ...four, five, six -

      WHOOSH!  The Hostess and Sky are pulled out together - out
      of the door, fast, flying into the darkness, gone -
        www.thewriterstale.com

      SCHUNK!  The door slams shut.

      And it's over.

      Silence.  Frozen.

      Then...

      The madness has gone.  Biff, the Professor & Jethro drop
      the Doctor, like they're ashamed. 

      The Doctor can speak.  Exhausted:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's gone, it's gone, it's gone,
                    it's gone, it's gone...

      As his litany fades away, and he just stays on the floor,
      wounded, aching, recovering.

      Biff steps all the way back to the front wall, stunned. 
      Sinking to the floor.  Heaving for breath.

      The Professor just curls up.  Hiding his head.

      Jethro retreating to one of the side-walls, like he can't
      believe what he just became.

      Dee Dee crying, turns away, can't look at any of them.

      Val staring at the Doctor.

      Silence. 

      Hold.  For a long time.

      Then quietly:

                                    VAL CANE
                    I said it was her.

      The Doctor just looks at her. 

      Such a look.

      And Val is silent.

      CUT TO WIDE SHOT.  All recovering.

      Slowly FADE TO BLACK...

      Bring up GRAPHIC:

      20 minutes later
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
      FADE UP...

        www.thewriterstale.com

      More lights on, now, though not full-power.  All sitting
      apart; as far apart from each other as they can be.

      Over this:

                                      RADIO VOICE
                      ...repeat, Crusader 50, rescue
                    vehicle coming alongside in three
                    minutes, door-seals set to
                      automatic.  Prepare for boarding,
                    repeat, prepare for boarding.

      The Doctor looks over to the Professor.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The Hostess.  What was her name?

                                      PROFESSOR HOBBES
                    ...I don't know.

      The Doctor looks across at Dee Dee, Val, Biff, Jethro.

      All shake their heads.

      No one knows.

      FADE TO BLACK.



                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 8 - SHOOTING SCRIPT 16/11/2007    Page 60.

      FADE UP...


      WIDE SHOT.  THE DOCTOR walking across, still exhausted. 
      DONNA, knowing that something's happened, running to him.

      Big hug.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR & DONNA sitting there.  The Doctor more his old
      self, though quiet.

                                      DONNA
                    ...but what d'you think it was?

                                    THE DOCTOR
              DW4 - Ep 8 - Pink
                    No idea.

                                      DONNA
                    D'you think it's still out there?

      No reply.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    You'd better tell them.  This lot.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yeah.  They can build a Leisure
                    Palace somewhere else.  Let this
                    planet keep on turning.  Round an
                    X-tonic star.  In silence.

                                      DONNA
                          (smiles, gentle)
                    Can't imagine you, without a voice.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                          (smiles)
                    Molto bene.

                                      DONNA
                    'Molto bene!'

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, don't do that.  Don't.

      And they sit in silence.
