      FADE IN:


        A disaster area.  Old sports equipment and file boxes 
        insure no car will ever park here.  ADAM has lined up the 
      four Braverman family bikes which are all in various 
        stages of disrepair.  KRISTINA, rifling through a 
        Goodwill box of old clothes, watches over his shoulder as 
      he struggles to pull the chain back on Max s bike.    

                                        ADAM
                      Almost there.  Almost there.
                                (losing it)
                      Dammit!

                      We don t have to do a bike ride today.  PARENTHOOD   -   01007/107   -   REVISED 2ND BLUE   -   2/26/10       3

        Kristina moves aside Adam s old surfboard and uncovers 
        the GOODWILL BOX.  She digs out a pair of her old HEELS.

                                        ADAM
                      Have you looked at our family calendar 
                      lately?  Between Max s new schedule, my 
                      work, Haddie s school commitments and of 
                      course... 
                              (with disdain)
                       Steve time .  That only leaves three 
                      hours a week where the entire family is 
                      free.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      But does it have to be spent on bikes?

        HADDIE appears in the doorway.

                                        HADDIE
                      What s up?

        Kristina holds up the shoes.  Adam continues struggling 
      with the chain throughout the following.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      What about these for tomorrow?  They were 
                      in the Goodwill.

                                        HADDIE
                      You re not serious.  Mom, Aunt Julia 
                      works in a real office.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      I wore these real places.

                                        ADAM 
                      What is she talking about?

                                        KRISTINA
                      She s spending a day at work with your 
                      sister.  

                                        HADDIE
                      It s career week.  I get to take Monday 
                      off to shadow someone in a career of my 
                      choosing.

                              (to Kristina)
                      Am I obligated to answer that?

        Suddenly the chain snaps into place.  

                                        ADAM 
                      I got it!  I got it!  Did you see that?  

                                        KRISTINA
                      Yeah, honey.  It was awesome.  

                                        HADDIE
                      Oh God.  This is one of those Braverman 
                      family fun things, isn t it?

                                        ADAM
                      Yes.  It is.  Prepare for an epic 
                      afternoon of fun and togetherness.    

                                        HADDIE
                      I m seeing a movie at five with Steve.  
                      Mom already gave me permission.  

      Adam shoots a look to Kristina who just shrugs.

                                        KRISTINA
                      I didn t know this was going to be epic.  

                                        ADAM
                      That still leaves us fifty-two minutes 
                      for quality Braverman bonding.  Mount up.  
                      I ll grab the boy.    

                                        HADDIE
                      The boy still has forty minutes left with 
                      Gaby.
                              (off their looks)
                      What?  His schedule is on a giant 
                      calendar in the kitchen.  Kinda hard to 
                      miss.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Maybe we should do this another time.

                                        ADAM
                      No way.  This is gonna be great!  

        Adam, still happy, sprints past Kristina.  


        Sarah, now wearing a different dress, strolls through the 
      park with MR. MARK CYR, Amber s English teacher.

                      Oh God.  You didn t actually know how old 
                      I was.  Now you re doing the math.  I 
                      already did it.  It s twelve years.  PARENTHOOD   -   01007/107   -   REVISED 2ND BLUE   -   2/26/10       7

                      You have a daughter who s a junior.  I 
                      sort of assumed you weren t ten when you 
                      had her.  
                                (then)
                      You wanna know what I was really thinking 
                      about?

                                        SARAH
                      Probably not.

                                        MR. CYR
                      You talk with your hands a lot.  

                                        SARAH
                      Oh god.  Do I?

                                        MR. CYR
                      Which is ridiculously cute.  But I really 
                      want to hold your hand.  And it makes it 
                      kinda hard to make a stealth move.  So I 
                      was trying to figure out if I should 
                      forgo stealth or if I just...

        Sarah, hand now swinging in tandem with Mr. Cyr s, 
        lightly wraps her hand with his.

                                        MR. CYR (CONT D)
                      See.  That s what I m talking about.  
                      Cool, subtle, stealthy.  You re good.  

                                        SARAH
                      I ve got twelve years on you.  

        Mr. Cyr pulls her toward him with their now intertwined 
        hands.  Goes in for the kiss.  Sarah stops him.    

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      I m sorry.  

                                        MR. CYR 
                                (confused)
                      No, I m sorry.  I misread the hand 
                      holding. 

                                        SARAH
                      It s Amber.  She saw me getting ready for 
                      this.  And I totally lied.  Not an all 
                      out lie but a lie of omission.  I thought 
                      about telling her, and I should have.  
                      But then she called me pulchritudinous 
                      and I got distracted and...

                      It s not funny.

                                        MR. CYR
                      I ve been helping Amber study for her 
                      SATs.  Pulchritudinous is on her vocab 
                      list.

                      Wonderful.  I m so glad you ve given her 
                      the tools to insult me with multiple 
                      syllables.

                      It means beautiful.

                      Here s a thought.  Maybe before you tell 
                      her, we should at least make sure there s 
                      something worth telling.

                      I was thinking like a test run.  Like we 
                      make out and just see how it goes.  
                      Because it would be a total waste if you 
                      told Amber and it turns out we actually 
                      repulse each other.

                                        SARAH
                      That would be... wasteful.

      Mr. Cyr kisses her.  It s insanely awesome.

        Haddie, waiting out front in the best version of business 
        attire she could cobble together, rises when JULIA pulls 
      into the driveway in her Lexus Hybrid.  Kristina, mom 
        sweats and a stained shirt, rushes out clutching a PAPER 
        LUNCH BAG.

                      Aunt Julia said she d take me out.

                      Here.  Let me give you some money for 
                      Haddie s lunch.

      With that, Haddie climbs into the car and the Lexus

      This is the playlist he made for her -- a vocab lesson.

      Adam and Haddie ride their bikes and stop at a really 
      nice public courtyard in front of a behemoth modern 
        business building.  They come to a stop.  There s a beat, 
        then, very simply:

                                        ADAM
                      I want you to know that your mother is 
                      amazing.

        Haddie feels a bit trapped.

                                        HADDIE
                      Is this about the remark about her 
                      spaghetti?  I can t believe how sensitive 
                      you guys are.  Look, I know she s an 
                      amazing mom, okay?  I m trying to be 
                      fifteen here, and not like express that 
                      on a daily basis.

                      She s more than an amazing mom.  
                      See this place?  The play area, the 
                      benches, the trees, the landscaping.

                                        HADDIE
                      Uh-huh...?

                                        ADAM
                      The company that built this building 
                      wanted to use every inch of this land for 
                      offices.  Your mother got in there and 
                      fought them.  She got them to put up two 
                      hundred thousand dollars to make this.  
                      Without your mom, this wouldn t be here. 

        Haddie takes it in -- kids play on a play structure, 
        people sit on benches talking, hanging together. 

                                        HADDIE
                      Wow. That s so Erin Brokovich.

        Haddie looks around, taking it in.  Adam looks at Haddie.  
        His beautiful, smart, lovely daughter.  Takes her in.  
      Then simply--

                      No, there aren t.  

      Adam is touched.  Bittersweet.  He knows that she s aware 
      of his vulnerability, that he s on borrowed time with his 
        daughter.  On cue, Haddie s phone RINGS with a hip hop 
      ring tone that Adam knows all too well.

                      He was going to call if he got done with 
                      basketball practice early.  So we could 
                      hang out.  But it s cool.  I ll tell him 
                      I m busy.
