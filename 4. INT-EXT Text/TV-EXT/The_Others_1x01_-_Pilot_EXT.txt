            A 19th C. CHURCH with an adjacent CEMETERY.  HOLD on the
            church— suddenly, a STAINED GLASS WINDOW BLOWS OUT. 

            IN FG, a TOMBSTONE CRACKS and SHATTERS, as if dropped from a
            height.  CAMERA MOVES past more weathered, 19th C. GRAVE
            MARKERS, through an IRON FENCE and across --


            --an URBAN STREET, early FALL.  Little traffic at this late
            hour, a few NEON SIGNS in the distance.  CAMERA keeps moving
            through the city, OVER A WALL and into --


            --a collegiate quadrangle in New England; a mix of PERIOD and
            MODERN BUILDINGS.  A banner:  "WELCOME FRESHMEN." TRACK
            TOWARD a modern HIGH-RISE, MOVE IN on a WINDOW


            START ON OLD TOMBSTONES, several TOPPLED, CRACKED and BROKEN,
            as if a sledgehammer had been taken to them. 

            MARK OSBORNE, SATORI, and a PRIEST walk among these graves in
            the iron-fenced cemetery-- we see BOARDS over the BROKEN
            WINDOWS of the church. 

            OSBORNE is in his 20's, preppily handsome, soft-spoken and
            thoughtful.  SATORI is a new-agey woman in her 50's or 60's,
            with long, silver hair, draped with bangles and bells.

                                PRIEST
                      Senseless... we've put in alarms, I don't
                      see how they're getting past.

                                OSBORNE
                      Have you given any thought to the matter
                      of Aloysius Green?

                                PRIEST
                      This is an historic churchyard, there
                      hasn't been a burial in a hundred years--

                                SATORI
                      We're talking a mid-nineteenth century
                      corpse, it's not like he'd clash.

                                PRIEST
                      Why is this so important to you people?

                                ELMER
                      It's important to Aloysius.

            ELMER GREEN is seated on a bench in the graveyard.  He's
            probably 90, black, in a neat dark suit, wearing coke-bottle
            lenses so thick his eyes distort.

                                PRIEST
                      Excuse me?

                                ELMER
                      Eighty-odd years he been my spirit guide.
                      The man belonged here, was a sin they
                      planted him by the river inna first
                      place. Now he been dug up for an exit
                      ramp...

                                SATORI
                      Who knows, settling the karmic debt might
                      solve your vandalism problem.

                                PRIEST
                      I told you, I prefer not to hear any more
                      of that sort of mystical speculation--

                                OSBORNE
                      Father, she's just talking about, you
                      know, good p.r., community outreach...

            The priest sighs, there's more going on here than he wants to
            acknowledge.

                                PRIEST
                      I'll take up the Aloysius Green case with
                      the board-- purely as a matter of
                      historical propriety.

            He heads back for the church.  ELMER nods to himself and
            rises.  OSBORNE takes his arm, he and SATORI help him away.

                                ELMER
                      No one wantsa call a ghost a ghost...

                                                                 CUT TO:


            MARIAN and JEROME move down the steps of the library.

                                JEROME
                      I'm not surprised you hadn't heard, the
                      university covers up suicides pretty
                      efficiently--

                                MARIAN
                      How did she do it?

                                JEROME
                      P and B-- pills and booze, right before
                      Christmas break.  They found her in the
                      tub a week later.

                                MARIAN
                      Oh, God.

                                JEROME
                      Yeah, I'd hate to've been working dorm
                      crew on that room.  So listen, does stuff
                      like this happen to you a lot?

                                MARIAN
                      What do you mean?

                                JEROME
                      You know, psychic phenomena.  'Cause I
                      know some people you really should meet--

                                MARIAN
                      Who are you?

                                JEROME
                      Oh, sorry.  I'm Jerome Ballard, folklore
                      and mythology.  I wrote my doctoral
                      thesis on ghost stories, the paranormal's
                      sort of a lifelong passion--

                                MARIAN
                      I didn't see a ghost.  I must've been
                      sleepwalking, I used to when I was
                      younger-- I was sleepwalking and I had a
                      bad dream--

                                JEROME
                      Come on.  Sounds like a ghost to me.

                                MARIAN
                      You really believe in that stuff?

                                JEROME
                      When you eliminate all rational
                      explanations, the totally wacky is the
                      only alternative.  Seriously, too many
                      people have seen spirits, there's all
                      kinds of evidence in the literature--

                                MARIAN
                      You ever see one?

                                JEROME
                          (a bit embarrassed)
                      Well, no... I've wanted to.  I'm just not
                      attuned.  But it sounds like you are.
                      You're not the only one-- there are
                      others like you--

                                MARIAN
                      You're talking about me like I'm a freak!

                                JEROME
                      That depends on your definition of
                      "freak..."

                                MARIAN
                      I'm just a freshman from Iowa, nobody is
                      more normal than me, I grew up on a corn
                      flakes box for God's sake.  I had a bad
                      dream, my stupid roommate had to spread
                      it all over campus--

                                JEROME
                      Look, I just wanted to let you know,
                      there's a meeting on Thursday and it'd be
                      nice if you came by...

            As he speaks, he's writing something on the back of a Xerox
            copied news clipping.

                                MARIAN
                      A meeting?

                                JEROME
                      The Others.  Gifted people.  You know,
                      freaks like you.

            He hands her the paper with a grin, waves and moves off.
            Marian can't help but smile.  She glances at the page --

            INSERT PAGE-- "OTHERS," an ADDRESS and TIME in pen.  She
            flips it over... a NEWS CLIPPING, "STUDENT FOUND DEAD," with
            a GRADUATION PHOTO of a beautiful, smiling DIANE STILLMAN... 

            MARIAN'S smile fades.  She crumples the clipping and tosses
            it into a TRASHBIN.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


            Early morning.  MARIAN sifts gingerly through the TRASHBIN
            where she tossed the flyer.


            An institutional brick building, like an elementary school.
            MARIAN approaches, the crumpled FLYER in hand.


            OSBORNE catches up with MARIAN as she hurries away from the
            center, toward a BUS STOP.

                                OSBORNE
                      Marian!  Hang on.
                          (she turns toward him)
                      I apologize for Albert.  He's not good
                      with strangers.

                                MARIAN
                      I'll say.

                                OSBORNE
                      There's a pretty high flake quotient,
                      I'll admit... but they grow on you.  Over
                      time.

                                MARIAN
                      What do you people do, anyway?  Read
                      palms, or write astrology columns, or
                      maybe stuff fortune cookies--?

                                OSBORNE
                      I'm a first year resident at St. Joe's
                      hospital...

                                MARIAN
                          (surprised)
                      Oh...

                                OSBORNE
                      Come on, lemme buy you a cup of coffee or
                      something.

            Marian thinks a beat, then nods.


            OSBORNE and MARIAN walk through a PARK in the city center.

                                OSBORNE
                      ...the Others started in the twenties,
                      part of the great spiritualist revival.
                      Back then everyone had a Ouija board and
                      held seances at parties.  Elmer is the
                      last of the original members, he was sort
                      of a boy wonder as a medium...

            They've reached a PEDESTRIAN UNDERPASS near a major STREET.

                                OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                      Let's cut down here.

                                MARIAN
                      Wouldn't it be faster to just keep--

            Osborne is already trotting down the steps.  Marian isn't
            happy about it, but she follows.


            MARIAN, getting a hold of herself, darts up the stairs, now
            keeping her distance from OSBORNE--

                                MARIAN
                      You bastard, you knew what was down
                      there!  You were testing me?!

                                OSBORNE
                      I'm sorry, I had no idea you were that
                      sensitive.  I had to show you-- it's not
                      just in your head --

                                MARIAN
                      I'm sorry, I don't understand-- 

            OSBORNE grabs her and spins her around.

                                OSBORNE
                      Nobody does!
                          (releasing her, more calmly)
                      Look, most people just avoid that place
                      now.  Or if they have to use the tunnel,
                      they tend to walk a little faster without
                      knowing why-- maybe they just think it's
                      claustrophobia. For them, this sort of thing
                      doesn't exist.  They may feel it, but they can
                      deny it, ignore it.  But others-- people
                      like us-- we have to deal with it.  Even
                      if it doesn't make sense. Because
                      whatever it is, for us-- it is real.  It
                      is. 

            MARIAN, reeling, sits on a nearby bench.  OSBORNE sits a few
            feet away.  After a beat, she almost whispers:

                                MARIAN
                      What happened down there... to the
                      children?

                                OSBORNE
                      It was a brother and sister, they were
                      out late.  Some psycho murdered them in
                      that tunnel, about twelve years ago--

                                MARIAN
                      There was a knife--

                                OSBORNE
                          (nods)
                      They never caught him... you know, you
                      picked up a lot.  As much as Satori-- and
                      the cops brought her in on the case a
                      month after it happened.

                                MARIAN
                      It's true... I really am a freak.

                                OSBORNE
                      You're not a freak.  You're just seeing--
                      well, for lack of a better term, we call
                      it the Other Side.

            Marian trembles, on the verge of tears.  Slowly, he puts an
            arm around her, holding her close to comfort her.

                                                                 CUT TO;


            An older HOME with a FOR SALE sign.


            MARIAN, book bag slung over one shoulder, walks with BOB and
            JIM, jocky-looking fellow freshman.

                                JIM
                      --there's gonna be a major Halloween
                      party in Barker Hall tonight.

                                BOB
                      Those dudes are animals.

            THE THREE STUDENTS instinctively give a wide berth to a
            MUMBLING STREET PERSON as he passes, moving in the other
            direction.  A few paces on, he looks up, turns-- it's WARREN.

                                WARREN
                      Hey-- hey, you, uh, uh, blonde girl!

            MARIAN takes a moment to register who this guy is.  JIM and
            BOB eye Warren as he approaches, move to protect Marian.

                                WARREN (CONT'D)
                      I was just heading over to the, um, you
                      wanna go with me?

                                JIM
                      Get lost, OK?

                                MARIAN
                      No, wait, I know him--

                                BOB
                      You're kidding.

                                MARIAN
                      I mean, I met him once...

            WARREN points toward the OLD CHURCH a block up.

                                WARREN
                      I can't have already missed it-- damn, I
                      gotta get a watch.  What's your name
                      again?

                                MARIAN
                      Marian.  Missed what?

                                WARREN
                      You know, the ceremonial planting of the
                      r bones, laying to rest the restless--

            JIM and BOB back away from Warren and Marian.

                                BOB
                      We, uh, gotta get to practice--

                                JIM
                      Later-

            MARIAN is torn for a moment, looking from the young men to
            the twitchy Warren.  A note of regret:

                                MARIAN
                      Sure-- see you guys...
                          (to Warren)
                      What are you talking about?

                                WARREN
                      Aloysius Green, the reinterment.  The
                      others are there, come on.

            He turns and hurries off, MUTTERING to himself again.  MARIAN
            looks after him unsurely.


            WARREN hurries up to THE OTHERS, milling and talking quietly.
            MARIAN stands at the gates of the cemetery, peering in.
            OSBORNE cocks his head at the sight of her and approaches.

                                OSBORNE
                      Marian... did you want to join us?

                                MARIAN
                      I was just walking by... what's going on? 

            OSBORNE escorts her closer to the others.

                                OSBORNE
                      Well, it's a project we've all been
                      working on a while.  There's been some
                      vandalism here, tombs knocked over and
                      smashed...we're hoping this might put an
                      end to it.

            They've reached an OPEN GRAVE with a CANVAS BAG beside it.
            SATORI beams, gives MARIAN a hug, which she receives stiffly.

                                SATORI
                      I'm so glad you've come back to us, we
                      need your strength--

                                MARIAN
                      Well, I just happened to be—-            

                                SATORI
                      Nothing just happens.

                                ALBERT
                      That you, Marian?

                                MARIAN
                      Yes.

                                ALBERT
                      They tell me I was a little hard on you
                      the other night.

                                MARIAN
                      I guess.

            She waits expectantly with a half-smile for an apology.  But
            Albert is done speaking, reaches down to scratch his dog. A

            s Marian's smile fades, THE PRIEST we met earlier approaches
            nervously, ELMER beside him.  Elmer moves closer to Marian,
            staring at her intently, unnerving her a bit.

                                ELMER
                      Girl, I need a word with you.

            CLOSE as he takes her hand in his gnarled fingers.  He speaks
            in a hoarse whisper:

                                ELMER (cont'd)
                      Some spirits is too strong to fight.
                      Their pain, it becomes a poison in the
                      air.  Poison don't care what it kills.

                                MARIAN
                      What are you saying?

                                ELMER
                      Get outta that place.  I can give you a
                      couch to sleep.  I can help you...
                      navigate the spiritual waters a bit if
                      you know what I mean.

            MARIAN eyes the shaky, elderly man-- he doesn't strike her as
            a powerful protector.

                                MARIAN
                      Thank you, but-- I'll be fine.

            ELMER looks disappointed in her, shakes his head.

                                ELMER
                      Just keep your wits about you.

            THE PRIEST clears his throat; he obviously wants this
            ceremony to be over with as quickly as possible.

                                PRIEST
                      Shall we get started...?  Today we've
                      gathered because-- all of you care deeply
                      about Aloysius Green, a man who's been--
                      lost to us for a hundred and thirty
                      years... His great-grand-nephew Elmer
                      Green would like to say a few words...

            ELMER totters to the graveside, beside the BAG.  The priest
            looks away during the following, uncomfortable.

                                ELMER
                      Aloysius has spent most of his time mad
                      at the world.  It's hard to blame him.
                      He's born a slave, escaped and come to
                      what he thought'd be freedom... but his
                      soul never been free yet.  Aloysius
                      helped build this church, but after that
                      they wouldn't let him in it, not alive
                      nor dead... and lately he's done a bit of
                      mischief here...
                          (hoisting the canvas bag)
                      Aloysius, you been with me mosta my life.
                      You showed me the ways of the Other Side--
                      and soon I'll be joining you there...
                      until then... God rest you.

            Elmer OPENS THE BAG and pours the contents into the grave-- 

            ANGLE IN GRAVE-- a pile of DUSTY, DECAYED BONES, with a SKULL
            and RIB CAGE recognisable. 

            MARIAN GASPS at this grim sight.  She looks up at THE OTHERS,
            who stare calmly into the grave. 

            A SHOVELFUL OF DIRT lands on the pile of bones.

            OSBORNE passes the shovel to JEROME.  He looks up to see--

            MARIAN, through the fence, walking away fast.  MUSIC UP and--

                                                                 CUT TO:


            MARIAN sways as she and JIM cross the campus, the sounds of
            the PARTY RECEDING.  Other PEDESTRIANS about, it isn't late.
            She almost falls down, LAUGHING, Jim holds her up, his hands
            lingering on her body.

                                MARIAN
                      I seem normal to you, don't I?

                                JIM
                      Actually, you seem kinda wasted.

                                MARIAN
                      I know that, but I'm not weird, or
                      freakish or anything, am I?

                                JIM
                      No way.  You're a true babe.

                                MARIAN
                          (leans into him)
                      Can we go to your room?  I don't wanna be
                      alone right now...

                                JIM
                      My dweeb roommate's up studying.  How
                      'bout your place?  Linda's at her
                      boyfriend's, right?

            Marian's reluctant, but shrugs and nods.


            OSBORNE drives rapidly through the streets of the city. He's
            on his CELLPHONE, we hear the FILTERED VOICE of an OPERATOR.

                                OPERATOR (FILTER)
                      --there's no one on that line, sir, it
                      must be off the hook.

            He RUNS a RED LIGHT, DRIVING like a maniac now.


            OSBORNE pulls up in his CAR, jumps out, moves to the CAMPUS
            GATE-- it's CLOSED and LOCKED. He hesitates only a moment,
            then starts to CLIMB OVER.


            OSBORNE moves through the campus, a bit disoriented. He sees
            the FLASHING LIGHT of a SECURITY CAR, hurries in that
            direction, running into MARIAN'S BUILDING.


            PARAMEDICS WHEEL the unconscious MARIAN on a stretcher into
            the back of a waiting AMBULANCE.  Osborne moves alongside, a
            bit unsteady on his feet.

                                OSBORNE
                      Push the narcan on the IV, she swallowed
                      alprazalom, washed it down with vodka.

            He hands over Linda's PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. 

            As the AMBULANCE PULLS AWAY, SIREN BLARING, Osborne suddenly
            nearly loses his balance, has to move to the building's
            steps, where he sits heavily.  His CELL PHONE RINGS, he
            answers,it wearily.

                                OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                      Osborne.

                                                          INTERCUT WITH:


            IN FG, the REAL ESTATE SIGN with the notice "IN ESCROW" on
            it. MOVE to FIND a BEDROOM WINDOW as a LIGHT GOES ON.


            DRIVING SHOT, THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD as OSBORNE and JEROME
            approach a high-end institution down a long driveway... it
            looks more like a large Colonial home.

                                JEROME
                      Ritzy bin.

            A few RESIDENTS sit on benches, stroll, accompanied by
            casually-garbed NURSES. 

            OSBORNE parks the car near the front entrance.


            JEROME and OSBORNE exit, linger in front of the building.

                                OSBORNE
                      The man's guilty as hell.

                                JEROME
                      Even I felt that.

                                OSBORNE
                      Did Diane Stillman leave a suicide note? 

            JEROME shakes his head.

                                OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                      What if it wasn't suicide?

                                                                 CUT TO:


            A funky, one-story home on the outskirts of the city, a bit
            run-down-- it's painted in BRILLIANT COLORS.


            DOT drives a battered compact, a plastic SKULL on a BEAD
            CHAIN dangles from the rear-view mirror.  ALTERNATIVE ROCK
            plays on the car radio.  SETH sits in the passenger seat,
            absently twisting the CUBE, staring out the side window. AT A
            STOPLIGHT on a crowded street, Seth suddenly drops the cube,
            UNBUCKLES HIS SEATBELT and opens the passenger door-- "r

                                DOT
                      Seth-- no, what are you doing--

            She reaches to grab him, but he BOLTS off into the city--
            DOT, panicking, pulls out into the intersection, narrowly
            avoiding a collision, SWERVING and HONKING.  Leaving the car
            half on the curb, she leaps out and tries to follow the boy--
            but there's no sign of him.  On her anguished CRY--

                                                                 CUT TO:


            DOT'S CAR screeches up to the storefront PSYCHIC STUDIO with
            a neon EYE in front.


            A CAB pulls up, ELMER climbs slowly out of the back seat.
            pays off the DRIVER, then heads inside.

            TNT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

            An ORDERLY shepherds WARREN down the hall from the entrance
            to the ICU, OSBORNE and the KITTS a step behind.

                                WARREN
                      She's, she's drowning, can't you people
                      see?!

                                OSBORNE
                      Warren, you really oughta take your
                      medication...

                                MRS. KITT
                      How did that man get in here?

            The pass the ELEVATOR, which opens a moment later.  ELMER
            emerges from the elevator, looking in the direction of the
            commotion, then heads toward the ICU ward.


            SATORI and DOT hurry toward the brownstone from Dot's car.  A
            FRONT WINDOW is BROKEN.  The front door flies open. MRS.
            HARMON stands there, in her robe, very upset--

                                MRS. HARMON
                      I was about to call the police-- what in
                      God's name is he doing here?!


            WAVES CRASH on a rocky New England coast.  MOVE TO FIND all
            the OTHERS— OSBORNE, JEROME, SATORI, ALBERT, WARREN. DOT,
            SETH and now MARIAN-- standing on a rocky PIER.  All are
            dressed in black funereal clothes.  They pass a CERAMIC URN,
            painted in RAINBOW COLORS, from one to the next, saying their
            private good-byes.

                                JEROME
                      Elmer once told me, "Life is just a drop
                      of rain.  Death is the ocean.  Don't be
                      afraid to return from whence you came."

            He passes the urn to Warren, who stares at it a beat:

                                WARREN
                      "Whence?

                                ALBERT
                      Elmer would never say "whence."

                                JEROME
                      I was paraphrasing.

            Warren gives the urn to DOT, who in turn hands it to SETH.

                                DOT
                      OK, honey.                                

            Seth steps to the edge of the pier and HURLS THE ASHES into
            the breeze-- they DRIFT AWAY onto the waves.

                                SATORI
                      The end is the beginning...

            MARIAN IN FG; on the beach behind her stands ELMER.  She
            glimpses him from the corner of her eye, turns. 

            REVERSE ANGLE-- OSBORNE notes Marian's distraction, she
            BLINKS.  He speaks quietly:

                                OSBORNE
                      Is something wrong? 

            MARIAN'S POV— ELMER is gone. MARIAN has a slight smile.

                                MARIAN
                      No.  Nothing.

            WIDE SHOT as the group starts to leave the shore...

                                                                FADE OUT

                                    END
