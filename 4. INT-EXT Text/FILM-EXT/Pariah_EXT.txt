A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and
hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are
stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We
descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.
Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.
Hips, legs
feet dancing.
A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.
Hoots
and cheers.
The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.
More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.
FEMALE DJ (O.S.)
Let's go! Where all my sexy
Sagittarian ladies at?
Arms go up.
A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.
The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward
headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted
heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing
on the ceiling.
FEMALE DJ (O.S.)
Oh my God!
ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing
and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is
pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar
bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.
LAURA
Where your singles at?!! Where your
singles at?!! Yeah, baby!
Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the
dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.
FEMALE DJ
Goddamn I love my job!
Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly
waves Alike's wrist in the air.
2.
Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins
to direct her attention at her.
ALIKE
Stop! Chill!!
LAURA
Whatchu' come here for?!
Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders
her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage.
Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at
the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a
snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.
ALIKE
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof,
sorry ladies.
Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at
the clock on her cell phone.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
Shit!
She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer
visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing
crowd, she retreats for the bar.
FEMALE DJ
Let's go!

Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the
olive branch.
ALIKE
How many numbers you get? One?
LAURA
I could've gotten more, but your
moms was holding me up.
ALIKE
Oooh.
That's jacked up.
LAURA
How many you get?
ALIKE
Tonya, Denise, Shelley. No wait
that's old, I can delete that one.
Tonya...
Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but
misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through
the numbers with the other.
LAURA
Ain't Shelley that chick from your
math class?! Denise... What?
These are your damn study group
numbers! Why you frontin'?!
Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her
sleeve.
ALIKE
I don't see you with no list of
numbers.
LAURA
I'm not the one looking for a
girlfriend, man. You the one still
a virgin!
ALIKE
Shut up!
LAURA
Trying to help your ass. I'm
sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!
Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows
her and sneers.
6.
LAURA
Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit
since 6th grade. I don't need to
press, I gets plenty. Shit.
ALIKE
Wah-wah.
LAURA
I get more pussy than your daddy,
nigga, what?!
ALIKE
Oh shit!! Yeah, you got me with
that one.

Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the
perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS
horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging
their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school
bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building.
Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last
STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter
and launches across the lawn and into the building.
13
24
Alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into
oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. A group of
FAST GIRLS strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling
and yakking on cell phones. One of the girls, MIKA cuts a
flirty smile at Alike. Alike turns away and buries herself in
her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod.
MIKA'S FRIEND
It was like seven of us--Me,
Khalil, Misha, Tamara....
FAST GIRL #2
Tamara Marks?
MIKA'S FRIEND
Heeeell no--Fat Tamara.
MIKA
Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks
is a ughh--I can't stand her.
MIKA'S FRIEND
Anyway, it was all of us and oh
Laura, you know that girl from the
restaurant? She was there with one
of her friends.
Alike's ears prick up.
MIKA
That gay chick? Ya'll be hanging
like that?
MIKA'S FRIEND
Yeah, well it's a couple of them.
She's mad cool though, so sometime
she come out with us every now and
then, anyway--
23.
MIKA
Man, y'all be doin' it on it
weekends, let me find out!
FAST GIRL #2
I told your butt to come.
MIKA'S FRIEND
But anyway--
MIKA
Some of them AG's are kinda cute--
I'm not saying I would, but I would
holla.
FAST GIRL #2
I don't know about all that.
MIKA
Isn't that one of them over there?
What's her name? Amika?--Alisha?
The pack directs their attention at Alike. Alike profiles and
attempts to look casual.
MIKA'S FRIEND
Alike.
MIKA
Yeah, Alike--she's cute too.
FAST GIRL #2
Uugh. I don't be looking at them
all like that.
Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alike's physique. Alike,
aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt
unnecessarily. She licks her lips and readjusts the book in
her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face.
MIKA
Look, I'm not gay--but if I was gay
I might talk to her.
MIKA'S FRIEND
She's in the middle anyway.
MIKA
Yeah, but if she was just a little
more harder--
Alike looks over and starts to nod when a CUTE BOY with locs
swaggers up to the girls, drawing their rapt attention.
24.
CUTE BOY
`Sup ladies?
MIKA
FAST GIRL #2
Heeeey.
What's up?
The girls erupt into titters, and they melt into
conversation. Alike deflates, watching them over the top of
her book. She observes every little moment between the girls
and the boy, every wink. Another BOY joins the group and they
stroll off down the sidewalk.
Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them
leave. Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at
Alike. Remnant's of Alike's grin return reflexively. Mika's
friend jerks her elbow around.
MIKA'S FRIEND
Oooh--let me find out, Mika. You
act like you bi- or something.
MIKA
I like girls but I love boys.
FAST GIRL #2
FAST GIRL #1
Umm hmm !
I can't tell!
Alike waits for them to disappear from view before snatching
up her bag and bolting in the opposite direction.
25
25
Laura hoists a box of french fries onto her shoulder and
moves inside the restaurant.
LAURA
Watch out, it's slippery.
ALIKE
So what do you think?
LAURA
I already told you what I think.
ALIKE
But you know her, right?
LAURA
I said I know of her, I don't know
her know her.
Alike hefts up a box and follows Laura back into the
restaurant.
25.
ALIKE
I'm saying, you know her friend,
right? You gonna introduce us?
LAURA
Just put those on that stack right
there. Yeah, thank you.
ALIKE
You listening?
LAURA
I'm listening--all I'm saying is--
pass me that milkshake mix right
there.
Alike tosses Laura a bladder of milkshake mix. Laura catches
it.
LAURA
All I'm saying is that I don't
think you should put yourself out
there like that. Especially if you
don't even know if she likes you
like that.
ALIKE
She does.
LAURA
How do you know she does?
ALIKE
I just know she does.
LAURA
Hmmph. We'll see.
Laura holds out her hand as if checking for rain and scans
the ceiling.
ALIKE
What're you doing?
LAURA
I thought I felt a drop of pig
shit.
ALIKE
Shut up.
26.
LAURA
All I know is I been trying to get
you to holla at girls in the club
for the longest.
ALIKE
I don't want to holla at girls in
the club.
LAURA
Obviously. Why you pressed about
this chick?
Alike shrugs.
ALIKE
I wanted to ask you about something
else too.
LAURA
Oh God, what now?
ALIKE
I need you to get something for me.
LAURA
What?!
Alike cocks her head at Laura. Laura frowns back.
LAURA
What?!
ALIKE
Just for my image.
Alike raises her eyebrow. Laura shakes her head. The light
bulb goes off. She roars in disbelief.
LAURA
WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to
strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God,
what are you going through...
ALIKE
Please.
LAURA
What difference you think having a
bulge in your pants gon' make?
ALIKE
Pleeeeease. By next Friday.
27.
LAURA
Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh
my God I can't believe you !
Alright. Yeah. She better be cute
for all of this...
26
31
Alike stuffs the wad into a trash bag and plunges it deep
into a neighbor's garbage can. She scurries back into her
building and doesn't look back.
32
34
Alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit
chats with other churchgoers. Sharonda sits in the back
seat, flipping through a CD case and occasionally passing
CD's to Alike to play. Alike faces stonily forward except to
cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction. Audrey raps on
the window.
AUDREY
Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you
to meet.
Alike cracks the window an inch.
40.
ALIKE
Huh?
Audrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms.
Singletary. Alike cracks the window a little wider and
acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
Oh. Hey.
AUDREY
Get down out the car and come
speak.
Laboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the
car radio, and climbs down out of the car.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
What's wrong with you?
ALIKE
Alright, Mom.
AUDREY
You'll have to excuse her, she's
been feeling rude lately.
MRS. SINGLETARY
Oh don't worry, Audrey, I
understand how it is. Hormones.
It's just a phase.
AUDREY
Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one
of my co-workers and her daughter,
Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my
daughter Alike, we call her "Lee"
for short.
Alike shakes both of their hands in turn.
ALIKE
Hi.
MRS. SINGLETARY
Hello.
ALIKE
Nice to meet you.
BINA
Hi.
41.
AUDREY
And this is my youngest daughter,
Sharonda.
SHARONDA
Hi.
BINA
Hi.
MRS. SINGLETARY
Hi there, nice to meet you.
AUDREY
Lee, Bina goes to the same school
as you.
ALIKE
Cool.
BINA
Yeah, I think I've seen you around.
Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP
English?
ALIKE
Yup.
Audrey looks pleased with herself. Alike squirms.
AUDREY
So. Now that we're all acquainted,
don't be a stranger.
MRS. SINGLETARY
Oh no, we won't.
AUDREY
Bina I think you and Lee may even
go to school the same way. Don't
you live off of St. James Place?
MRS. SINGLETARY
There is something to be said for
safety in numbers.
Bina nods. Alike squirms.
MRS. SINGLETARY (CONT'D)
Well, we need to be pushing off --
I'll call you about those VBS
workbooks.
42.
Alike retreats into the car, Sharonda hops in behind her.
Alike reaches over and turns the key in the ignition.
AUDREY
Alrighty, I'll be around. Take
care.
Alike toots the horn. Audrey circles and gets in the driver's
side.
35
36
Alike strides down the sidewalk.
Bina speedwalks to keep up.
BINA
Look, I don't like lying to my
mother, that's all.
ALIKE
Then don't, she doesn't have to
know.
BINA
She does.
She asks me everyday.
ALIKE
So tell her yeah.
BINA
No, I'm sick of lying to cover for
you.
ALIKE
So don't.
Bina stops short.
Alike keeps walking.
BINA
Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you
wanna be called. I'm not trying to
hang out with you, either, but I'm
not about to take an L for it. So
stop dodging me, let's just go to
school together and be done with
it. We don't have to see each
other any other time than that.
Alike doesn't miss a step.
Bina yells after her.
BINA (CONT'D)
Whatever, my mother asks me again,
I'm telling her. Then she can tell
your mother, then it's whatever for
you.
Alike stops short. Bina crosses the street and continues in
the direction away from school. Alike spins around scanning
the street, then catches sight of her on the opposite
sidewalk.
ALIKE
Hey!
Bina keeps on pushing, the school now in sight.
44.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
Hey!
Alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to
catch up with her.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
Hey look, I'm sorry.
BINA
Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna
bug out.
ALIKE
No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to be that way. It's just...
OK, I am concerned that my, my mom
will find out, but...
BINA
But?
ALIKE
It's not like that. It's just--
she's just. If you knew her, you'd
understand. She's like, I don't
know.
The girls walk in silence for a moment.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
So what's your favorite class?
BINA
You don't have to make small talk.
Let's just walk.
ALIKE
I said I'm sorry. It's not you,
it's just that my mom is like,
she's like...
BINA
Overprotective?
Alike relaxes her shoulders, both relieved and surprised.
ALIKE
Yeah.
BINA
I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a
lot of people's parents are like
that.
45.
ALIKE
Yeah?
BINA
Yeah.
ALIKE
Yeah. But probably not like mine.
But anyway...
BINA
Anyway, like I said, we don't have
to talk. Just walk.
Alike's cell phone chirps--it's Laura.
Alike sighs and
stuffs the phone back into her pocket.
37
46
The pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans,
and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and
gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and
strut seeing and wanting to be seen. Equally bedecked
observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both
sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone. Competing
threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled
bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her.
ALIKE (V.O.)
Leave a message and I'll call you
back. BEEP.
Laura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the
screen. She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear.
LAURA
Where you at? Hit me up when you
get here.
47
48
Laura scowls at her cell phone screen. She shoves the phone
in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of
the evening. Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AG's
in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh
meat. Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an
alley across the street and looks away. One of the entourage
passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply. A few of the
girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break
off and scatter into the night one by one.
PIER GIRL #1
`Member when we used to stay out
here all night?
PIER GIRL #2
Shit, used to?
PIER GIRL #1
You stay with your sister now, huh?
Laura nods and spits.
PIER GIRL #2
Lucky as hell.
49
50
Bina and Alike troop home at a more leisurely pace. Alike
breaks the silence for once.
ALIKE
I liked your story, though. It was
tight.
BINA
Yeah? Which one? The one about the--
ALIKE
The one about karma, how things
come back to you. That one, I
thought it was tight.
BINA
For real? Thanks. I wasn't gonna
say anything, but I liked yours
too.
ALIKE
Why?
60.
BINA
Why did I like it or why wasn't I
gonna say anything?
ALIKE
Why did you like it?
BINA
I don't know. I guess because it
felt honest.
ALIKE
Oh.
BINA
Didn't you have on a different
shirt earlier?
ALIKE
What?
BINA
Nothin'.
ALIKE
No, what'd you say?
BINA
Nothin'.
ALIKE
Yeah, I had on a different shirt.
BINA
Oh... Well, that's cool.
ALIKE
So why weren't you gonna say
anything about it?
BINA
About your shirt?
ALIKE
About the poem.
BINA
Cause you're moody.
ALIKE
Moody?
BINA
And quiet.
61.
ALIKE
Man, I'm not moody.
BINA
Yeah, right.
Bina stops.
ALIKE
What?
BINA
This is me.
Alike looks up at the stoop, surprised.
BINA (CONT'D)
It's not so bad when there's some
conversation, huh?
Alike looks away.
BINA (CONT'D)
You wanna come up?
51
59
Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic
chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat
nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops
into the store.
MACK
Hey, baby!
ALIKE
Hey Mr. Ferguson!
MACK
I see Alike's been running circles
around you again!
ARTHUR
Little bit, little bit. I still got
it though.
Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock
whispering to one of the men.
74.
Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato
chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts
round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t-
shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's
face.
Sock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him,
when Alike saunters out between them.
ARTHUR
We better get going.
MACK (CONT'D)
Gone already?
ARTHUR
I'll holler at you later.
Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from
Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Get in the car.
ALIKE
But you said I could drive--
ARTHUR
I said get in the car!
Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the
store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur
piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a
moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands.
60
64
Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs
reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak
defiance against the night sky. A sodium vapor glow veils
everything in generous haloes, making the night more
beautiful than it really is.
Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying,
always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with
clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. Like Puck on a
midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys. Among
the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing. Laura,
smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a
sycophantic harem of four.
79.
Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other
silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now
righting, always connected. Alike and Bina. Bina smiles and
snakes her arms around Alike's neck. Alike too shy to react,
giggles and folds. Laura watches the pair spin and passes to
the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.
65
65
Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over
her face. Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure
whether this is play or for real. Laura chuckles, breaking
the ice. The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with
wild arcing blows. Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that
lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance
away. Alike swipes Laura's hat. Laura claps Alike on the
shoulder and Alike waves to Bina. Bina waves and smiles.
ALIKE
So whatchu you think? She's cool
right?
Laura looks around and shrugs. Laura plucks a fresh joint out
of her coat and lights it.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
She's hot right? I told you. It was
so tight. I'm tellin' you, you
shoulda been there tonight!
Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike.
LAURA
This one's just for me and you.
Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.
ALIKE
And she's smart, too. She does
poetry, you should hear it. It's
like, it's good, you know?
Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead, still chattering.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
I was thinking next weekend the
three of us could--
LAURA
Look, I'm right here.
Alike snaps out of it.
80.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
Oh my bad, I thought you were
beside me. Anyway, I was thinking--
LAURA
Look, I'm sorry for all the drama.
ALIKE
No, it's cool. I shoulda--
LAURA
What I'm saying is, I probably
overreacted.
(beat)
And then...I don't know. Seeing you
two together or whatever. I'm glad
to see you're finally happy.
ALIKE
C'mon man, you know you're my best
friend. Nobody's gonna --
LAURA
You don't need to say anything. I
just wanted to get it off my chest.
I'm happy for you, that's all.
Alike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Because I love you, alright? And
I'm sayin'...I'm right here.
Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off.
Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble
over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on
the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk
creeping back.
MIKA
We goin' to get something to eat?
LAURA
That's what's up.
ALIKE
Listen, umm--
Laura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it
away.
LAURA
That's for later. Bina, nice to
meet you.
81.
BINA
You too. We had fun.
Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder
and starts to lead Mika away.
MIKA
ALIKE
Byyeee!!
Hey hold up!
Laura pumps a lazy
fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina
takes Alike's hand
and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps
looking back, then
finally gives up. Laura looks back just as
Alike turns around
and disappears around the corner.
BINA (CONT'D)
I like your friends. They're cool.
66
68
Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a
small wooden frame home. The paint is peeling and the flowers
in the window-box are dead. A rusted metal mailbox next to
the door overflows with circulars. Laura lifts the circulars
out of the box and trashes them. She picks up a discarded
fast food bag and tosses it too. A dog barks from a
neighboring yard. Laura pulls open the screen door and tries
to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main
door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. More barking.
Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. She
snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward.
Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. LAURA'S
MOTHER, 54, and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at
Laura through the screen.
LAURA
Oh.
Laura's mother crosses her arms and looks at Laura up and
down.
83.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Thought you might've stepped out or
something? How've you been?
Laura's mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing
on Laura. Laura takes a step closer to the door.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Me and Candy, you know we're doing
real good.
Laura's mother puts her hand on the doorknob.
LAURA (CONT'D)
We might even be moving to a bigger
place soon. You know she's workin'
at the hospital now, yeah you'd be
real proud of her. She might even
go back and get her RN--
Laura takes another step forward.
LAURA (CONT'D)
How--? How's Pops? You look good.
You look healthy, yeah you look
real good. You know uh, we miss you
and everything--
Laura's mother starts to close the door. Laura backs away.
LAURA (CONT'D)
I don't wanna take too much of your
time. I just stopped by--you know I
uh--I'm getting my stuff together
too--I uh--
Laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and
advances on the screen door again, holding it out.
LAURA (CONT'D)
So, I did it. I took the test and--
Laura's mother slams the door. Laura stands on her tiptoes
and yells at the diamond shaped window.
LAURA (CONT'D)
I got my GED!
The lock on the door snaps into place. Renewed barking from
across the street. Silence from the door. Laura brushes a
fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the
mailbox.
84.
LAURA (CONT'D)
But listen I--I gotta go. I gotta
get to work but I'ma leave it for
you to see. It was nice talking to
you.
Laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway. She
stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch. She yanks the
envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket.
Laura storms off the porch and out of yard, never looking
back.
69
70
Alike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk.
She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out
into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She
continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening.
She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into
the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and
flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she
wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another
garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She
hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds
her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of
a subway station.
71
83
Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart
of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sunset paints the cityscape
pink and orange. The faint cadence of children playing drifts
in and out on a fickle breeze. Alike's wounds are healing and
she seems happy. The friends exchange wordless smiles and
soak in the peacefulness around them.
Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate.
Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike.
Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. Arthur
tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down. Laura
looks back at Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods.
Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass.
Alike rises to face her father. She stands tall, her weight
is centered. Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns
away from him. Distant playground voices fill the pause.
Alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook.
Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting,
her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her. Laura motions
to Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps
aside and watches Arthur pass.
Alike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows.
Distant playground voices fill the pause.
97.
ALIKE
Where's Mom?
ARTHUR
She...your mother couldn't make it.
Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.
Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Remember our old place? Waaay out
in Queens? It was our first
apartment, we were so proud. Had
all those trees around it? In
October, the whooole block would be
covered with leaves. You remember.
Alike makes no sign.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You couldnt've been more than 2
years old. And when the wind would
blow, all those leaves would come
rushing down the street at us and
you thought they were alive. You'd
get so scared. You'd cry and you'd
scream and beg for us to pick you
up. I would try and tell you
"they're only leaves, baby" and
make you stay on the ground. But
you were so afraid and you cried so
hard, your mother would always pick
you up. She always picked you up.
Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a
glance over at Alike.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
`Member how we used to--
ALIKE
I've been accepted into a early
college program. Starts in the
Spring. Berkeley.
ARTHUR
California's a long way away--
ALIKE
Ten weeks writing boot camp,
workshops. Then I can start summer
semester.
98.
ARTHUR
We can talk about that. Okay?
ALIKE
I need you to meet with my guidance
counselor. Sign the paperwork so I
can graduate early.
ARTHUR
I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let
her hurt you--
ALIKE
I need to know now if you'll sign
the papers. Yes or no?
ARTHUR
Can you forgive me?
ALIKE
Yes or no?
ARTHUR
You can always come back home.
Things are gonna be different, I
promise you--
Alike holds Arthur's hand, stopping him.
ALIKE
Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.
Arthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob.
ALIKE (CONT'D)
I'm not going back home.
ARTHUR
I know.
(beat)
Okay.
Alike nods, squeezes Arthur's hand. Arthur breathes deeply,
composing himself. He starts to pull away.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I better--
ALIKE
Tell Mom that she was right.
ARTHUR
Right about what?
99.
ALIKE
God doesn't make mistakes.
ARTHUR
You should tell her yourself.
Arthur squeezes Alike's hand and drifts away. Alike inhales
the sunset.

84A
Alike writes in her notebook, mouthing the words to a poem.
She looks up and studies the horizon from time to time.
84B
86
Laura and Sharonda fumble a suitcase out of the trunk of the
car. Alike shrugs into her backpack. Arthur nudges them aside
and hefts out the rest of the luggage.
ARTHUR
I got it.
Arthur slams the trunk shut.
ALIKE
Thank you.
ARTHUR
You want me to come in with you?
Alike shakes her head. Arthur starts to back away.
ARTHUR
Well--
Alike pounces on Arthur in a surprise hug. Arthur squeezes
her back.
ARTHUR
You can always come back home.
ALIKE
I love you.
ARTHUR
I love you too.
87
87
General chaos as passengers, and well-wishes scramble for
position.
LAURA
Let me get a hug or somethin',
damn.
Laura squeezes Alike first with one arm then pulls her hand
out of her pocket to wrap both arms around her friend.
102.
SHARONDA
Call us when you get there.
ALIKE
You know I will.
Laura backs away and wipes a sleeve at her eye.
LAURA
You just better fuckin' call.
Alike disappears through the bus doors. Laura slouches on a
hydrant and Sharonda paces, scanning the windows for Alike.
