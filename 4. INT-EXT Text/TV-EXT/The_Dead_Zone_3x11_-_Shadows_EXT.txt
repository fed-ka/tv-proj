            REVEALING JOHNNY lying on his back chewing a grass stem
          and enjoying the complete reprieve from worry that only a
          day this perfect can bring.  BRUCE and J.J. are fishing
          nearby, Bruce helping J.J. rig his line.

                                        BRUCE
                        You say something?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Archilochus colubris.  Otherwise
                        known as the ruby-throated
                          hummingbird.  Did either of you
                        know that of the three hundred
                        and twenty species found worldwide,
                        it's the only one that breeds in
                        eastern North America?

                                        BRUCE
                        No kidding.
                                (handing J.J. the rod)
                        Sounds like your biological dad
                        is still teaching biology.

          J.J. acknowledges this with a matter-of-fact shrug.

                                        J.J.
                        He knows a lot.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah?  Well, I bet he doesn't
                        know about the large creature
                        rumored to inhabit this lake. 
                          "Aquatus Cleaves Millis," possibly
                        a local version of the Loch Ness
                          monster.  Better hope you don't
                        hook it.

          J.J. just gives him a look.

                                        J.J.
                        Mister Lewis?  You're full of it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm wha...?  Did you hear what he
                        just said?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They say truth is the best defense
                        against libel.

          Johnny and J.J. share a smiling biological father-son
          look as Bruce shakes his head, picks up another rod.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay smart guy, twenty bucks says
                        you can't beat this cast.

          He casts a good distance across the lake.

                                        J.J.
                        Whoa, nice one!

                                        BRUCE
                        All in the wrist, young man.

          Johnny steps up, indicates J.J.'s rod.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I?
                                (to Bruce)
                        All in the wrist, huh?

          He casts expertly, the line zipping out.


          ANGLE FROM MID-LAKE

          as the lure arcs toward us, passing over Bruce's bobber,
          then landing right in front of us -- with an EXPLOSIVE
          BOOM.  Now our P.O.V. races back along the line to Johnny,
          where ANOTHER EXPLOSION ramps us into --          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - TEASER - 4/14/04 - GOLD           3.



          As Johnny reacts to this frightening vision.  Bruce doesn't
          notice, still eyeing Johnny's distant cast.

                                        BRUCE
                        All right, you the man -- today.
                                (checking his wallet)
                        Looks like I'll have to get back
                        to you on that twenty, though. 
                        I'm tapped out.

          J.J., however, has noticed Johnny's tell-tale look.

                          Johnny... did you just see
                        something?

          Bruce and J.J. both eye the cloudless sky.

                        Yeah.  We better pack it in.

          Johnny helps J.J. finish packing a tackle box.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you take that to the
                        car and we'll catch up to you?

                        'Kay.

          He runs off as Bruce eyes Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Rain, huh?  You sure your psychic
                          barometer ain't busted?

          Johnny packs up some more stuff, still very rattled by
          the vision, not even sure he wants to talk about it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be honest, I'm not sure of
                          anything right now.

                                        BRUCE
                        What're you talking about?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did just have a vision, but it
                        wasn't about the weather.
                                (beat)
                        I was fighting with someone.  In
                        a motel room, I think.  It was
                        dark... chaotic.  Couldn't see
                          anything clearly.  But I know I
                        was afraid... and angry... very
                          angry...
                                (beat)
                        ...and I killed a man.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay.  So you saw yourself killing
                        someone in the future.  In self-
                          defense, right?

          Johnny nods uncertainly, trying to remember.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was attacking me, but then I
                        hit him with something.  A lamp. 
                        To make him stop.

                        Only he didn't stop, and then I
                        was choking him, and I kept choking
                        him.  I just kept choking him,
                        Bruce, even after he...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, easy.  Whatever this is, it
                        hasn't happened yet, and we both
                        know it doesn't have to.  Now
                        this guy you say you..., did you
                        see his face?

                        Like I said, I couldn't see
                          anything clearly.

            Something else occurs to Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Any idea what gave you the vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shakes his head)
                        It's like it just hit me out of
                          nowhere.

          Neither man knows what to make of this.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well let's get your smart-ass son
                        home.

          Off Johnny, still troubled, as they head to his car...



          SARAH is kissing WALT goodbye as he's about to go to work. 
          Johnny, Bruce and J.J. approach with their gear.

                        all afternoon.

                        Johnny had a vision.  It's gonna
                        rain.

          He squints at the sky, still perfectly blue.

                                        WALT
                        Well, if it does, it's sure gonna
                        put a damper on the Founder's Day
                        bash.  We were expecting a big
                        crowd out at the fairgrounds.

                                        J.J.
                        Mom, I caught a huge bass.  Can
                        we cook it for dinner?

                                        SARAH
                                (ushering him inside)
                        Sure, let's have a look at this
                          monster.

                                        J.J.
                        Bye Johnny.

          Bruce is leaning against the door frame in the b.g.,
            something we shouldn't notice particularly, as J.J. holds
          up his hand to Johnny for a good-bye high-five.  Johnny
          slaps his palm, then rests his hand on the foreground
          side of the door frame, triggering --



          Another kinetic one-er (slightly less confusing than the
          last vision) as we see Johnny, dressed as he was in the
          previous vision (minus the blood), protesting angrily as
          he's muscled out the door by a burly BOUNCER.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I said back off!

                                        BOUNCER
                        And I said not to bother the girls.
                              (a final shove)
                        Now stay out, or we'll definitely
                        have a problem.

          He goes back inside as Johnny seethes.  His clothes are
          disheveled from the tussle but he doesn't bother to
          straighten them.  Instead, he pulls out his cell, speed-
          dials Walt...

          The phone BEEPS.  An INSERT shows us the battery's low.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Damn it!

          approaching from a side alley exit, clutching a skimpy
          gown around herself, a cigarette in one hand.

          Tyler nods, a little scared by his intensity.

                        I was gonna tell you inside, but
                        then Linus got involved.  You
                        don't want to bug him when he's

                        Just tell me about the man.

                        He was in earlier.  Made a pass
                        at me, you know, tried to get me
                        to go back to his place with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        His place? 

                                        TYLER
                        I guess he was lonely.  I mean he
                        had some sob story about his wife
                        leaving him and his boss being on
                        his case, yada, yada, but I don't --

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impatient)
                        Did he say where he lived? 

                                        TYLER
                        Said where he was staying.  Right
                        across the highway.

          And as she points, suddenly, there's a BOOM, followed
          quickly by a couple more.  They both turn to watch
            FIREWORKS blossoming over the distant Fairgrounds (maybe
          we can see the top of a Ferris wheel), illuminating a
          MOTEL across the highway with a distinctive neon SIGN,
          and a smaller one under it flashing "No Vacancy." 

                                        TYLER
                        Wow, don't you love fireworks? 
                        And I'm stuck working a double.

                                        TYLER (CONT'D)
                                (moving off)
                        You're cute.  If you come back,
                        ask for Tyler.  I mostly work
                          afternoons.  Private dances are
                        half off before six.

          She goes back inside, as Johnny stares at the motel,
            fireworks continuing to go off overhead.  He remembers
          something, reaches into his coat pocket, and his expression
          hardens.  He takes something out, looks at it...

          It's a wicked-looking CLASP KNIFE, with an open, blood-
            encrusted blade.  He looks up again at the motel, his
          hand falling to his side, the blade glinting.  As he walks
          across the road, fireworks light up the sky...



          Johnny reacts to this new seemingly unprovoked vision.

                                        WALT
                        John?  Now what?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing, I just remembered
                        something.
                                (trying to sound casual)
                        They having fireworks at that
                        thing tonight?

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, which is why I'm hoping
                        you're wrong about the rain.  But
                        then you're never wrong, are you?

          He heads toward his cruiser, his good-natured remark
          rattling Johnny even more.  Bruce and Johnny start back
          to Johnny's car, Bruce taking out his cell --

                                        BRUCE
                        I got a couple of patients today,
                        but I can cancel them.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Your vision.  There must be some
                        clues we can follow up, right?

          Johnny eyes his friend uncertainly.

          the motel... the knife glinting in his hand...



          As he looks away, trying to hide his unease.  The latest
          vision, the knife in particular, suggests he may've
          instigated the fight that ended with him killing a man. 
          But he's not ready to share these new "clues" just yet,
          even with Bruce.

          Johnny gets out of the Range Rover in front of the motel,
          a no-frills economy establishment.  He looks up at the
          neon sign he saw in his vision -- it now flashes "Vacancy" --
          then notes the strip club across the highway.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/14/04 - GOLD         11.



          Camera is suddenly SPINNING, everything we see TINGED
          WITH RED.  We catch disorienting glimpses of a crime scene: 
          a patch of concrete bordered by shadowy greenery, ringed
          by police tape.  A sheriff's deputy (ROSCOE) works with
          TWO FORENSIC TECHNICIANS inside the tape; STATE TROOPERS
          keep a crowd at bay outside.

          The location itself could be a park, or maybe part of a
          street or intersection inside a park.  But we can't be
          sure because we only catch glimpses of a few generic
          landmarks:  a lamp post; a tree and bench; the nearby
          opening of a pedestrian underpass, which almost looks
          like the dark mouth of a cave.

          Then the spinning slows, color returning to normal as


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/10/04 - PINK         20.

          camera pulls back to reveal in f.g. a SPINNING RED BEACON
            magnetically mounted on the roof of an unmarked police
          car, then finds Johnny Smith trying to get past a couple
          of troopers.

                                        TROOPER 1
                        Sir, stay behind the tape! 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call Sheriff Bannerman, he knows
                        me.

                                        TROOPER 1
                        Sir, stay back or we'll be forced
                        to arrest you.

                                        ROSCOE (O.S.)
                        It's okay!  Let him through. 

          The troopers let Johnny pass, our jittery hand-held camera
          moving with him, sharing his P.O.V. as Roscoe moves to
            intercept him.  Behind Roscoe, Johnny can see a forensics
          tech scraping a sample from a patch of bloodstained cement.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Walt radioed you'd be coming.

          But he sounds more worried than grateful for Johnny's
          help, and he continues to block him from the crime scene.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just tell me what can I touch. 

                                        ROSCOE
                        John, we're all hurting over this. 
                        I know it must be a terrible loss.

          And now we see it in Johnny's eyes:  he has lost someone. 
          Indeed, his anger is the only thing keeping his grief in
          check.  He repeats, his voice tight: 

                                         JOHNNY
                        Roscoe, either get out of my way
                        or arrest me, but one way or
                        another I'm gonna find out what I
                        need to know. 

            Reluctantly, Roscoe turns to the forensics tech, who
            indicates that he's pretty much done.  Seeing this, Johnny
          pushes past Roscoe and crouches by the bloodstain.  This
          isn't a stranger's blood; it hurts Johnny just to look at
          it.  Still, he forces himself to touches the still-damp
            concrete.  He reacts to a vision, something clearly awful,
          but apparently it doesn't tell him enough.

                        What else?  I need to touch
                          something else.

                                        ROSCOE
                        We found another bloodstain over
                        there.  Could be from the perp.

          He indicates where the other forensics tech is shutting
          his evidence kit by the base of the statue.  Johnny crosses
          to the spot, Roscoe following, speaking awkwardly...

                                        ROSCOE
                        They say surgeons shouldn't operate
                        on their own family, right?

          But Johnny isn't listening, crouching now over this smaller
          bloodstain, extending his fingertips again...

                                        ROSCOE
                        So maybe, you know, you should
                        leave this one to us.

          Johnny makes contact... has a vision...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (aloud to himself)
                        Tossed it... tossed it and ran...

          As he crosses to some bushes, Roscoe following --

                                        ROSCOE
                        Unless what you're looking for...

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY, crouching with his back to Roscoe, who
          can't see what he's doing, as he pulls out a clasp knife
          with a blood-encrusted blade, then reacts to another
          vision.

                                        ROSCOE
                        ...is revenge. 
                                (beat)

                                (re: vision, to himself)
                        The strip club... I know you were
                        there but where are you now? 

          He stares at the knife a beat; we sense part of him wants
          to just take it and bolt.  Instead, he controls his anger
          and stands, turning to Roscoe with it.  Roscoe reacts.

          Roscoe nods to one of the forensic techs, who takes it
          with gloved hands, starts to bag it.

                                         JOHNNY

                        Look, just wait a minute while I
                        call this in.

                        Johnny? 

          Roscoe takes a few steps after him, bringing the spinning
          beacon back into the f.g. --

                        Who did?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe.  I was at a crime scene. 
                        Someone had been killed.

                                        BRUCE
                                  (understanding)
                          "Family."

          Johnny nods as the line is picked up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?



          Sarah is gardening, J.J. helping by digging holes with a
          trowel.  She reacts to the alarm in Johnny's voice.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is J.J. there?

                                        SARAH
                        Yes, he's helping me in the garden.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want you to take him inside and
                        lock the doors.  I'll call Walt,
                        have him send a patrol car over.

          Sarah glances nervously back toward the house.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, what's going on?  Are we
                        in danger?

                        It's probably nothing, but I just
                        want you to sit tight until I
                        make sure.  I'll explain later,
                        but for now please just do this.

                        Sure.  Of course.

                        I'll call you soon.

          We end the intercut as Johnny hangs up and grabs his coat.

                                        BRUCE
                        So where are you going now?  Make
                        that where are we going now?

                        To report a murder.



          Bruce rigs J.J.'s fishing rod.  FAST-FORWARD to the moment
          where Johnny takes the rod from J.J. and casts, then --          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/10/04 - PINK         30.



          Bruce leans against one side of the door frame in the
          b.g. as Johnny rests a hand on the opposite side --



          A vision that breaks from the established pattern.  Instead
          of taking another measured step back in time, it leaps us
          directly to the moment of the murder itself as we see a
          series of fragmented images of Bruce being stabbed
          repeatedly, all EXTREME CLOSE-UPS that prevent us from
          seeing his assailant.  A FINAL IMAGE shows us Bruce being
          cradled in someone's arms, gurgling up blood as he tries
          to say something.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT THREE - 4/10/04 - PINK       33.



          A MAN'S HAND clenching a heavy object (a piece of pipe,
          but we can't see it clearly) descends in a blow... the
          SALESMAN'S TORSO hits the pavement... a BLOODY CLASP KNIFE
          clatters onto the pavement... a MAN'S HANDS lift the prone
          SALESMAN by the neck and smash him back into the pavement. 
          Though we can see enough of the victim to realize it's
          the Salesman, all we see of the attacker is his hands.



          Day has turned to night as Johnny's car rolls slowly
          through an urban neighborhood of low buildings.



          As it approaches a dead end by a river-front park.



          Street lights are on as Johnny and Bruce walk along,
          passing joggers and dog-walkers; a family with young kids;
          other pedestrians.  They reach a small paved open area
          with a bench and a tree.  Johnny stops, feeling a
          tightening in his gut.

                                        BRUCE
                          John...?

          But Johnny is looking around, noting a lamp post, the
          nearby pedestrian tunnel.  He's hit again by --

          Also turning as he takes it all in.  Another dog walker
          crosses between them and the river.  Three young men, all
          wearing watch caps, sit on some nearby bleachers drinking
          beer out of paper bags and laughing.  Once again, the
          placid scene contrasts with Johnny's violent recollections.

                        You sure?

          Johnny's eyes fall on a familiar patch of concrete.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  I'm sure.


  5858MEMORY FLASH (B&W)

            A distraught, manic Johnny pushes past Roscoe to crouch
          by the bloodstained concrete, reaches out for a vision.


  5959RESUME JOHNNY

          Now crouching in the same place.  But this time his touch
          yields nothing.  He stands as Bruce eyes the spot.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why do I feel like someone just
                        walked over my grave?

          Johnny doesn't answer, instead moving to touch a bench,
          then the lamp post, his frustration and alarm growing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm still not getting anything.

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you expect to?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We shouldn't be here.  This is
                        crazy.

                                        BRUCE
                        'Course it's crazy.  "Crazy" has
                        been the theme of both our lives
                        since you came out of that coma. 
                        Why should today be any different?

          Johnny takes out his cell.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who you calling?

                        Walt.  At the very least, we can
                        get some back-up.

          But before he can complete the call, they react to a girl's
          O.S. SCREAM.  A charged look between them, then they race
          in the direction it came, through the pedestrian tunnel.


  6060AT THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL

          They hear the shriek again, only now it's followed by
            laughter.  They see the cause:  a BUNCH OF boys and girls
            playfully roughhousing as they play a Hacky Sack game. 
            Relieved, Bruce puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder...

          Only now Johnny notes something else happening back where
          they came from.  A Salesman sits dejectedly on the bench
          by the tree, setting his battered briefcase beside him. 
          Meanwhile, a man in an ARMY JACKET is ambling up behind
          him.  Something about the scene commands Johnny's
          attention; maybe it's the man on the bench, something
          familiar about him...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce...

          But before the thought can fully form, Bruce turns and
          they both see Army Jacket jerk an object from his pocket
          (a piece of PIPE, but we can't see it clearly) and whack
          Salesman hard across the head.  Johnny and Bruce react as
          Salesman goes down.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's it!  It's happening!
                                (shouts)
                        Hey!

          Army Jacket turns and sees them, then grabs the Salesman's
            briefcase and takes off.  Bruce tenses, about to take
          some action, but Johnny stops him, having made a snap
          judgment that the mugger is the man he's been seeking --
          the man who would've attacked Bruce, but instead attacked
          the Salesman.  He doesn't want Bruce anywhere near him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll take the mugger, try'n see
                        where he's going.  You help that
                        guy.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.

          He takes off, and as he does so CAMERA pulls back slightly --
          to REVEAL ANOTHER JOHNNY standing there watching him go.

          We're in a vision; a vision that started when Bruce touched
          Johnny's shoulder.  This new Johnny ("Observer-Johnny")
          watches Bruce head toward the fallen Salesman, then we
          CUT TO --


    6161VISION-JOHNNY

          Now chasing after Army Jacket, CAMERA tracking with him
          as he passes various people, among them a DOG-WALKER, an
          ELDERLY COUPLE on a bench, and a HOMELESS MAN looking for
          bottles in the trash.  With his bad leg, he's hard-pressed
          just to keep the mugger in sight, and now the man scrambles
          over a low stone wall, dropping the briefcase, then keeps
          running.  Vision-Johnny rushes toward the wall, not seeing
          the last person he passes, who once again is -- 


            OBSERVER-JOHNNY

          now watching from the edge of the path.  CAMERA hangs
          back with him as he turns to see Vision-Johnny reach the
          wall, winded, leg throbbing, only to see the mugger tearing
          ass out of the park.  Giving up on the chase, he picks up
          the briefcase... and reacts to a frightening vision (a
          vision neither we, nor the Johnny watching from within
          this vision, see, but the import of which is clear).

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Bruce! 

          He's already turning to run back, Observer-Johnny reacting
          to his look of alarm, when THE SCENE FREEZES.

            Vision-Johnny is frozen in mid-step, as Observer-Johnny
          now turns and starts to rush back through the frozen
            surroundings.  He passes the same people Vision-Johnny
          passed going the other way, now all frozen, and arrives
          back at the open area to see the three young men frozen
          as they approach Bruce, who's crouched by the fallen
            Salesman.  Now he recognizes two of them as the Punks
          from his vision in Walt's office.  One of them (Punk 1)
          has an unopened clasp knife in one hand.  Then the scene
          UNFREEZES, Bruce oblivious to the approaching threat as
          he checks on the Salesman, who's lying face down.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, are you all right? 
                                (the Salesman groans)
                        Don't move, okay?  I'll get help.

          Bruce sees a CELL PHONE in a holster on the man's belt,
          but as he starts to remove it --

          Bruce turns, startled.

                                        BRUCE
                        No, I'm not.  I'm trying to help
                        him.

                                        PUNK 1
                        Yeah, help yourself to his wallet. 
                        Wrong move, spade.

          He flicks out the knife blade.  Bruce rises, holding out
          his hands placatingly.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey! 

          And is promptly sucker punched by Punk 3 as Johnny watches
          helplessly.

                                        PUNK 2
                        That's it!   Kick his ass! 

          They converge on Bruce, who struggles to hold his own,
          knocking down Punk 3, then managing to knock the knife
          out of Punk 1's hand.  Meanwhile --


          THE SALESMAN

          starts to pick himself up, and Observer-Johnny, now
          revealed crouching beside him, sees his fear and confusion,
          and something else:  the tattoo on his right forearm.  In
          an instant he realizes that this is the man he's been
          seeking, the real threat.  And in that moment, Bruce is
          SLAMMED into the Salesman, knocking him back down.  The
          man hasn't even had a chance to take in the fight; he
          just thinks he's still being attacked by whoever originally
          brained him.  Panicked, and enraged, he sees --

          THE KNIFE

          lying on the ground.  In anger and desperation he grabs
          it, turning and STABBING Bruce as Observer-Johnny reacts,
          stunned as he realizes how this actually happens.  Bruce
          tries to ward off this new attacker, which only heightens
          the Salesman's fear, and the rage fanned by that fear. 
          He goes berserk, stabbing Bruce again and again as Observer-
          Johnny watches in horror.  Even the Punks are freaked and
          run off.  A beat, then the Salesman rises, stares at the
          bloody knife in his hands as if emerging from a fog, then
          runs off too, tossing the knife in the bushes as he goes. 
          Bruce rolls weakly onto his back as now Observer-Johnny
          sees --

                          Bruce...
                                (reacts to all the
                                  blood)

                        John... that you? 

          Bruce's eyes open but we sense his sight is already fading,
          and now those dimming eyes seem to look past Vision-Johnny
          to our Johnny, who's watching with an expression that is
          just a step removed from Vision-Johnny's utter anguish.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I'm here.  Just hang on,
                        buddy, I'll get an ambulance.

          But as he fumbles for his cell, Bruce continues speaking
          as if to our Johnny; or in other words, to the air...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, if you can hear me, you
                        gotta remember...

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        I can hear you but don't talk...

                        No matter what happens remember...
                        who you are.

          Then his eyes close, and as Observer-Johnny lowers his
          head, Vision-Johnny is convulsed by grief.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                          Bruce.... Bruce!

          once again Johnny finds himself --

          Bruce has just put his hand on Johnny's shoulder.  Knowing
          he's just been given another chance to save his friend,
          Johnny looks back toward --


          HIS P.O.V. - ARMY JACKET

          again clubs the Salesman from behind --

                        That's it!  It's happening!

                        Hey!

          As before, Army Jacket turns, sees them, then grabs the
          Salesman's briefcase.  Once again, Bruce tenses, but this
          time Johnny gives him a different direction --

                                        JOHNNY
                        You take the mugger.  I'll help
                        the vic.

                        It's a racial thing, I saw it. 
                        Now go, and don't try to play

                        Don't worry.

          Bruce takes off.  Johnny eyes the fallen Salesman, then
          the Punks who have yet to notice the crime and are still
          hanging at their park bench.  But he's not about to take
          any chances and takes out his cell, speed-dialing --

          An alarmed Walt on the phone.

                        John?  Where are you?  I was about
                        to put out an APB on your car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm in a park by the river, at
                        the end of Sixth.
                                (anticipating his
                                next question)
                        We're both okay, but there's
                        someone else who needs an
                        ambulance.

                        Don't do a thing 'till I get there.

          Johnny hangs up, thinking he's got things under control,
          only to react as he sees --

  7171HIS POV - THE PUNKS

          Starting toward the Salesman, Punk 1 taking out his knife. 
          Apparently the skin color of their prey doesn't matter as
          much to this pack of hyenas as Johnny thought.


          JOHNNY

          realizes he has no choice but to intervene to protect a
          man who in different circumstances would've killed Bruce. 
          He rushes toward --

          THE SALESMAN

          As Johnny arrives ahead of the approaching Punks, who
          react as though he's trying to cut in line.  He holds up
          his phone --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  I've already the called the
                        police.  Everything's under
                          control.

                                        PUNK 1
                        What's your problem?  We were
                        just going to help the guy.

                                        PUNK 2
                        Yeah, what'd you think, we were
                        gonna rob him?

          Johnny can't help but eye the closed knife Punk 1 still
          has in his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please, just back off and give
                        him some room.

          The Punks exchange looks, then Punk 1 flips out the blade.

                                        PUNK 1
                        How about you back off, gimp?

          He holds out the blade, expecting Johnny to run, then
          cries out in surprise and pain when Johnny instead whacks
          it out of his hand with his cane.

          Now the other two punks attack Johnny as meanwhile --


          THE SALESMAN

          gets to his knees, only to be inadvertently knocked down
          again by Johnny just as he was by Bruce in the vision. 
          Once again he's panicked and enraged, thinking now that
          it's Johnny who mugged him.  Once again, he sees the knife
          on the ground, grabs it, and turns, slashing Johnny in
          the arm.  Johnny cries out and wheels, grappling with the
          man as meanwhile he's hit by --



          A WHIRRING SOUND accompanies a shot of a fishing lure
          arcing out over the still water and landing with a splash. 
          A beat as the bobber settles on the surface, then it's
          tugged back toward shore, where we...

          FIND JOHNNY, slightly bruised, his arm bandaged, slowly
          reeling in the line as he stands alone at the lake's edge.

          Johnny turns to see Bruce approaching.

                        Not for me.

                        Figured I might find you here. 
                        'Case you didn't know, that guy
                        dropped his charges against you. 
                        Walt had a little talk with him,
                        about what might've happened,
                        kinda sobered him up.

          Johnny nods, looking pretty sobered up himself.

                        Yeah, but didn't, thankfully for

          Johnny watches his line, chewing over something in his
          mind.

                        You know, on the way here I passed
                        an accident.  A car had gone up
                        on a sidewalk, hit a bus stop.  I
                          stopped, asked if anyone had been
                        hit, and the cops said no.
