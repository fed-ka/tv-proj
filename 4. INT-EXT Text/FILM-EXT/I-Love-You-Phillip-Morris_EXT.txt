A group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a

RED HAIRED BOY

It's right there.
A young STEVEN RUSSELL (9) is among them.
YOUNG STEVEN
It's really big.

Steven walks up to a middle class home and raps on the
screen door. A kindly woman (MRS. BASCOMBE) arrives
behind the mesh wearing a birthday PARTY HAT.
MRS. BASCOMBE
(alarmed)
Is something wrong officer?
STEVEN
Are you Barbra Bascombe?
MRS. BASCOMBE
Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone hurt?
STEVEN
(lip quivering)
In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave
up a baby for adoption, correct?
An ashen look overcomes Mrs. Basham's face. She removes
her hat.
MRS. BASCOMBE
I don't think I know what you're talking
about.
Steven can see that behind her is a small FAMILY
GATHERING at the table, grouped around a BIRTHDAY CAKE.

MRS. BASCOMBE
I don't know what you're talking about.
STEVEN
You were young. I know that you made a
mistake giving me away, but-
MRS. BASCOMBE
Listen-
STEVEN
Shhhhhh.
Mommy please- let me finish.
What color that remains in her face drains away.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
We
all make mistakes. What I came here
to
say is, I forgive you because none of
us
is perfect but now with a fresh start
we
can build --
She SLAMS the door in his face.
From behind the door-
MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
I have no idea what you're talking about,
Steven.
STEVEN
No, it's okay, I know everything.
But
it's fine. Just tell me why--
MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
Go away!
STEVEN
Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at
once. But I can come back. How's that?
I can come back later, I'll bring us some
coffee and we can talk about...
(suddenly furious)
WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER
TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD!
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?! WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH ME!?
Tears stream down Steven's face. He gets in his car and
slams the door. And as he sits there trying to make sense
of things...

I/E RUSSELL HOUSE - HOUSTON - 1986 - DAY

The ideal suburban American barbecue is in full swing at
the new Russell household.
In a series of brief vignettes, Steven shows off the
house, his family and his new corvette.
CUT TO:
A happy Steven moves through the backyard with a plate of
meat fresh off the grill.
Continuing past the buffet he enters the dining room to
find SIX YEAR OLD STEPHANIE (same actress) happen past.
Steven lovingly scoops her up without a thought.
STEPHANIE
I can't find my blue fish.
DEBBIE (O.S.)
Steven?
He turns to see Debbie across the room talking to a YOUNG
COUPLE. She waves him over.
STEVEN
(to Stephanie)
In the laundry room.
He puts her down and heads over to Debbie and the couple.
DEBBIE
Steven you haven't met our new neighbors
down two and across the street- Neil and
Sara.
STEVEN
No I haven't. I hope you're planning on
changing the paint. What do you call that
color?
NEIL
Oh we're changing it.

Yes sir-ee.

WE'RE BACK on the hilltop from the beginning of the
movie.
Nine year old Steven and his three young FRIENDS crest
the verdant hill- running and laughing through the
backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day.
They all collapse into the long grass like the splayed
arms of a starfish. Catching their breath, they stare up
at the sky- searching for shapes in the clouds.

A man's wiener.

Shut up! There's no wiener!
YOUNG STEVEN
Uh huh!
RED HAIRED BOY
No there's not!
There is a long silence.

The Moustached Man and Steven say goodbye at the door.

I had been living a lie for a long, long

drunk.

Steven drives his red Corvette, hard top removed, with a
contented look on his face. He glows as the Pet Shop
Boys' "West End Girls" plays on the radio.
STEVEN (V.O.)
Now just because I was screwing around
doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did.
I loved her with all my heart...
Stephanie too. My family was all I had
and they needed me. So I told myself it
was just a little lie and it was better
for everybody if it stayed that way.
(beat)
That's what I told myself. But life has a
way of forcing these things into the
light.
CRASH! A CROSSING PICKUP TRUCK smashes into the driver
side door-- violently propelling steven and his corvette
out of frame.
STEVEN (V.O.)
You might even call it an epiphany.

VINTAGE MAMBO MUSIC. Palm trees line an upscale Palm
Beach shopping district. Well-heeled nabobs cruise the
boulevard, shopping and being seen.
Two MINIATURE DOBERMAN PINSCHERS on a tandem leash appear
from around a corner soon followed by the NEW STEVEN with
a handsome young man on his arm (JIMMY KEMPLE).
Steven's pajama-like clothes, perfect tan and loose
demeanor make him the very essence of a man with new
found freedoms.
STEVEN (V.O.)
Life was good. Everything was falling
right into place. I moved to Florida, got
a new job, had two adorable pups, I was
dating a cute guy named Jimmy. I could
do anything I wanted...

An OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY
FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As
he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is
talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER.
Tomato crates are all around.
STEVEN (V.O.)
It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to
buy low grade tomatoes in the field and
sell them to clueless chain stores as
higher grade.
PRODUCE MANAGER
These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right?
STEVEN
(big smile)
Finest in the land...
And as they talk-
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's called `field buying'. I could clear
three thousand dollars in a good week
doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough.
29
34A
Steven's Ford Bronco cruises past the apartment building
to find a few POLICE CARS parked outside. He drives on.
SMASH CUT TO:
35
35
Steven BLUBBERS TO HIMSELF inside his Bronco which is
parked in a bleak lot near a looming billboard.
STEVEN (V.O.)
But one thing was for sure-- I was not
gonna let them put me away. I was a cop
and I knew what jail was like. And there
was no way I was going there. I had a
plan.
He continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dumps all the pills into his
mouth. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a
bottle of Galliano to wash it down.
He starts up the car.
STEVEN (V.O.)
Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine.
36
36
CARS PASS through frame, quickly heading wherever it is
they are going. Moments later, a car horn is heard,
incessantly blaring and building in volume until--
STEVEN'S CAR IDLES INTO FRAME AT 1 MPH. The Heights',
"How Do You Talk To An Angel" is barely audible over the
car horn and STEVEN is slumped over the steering wheel.
Moments later, it veers off down into the grassy shoulder
and out of frame.
FADE OUT.
37
39
Debbie, Kemple and the Cop exit the hospital and look
around frantically. They spot him running across the open
air lot and give chase.
Steven comes to a stairwell door. It's locked. He runs
some more and finds himself cornered at the guard rail.
KEMPLE
Steven!!! Stop!
Kemple, Debbie and the cop slowly approach. Steven
glances over the guard rail. ONE FLOOR DOWN is an OPENED
DUMPSTER.
KEMPLE (CONT'D)
Steven!
Steven looks down again. Kemple knows what he's thinking.
KEMPLE (CONT'D)
Wait Steven. Don't!
Steven looks down. The soft bags of trash below beckon
him to freedom.
KEMPLE (CONT'D)
Steven I'm serious! You stop or you'll
never see me again!
(no response)
I mean it!

Steven looks to Kemple and then to the Cop right behind
him. HE JUMPS and--
KEMPLE (CONT'D)
STEVEN!
They run to the guard rail and look over to see--
Steven lies MOANING and delirious on his back NEXT TO THE
DUMPSTER.
FADE OUT.

As inmates CHANT and STOMP, a new inmate walks the line
to his new cell clutching his prison issue belongings.
Although we can only see him from behind, we can only
assume this is Steven. He continues his walk amidst a
shower of stares and JEERS and THREATS raining upon him.
INMATES

42
Steven escorts Arnie through the prison, waving to
various inmates and guards along the way.
STEVEN
(upbeat)
You're gonna catch a beating any day now,
that's just the way it is. I lost three
teeth and cracked a vertebrae. Anyway,
all you need to do is fight back. Win or
lose, just fight back.
(then)
Or you could try to suck the guys' dick.
Your choice.
He moves on.
43
45
A mean-looking con named GARY mans a mail-cart while he
talks with Steven and Arnie.
GARY
(mid-sentence)
...letters, magazines, shit like that- it
all goes through unmolested. But if
Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or
brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have
to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five
bucks per item or you can suck my dick.
Steven turns to Arnie.
STEVEN
Your choice.
46
52
VARIOUS SHOTS as we follow the note being passed by
different hands and means throughout the prison on its
way to Steven.
PHILLIP (V.O.)
Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I
should tell you I'm diabetic so I
probably shouldn't... but I did anyway.
It's been so long since anyone's shown me
any kindness and well, it means a lot. I
just wish you were here...
53
55
Again Phillip watches as Cleavon passes his cell without
leaving a note.
56
56
Phillip lays in bed, impatiently. He seems upset. He
anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the
mopping Cleavon working his way closer to his cell.
PHILLIP
Hurry up would you?
CLEAVON
I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot.
Besides I ain't got nothing for you
anyway...
PHILLIP
But it's been three days.
CLEAVON
You got a tracking number, motherfucker?
PHILLIP
No.
CLEAVON
Then shut your faggot ass.
Phillip slumps back onto his bed, depressed.
PHILLIP
Congratulations Phillip, scared off
another one.
A few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his
cell door sliding open.
He looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him.
CORRECTIONS OFFICER
Morris - you got a new roommate.

This is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh
until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of
belongings.
Phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind
Steven.
PHILLIP
Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?
Steven slowly moves closer.
STEVEN
I know a guy. I took care of it.
I'm
gonna take care of everything...
Steven gently caresses Phillip's face. Phillip is
melting. Then suddenly, Phillip grabs Steven's ass.
PHILLIP
Enough romance, let's fuck.
They launch themselves onto the bunk and as they get to
business...
FADE OUT.
57
60
Phillip emerges from the line munching on a candy bar
when he notices a ruckus on the other side of the fence.
He wanders over to see a LARGE PRISONER beating the crap
out of the Screecher.
LARGE PRISONER
I'm gonna cut out your motherfucking
tongue with your screeching all night.
As guards descend on the two, the Large Prisoner
continues to beat on the screeching SCREECHER.
Phillip sidles up next to a BALD PRISONER.
PHILLIP
What does he care- he ain't in our
block...
BALD PRISONER
Someone probably paid him.
61
68A
Phillip runs after Steven, quickly arriving at a LOCKED
GATE. Steven is on the other side, still being escorted
away. Phillip is forced to find an alternative route.
69
71
PHILLIP'S POV: Steven is waiting in line with some other
prisoners to board a bus.
Phillip can be seen through the small window, but he
fails to get Steven's attention.
He bangs silently on the glass.
72
73
Phillip runs down a breezeway. Eventually he reaches a
heavily populated gate, manned by a YARD GUARD.
PHILLIP
I wanna go in the yard.
YARD GUARD
You do?
PHILLIP
I WANNA GO IN THE YARD!
YARD GUARD
Hold your horses Dorothy.
The Yard Guard pushes a button that opens the gate and
Phillip bursts through.

Phillip runs through the yard, passing GIANT WOLF-
WHISTLING INMATES as they put down their weights and stop
their basketball games.
Phillip maintains his focus on the sally port on the
other side of the far fence.
PHILLIP
STEVEN!!!!
Boarding the bus, Steven hears him and turns. Delighted,
he's forced on board by a Guard before he can respond.
PHILLIP (CONT'D)
STEVEN!
Steven gets in his seat and yells out the window.
STEVEN
What the hell are you doing!?
PHILLIP
I love you!
STEVEN
I love you too!
VROOM! The bus starts up and begins to move.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
We'll be together soon! I promise!
The bus drives off. Phillip runs along with it for a
while as they share a long goodbye. And eventually, the
bus disappears from view.
Phillip clings to the fence a moment, hanging on to hope.
He slumps and turns-
-only to find himself confronted by several HULKING
MEMBERS OF THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD with one thing on their
minds.
Phillip marches right toward them and as he draws close-
PHILLIP
GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!!
Startled, they split to let Phillip pass unmolested.

The gate of the prison closes behind Steven as he
exits.
He approaches a waiting TAXI.
STEVEN (V.O.)
And once I did, I was determined to get
us back together as soon as possible.

The same taxi pulls up in front of the prison and Steven
emerges with a BRIEFCASE, wearing a THREE-PIECE SUIT.
He rings the buzzer at the front gate.

The dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see
Steven and Phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a
small fire on the beach.
PHILLIP
How'd you know he'd do that?

I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for

An empty 21-foot MOTORBOAT bobs atop placid seas, fishing
poles dangling over the side. The SOUND of two men
enjoying themselves can be heard.
After reaching their inevitable conclusion, the VOICES
gasp for air.

Dan Lindholm is out on the balcony staring up at the
starry sky. Steven approaches.
LINDHOLM
You see that?
Dan points out a small dot of light moving across the
sky. Steven squints.
STEVEN
No...
(realizing)
Oh- is it...?
LINDHOLM
Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right
now. Just a satellite deployment.
Nothing special... Just touching the face

He chokes back a tear, then throws an arm around Steven.

Steven, Lindholm and two CLIENTS are at the first tee.
Steven nervously tees up. He does his best recollection
of a warm up and hits the ball. It's not a good drive,
but it does go about thirty yards.
STEVEN
Oh! This is easy!

As Lindholm and the Clients wait, a periodic spray of
sand flies up from the trap behind them as unseen Steven
swings in vain.

The sheriff is desperate and goes to a
psychic. All the woman says is rabbit.
Rabbit-rabbit-rabbit, that's all. Well
he thinks `bullshit' and he's driving
back home and what happens? He sees a
rabbit crossing the street in front of
him. So he pulls over and follows it into
the woods and he finds the missing car.
All wrecked and turned over and the
girl's inside... still alive.
Eventually we find Steven and Phillip in the BACKYARD on
a large DOUBLE CHAISE LOUNGE. Their sleeping min-pins
are between them.

The nurse picks up the phone.
CARETAKER (CONT'D)
