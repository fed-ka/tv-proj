      Chock full of hipsters - the staff and the clientele. At an 
      outdoor table sits HANK - 32, black, handsome, wearing his 
      EMToutfit. Sipping an espresso from a tiny cup and eating a 
      plate of sliced apples. Here comes JOHNNY - 32, white, rugged 
      good looks. Not happy right now: 

                                    JOHNNY
                    Ya gotta be shittin me.

                    My day to pick - I picked a bistro. 
                      Thought you d like the chicks.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Which ones are the chicks? 

                                    HANK
                    Every day it s your turn, you pick 
                    some depressing old diner where 
                    they pour sadness over your 
                      pancakes and the youngest chick in 
                    the place is 87 years old. 

      An incredibly cute waitress drops off some honey and brown 
      sugar. Her beauty is affected only by a long ugly serpent 
      tattoo that stretches all the way down one arm. She exits.

                                    JOHNNY
                    As opposed to that chick - who 
                    looks like she s about to star in 
                    The Girl With The DouchebagTattoo. 
                      I like sad pancakes and I like my 
                    sad pancakes served by someone sad 
                    who got their tattoo either in the 
                      Marines or the holocaust and I like 
                    to get both my lonely coffee and my 
                      tragic pancakes for less than 4 
                    very happy dollars. How much did 
                    you pay for that apple? 

                                    HANK 
                      5 bucks. But it tastes like 10. 
                      When s the last time you had a 
                    piece of fruit?

                                    JOHNNY
                    Is there fruit in Fruit Loops?

                    This ain t about the pancakes. This 
                    is about the guy who died on us 
                      yesterday.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    He was the same age as us, bro. Hit 
                    by a bus.

                                    HANK
                    Dead on impact. Even though we 
                      worked on him for almost half an 
                    hour there was nuthin we could do 
                    about it. Not a sad pancake deal.

                                    JOHNNY
                            (looking off - lost)
                      Really puts things in perspective.

                                    HANK
                    Check this perspective asshole:you 
                    got Daddy issues, which lead to 
                    your Mommy issues, which lead to 
                    your commitment issues - let s not 
                    throw a mortality grenade into that 
                    whole goddammess.

                      I miss her, man.

                      Omigod! This is about Theresa. I 
                    knew it! Ya wanna talk about 
                      perspective? Look at it from hers: 
                    she lived with a guy who showed 
                    more commitment to diners than he 
                    did to getting married. Tell ya one 
                    thing I don t miss: the screaming 
                    crazy arguments and the endless 
                      grudges and the constant breakups. 

                                    JOHNNY
                      I don t wanna die alone. Like that 
                    guy yesterday.

                                    HANK
                    Okay then. Y knowwhat you should 
                    do? Get back together with her.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Really?

                                    HANK

                    Tough shit. We got a new guy comin 
                    on the rig today and I heard he s 
                    an ex-Navy Seal.      

                                    JOHNNY
                    Navy Seal. Shit. Do I look like I 
                    been cryin ?

                                    HANK
                    You were actually cryin ?

                            (defensive)
                    No. Misty. I got misty.



      Johnny drives, waiting for a call. Eating a jelly donut and 
      drinking his coffee. Hank rides shotgun. In the middle is the 
      new guy - BRIAN, mid-twenties. Short. Stocky. Blonde crew 
      cut. Bag of candy. Wide-eyed.

                                    BRIAN

                    Wow. This is a regular lime Skittle 
                    in a Wild Berry Skittle bag. 
                      What rethe odds?

                                    HANK
                      I thought I read somewhere that you 
                    were with the Navy Seals.

                                    BRIAN
                    Navy? No no - EASTER seals. 
                      Volunteered. This is so cool. First 
                    day on the job. You guys Facebook? 

                                    JOHNNY
                    No I don t Facebook- matter a fact 
                      I don t even read regular books. I 
                    eat, I sleep, I save lives.

                    Hey - I control technology, 
                      technology does not control me.

                                    HANK
                    Which means he can access online 
                    porn from his phone WHILE he s 
                      driving.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    Is there some fancy name for that?

                                    HANK
                    Last time I checked it was still 
                      called jerkin  off.

                    North Shore Drive and West 
                      Hawthorne. Driver trapped inside.

      Hank responds and Johnny hits the gas as the sirens wail.

                    Hang on Easter Seal - I know a 
                      shortcut.

      He pulls a 180, tires squealing, and just misses getting 
      slammed by a huge truck coming in one direction and a bus 
      headed in the other. Brian blesses himself.

                    This comin from a man who doesn t 
                      believe in God.

      Johnny is driving like Jeff Gordon while almost nonchalantly 
      eating his donut and slurping coffee.

                                    JOHNNY
                      I never said I don t believe in 
                    God. I said I believe Michael 
                      Jordan is God.

                                    HANK

                    Who s complicated now, asshole?

      Johnny speeds thru an intersection, barely avoiding cars and 
      trucks coming from every direction.

                    I try to keep my dickaway from my 
                      phone. He always wants to call my ex.



      The ambulance screeches to a halt close by an overturned 
        automobile. Several bystanders. No other emergency vehicles. 
      The guys jump out. Don McLean s  AMERICAN PIE  is blaring 
      from the overturned car s audio system. 

                                    JOHNNY
                    Got a fuel leak ready to spark. 

      He points out the leak - and the camera pans to reveal the 
      DRIVER, unconscious and bleeding in the passenger foot well.

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    I m goin in.

      Hank clears the remainder of broken glass from the window.

                    Yup. Get the body board.

                                    BRIAN
                      Especially when there s a chance 
                    the vehicle could go up in flames?

      As Brian runs to the rig, Johnny snakes himself across the 
      front seat as Hank keeps an eye on him and the fuel leak.  
      Other sirens can be heard approaching.

                                    HANK
                    Leak is gettin heavy, bro. And 
                    based on personal experience I 
                      estimate there s another 14 verses 
                    left in this crappy tune.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Almost there.

      He s squirming and struggling - seems close to reaching the 
      victim when: his hand reaches up and shuts off the car, 
      killing the engine and the music.

                                    JOHNNY (CONT D)

                    Thank God. This couldabeen so much 
                      worse.

                                    JOHNNY
                    How?

                                    HANK
                    What if he liked Madonna?

      Johnny and Hank pull the guy out.  Just as they carry the guy 
      to safety, the back end of the car bursts into FLAMES.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Course you are.  Cause all the 
                      rescue work is already over so only 
                    thing left is the paperwork.

      Hank and Brian lift the boarded victim onto the gurney and 
      roll him towards the back of their rig. Johnny brushes him 
      off and helps Hank and Brian get the gurney in the back of 
      the rig. Suddenly a gorgeous female cop, THERESA, and her 
      equally gorgeous black male partner, DANNY, arrive at the 
      ambulance back doors.  

                                    THERESA
                      Pissedoff fire lieutenant, car in 
                      flames, victim already locked and 
                      loaded - figured it had to be 
                      Johnny and Hank. Guys, this is my 
                    new partner, Danny.

       Hey s  all around. Just a head nod from Johnny. Through the 
      following, Hank and Brian secure the patient.

                                    HANK
                    This is our new guy Brian. Brian - 
                      Theresa.

                                    THERESA
                    How s it hangin Bri?

                    Um- good.

                          (to Danny)
                      Johnny s dad was a highly decorated 
                      Chicago fireman who retired as a 
                    hero a hundred times over but left 
                    his mother for a stripper when 
                      Johnny was thirteen.

                    Plus he fails the firefighter test 
                    every year which is more than 
                      likely a subconscious form of 
                      sabotage so he can stay in this job 
                    which he loves and does better than 
                      everyone else on the planet. Except 
                    Hank.  
                          (Johnny is smiling)
                      What s funny.

                                    JOHNNY
                      Nothing. She wasn t a stripper.

                                    THERESA
                      Right. She was just a drunk who 
                    liked to take her clothes off in 
                      nightclubs where they serve steak.

                                    HANK
                          (off the patient)
                    We re good to go here, bro!

      As Johnny begins to close the doors, he notices Theresa 
      carefully straightening Danny s badge. A telling moment of 
        tenderness? Hank notices it too. As Theresa and Danny walk 
      away - Hank looks right into Johnny:

                    You awright?

      Johnny appreciates the concern, pats Hank on the shoulder as 
      a thank you gesture and BAM! slams the doors shut:



      They fly through traffic, sirens and lights ablaze. Johnny 
      drives as Hank finishes vitals on the guy and then asks Brian 
      to hand him medical supplies, which Brian does as ordered:

      WIDE ANGLE shows the ambulance is literally moving at about 7 
      mph. Cars and trucks speed past. Some cars backed up behind 
      it, beeping their horns as Johnny waves them to go around.



      Johnny notices that the police cruiser is empty. Glances 
      around when he hears a hushed  hey  which seems to come from 
      inside the back of the rig, where one door s ajar. He crosses 
      to peek inside when someone grabs him and pulls him in:

                    the truth, brother.

      Brian starts humming the song - very verylow.

                    None of this would have happened if 
                    you paid the right kind of 
                      attention to her instead of laying 
                      around the apartment all the time 
                      playing Madden on the X-Box. Brian - 
                    stop!

                                    JOHNNY
                    What are you talking about? Half 
                    the time you were over playing 
                      Madden with me.

                                    HANK
                    So I could sabotage my relationship 
                    with Jeff the Chef. I had a master 
                    plan. I KNEW what I was doing.  

                                    BRIAN

      They all duck down. A beat. Then:

      He sits up.

                                    HANK (CONT D)
                    Oh my god.

                                    JOHNNY

                                    HANK
                    The guy drives a Lamborghini.

      They all peek up at the most incredible car you ve ever seen. 
      Then they duck back down. Johnny is in prayer mode.    

                                    JOHNNY
                    Oh Lord - please don t let her 
                    sleep with him please please
                      please.

                    Lord - if you can hear me - please 
                    let this guy be gay.

                                    BRIAN
                    Hey, they re not leavin . They re 
                      making out.

      Brain was peeking and now they all rise up.  

                                    HANK
                    Okay - forget gay. Let him be bi.

      Suddenly Theresa pushes the guy away.

                                    JOHNNY
                      That s my girl. Kick him in the 
                    balls honey! Kick him in the - hey,

                                    BRIAN
                    She s gettin out.

      They watch as Theresa gets out of the car and crosses to the 
      front of it and - starts writing something down.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Wait. Is she -

                                    HANK

                    Must have been a terrible kiss.

                                    HANK

                      I know. I ll stop talking.

      Theresa walks to the driver side window of the Lamborghini.  
      The Matt Damon-ChanningTatumguy rolls it down and she hands 
      it to him. He speeds off.  

                                    BRIAN (CONT D)
                    She s comin this way!

      They all duck down again. Shhh-ingeach other. There is a 
      long beat as they hold their breath and then - TAP TAPTAPon 
      the window. Brian gets up and rolls down his window in the 
      back. Johnny and Hank stay down.

                                    BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Theresa.

                                    THERESA
                    Why do you smell like peaches?

                                    BRIAN
                    I m drunk. You wanna go swimming?

      Johnny and Hank slide up.

                                    JOHNNY
                    You just give that guy a ticket?

                                    THERESA
                    Yes. His registration was expired - 
                    which I normally let go when I m on 
                      a date with such an incredibly 
                      handsome, sexy, shockingly wealthy 
                    hunk of manhood - except for two 
                      things. Number one? He couldn t 
                    stop talking about himself.  He was 
                    an arrogant cocky self-involved 
                      asshole. Which is what I seem to be 
                      attracted to. So I was still gonna
                    let him make out with me right 
                    there in the car for hopefully 
                    about fifteen minutes.

                                    BRIAN
                      Because it was a Lamborghini?

                                    THERESA
                    That and the fact I knew you guys

                                    JOHNNY
                    How?

                                    THERESA
                      Because I GPS dYOUR phone about 
                    two months ago.

                                    JOHNNY
                    Oh.

                                    THERESA
                    Plus he had a tongue like a horse. 
                    And he tried to finger me. Which I 
                    don t allow on the first date. 
                      Unless the guy s a really great 
                      kisser. Then it s both hands on 
                    deck.  

                                    JOHNNY
                    She s kidding.

                                    THERESA
                      Y knowwhat? I never should have 
                      deleted you as my ICE -  cause who 
                      better to call in case of emergency 
                    than someone who s already parked 
                    right across the street!? Johnny - 
                    if only you had put this much 
                      thought and energy into our 
                      relationship while we were living 
                      together. It would have been 
                      charming and impressive. And might 
                    have ended with us walking home 
                      together tonight, arm in arm - 
                      totally in love. Instead - I m 
                      taking a taxi. By myself. And shame 
                    on you for getting this innocent 
                    young man drunk and using his car 
                    for your nefarious plan! Good 
                      night!  

      She turns and walks way. They all watch her go. There is a 
      long, uncomfortably quiet beat in the car. Then:

      She hands him a Coke. He downs a couple Advil. Takes a swig.

                    Think I m off peaches. And bars.  
                    And swimming.

                                    BRIAN
                    No no. That part was awesome. I ve 
                    never been on a spy mission before.

      He downs two more Advil. Huge swig of Coke.

                    man s ass.

      A beat. Brian stares back at them. Then does a HUUUGEspit 
      take and starts screaming with his tongue stuck straight out 
      until he heads into the locker room. Johnny spent that time 
      taking pictures with his phone. Which he is now dialing on.

      Brian s screaming can be heard off-screen.

                    Oh yeah. They ll be blown up, 
                      framed and hung behind Mac s desk 
                    by the time we get done with the 
                      shift. See ya in 5.

      Johnny hangs up. We see Hank s iPhonescreen right before he 
      does the same. It features a close up of Johnny as he is 
      driving the rig. And right above it the name tag  I.C.E.
