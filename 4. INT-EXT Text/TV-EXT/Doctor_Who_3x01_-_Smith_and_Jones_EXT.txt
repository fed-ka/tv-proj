      Rush hour, hundreds of people, but all reduced to a long-
      lens blur foreground & background, to focus on: MARTHA
      JONES, walking along.  23, facing another day at work,
      just another face in the crowd.  Hold on this.

      Then her mobile rings, she recognises the number, and she's
      already smiling as she answers -

                                      MARTHA
                    You're up early!  What's happening?

      CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SIGN saying ROYAL HOPE HOSPITAL.  Big, central building,
      modern (but not too new), one central tower block with
      many extensions leading off.  MARTHA heading inside.

      Behind her, a MOTORCYCLE COURIER is also walking towards
      the Hospital, fast, marching along.  He just clips her as
      he overtakes her, but keeps on walking. 

                                      MARTHA
                    Oy!  Watch it, mate!

      He turns back.  Stares at her.  Faceless.  Something
      unnerving in his absolute stillness.

      Martha a bit spooked.

      Then he walks on, striding away.  Martha unsettled, though
      she shakes it off, continues on her way.

                                                                            CUT TO:Who 3   -  Episode One   -   Shooting Script   -   28/07/06  - Page 4.Doctor 




      FX: GREY CLOUDS fill the sky overhead.  A bolt of lightning.

      INTERCUT WITH STAFF KITCHEN. 

      TISH walking along, on her mobile.  It's damp and rainy,
      though nowhere near as bad as the rain around the hospital.

                                    TISH
                    I wish you'd take this seriously,
                    that's our inheritance she's
                    spending.  On fake tan!  Tell you
                    what, I'm not that far away, I'll
                    meet you for a sandwich, we can
                    draw up a battle plan -

                                      MARTHA
                    What, in this weather?  I'm not
                    going out, it's pouring down.

                                    TISH
                    Come on, it's not that bad -

      And on that, Tish turns a corner -

      FX: a good mile away, dark clouds and heavy rain over the
      Hospital, noticeably heavier.

                                    TISH (CONT'D)
                    Oh, take it back.  God, that's
                    weird.  The storm's right on top
                    of you. I can see it, from here, 
                    it's right on top of the hospital.

                    No, I'd stay inside if I were you,
                    it just looks... weird.

                                      MARTHA
                    Yeah, but anyway, I've got a plan,
                    this is what we do -

      And Martha turns away from the window, faces the door -

      THE DOCTOR, in pyjamas & dressing gown, hurries past - a
      glance at Martha, he seems worried, but then he's gone -

                                      MARTHA (CONT'D)
                    - we tell Dad and Annalise to get
                    there early, about seven thirty,
                    and we get Leo there at the same
                    time so we can do all that birthday
                    stuff, but we tell Mum to get there
                    for about eight thirty, nine, and
                    that gives me time to have a word
                    with Annalise, and maybe I could
                    tell her...  What?

      That, at Julia, who's staring beyond Martha, at the window.

                                      JULIA
                    ...the rain.

                                      MARTHA
                    It's only rain.

                                    TISH OOV
                          (quiet)
                    Martha.  Have you seen the rain?

                                      MARTHA
                    Why's everyone fussing about rain?

      Said, turning round to the window.  And Martha stops dead.

      FX: the window.  The rain on the glass is running UP.

                                      JULIA
                    ...it's going up.

                                    TISH OOV
                    The rain is going up.

      Martha & Julia walk forward, gobsmacked...

      FX: REVERSE from the opposite side of the window, tracking
      in on Martha & Julia, water running up the glass...

      CUT TO CITY STREET, Tish still on the phone - the rain
      normal about her - but she's just gaping, and other PEOPLE
      beginning to stop and stare...

      FX: the Hospital in the distance, ominous grey clouds
      circling right overhead, rain flying upwards, hugging close
      to the building, an unnatural sight.

      FX: Trish's POV, bolts of lightning all around the Hospital -
      and again, they're going up, ground to sky -

      CUT TO the Staff Kitchen -

      FX: flashes of lightning, close to the window, and then - 

      FX: slam! - the window fills with solid bright white light -

      Martha & Julia throw their hands up, blinded - 

      And all hell breaks loose!  Like an earthquake - with the
      window staying a bright, constant white, the whole room
      shakes violently - with a whumph!, Martha & Julia thrown
      left! - whumph! - right! - whumph! - left again - !

      The cupboards fly open, stuff flying out, then being flung
      in the opposite direction - like a ship at sea, in a storm -

      Martha & Julia drop to the floor, CAMERA down with them.

      And then...  It stops.

      Calm.  Silence.  Hushed:

                                      MARTHA
                    What the hell was that..?

                                      JULIA
                    You all right?

                                      MARTHA
                    Think so, yeah.

      And they stand, cautious.  Shaking off broken crockery.

                                      MARTHA (CONT'D)
                    Felt like an earthquake, or..?

                                      JULIA
                    Martha.  It's night.

      Through the window: PITCH BLACK.

                                      JULIA (CONT'D)
                    But...  It was lunchtime...

      REVERSE through the window, looking in on Martha, as she
      slowly walks forward, to look out.  Her mind is screaming. 
      But she contains it; she's got to.

                                      MARTHA
                    It's not night.

      Julia walks forward, to join Martha.  Then she just stares.

      FX: THEIR POV, outside the window.  The surface of THE
      MOON.  With the Earth beyond, suspended in the night sky.

                                      MARTHA
                    We're on the Moon.

                                      JULIA
                    ...can't be.

                    We're on the Moon.  We're on the
                    bloody Moon.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      WIDE SHOT.  The surface of the Moon.  With the ROYAL HOPE
      HOSPITAL sitting there.  The central tower, and all its
      extensions.  At its base, bits of road, tarmac & cement,
      are ripped off, where the building was gouged out of the
      ground; but otherwise, everything's intact.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FX SHOT: CLOSER on the MAIN TOWER - most windows lit, the
      last few lights flickering on.  Windows filling with people,
      hundreds of silhouettes, as they approach the glass.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      (NB, all Moon scenes now designated NIGHT, though time-of-
      day is continuous with the same DAY 2.)

      CUTTING even CLOSER to the main building - 

      SHOT of FEMALE WARD WINDOW, looking in.  PATIENTS & STAFF
      start to fill the window, staring out, awestruck, hands
      against the glass, unable to believe what they're seeing...

      SHOT OF MALE WARD WINDOW, looking in.  PATIENTS & STAFF
      slowly approaching the window, staring out...

      SHOT OF MR STOKER'S OFFICE WINDOW, looking in.  MR STOKER
      walking up to the glass, open-mouthed...

      FX: REVERSE, the surface of the Moon.  Undeniable!

      And then...

      One WOMAN starts to scream.

      Then another WOMAN.  Then a MAN.

      Then the whole MALE WARD WINDOW full of PEOPLE, panicking.

      Then the FEMALE WARD WINDOW, PEOPLE screaming, some sobbing,
      some wailing, some praying, absolute hysteria, scared
      witless by that terrible, impossible view.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      TISH terrified - running, running, running -

      Until she's stopped by a POLICEMAN.

                                    TISH
                    Oh my God.  Oh my God...

      FX SHOT, REVERSE on Tish & others on the edge of a HOLE. 
      A great big crater, gouged out of the ground, where the
      Hospital used to be, surrounded by buildings on either
      side.  A fountain of water from a broken water pipe.

      FX SHOT: EVEN WIDER, the City surrounding the HOLE. 

      CUT BACK TO TISH, escaping the POLICEMAN, into her mobile:

                                    TISH (CONT'D)
                    Martha, can you hear me?  Martha? 
                    Are you there?  Martha??!

      And she's walking past a big blue box.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CAMERA outside, looking in.  It's an ordinary patients'
      lounge, cheap chairs, old telly.  In the CORRIDOR beyond:
      glimpses of panic, a WOMAN sobbing on the floor, PEOPLE
      running past, screams.  But fading in b/g: on THE DOCTOR &
      MARTHA, as they approach the windows, cautious.  The room's
      got French windows opening on to an area of concrete -
      nothing posh, just a low-walled open concrete verandah.

      The Doctor tests the handle...  Looks at Martha, both take
      a deep breath...  And the Doctor opens the door...

      And, nothing, no outrush of air.  They exhale.  Step out.

                                      MARTHA
                    We've got air.  How does that work?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just be glad it does.

      FX: CAMERA TRACKING FORWARD over the verandah, to see the
      Moon's surface beyond. (FX REPEAT the view during dialogue.)

      Hold the silence, the two of them looking out, then, quiet:

                    brother's twenty first.  Oh, my
                    mother's gonna be...

      For a second, she could cry.  Stops herself.  Pause.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    D'you want to go back in?

                                      MARTHA
                    No way.  Cos... I mean, we could
                    die, any minute, but all the same...
                          (smiles)
                    It's beautiful.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    D'you think?

                                      MARTHA
                    How many people want to go to the
                    Moon?  And here we are.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Standing in the earthlight.

      Pause, both still looking out.  Calm, but more serious:

                                      MARTHA
                    What d'you think happened? 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    What do you think?

                                      MARTHA
                      Extraterrestrial.  Got to be.  I
                    dunno, few years ago, that would've
                    sounded mad, but these days...
                    that spaceship flying into Big
                    Ben.  Christmas.  And those Cybermen
                    things, that battle in the sky...
                          (beat)
                    I had a cousin, Adeola.  She worked
                    at Canary Wharf.  Never came home.

      On the Doctor, looking at her, realising.

                    find a way out.  If we can travel
                    to the Moon, then we can travel
                    back, there's got to be a way.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's not Smith.  That's not my
                    real name.

                                      MARTHA
                    Who are you, then?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm the Doctor.

                                      MARTHA
                    Me too, if I ever pass my exams. 
                    What is it then, Dr Smith?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just the Doctor.

                                      MARTHA
                    How d'you mean, just the Doctor?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just, the Doctor.

                                      MARTHA
                    What, people call you "the Doctor"?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yep.

                                      MARTHA
                    Well I'm not.  Far as I'm concerned,
                    you've got to earn that title. 

      He squats down to the floor, searching - 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd better make a start then, let's
                    have a look, there must be some
                    sort of...

      He finds a stone chipping, stands, chucks it over the edge -

      FX: vwop!, it's like the stone passes through an invisible
      membrane, which wobbles, ripples blue, then fades.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                      Forcefield.  Keeping the air in.

                                      MARTHA
                    But if that's... say, it's like a
                    bubble, sealing us in.  That means,
                    this is all the air we've got. 
                    What happens when it runs out?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    How many people in this hospital?

                                      MARTHA
                    Dunno, thousand?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    One thousand people, suffocating.

                                      MARTHA
                    Why would anyone do that?

      A thrrrrmmmmmm in the air - both looking round -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ask 'em yourself.  Heads up!

      FX: THREE SPACESHIPS fly overhead, appearing from behind
      and above the Hospital roof.  They're like tubes, but
      massive upright tubes - they stay upright always, no need
      to be aerodynamic - the size of office blocks, studded
      with levels and lights, all very functional and military.

      Martha automatically grabs hold of the Doctor as they watch -

      FX: the three ships start to descend, half a mile away -

                                                                            CUT TO:

      running back to the windows, urgent, to stare out -

      CUT TO MALE WARD, some PEOPLE crying at the glass, more
      running up to join them, awestruck, to see the ships. 
      Including MORGENSTERN; a bit of a geek, he loves it!

      CUT TO MR STOKER'S WINDOW.  STOKER stares out, in shock.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FX: CU the foremost TUBE, dust blowing up around its base
      as it settles.

      FX: third TUBE lowering, with the HOSPITAL visible half a
      mile away in b/g.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR & MARTHA right on the edge, looking out.

      FX: seen from a distance, the Doctor & Martha's POV; at
      the base of the foremost TUBE, a white panel slides up, a
      door opening.  A ramp slides down.

      FX: figures - too small to be seen clearly - march out, in
      a line, very military.  They head down the ramp - 

      FX: onto the moon's surface.  March towards the hospital.

                                      MARTHA

      FX: WIDE SHOT of the HOSPITAL, deadly BLUE LIGHTNING zig-
      zagging all around the building, making the surface of the
      air-bubble visible, all the bolts contained within the
      membrane, like a storm in a bottle-

                                                                            CUT TO:


      TISH, POLICE and CROWD throwing their hands up, caught in
      the glare of a blinding white PRAC LIGHT.

      But as the light fades, and they lower their arms...

      CUT TO REVERSE: and there's the Hospital, plain as day.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Organised chaos.  AMBULANCES & POLICE CARS, PEOPLE passing
      to and fro f/g & b/g, some PATIENTS being carried on
      stretchers by PARAMEDICS, some in wheelchairs.  A lot of
      them being given oxygen. 

      JULIA, recovered, runs to a friend, hugs her.

      MARTHA just sitting on the back step of an ambulance, dazed. 
      A paramedic gives her the all clear, Martha walks away...

                      represented the Human Race, I told
                    them, you can't do this, I said...

      Martha hears her name being called, sees -

      TISH is forcing her way past a crowd barrier -

      Martha smiling, but at the same time, looking around:

      HER POV: a good distance away, past the crowd barriers,
      THE DOCTOR, walking towards a wooden blue box.  He sees
      her, waves, though keeps walking -

      Martha distracted as Tish collides with her, huge hug -

                                    TISH
                    Oh my God, I thought you were dead,
                    what happened?  It was so weird! 
                    Cos the police wouldn't say, they
                    didn't have a clue, and I tried
                    phoning, Mum's on her way but she
                    can't get through, they've closed
                    off the roads, there's thousands
                    of people trying to get in, the
                    whole city's come to a halt, and
                    Dad phoned, cos it's on the news
                    and everything, he was crying, oh
                    my God, I've been a mess, but what
                    happened, I mean what really
                    happened, where were you?

      Under this, far-off, the noise of ancient engines, grinding.

      Martha looks round again. 

      The Doctor, and the box, have gone.

      Tish's voice just fading away in b/g; hold on Martha, a
      good long time, looking towards the empty space, feeling
      somehow alone, in the middle of all these people.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Panning down from the night sky.  A city centre pub, not
      too smart, not too rough.  A banner outside, 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY
      LEO.'  And the doors fly open -

      ANNALISE comes storming out, followed by CLIVE, followed
      by FRANCINE in the middle of a blazing row -

                                      ANNALISE

                    was just saying you look healthy -

                    Clive, that woman is disrespecting
                    me!  She's never liked me!

                    And then, she has a go at Martha,
                      practically accused her of making
                    the whole thing up -

      But then smiling.  Because across the road...

      THE DOCTOR.  He steps back into a nearby alley, in darkness.

      Martha runs across the road - 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MARTHA runs into the alleyway -

      And there's THE DOCTOR, leaning on the tall blue box.

      Pause between them.  Almost embarrassed.  Then:

                                      MARTHA
                    I went to the Moon today.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Bit more peaceful than down here.

                                      MARTHA
                    You never even told me who you are

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The Doctor.

                                      MARTHA
                    But what sort of species?  And
                    it's not every day I get to ask
                    that.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm a Time Lord.

                                      MARTHA
                    Right.  Not pompous at all, then.

      He laughs, gets out a new, identical sonic screwdriver.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I just thought...  Since you saved
                    my life, and I've got a brand new
                    sonic screwdriver which needs road-
                      testing...  You might fancy a trip.

                                      MARTHA
                    What?  Into space?  But...  I can't,
                    I've got exams, I've got things to

      She looks back round, hearing:

                    Then again...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    If it helps...  I can travel in
                    time, as well.

                                      MARTHA
                    Get out of here.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I can!

                                      MARTHA
                    Oh come on.  That's going too far.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'll prove it.

      And he disappears into the box -

      FX: the grind of engines, and it disappears.

      Martha gobsmacked.  She walks forward, into the empty space,
      holding out her hands, like it's an illusion.

      Then she hears the engines again, darts back, in case she
      gets crushed -

      FX: the box rematerialises.

      And the Doctor steps out, brandishing his loose tie.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Told you!

                                      MARTHA
                    No, but...  That was this morning,
                    but...  Did you just..?  Oh my
                    God!  You can travel in time!  But
                    hold on, if you could see me this
                    morning, why didn't you tell me
                    not to go to work?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Crossing into established events,
                    strictly forbidden.  Except for
                    cheap tricks.

                                      MARTHA
                    And that's your spaceship?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's called the Tardis.  Time And
                    Relative Dimensions In Space.

                                      MARTHA
                    Your spaceship is made of wood? 
                    But there's not much room, we'd be
                    a bit... intimate.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Take a look.

      He stands aside, to let her in.  She walks forward...
