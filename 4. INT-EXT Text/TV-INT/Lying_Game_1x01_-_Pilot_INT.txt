      Emma crosses down a hallway off the faded living room.


      ... Emma kicks off her shoes, starts to slip out of her 
      top... when she notices TRAVIS BOYLE, 19, her pea-eyed 
      foster brother, leering at her through an open window.

                                        TRAVIS
                      Hey,  sis.  Good run?

                                        EMMA
                      I m not your sister.

                                        TRAVIS
                      Okay, foster sister...  Like that 
                      better, anyway.  So many more 
                        possibilities.  

                                        EMMA
                      You are such a perv.

                                        TRAVIS
                      And you so read things into what I say.  

      Emma reaches to close the blinds.

                                        EMMA
                      I don t think so.  Now if you don t 
                      mind...

                                        TRAVIS
                      Only if you close those blinds.

      Emma BANGS the window shut, yanks the blinds, blotting out 
      Travis s toothy grin.  Emma falls back on her bed, gazing                                                                                       2.


      up at the ceiling.  She s painted the ceiling in dayglow 
      stars, the only decoration in an otherwise drab bedroom.  

      A sudden PINGING causes Emma to bolt up.  She opens her 
      laptop, immediately linked to Skype.  A face APPEARS on her 
      SCREEN -- a face identical to Emma s.  This is SUTTON 
      MERCER, 17, Emma s newly-discovered twin sister.  Sutton is  
      sitting in her upscale Phoenix bedroom. 

                                        SUTTON
                      There you are.  We just got back... 

                                        EMMA
                      Wait.  Let me look at you.

      Emma drinks in Sutton.  Sutton does the same.  Like looking 
      in a mirror.

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      It still... amazes me...

                                        SUTTON
                      Even after two months?

                                        EMMA
                      You know I can t wait for it to be face-
                      to-face.

                                        SUTTON
                      Me, too...

                                        EMMA
                      So now that you re back home...  

                                        SUTTON
                      Emma, you know I want us to be 
                      together.  But you get why we have to 
                      wait...

                                        EMMA
                      You re searching for our real parents. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Which means being careful with my 
                      adopted ones...    

      Emma looks off, hesitating.  Sutton twin-senses there s 
      something on her mind.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      What?                                                                                        3.


                                        EMMA
                      It s just -- the people who adopted you 
                      -- they sound pretty cool.  I mean, 
                      they must love you...

                                        SUTTON
                      Then why did they lie to me?

      Sutton, noticeably disturbed, has leaned back.

                                        EMMA
                      Maybe they want to protect you. 

                                        SUTTON
                                (flaring)
                      They re protecting themselves, okay? 

      Sutton suddenly gets up, paces away.  Emma can t see her.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT'D)
                      Sure, on the surface, they gave me this 
                      perfect life, and it s been great...  
                      But now I find out most of it was just 
                        a cover-up... 

      Sutton returns to the WEBCAM, switches on a warm smile.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      But, hey, I m back on it now.  Won t be 
                      long, I promise.  

      Sutton smiles.  Emma returns an identical one.

                                        EMMA
                      Well, like I always say,  hope is 
                      grief s best music. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Wow, Emma, that s brilliant.  You 
                      really got the smart half of the 
                      embryo, didn t you?  

                                        EMMA
                      Actually, it s stolen from a book.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah, well, so when we do get together -
                      - guess who s going to do my homework 
                      for me?

      Both laugh an identical laugh, interrupted when Emma s door 
      FLIES OPEN!                                                                                        4.


      Travis is standing there, hoping he s walked in on 
         something. 

                                        TRAVIS
                      Who you talking to?

                                        EMMA
                      None of your business.  

      Emma SLAMS her laptop shut... as we... 

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                        ACT ONE


      DOORBELL RINGS... and we find LAUREL MERCER, 16, racing for 
      the front door across this marble-decked foyer.  Laurel, 
      Sutton s sister, is all sassy spunk and sarcasm.  She opens 
      the door to handsome-sexy-confident LUKE COBURN, 17.  Luke 
      has always been the boy all the girls crush on.

                                        LUKE
                      Hey, Laurel, welcome home.  Sutton 
                      here?

      Laurel puts on a faux serious face --

                                        LAUREL
                      Luke, I m afraid I have bad news.  
                      Sutton was killed in a tragic boating 
                      accident off Bora Bora, making me the 
                      last available Mercer female.  

      KRISTIN MERCER, 40s, races into the foyer, having heard --

                                        KRISTIN
                      Laurel, stop!  Luke, don t listen to 
                      her...

                                        LUKE
                      Wouldn t think of it, Mrs. Mercer.  
                      Welcome home.  How was the South 
                      Pacific?   

                                        KRISTIN
                      Wonderful time, but glad to be back.
                                (then)
                      Do you believe Sutton turned me down 
                      for our girls night out...?

                                        LUKE
                      Thought you guys had a tradition.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      So did I.

      Sutton is hurrying in on this --

                                        SUTTON
                      Don t start, Mom.  Hey, Luke...

      Sutton gives Luke a quick kiss.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                              (to Kristin)
                      People grow out of things, Mom.  Why 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                      7.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      don t you take Laurel -- she s been 
                      screaming to go for years.

                                        LAUREL
                      This is true.  Besides, I m sure Sutton 
                      and Luke have a lot of, you know...
                              (airs  quote marks )
                      ...  catching up  to do...

      Laurel quickly spins from Sutton s look-that-could-kill, 
      passing entering TED MERCER, 40s, on her way out.  Ted s a 
      plastic surgeon.  Handsome, athletic, very confident.  

                                        TED
                      Hey, Luke.  Good summer?

                                        LUKE
                      Pretty boring without Sutton around.

                                        SUTTON
                                (quickly)
                      I m out of here.  Char s got a  welcome 
                      home  thing going for me.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Everything unpacked?

      ... BANG, the door closes behind Sutton and Luke.  Ted 
      turns to Kristin.    

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      My mistake.  Discussing things in front 
                      of the boyfriend.  
                                (then)
                      I was just so hoping the trip, getting 
                      away...

                                        TED
                      Daughters pull away from their mothers.  
                      It s a natural part of growing up.

                                        KRISTIN
                      No.  It started when we lied to her.  
                      That s when she pulled away... 

      Real fear in Kristin s voice.  Ted eases Kristin into a 
      warm embrace.

                                        TED
                      We did the right thing.  Never doubt 
                      that.
                                (then, strongly)
                      We did all we could.                                                                                      8.


      Kristin leans her head against his chest, so wanting to 
      believe him.


        Blackjack-dealer foster mother, CLARICE BOYLE, 52, is 
      shaking a hollowed-out book at Emma and Travis.                                                                                        9.


                                        CLARICE
                      ... Five hundred dollars, including a 
                      hundred dollar tip signed by none other 
                      than Mister Bruce Willis himself...  
                      Now who got into my kitty?

                                        TRAVIS
                      Ma, I didn t even know you had a kitty.

                                        CLARICE
                      Emma?

      Emma hesitates.  It s as though she knows what s coming.  

                                        EMMA
                      Travis took it.  He stole your money.  
                      I saw him do it.

                                        TRAVIS
                      I got my own job, what would I need 
                      with Mom s tip money?

                                        EMMA
                      I dunno.  Buy more pot.  He s been 
                      coming on to me every chance he gets...   

      Clarice hasn t even looked at Travis.  

                                        CLARICE
                      Emma... I took you in... when no one 
                      else would have you...  

                                        EMMA
                      You took me in because the state of 
                      Nevada pays you...

                                        TRAVIS
                      Check her backpack.  Go on, look...

                                        CLARICE
                      Think I will...

      Clarice grabs the backpack, rummages, comes out with a wad 
      of bills.  She unfurls a particular c-note.

                                        CLARICE (CONT D)
                       To my lucky penny, Clarice.  Love, 
                      Bruce Willis. 

      Emma thrusts a finger toward Travis.

                      He did this.  He set me up.                                                                                      10.


                                        CLARICE
                      Social Services said if anything like 
                      this happened, I m supposed to call the 
                      cops... and that s just what I m going 
                      to do.  Watch her, Travis.

      Clarice heads for the kitchen phone.  Emma, worried, spins 
      away from Travis s smug smile...


      Travis has the drapes pushed back, looking out the front 
      window.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      That didn t take long.

      Travis turns.  Emma is standing there, hands behind her.

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      You know, I still might be able to help 
                      you here...  Promise me a little 
                      action, I can make those cops go 
                      away...

      He slides a hand down her arm... moves closer...

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      I mean, aren t you getting kind of 
                      close to three strikes?                                                                                    13.


      Emma swings the tennis racket out from behind her back!  
      She hits him hard in the face, sending him reeling...  

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      Bitch...   

      He lunges for her, but she swings the racket baseball-
      style, smashing him in the mouth.  He SCREAMS in pain, 
      falling into an end table, knocking over a lamp... plunging 
      the room in darkness.  Travis, bleeding badly, groans in 
      pain... as the door flies open and the officers burst in...

                                        COP
                      Police!  Stop!

      JUMP TO --


                                        EMMA
                      Sutton?  Sutton, you still there?                                                                                    15.


      Sutton paces in the dark pool house.

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah.  Just thinking.

                                        EMMA
                      I know you don t want to spring this on 
                      your adopted family...

                                        SUTTON
                      No, it s okay.  We ll work it out. 
                                (beat)
                      What time does your bus get in?

                                        EMMA
                      Eight-fifty AM.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Okay.  I ll meet you at the station.

      Relief washes over Emma.  A bus COUGHS EXHAUST across the 
      lot.  Her bus.  A nearby TRANSIT OFFICER makes her nervous.

                                        EMMA
                      Gotta go.  

      And Emma mad-dashes for the bus.  

      BACK TO -- Sutton hears the LINE GO DEAD.  Door to the pool 
      house suddenly BURSTS OPEN!  Sutton spins and squints into 
      a BLINDING FLASHLIGHT.  MATCH CUT TO --


      ... BRIGHT SUNLIGHT in Emma s eyes, waking her.  She 
      squints at a passing highway sign:  NOW ENTERING PHOENIX, 
      ARIZONA.  


      Emma steps inside the marble foyer.  A far cry from Vegas.  
      A far cry from anywhere she s lived.  Kristin Mercer -- 
      Sutton s mom -- is passing through with an enormous potted 
      plant.  She can barely see through the thick fronds.

                                        KRISTIN
                      There you are.  Sure got home late last 
                      night.  Then out again first thing this 
                      morning...
                                (teetering suddenly)
                      Whoa...

                                        EMMA
                      Here, I ve got it...

      Emma rescues the pot from Kristin.  Kristin looks at Emma, 
      a little surprised..  Emma looks away nervously.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      Where should I put it?                                                                                    21.


                                        KRISTIN
                      Living room, where it always goes.  
                      Thank you, Sutton.

      Emma descends a pair of steps into the living room.  A 
      matching pot is her best clue as to where to put this pot.  

      Laurel is lying on a couch in a window nook, skimming a 
      teen rag on her ipad.  

                                        EMMA
                              (to Kristin)
                      Sorry about this morning.  I had some 
                      stuff to do.

                                        LAUREL
                      What -- pawning Grandma s necklace?

      This is the first time Emma sees her  sister,  Laurel.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Sutton?  Oh my God, where is it?  I 
                      don t think I ve ever seen you without 
                      it.

      Emma s hand instinctively goes to her throat.

                                        LAUREL
                      Luke probably took it off last night, 
                      so he could give you a proper  welcome 
                      home hickey.   By the way, Mads asked 
                      me to swim with you guys.  She can t 
                      wait to see our new bikinis.  Don t 
                      suppose I can have a ride.

      Laurel is expecting a summary  no,  shocked when --

                                        EMMA
                      Sure, I guess.

                                        LAUREL
                      Cool.

                                        EMMA
                              (to Kristin)
                      Look, I m sure I ll find the necklace.

                                        KRISTIN
                      I hope so.  Something ever happens to 
                      it, your grandmother will be 
                      devastated.  

                                        TED
                      And we d never hear the end of it.                                                                                    22.


      Ted Mercer, Sutton s dad, is coming through, on his way to 
      the golf course.  Emma takes a long look at Ted as he 
      collects his keys.

                                        TED (CONT D)
                      Anyone going by the dry cleaner s?  
                      I ve got a bag of shirts from the trip.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Might have to wait till Monday.  Unless 
                      Sutton... on your way...

      Kristin is anticipating rejection, but instead gets --

                                        EMMA
                      Sure.  No problem.

                                        LAUREL
                      Oh my God.  That s twice.   Sutton 
                      pitching in. 

                                        KRISTIN
                      Laurel... leave her alone...

      Emma meets Kristin s warm smile with a smile of her own.  
      She instantly likes this woman -- the mother she might have 
      had.

                                        EMMA
                      Is there... anything else I can do?

      Ted puts down the mail he s been going through.

                                        TED
                      Okay, that s it.  Who are you and what 
                      have you done with my daughter?

      Emma s jaw goes slack, but everyone s CHUCKLE overtakes her 
      panic, and she opts just to smile along.


      ... Emma closes the door behind her, leans her head back 
      against the Lady Gaga poster hanging there.  When she opens 
      her eyes, she takes in Sutton s room, remembering it from 
      the webcam tour.  Sutton s MacBook is on the desk.  Emma 
      touches it as if it s the Holy Grail.  She opens it, 
      Sutton s Facebook POPPING UP on the SCREEN.  She SCROLLS 
      recent comments...  Swimming at my house.  Don t be late.  
      Wear that bikini.  Emma turns, sees a string bikini on a 
      hangar by the closet.  She holds it up to herself in the 
      mirror.  Gulps.  Timid KNOCK at the door, then Kristin, 
      watering can in hand, nervously enters.                                                                                    23.


                                        KRISTIN
                      They barely watered while we were away.  
                      Okay if I get yours?

                                        EMMA
                      Sure.

      Kristin suddenly turns to Emma.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Last night with Luke, I shouldn t have 
                      pulled him in that way...  I was really 
                      looking forward to us having our girls-
                        night-out...  This summer, I was so 
                      hoping you and I could get back what 
                      we d lost...  Maybe now that we re 
                      home...   

                                        EMMA
                      I ll go...

      Emma realizes she s straying from Sutton s playbook --

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      I mean, if it means that much to you...

                                        KRISTIN
                      Everything.  It means everything.

      Emma nods, smiles.  Kristin s eyes grow misty.  Laurel, in 
      a cover-up, bursts in.

                                        LAUREL
                      We better get going.  If you re still 
                      taking me...

      Emma turns back to Kristin.  Kristin smiles, waves her off.

                                        KRISTIN
                      Go.  Have a good time.  

      JUMP TO --


      Emma, alone, steps into the coldly modern house from the 
      patio.  Very masculine environs.  She heads for where she 
      thinks the bathroom might be.                                                                                      28.


        HALLWAY/THAYER S ROOM

      Emma, on her way to the bathroom, pauses at an open door.  
      A bedroom.  A boy s bedroom.  Thayer s bedroom.  PHOTOS 
      cover his ego wall.  Champion Little League player, high 
      school track team.  Trophies and certificates and a 
      bulletin board of SNAPSHOTS.  His hair is longer, wavy... 
      very different from Luke s...  A SHOT of Sutton and Thayer 
      seems to capture Emma s attention.  From the doorway, the 
      smooth VOICE of ALEC VEGA, 44, Mads and Thayer s divorced 
      dad --

                                        ALEC (O.S.)
                      Been over two months...

      Emma turns to this brooding, but handsome divorced man.  
      There s a sheen to his ivory locks.

                                        ALEC (CONT D)
                      ... Feels like he was just here.

      Emma nods, silent as Alec moves around the room.

                                        ALEC (CONT D)
                      You were like a second sister to him, 
                      Sutton.

                                        EMMA
                      I don t know about that.

                                        ALEC
                      I do.
                                (then)
                      When he left, he said he d call.  He 
                      calls Madeline, but not me.  Does he 
                      call you, Sutton?  

                                        EMMA
                      A few times.  When I was away.  He 
                      seemed okay. 

      Alec stares at her.   

                                        ALEC
                      Sutton, why do I feel like you re not 
                      telling the truth?

                                        EMMA
                      I don t know... I...

      Mads is suddenly bolting into the room.

                                        MADS
                      Hey -- what s going on?                                                                                    29.


                                        ALEC
                      Just what I was wondering.  

      As a volley of looks pass between Mads, Alec, and Emma...  


      ... Emma locks the bathroom door once she s inside.  
      There s a small window LOOKING OUT on the backyard.  

      Emma can SEE into the patio area where Mads, Char, Laurel, 
      Luke, Nisha, and now GARRETT MATHEWS, 17, are gathered.  
      Garrett has that edgy  bad boy  vibe, a healthy dose of 
       urban  in the  suburban.  

      OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

      ... Luke and Garrett are faced off.  

                                        LUKE
                      Just go.  No one wants you here.

                                        GARRETT
                      Is this your house... your party?  

                                        MADS
                      Guys, come on...  Garrett, you really 
                      need to go...  Sutton doesn t want to

                      Yeah, we do.

      Garrett gives them a look, nods darkly, then starts off...

      INSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ... Emma watches as Garrett stops at the gate.  He looks 
      back toward the house and Emma could swear he s looking 
      right at her.

      Laurel is painting her nails on the bed, while Emma stares 
      at Sutton s computer SCREEN... one fuzzy PHOTO of Garrett 
      taken the year before...                                                                                    30.

                      like those homeless dudes in the park.  

      Emma shuts off the computer, gazes at the wall.

                                        EMMA
                      Have Mom and Dad ever talked about my

       Emma stares at her a moment, ingesting this information.

                                        EMMA
                      I just think... our parents aren t 
                      telling us everything.

      Laurel swings her finished toes and feet off the bed.

      Laurel frog-walks toward the door...                                                                                    31.

      Emma quickly hangs up, stares at the blank computer screen.  
      Suddenly -- in the computer screen s REFLECTION -- she SEES 
      someone in the window behind her!  Emma SCREAMS!

                      Hey.  I m allowed to change my mind -- 
                      I m a teenager.

      Ted smiles.  Emma smiles back.

      The irony lingers -- as well as the moment -- as Ted starts 
      to the door, turns back --

                      So am I too old... now?

      Ted smiles and crosses back to embrace her warmly.  Emma 
      closes her eyes against his broad shoulder, makes sure he 
      doesn t see the tear in her eye when they part.

      Ted goes out into --

      A little stunned, Ted looks back at the closed door...                                                                                     34.



      THUNK!  A pillow hits Emma.  She rolls over, the FACE in 
      front of her COMING INTO FOCUS -- it s Laurel in her 
      cheerleader outfit.

                      be dying to see what Sutton Mercer is 
                      wearing.   Little curious, myself.  
                      Better hurry.

      Laurel bolts out of the room.  Emma jumps up, throws open 
      the closet, gazes on rack upon rack of trendy threads.    

                                        EMMA
                      You said this would be fun, Sutton...
                                (slowly smiles)
                      And it finally is.

      She dives into the closet...


      Emma makes her grand entrance, and everyone -- Laurel, Ted 
      and Kristin -- turn.  Emma looks very, very Sutton.

                      teeth.

      Laurel ducks out.  Emma, meanwhile, pauses by a small 
      gallery of family photos on a shelf in the breakfast nook.  
      Exotic vacations.  Elaborate birthday celebrations.  All 
      the fun Sutton experienced -- and Emma didn t.  Emma lifts 
      a photo of Kristin holding Sutton as a baby.  Kristen 
      appears at her side, looks over her shoulder.

                      Very defiant.  I used to hold you and 
                      stare into those big eyes and wonder...

      Kristin trails off.  Emma can tell she wants to say more.

                                        EMMA
                      So I don t know if I ve ever asked you 
                      this, but did you guys want just one 
                      kid, or two?  

      Kristin, taken aback, looks at who she thinks is Sutton.

                                        KRISTIN
                      I don t...

                      baby seemed like all we could handle. 

      Ted glances up from his paper during the ensuing silence.  
      Kristin is suddenly misty-eyed.

                                        EMMA

      Kristin waves a hand and hurries out of the room.  Ted 
      gives Emma an uneasy smile.

                      This, I didn t want anyone to see.

      And Luke kisses Emma passionately on the lips.  When they 
      part --

                                        LUKE (CONT D)
                      With all that s been going on, I 
                      haven t been able to say what I ve 
                      wanted to say for two days...
                                (then)
                      Welcome home, Sutton.

                                        EMMA
                      Thanks.

      And they kiss again.                                                                                      41.


                                        LUKE
                      It s really weird, but I keep thinking 
                      there s something you re not telling 
                      me.

      Emma looks away for a second.  When she looks back, she s 
      fully Sutton again --

                                        EMMA
                      Actually, there s something you can 
                      tell me...  How the hell I m going to 
                      survive against Nisha today?

                                        LUKE
                      Stay clear of her drop shot...  and 
                      don t forget -- you re better than you 
                      think you are.

      Off Emma s growing feelings for this prince she knows 
      she ll soon have to give up...


      ... START CLOSE on the PHOTO of Thayer, on the deck of the 
      lake house.  Emma puts the photo aside.

                                        EMMA
                      What s the point -- ten PM, it s all 
                      over.

      Laurel, dressed up, is at the desk, putting on make-up.

                                        LAUREL
                      What happens at ten PM?  Is this a 
                      Cinderella thing? 

      Emma stares at Laurel for a long moment, then --

                                        EMMA
                      I should just tell you...

                                        LAUREL
                      Tell me what?

      Char and Mads suddenly scramble in through the slider, 
        interrupting --

                                        CHAR
                      You re not dressed!  Don t say you re 
                      not going.  All of Scottsdale High 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    46.

                                        CHAR (CONT'D)
                      knows you kicked Nisha s ass.  They 
                      want to see the fireworks.

                                        LAUREL
                      Wait.  Sounds like she s got some place 
                      else to be...

      Char has thrown open the closet, rummaging for something 
       Sutton  can wear.  

                                        CHAR
                      What is wrong with you guys?   So what 
                      if it s Nisha-Lucretia, it s still a 
                      party.    

      Emma studies Char and Mads.  Soon the real Sutton will be 
      back and everything will change.

                                        EMMA
                      You guys are amazing, you know that?  

      In Emma s whole life, she s never had friends like these.

                                        CHAR
                      You re really scaring me, Sutton.  Now 
                      get changed, so we can go.

                                        EMMA
                      You guys pick something for me.  You 
                      know more about what s in that closet 
                      than I do.

      Char has spotted a garment bag to the side.  

                                        CHAR
                      New stuff!  Perfect!  


      The front door CREAKS open.  Emma steps into this deserted 
      rental, tries a light switch.  Nothing.    

                                        EMMA
                      Sutton?  Are you here?

      No answer.  She walks further into the house, her only 
      light source the MOONLIGHT in a window.  There s a living 
      room... dining area.  The back of the house beckons next. 

      INTERCUT -- a SEDAN, headlights off, rolls in next to 
      Emma s BMW.

      IN A BACK BEDROOM -- Emma stops when she notices a little 
      SPARKLE on the floor.  She bends down, finds a necklace -- 
      apparently the one Sutton lost.                                                                                      53.


      INTERCUT -- mysterious, dark FEET start up the porch steps.

      IN THE BACK BEDROOM -- Emma hears a faint CREAK.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      Sutton?!

      She pockets the necklace, runs back to --

      LIVING ROOM - Emma stops in her tracks.  A FLASHLIGHT S in 
      her eyes.  A second later, it snaps off.  It s Garrett 
      again.  

                                        GARRETT
                      So you ready to tell me who you are, 
                      where you ve come from, and what the 
                      hell you ve done with Sutton?

      Emma, nervous, stays silent...

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      ... Fine.  If you want, I can go to 
                      Sutton s parents.  Or my father... the 
                      cop?  

                                        EMMA
                      Okay!  All right...
                              (deep breath)
                      I m not Sutton.  I m her twin sister.  
                      My name is Emma.  Emma Becker.  
                                (exhales)
                      God, you have no idea how many times in 
                      the last two days I ve wanted to say 
                      that.  We switched places... when I got 
                      here...
                                (then)
                      Look, Sutton will be here any second.  
                      This was where we agreed to meet.  Ten 
                      o clock.   I ll let her explain.  

      Garrett still regards her with a healthy dose of suspicion.

                                        GARRETT
                      Man.  Two whole days.  You fooled 
                      everyone.

                                        EMMA
                      Except you.

                                        GARRETT
                      Sometimes all it takes is a kiss.
                                (studies her)
                      So you haven t answered my questions.  
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                        GARRETT (CONT'D)
                      Starting with -- where did you come 
                      from?

                                        EMMA
                        Unfortunately a place I can t go back 
                      to.

      TIME CUT --


      Mads  father, Alec Vega, is washing his hands in the sink.  
      Mads comes in through the back door, home from the party.  
      Alec -- perspiring -- is dressed in dark clothes.  

                                        MADS
                      Hi, Dad.  I know it s late...  I was at 
                      a party.

                                        ALEC
                      Have any fun?

                                        MADS
                      Not really.  Way too much drama.

                                        ALEC
                      Thought you liked that stuff.  Good 
                      fodder for that big novel you re going 
                      to write some day.

      There s just a little bit of ridicule in Alec s voice.

                                        MADS
                      I guess...
                                (then)
                      It s weird -- I keep expecting Thayer 
                      to show up.  Today at school.  Tonight 
                      at the party.  Remember how he d shoot 
                      baskets out there... sometimes till two 
                      in the morning. 

      Alec looks out through the kitchen window.  The garage 
      backboard and basket stand idle in a flood light.                                                                                    56.


                                        ALEC
                      I don t really want to talk about that 
                      right now.
                                (then)
                      Go to bed, Madeline.  You have school 
                      tomorrow.

      HALLWAY AND THAYER S ROOM

      Mads pauses by the open door to Thayer s room, looks in on 
      his things.  A haunting, moonlit glow to the place.  Her 
      cell TONES.  Mads quickly answers --

                                        MADS
                      Sutton?

                                        KRISTIN (O.C.)
                                (filtered, on phone)
                      Madeline?  Thank God you picked up...  
                      It s Kristin...  I need to know the 
                      last time you saw Sutton...


      Emma lifts the phone off the car seat, checks the screen.

                                        EMMA
                      Seven missed calls.

      As Emma scrolls them --

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton in there?

                                        EMMA
                      Everyone but.  

      STRANGER S P.O.V. -- FROM A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY

      ... SOMEONE is hiding in some brush, watching as Emma says 
      something to Garrett, jumps into the BMW, and drives off. 
      As the P.O.V. focuses on Garrett watching after her...                                                                                    58.



      Sgt. Dan Mathews, Garrett s father, is talking to Kristin 
      and Ted in hushed tones.  Mads and Laurel look on.  Another 
      pair of cops are moving through with evidence kits.  

                                        TED
                      ... Alarm company said it went off at 
                      exactly ten-fifteen.  

      A familiar voice from the open front door causes them all 
      to turn --

                                        EMMA
                      What s going on?

                                        KRISTIN
                      Oh thank God...

      Kristin runs to Emma, pulling her into an embrace.

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      We d worried they d taken you...

                                        EMMA
                      Taken...?

                                        TED
                      Someone broke into the house... into 
                      your room...

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      Would you know if anything s missing?

      JUMP TO --


      START on the ransacked bedroom.  WHIP BACK to Emma as she 
      walks in, her parents, Mathews and Mads and Laurel right 
      behind.  Laurel and Mads linger in the doorway.

                                        LAUREL
                      I got home first.  The alarm was going 
                      off.

      There s glass from the broken slider on the floor...

                                        TED
                      We think maybe Laurel scared them away.

      Emma stops over the desk, turns to them.                                                                                    59.


                                        EMMA
                      My laptop s gone.

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      You didn t have it with you?

      She looks at them.  She s close to telling them who she 
      really is...

                                        EMMA
                      No...  I didn t...

                                        DAN MATHEWS
                      According to Madeline Vega and Laurel, 
                      you left the party early.  Where were 
                      you, Sutton?

      Emma still hesitates...  Kristin crosses to her, takes her 
      in her arms, and holds her closely.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      ... I don t care where you were.  It 
                      doesn t matter.  So long as you re 
                      safe.
                                (holds her at arm s 
                                length)
                      Sutton, I... I m sorry about before...  
                      From now on, nothing but the truth.  I
