      ... And we re SOARING over rolling hills, proverbial Irish 
      Heather, as we super:  Callan, Ireland.   DESCENDING on a 
      FARM, we see a rugged FARMER tending to goats and chickens.  
      The image is a portrait of peace and stillness... and THEN: 

      An MH-60 BLACKHAWK RIPS IT TO SHREDS.  Animals SCATTER as the 
      copter descends, deploying MEN IN TACTICAL GEAR who race 
      toward a FARMHOUSE.  The stunned FARMER tries to process 
      what s happening -- and it HITS HIM:

                                  FARMER
                    Walter -- 



      The armed men lead the boy out the front door:

                                  WALTER
                    Before you lock me in a room, 
                    please tell the shuttle designers 
                    that the shape of the nose cone 
                    tiles create a single point of 
                    failure -- people will die burning 
                    up on re-entry.

      Team Leader doesn t respond as they slow near the chopper, 
      where Walter s parents have been sidelined, as heartbroken as 
      they are furious.  Mom s quietly crying into dad s shoulder.  
      The boy s eyes go down... fear + regret...

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    I... just wanted the blueprints for 
                    my wall.  

      But we see it in his father s face: this was the last straw.  
      Finally, he looks at Team Leader, quietly broken:

                                  FARMER/DAD
                    Don t bother bringing him back.

      HOLD: their last, painful moment as a family, as -- 



      A 14 YEAR-OLD RED-HEAD GIRL appears cresting the hill.  STOPS 
      in shock, sees Walter being strapped into the chopper.  He 
      looks up.  MEETS HER EYES with a small, helpless wave and...

      The girl BREAKS INTO A RUN -- desperate -- too late -- as the 
      chopper RISES INTO THE SKY -- 



      ON A WORN TIRE cruising down the road.  Might still be worth 
      more than the car it s attached to.  Walter drives...

                                  RADIO DJ (OVER RADIO)
                    Okay, for $104.7 dollars... which 
                    month has 28 days?

                                  WALTER
                    All of  em.

                                  CONTESTANT (OVER RADIO)
                    February.

                                  RADIO DJ (OVER RADIO)
                    That s right! You re a winner!

                                  WALTER
                    Idiots.

      Then he hits a BUMP and coffee spills on him.                                                                                        7.


      As he slows to park, we BOOM UP to reveal a run-down, 
      prototypically North Hollywood warehouse on its last legs:



      TIGHT ON Chuck Taylors, SPRINTING, as TOBY BISSEL (30 s, 
      genius behaviorist, can  read  anybody and has fun with it) 
      runs for his life!                                                                                        9.


      20 yards behind a car CHASES, slaloming garbage cans Toby 
        purposefully topples in his wake.  The car screeches to a 
      stop; 2 THUGS jump out as Toby races into... 



      As the thugs SMASH a metal pole they ve pulled from the 
      dumpster into the door, two BLACK SEDANS screech into the 
      alley, skid to a STOP: ND AGENTS exit car #1.  Federal Agent 
      CABE GALLO (45, NY blue collar, no nonsense) exits car #2:

                                  THUG #1
                    Good, cops.  Guy in there owes me 
                    money -- 

                                  CABE
                    Drop it, or I ll put a bag of pills 
                    in your pocket fat enough to get 
                    you a room in Lompoc.  Understand?

      As the thugs RUSH OFF, Cabe slides his badge under the door:

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    Homeland Security.  Open up.



      WHOOSH: a 747 JETLINER rips past camera, cutting clouds --
      CAPTAIN JASON PIKE radios to no avail, growing concern:

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    Still no contact -- 

                                  CO-PILOT
                    At 10,000 feet I might get a 
                    signal.

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    If we descend without comms, we 
                    could run into another plane.  

                                  CO-PILOT
                    Less than 100 minutes of fuel...

      Grave looks, off which the SCREAM OF A SIREN takes us to:



      Two GOVERNMENT SUVs shred down the 405.  In the LEAD VEHICLE, 
      Cabe and Walter up front: Walter s writing some kind of LIST 
      on a pad -- Cabe glances over:

                                  CABE
                    What re you doing?                                                                                    17.


      Walter turns from view and doesn t answer, no trust here.  
      Toby, Happy, Sylvester in the backseat:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    I knew the slogan was a mistake: 
                    this isn t an ordinary problem and 
                    we sure as hell aren t heroes.  
                    These t-shirts are a polyester 
                    blend of lies.

                                  TOBY
                    It s marketing psychology.  Who s 
                    gonna hire someone with the slogan 
                         Nerds-That-Never-Got-Laid-In-High 
                          School-Who-Can-Fix-Your-Router?  

      SUDDENLY: SCREECH!  Everyone LURCHES forward as Cabe BRAKES 
      HARD: UP AHEAD, an OVERTURNED TRUCK.  Unmoving traffic. 

                                  CABE
                    Dammit -- 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Odds of success just fell to 36%.  

                                  HAPPY
                    This is going great so far.

      Cabe steps out in frustration to see if he can move traffic; 
      Walter gets out too, as Toby says:

                                  TOBY
                    Ah, yes, getting 3 feet closer will 
                      definitely help you move that 
                    truck...



      Walter and Cabe in the gridlock -- HORNS BLARING -- YELLING -- 

                                  WALTER
                    You re a Fed, get us a copter -- 

                                  CABE
                    Air traffic s been shut down til 
                    the situation s resolved.

      Sylvester s head PEERS out the window:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    No copter?  Now it s 17%!

      As Cabe heads forward to see what he can do, we go CLOSE ON 
      WALTER as the SYMPHONY OF CHAOS blares around him... and the 
      closer we get, the sound begins to FADE AWAY until it goes...                                                                                    18.


      ... DEAD SILENT.  As before, everything around Walter has 
      SLOWED.  HIS EYES SNAP BACK AND FORTH AT REM SPEED, 
      CALCULATING -- and now, an echo on the wind, he hears:

      A YOUNG GIRL S LAUGHTER.  As we -- FLASHCUT: POV dreamlike -- 
      we re running behind that REDHEAD GIRL from our opening -- 
      chasing her through PURPLE WILDFLOWERS -- she turns to us:

                                    REDHEAD
                    C mon, Walter... catch me!  You can 
                    do it!

      A DOPPLER HORN SMASHES US BACK TO: 

      WALTER ON THE HIGHWAY, his eyes STOP MOVING AT REM.  Somehow, 
      this memory has GALVANIZED HIM -- he knows what to do:

                                  WALTER
                    CABE!
                          (up ahead, Cabe whirls)
                    We need a reliable wireless signal 
                    with no chance of going down -- I 
                    just fixed one a mile West of here.  



      -- Walter -- walking away -- Paige RUSHES OUT:

                                  PAIGE
                    Hey -- 
                          (she GRABS his arm)
                    Hey.  I understand what s going on:
                    You re doing what Ralph does when 
                    he doesn t understand how to fix a 
                    problem, he panics and shuts down -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Do I look panicked to you?

                                  PAIGE
                    Not until you said that.  When you 
                    don t know something, you feel like 
                    you don t know anything, because 
                    Knowing s the only value you have.  
                    But you can do this.

      He just stares, unreadable.  Has she gotten through?  Then:

                                  WALTER
                    Let me explain something to you.
                    Left brain: logic.  Right brain: 
                    emotion.  For all practical 
                    purposes, I have no right brain.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    35.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Emotional speeches,  pep talks  -- 
                    they don t work on me.  They work 
                    on artists, musicians, waitresses -- 
                    people who re satisfied being 
                    underpaid to serve others.  

      Paige literally FLINCHES.  As usual, Walter wasn t trying to 
      insult her; to him it s merely a statement of fact:

                                  PAIGE
                    I get it, I m the dumb waitress. 

                                  WALTER
                    I never called you that.

                                  PAIGE
                    You don t think I wanted to do 
                    something else with my life? 
                    Something my son could be proud of?  
                    But I ll tell you one thing: I m 
                    smart enough to know people almost 
                    never get second chances to make up 
                    for something they should ve done.  
                    And if you let your friends die, 
                    you re gonna wake up with it 
                    everyday for the rest of your life.  
                          (beat)
                    I promise you that.

      ON WALTER.  Paige has no idea how much she just hit the 
      bullseye, but for reasons she couldn t possibly know about:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Come back inside with me, Walter.

      He just stares.  And right when he s about to say  no  --

                                  RALPH (O.S.)
                    It stops and starts.

      RALPH at the back door.  She turns, confused:

                                  PAIGE
                    ... What, Honey?

      He points to a WATER TAP against the wall, drips of WATER 
      coming from the pipe.  CLOSE ON WALTER, as he looks at the 
      water, at the boy... drip... drip... drip... EVERYTHING SLOWS 
      DOWN AROUND HIM, even Paige... BUT NOT RALPH.  They meet 
      eyes.  Walter s again move at REM SPEED as it HITS -- and we:

      SNAP BACK TO SPEED -- Walter s already rushing back into the 
      diner, blowing right past her:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Walter?                                                                                    36.



      Walter SCREECHES to the GATE, flashes Cabe s badge at GUARD:

                                  WALTER
                    Deputy Director Cabe Gallo.  Your 
                    facility might be compromised, I 
                    need immediate access -- 



      UNDERWATER: Happy PULLS on the Belt/Bar fulcrum; the door 
      BUDGES a crack!  She SHOVES IT FULLY OPEN... STRAINING with 
      everything she s got and... WHOOOOOSH!  THEY RE FORCED OUT AT 
      AMAZING VELOCITY!  Happy SLAMS into the wall -- HARD -- 
      PAINFUL -- before we see what happens we SMASH BACK TO:



      The COPS have Walter in CUFFS, are using his walkie:

                                  COP #1
                    Officer Tadych of the LAPD. I have 
                    a Walter O Neil in custody, he has 
                    your badge and says he s on 
                      assignment with you?

                                  CABE
                          (well, not exactly, but)
                    ... Yes.  Call the Federal Building 
                    on Wilshire, they ll confirm this 
                    detail, but do it in transit -- I 
                    need him back here A-SAP.

      The DINER PHONE has started RINGING.  Paige answers in BG:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    It won t matter: we lost our only 
                    chance to save the planes.  At 
                    least a dozen collisions, the 
                    rest ll probably head to the ocean 
                    to avoid ground casualties... 

                                  PAIGE 
                    ... Oh my God!                                                                                    42.


      They all TURN -- Paige is holding up the phone in excitement:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    It s Happy!  They re alive and on 
                    their way back with the software! 

      Off Cabe, WIDE-EYED -- 



      CABE S SUV SCREECHES TO STOP in front, just as an LAPD COP 
      CAR does too.  Toby and Happy leap from the SUV, as Walter 
      emerges from the cop car -- tosses Cabe back his badge:

                                  WALTER
                    You re welcome.

      Before Cabe can respond, Walter heads right past him to Happy 
      and Toby, who holds up the laptop triumphantly...

                                  TOBY 
                    Seats back and tray tables up, 
                      everybody, these planes are as good 
                    as landed! 

      As they ENTER, Walter sees how Happy s carrying her shoulder:

                                  WALTER
                    Your shoulder s dislocated at the 
                      glenohumeral joint. 

                                  HAPPY
                    4 years Varsity Lacrosse, I m good-- 



      TRACKING OVER A BLACK BUGATTI SUPER SPORT, hood up, to reveal 
      HAPPY doing what she does better than anyone on earth -- 
      Toby s plays  nurse  to her  surgeon,  handing her tools, so 
      fast: she strips a wire like a hunter skins a rabbit/ grabs 
      electrical tape/ bites some off/ all in a QUICK CUTS -- she s 
      amazing, brilliant, Toby can t help but be mesmerized...

                                  TOBY
                    Fast hands... delicate, but 
                    strong...

                                  HAPPY
                          (doesn t look up)
                    You do realize you re talking out 
                    loud.

      ... Uh, no.  He didn t.  Now he does.  Swallows embarrassment 
      as CABE TAKES FRAME, walking to Walter, along with the team:

                                  CABE
                    Still a mess to LAX.  Escort s just 
                    gonna get you to the back-up 
                    faster.

                                  WALTER
                    That s why we re going west to 
                    Santa Monica Airport.

                                  CABE
                          (beat: what?)
                    Their runways are too short for a 
                    747.

                                  WALTER
                    We don t need runways.  We re gonna 
                    to do the transfer while the 
                    plane s still in the air, barely 
                    off the runway.                                                                                    46.


                                  CABE
                          (beat: is he kidding?!!)
                    There s a neighborhood next door.  
                    You could take out half a block -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Actually, if we fail, it ll be more 
                    like four blocks. 

      Cabe just STARES -- no choice -- Happy SLAMS down the hood:

                                  HAPPY 
                    She s ready.

                                  WALTER
                    I m gonna need someone shotgun,
                    and before you volunteer, your 
                    shoulder disqualifies you.
                          (to Cabe)
                    The Bugatti window s 22" and your 
                    shoulder span s at least 25", you 
                    won't fit through.

                                  TOBY
                    Guess I m your huckleberry.

                                  WALTER
                    No.  I need you to find an Asian 
                    flight and profile the entire 
                    manifest -- we re looking for a 
                      daredevil, a maniac, the exact 
                    opposite of Sylvester.

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Hey -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Fine.  Come along.  At 240 mph.

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Hell no. 

                                  HAPPY
                    I can push through it, Walt.

                                  WALTER
                          (a beat, shit)
                    I guess we have no choice.  Get in.

      Happy puts her tools down, but we can see her shoulder s in 
      pain.  Ralph PULLS on Paige s sleeve.  She looks at him: a  
      MOMENT of understanding.  Something in his eyes she almost 
      never experiences.  Ralph nods...

                                  PAIGE 
                    You sure?
                          (Ralph nods again; 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    47.

                                  PAIGE  (CONT'D)
                            then, to Walter)
                    I ll go.

      Everyone turns to Paige.  Walter calculates: her, Ralph -- 

                                  WALTER
                    ... No.  

      Paige walks up to Walter, talks SOTTO so no one else hears:

                                  PAIGE
                    Look... he needs this.

                                  WALTER
                    There are easier ways to bond with 
                    your child.

                                  PAIGE
                    What about your  greater good 
                      analysis?   Isn t saving 10,000 
                    lives worth the risk?  You told me 
                    he won t need me much longer 
                    anyway... til then, the least I can 
                    do is set an example for him.  

      That LANDS on Walter -- she has his full respect.  Finally, 
      he nods.  Paige swallows, kneels in front of Ralph:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Happy s gonna watch you while Mommy 
                    and Walter help the people in the 
                    planes, ok?
                          (as they HUG)
                    I ll be back soon.  I ll be okay.

      Ralph nods.  Paige gets into the car.  The cop cars spin 
      their cherries providing an ESCORT and... Walter PEELS OUT.  
      A beat, Sylvester looks to Ralph:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Odds are high she won t be okay.

      Happy SLAPS Sylvester on the back of the head as CALL IN THE 
      CAVALRY by THE SHYS KICKS IN and we HARD CUT TO:



      The Cavalry -- aka: Walter and Paige.  KICK ASS POLICE ESCORT 
      races through LA streets.  Paige holds on TIGHT, terrified:

                                  PAIGE
                    This thing has airbags, right?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes, but at these speeds they re 
                    useless.                                                                                    48.


      Toby crackles through on the walkie: INTERCUT WITH DINER 
      where the gang hacks away at personal information -- a MAN S 
      DRIVER S LICENSE PHOTO appears:

                                  TOBY
                    Think I got somebody: Duncan 
                    Dupree.  5 foot six, 140 pounds. 
                    Flat feet kept him outta Army 
                    Rangers; couldn t follow dad onto 
                    St. Louis PD due to bad hearing; 
                    suspended in high school for a 
                    fight with the football team -- not 
                    one player -- the whole team.  This 
                    little man has something to prove.

                                  WALTER
                    Perfect.  Contact him.

                                  TOBY
                    How the hell do I do that?!

                                  WALTER
                          (as he s hanging up)
                    You have a 187 IQ, figure it out!

      Paige looks over at Walter, nerves spiking, grips the door:

                                  PAIGE
                    Something I don t get.  Someone ll 
                    email us the software as the 747 
                    flies over?  Won t it be going too 
                    fast to get a wireless signal from 
                    the plane?

                                  WALTER
                    ... No.  Because when it s 30 feet 
                    off the ground, you and I will be 
                    driving directly under it.

      Paige STARES at him: WWHAAAAAAT?!  MUSIC SWELLS and -- 

 END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    49.


                                          ACT FOUR



      THE BUGATTI HITS THE RUNWAY!  Walter pulls on a jerry-rigged 
      cable: THE SHIELD that Happy built POPS UP ON THE HOOD -- 

                                  WALTER
                    NOW!  YOU CAN DO THIS!

      Paige, TERRIFIED, climbs out the window with the laptop, 
      holds it high above her head as...

      THE PLANE ROARS OVER HER, ALMOST CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH!  SHE 
      SCREAMS AS WALTER HOLDS THE CAR STEADY RIGHT BENEATH THE 
      PLANE.  AND NOW, LANDING GEAR LOWERS, TO REVEAL, DEAR GOD... 

      DUNCAN CLINGING TO IT LIKE A BABY KOALA, THE WIRELESS DEVICE 
      DUCT-TAPED TO HIS BODY!  He s wide-eyed and windblown, but 
      gives Paige a stunned wave  hello  as the plane and car 
      streak down the runway, just a few feet apart:



      PAIGE -- one hand CLINGING DESPERATELY to the car, the other 
      clinging to the LAPTOP as... SHE SEES IT RECEIVE THE FILE!  
      COLLAPSES back into the car, Walter SEES the screen --

                                  WALTER
                    CLICK THE FILE THREE TIMES!

      She does... and the e-mail is FORWARDED TO LAX as the landing 
      gear RETRACTS, sucking Duncan back into the plane, which 
      BANKS upward, causing the Bugatti to shake! 

      Walter CUTS the wheel, HITS the air brake -- the Bugatti 
      SKIDS across the runway -- SKIIIIIIIIIIIIDS -- finally, 
      barely coming to... A SAFE STOP.

      BREATHLESS, Walter looks at a disheveled Paige... and says:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    You stayed under the shield.  Well 
                    done.

      With that, Paige PUKES out the window.



      Against the glorious sunset, cop cars everywhere, cherries 
      spinning.  The WHOLE TEAM is being interviewed by Feds, as we 
      find... Cabe, who s been handed four envelopes of CASH from a 
      fellow agent -- turns to WALTER, who s scanning the crowd:

                                  WALTER
                    Where s the waitress?

                                  CABE
                    A cop took her and Ralph home.
                          (a beat)
                    You look disappointed.

                                  WALTER
                          (reveals nothing)
                    I think you have something for me.

      Cabe hands the envelopes to Walter, who checks: $50K each.

                                  CABE
                      Everyone s real happy with your 
                    work today.  So... Deal s a deal.

                                  WALTER
                    I want a share for Paige, that 
                    Duncan guy, and the Thurman kid.                                                                                    57.


      Cabe nods, he ll do that.  Walter turns to go without a word:

                                  CABE
                    Walter.
                          (Walter turns)
                    I m sorry about what happened 
                    between us... back in the day.  I 
                    lied to you.  I thought I was doing 
                    it for the right reason.  

                                  WALTER
                          (it s still a raw wound)
                    We killed people. 

                                  CABE
                    To save tens of thousands more...
                    but I m still sorry.

      Walter stares at Cabe.  Into him:

                                  WALTER
                    I believe you.  I also know the 
                    fact you re apologizing means 
                    you ve realized we re the key to 
                    your future.

      ON CABE, called out.  He nods, okay, here goes... 

                                  CABE
                    I was reassigned here to set up a 
                    new kind of Strategic Response 
                    Team, something game-changing.  
                    See, I can t train average agents 
                    to think like you, you re a 
                    different species.  Problem is, the 
                    bad guys are getting smarter too, 
                    so we have to fight them in a 
                    smarter way: they hit our banks, 
                      electrical grids, hospitals -- we 
                    cover everything from missing kids, 
                    to stolen nukes.  You d have the 
                    full resources and backing of the 
                    U.S. Government, clearance at the 
                    NSA, DOD -- 

                                  WALTER
                    This conversation s oddly familiar.

                                  CABE
                    Look... I didn't have as much 
                    autonomy then to keep my promises.  
                    I do now.  
                          (beat)
                    We can make a real difference, 
                    Walter... but I can t do it alone.  
                    And from what I know about you and 
                    your buddies, you can t either.                                                                                    58.


      Walter looks across the tarmac at his team, protectively:

                                  WALTER
                    Failure is not an option for people 
                    like us... if they aren t 
                      protected, they ll beat themselves 
                    up inside until they break.  

                                  CABE
                    They re beating themselves up 
                    already: What s their purpose?  Why 
                    were they given their gifts and put 
                    on this planet?  What I m offering 
                    you all... is the answer.

                                  WALTER
                    Very dramatic.

                                  CABE
                          (sincerely)
                    ... I m trying here, Walter.

      Walter stares.  And then, reaches into his pocket, pulls out 
      his NOTEPAD.  Tears off a PAGE with HANDWRITTEN SCRAWL.  
      Hands it to Cabe, who reads, confused...

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    Fixed salaries, cars, a research 
                    Lab, full control over your hires,
                    and a yearly government grant to 
                    fund your...
                          (is he reading this 
                            right?)
                    ...  Immortality Project? 
                          (looks up)
                     When did you write this?

                                  WALTER
                    In the car after we left the 
                      warehouse.  You asked me what I was 
                    doing.

      ON CABE.  Stunned, can t help but CHUCKLE a little...

                                  CABE
                    You knew I d offer you a job...

                                  WALTER
                    Your badge said  Homeland Security 
                    Strategic Initiatives Division,  
                    that's a hell of a promotion, the 
                    kind that forces you to prove 
                    yourself quickly if you wanna keep 
                    it.  I assumed if we survived 
                    today... you d see we would be the 
                      "strategy."                                                                                     59.


                                  CABE
                          (heartened)
                    So... you trust me?

                                  WALTER
                      Absolutely not... but I don t need 
                    trust, I have leverage: this time 
                    your career depends on us.  You 
                    can t hurt me without hurting 
                    yourself, and you aren t dumb 
                    enough to hurt my friends, since 
                    you d end up the sole focus of my 
                      retaliation... and we all know how 
                    that goes. 

      Damn.  Rockstar.  And to our surprise, WALTER offers his hand 
      first.  A beat, then Cabe SHAKES.  As...

                                  CABE
                     Failure is not an option... 
                          (beat)
                    Has a ring to it.

      And Cabe rejoins his squad, as HAPPY, TOBY, and SYLVESTER 
      rejoin Walter.  A beat, Toby takes one look, and...

                                  TOBY
                    Your lips are parted and you re 
                    leaning slightly forward, 
                      primordial signs of desired 
                      communication.
                          (beat)
                    You have something to tell us.

      Off Walter s slight GRIN -- 



      VROOOM: The BUGATTI screeches to a stop.  Walter exits his 
      NEW CAR, admires it, then hurries into... 



      PAIGE, opening the door to her small, Deep Valley apartment:

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Walter?                                                                                    62.


                                  WALTER
                    Hi.  Um, sorry for coming by late-- 
                    I just wanted to... apologize for 
                    offending you today.  Twice.  That 
                    wasn t... decent.

        A vulnerability in him she hasn t seen.

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Thank you.  It s ok.

                                  WALTER
                    I also want to offer you a job.
                          (off her SURPRISE)
                      Government-funded problem solvers.  
                    You said you wished you could do 
                    something else with your life.  
                    Something greater.  Now you can. 

      Paige is stunned... trying to understand...

                                  PAIGE
                    ... why?  I m-- I m not a genius...

                                  WALTER
                    But you re raising one.  You know 
                    what to say when we re misbehaving, 
                    or upset.  Or scared.  The work 
                    we ll do requires interaction with 
                    the world.  With people.  Not our 
                    strong suit.
                          (beat)
                    We need an interpreter.  
                          (hands her a paper)
                    Salary plus benefits. 
                          (she reads amount, even 
                            more stunned)
                    Getting in that car wasn t your 
                    second chance... this is. 

      She looks at him, overwhelmed.  And in this moment, READS 
      HIM.  Her gift.

                                  PAIGE
                    ... for you, too?

      Walter looks down.  This is a story he tells almost no one.  
      It s awkward for him.  Unusual.  We PUSH IN ON HIM, for:

                                  WALTER
                    When I was 16, my Hacker name was 
                       Scorpion.   I chose it because a 
                      Scorpion s a docile creature by 
                    nature... but if it s pushed too 
                    far, it stings.

      She nods gently, yeah.  This next part s harder...                                                                                    63.


                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Knowing I had that kind of power 
                    made me overconfident... so when 
                    Cabe came and asked me to develop 
                    tracking software to drop first aid 
                    packages to soldiers behind enemy 
                    lines, I did.
                          (beat)
                    One day I turned on the news and 
                    saw the live feeds of us dropping 
                    bombs on Baghdad... they were using 
                    my system to kill people.
                          (on Paige, STRUCK)
                    I d designed it for speed over 
                      accuracy... so 8% of the bombs were 
                      off-target by 100 yards.  Which 
                    means... over two thousand 
                    civilians died needlessly in 
                      hospitals, shopping malls... a 
                      kindergarten school... 

      ON PAIGE, eyes welling.  Heartbroken for him.  So softly... 

                                  PAIGE
                    You were... just a kid.

      He nods.  Right now, he looks like one.  Then...

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    You know... I helped Ralph with a 
                    report on arachnids once?  There s 
                    another thing about scorpions...
                          (beat)
                    They re incredibly loyal to their 
                    family.  

      Walter can t quite meet her eyes.  And offers, gently...

                                  WALTER
                    If you don t want to fail your son, 
                    tell him to ignore any sentence 
                    that starts with  Normally.   Don t 
                    ever let him be scared of what he s 
                    capable of.  And it ll be hard for 
                    him to make friends.  Sometimes 
                    it ll feel like nobody in the world 
                    likes him.  Make sure he knows it 
                    isn t his fault... the word Prodigy 
                    comes from the Latin prodigium, a 
                    monster that violates the natural 
                    order.  You ll need to protect him.

                                  PAIGE
                    From who?

                                  WALTER
                    From everyone who isn t like him... 
                    and from himself.                                                                                     64.


      Just then, RALPH walks by in the background, smiles/waves:  

                                  RALPH
                    Hi, Walter.

      Paige... is STUNNED.  Turns back to Walter, GRATEFUL... 

                                  PAIGE
                    He s never smiled or waved at 
                    anyone before.  Ever.

                                  WALTER
                          (simply)
                    He recognizes one of his own. 

      Ralph puts on a video game, subtly pushes a controller across 
      the floor beside him -- an invitation. 

      Walter looks to Paige.  She nods.  Walter enters, gently sits 
      next to Ralph.  As they play...

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Can you pause your dreams, Ralph?

                                  RALPH
                    Yeah.

                                  WALTER
                    Ever rewind them?

                                  RALPH
                      Sometimes.

                                  WALTER
                    ... yeah.  Me too.

      During this, we ve been PUSHING IN ON PAIGE, watching, eyes 
      wet, feeling happier than she s felt since her son s birth: 
      he s finally made a connection to another living soul. 

      She smiles, a smile like a lamp turning on.  Walter turns 
      back to look at her, and she NODS: telling him nothing on 
      earth could stop her from taking that job.  

      As MUSIC RISES:
