We float down through a serene, leafy park to the
children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL
FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.
GIGI (V.O.)
I have a theory about how this all
started...
A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little
girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.
And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE
LITTLE GIRL DOWN.
LITTLE GIRL
Why did you do that?
LITTLE BOY
Because you smell like dog poo.
Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-
liner. Our little girl's face turns red.
LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
You're so stupid just like dog poo!
You're made of poo!
And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,
smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN weaves BANANA LEAVES with a FRIEND.
FRIEND (SUBTITLE)
I'm sure he forgot your hut number.
Or
didn't get enough approval from his
father. Or was eaten by a giraffe.
This last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman.
GIGI (V.O.)
Why do we say this stuff to each other?
Why do we tell each other these lies?

GIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Is it possible that it's because we're
too scared, and it's too hard, to say the
one obvious truth that's staring everyone
in the face?
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
AND THEN THE TITLE FADES UP:
HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU...
Gigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant.
GIGI
Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
CONOR
Yeah.
It was really nice meeting you.
GIGI
B-bye.
Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling.
She turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL
PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET.
Gigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials.
GIGI (CONT'D)
Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it
went well.
She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor.
GIGI (CONT'D)
And I think he might me leaving me a
message at home as - we - speak.

6.
We FREEZE FRAME ON GIGI, mid-step.
Then, THE IMAGE
SLIDES OVER TO FIND:
CONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME. The image UNFREEZES and we
continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE.
CONOR
Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know
that I was thinking about you.
We TILT up to find Anna and Ben. Anna looks at her
phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse.
ANNA
Sorry.
What was I saying?
BEN
I think you were telling me how you don't
want to be like your mom and wake up and
realize you didn't pursue your dreams.

7/20/7
10.
Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.
She takes one
and laughs, a bit embarrassed.
ANNA
Was I? Little intense for grocery store
chatter. Sorry.
BEN
It's OK. I might even be able to help
you out. There's a guy at my firm who
has exclusively music clients.
ANNA
That would be - amazing.
What are you -
like my savior?
Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper.
She writes down her number, and holds it out to him. He
looks at it, contemplating. He doesn't take it.
BEN
OK. Look.
I'm married.
I don't do
this.
ANNA
Don't do what? Help struggling singers?
BEN
Help hot Pilates instructing singers who
happen to be very charming.
Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away.
ANNA
Do you want to give me your card? That's
legit. I bet you're allowed to do that.
Ben considers this.
BEN
Right.
OK.
I guess that would be OK.
FROM INSIDE A CAR PARKED AT THE STORE:
We see Anna and Ben talking.
They shake hands awkwardly
and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.
A brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood -
clearly under massive renovation.
Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.

7/20/7
37.
CONOR
Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend.
Or whatever.
MARY
Hey.
So, did you see it?
CONOR
I'm not sure about this.
MARY
You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning
market. You're gonna make a fortune.
Conor looks at the paper.
CONOR
Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you
have to put me on the page with the
massage ads?
MARY
It was either that or on the page with
the personals. I made a call.
CONOR
OK. You're right.
Hey, have you talked
to Anna lately?
Conor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still
on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN.
UNDER VARIOUS 1 INCH ADS FOR MASSEUSES, S&M; and LEATHER
TYPE SERVICES - THERE'S A HALF PAGE AD UNDER THE TITLE:
THE HOME FOR YOUR LIFESTYLE - CONOR BARRY - REAL ESTATE
Under which is a picture of Conor, standing in front of a
brick Tudor, a SOLD SIGN proudly displayed. In the
background - TWO MEN look lovingly at their new home.
There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps.
Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge,
next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY.
CIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS.
She stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside.
CLOSE ON:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE.
As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna
and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny
backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.
As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna
grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.
MAYA
Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me
anything.
ANNA
Mom - you always say that and I always
get you something.
Maya takes a BIG SIP OF WINE (not her first) as she tears
open the gift, which is clearly a RECORD ALBUM.
MAYA
You didn't.
ANNA
It's no big deal.
CONOR
What is it?
Maya shows him the album - TIM BUCKLEY'S STARSAILOR.
CONOR (CONT'D)
Tim Buckley.
Nice.
MAYA
Here - put on my favorite.
Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim
Buckley?
CONOR
No.
She did not.
44
7/20/7
45.
"Song to the Siren" plays as Anna returns to the table.
MAYA
We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell's
Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But
he had this big mop of hair and these
eyes that just looked past you and
through you and into you all at the same
time. Complete interest and disinterest.
It was amazing.
Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Of course, I was with Anna's father at
the time, so, you know...another
opportunity missed.
ANNA
Mom, please -
MAYA
It's the truth. I knew them all. Robert
Plant, Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons...
(to Conor)
Have you seen the pictures of me from
when I was Anna's age?
CONOR
Umm - I don't think so -
MAYA
Sweetie go get that picture - you know
the one -
Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Go. Your mother's asking you to do
something for her on her birthday.
Anna goes inside.
Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.
MAYA (CONT'D)
You'll see - we look strikingly similar.
My lips may be a bit fuller, but...
She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns
with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.
INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white -
somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.
45
7/20/7
46.
CONOR
Wow.
That's - unbelievable.
MAYA
So that's what we're dealing with here,
for reference. Imagine meeting someone
who looks like that in a coffee shop.
Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.
CONOR
That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I
kinda did. Anna and I met at a
restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not
a coffee shop, but...still -
He looks from Maya to Anna.
Maya stands up.
MAYA
That's sweet. But if we're comparing
stories -
(indicating with her glass)
She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley.
With that, Maya heads inside.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Anyone need a refill?
Anna looks to Conor apologetically.
He just smiles.
Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment.
ANNA
Thanks again for coming with me.
You
make it so much easier.
CONOR
Are you kidding? I like your mom.
She's
cool.
ANNA
Yeah, well - cool's not always what
you're looking for in a mom.
Conor smiles, understanding.
CONOR
So, you want another -- foot rub?
He's trying.
But it's awkward.
46
7/20/7
47.
ANNA
Ugh. I'm just beat. I wanna put on
sweats and get in bed.
CONOR
I'd be into that.
Anna gives him a smile, opens her front door.
ANNA
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
She gives him a KISS, and goes inside.
FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:...IF HE/SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU
TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his
Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard -
- goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc.
TRENT
If a girl is into you, she's sleeping
with you. And if after a month - two
months at the very outside - she's not
sleeping with you, she does not like you.
I guess the trick is, how to spot this
girl early - so you don't waste the one
to seven weeks waiting to find out that
it's never gonna happen. So, I've got
some signs about how to spot this girl -
gleaned from my own experience, of
course. A girl will never sleep with you
if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,
she pops a zit in front of you, her name
is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump
in your bathroom or she takes home
leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not
scientific - but I'm just saying - you
were warned.
Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands,
unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat.
NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.
NEIL
Ah.
My first visitor.
BEN
This boat is sick. How come you never
invited me out before?
NEIL
Well, this was supposed to be just for
Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave
our jobs. Sell the house. Take off.
54
7/20/7
55.
Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know
what to say. They're silent for a second.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission
to board granted. I'll show you around.
Ben smiles, steps on to the boat.
CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil
smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out
into the bay.
Ben stands across from him, looking on.
NEIL
(re: cigarette)
Sorry.
BEN
It's OK.
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.
NEIL
So Janine sent you to check on me?
BEN
Yeah.
Pretty much.
NEIL
Any message from Beth?
Ben shakes his head no.
Neil seems disappointed.
BEN
I think she's been busy getting ready for
her sister's funeral though, so...
NEIL
Her sister's what?
BEN
Wedding.
Her sister's wedding.
What did
I say?
Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.
NEIL
You said funeral.
BEN
No, I didn't. Shit, did I?
55
7/20/7
56.
Neil LAUGHS HARDER.
Even Ben sees the humor.
NEIL
The marriage thing is weird, man. I
never thought Beth would give me an
ultimatum.
BEN
Really?
Why not?
That's what women do.
NEIL
Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got
you to bite the bullet.
BEN
Yup.
Neil looks at Ben, curious.
NEIL
Do you regret it?
BEN
No.
NEIL
So you're happy? You'd say you're
happily married?
Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.
BEN
I love Janine.
Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.
The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the-
century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just
begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.
Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with
her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her
husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.
Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort
- BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow
tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy -
who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.
Janine pulls up in her Land Rover and gets out. As she
approaches the house, she stops in her tracks. ALL THE
SCAFFOLDING IS GONE. THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. She
whips out her cell phone and dials.
JANINE
Javier - does this mean what I think it
means? So when you say "done" - you
don't mean "we still need plumbing in the
upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done
done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll
call when I see it...Bye.
She hangs up the phone, steels herself, and walks inside.
CLOSE ON:
A LIT CIGARETTE.
A LONG DRAG IS TAKEN.
104
7/20/7
105.
CUT WIDE TO REVEAL: Ben sitting on a ledge in front of
the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby.
He's clearly waiting for Anna to arrive.
His PHONE RINGS. He looks at it - JANINE CALLING. He
IGNORES the call, takes another drag of his cigarette.
Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row
house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside.
ANNA
You seriously get a ton of people bidding
on this?
CONOR
I know it's crazy. But it's a
neighborhood "in transition."
ANNA
So that means what - that hip gay people
want to live out here?
CONOR
Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples,
young families.
Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house.
Your standard waterfront seafood restaurant. Gigi sits
across from BILL, nice looking, if a bit conservative.
GIGI
So, Alex told me you work in finance.
110
7/20/7
111.
BILL
Yes.
Yes, I do. Finance.
A LONG PAUSE.
GIGI
This is nice.
BILL
It is.
GIGI
A nice evening. And you planned it. And
called me when you said you would. And
showed up on time. Thank you, Bill.
BILL
You're very welcome.
ANOTHER AWKWARD LONG SILENCE.
Gigi smiles.
A staple of summer in Baltimore.
The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very
phallic "blade" with a A BUNCH OF YOUNG SHIRTLESS MEN
dancing and waving. Mary rides the float, too, waving to
the crowd with Nathan, Joshua and Bruce.
Conor, with a NATTILY DRESSED GAY COUPLE, stands on the
street watching. Nathan calls down from the float.
NATHAN
Jonathan?
NATTILY DRESSED GAY
What are you guys doing up there?
NATHAN
Dancing.
Get your asses up here.
With that, the two Nattily Dressed Gays grab Conor, and
climb up onto the float. They SHOUT over the music.
115
7/20/7
116.
NATTILY DRESSED GAY
This is Conor. He just sold us on the
most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.
MARY
Hey, Conor.
I'm Mary.
Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men
around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.
MARY (CONT'D)
It's so great to finally meet you in
person.
CONOR
You, too.
They look at each other.
Is there a connection?
CONOR (CONT'D)
Would you like to dance?
MARY
I'd love to.
Conor takes her hand - and the two of them do an old
fashioned slow dance on the float. As everyone freaks
around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.
Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.
As he heads to the stairs, he stops in his tracks. At
the bottom of the stairs - ALL OF HIS CLOTHES are
stacked, neatly folded into piles. He approaches, then
sees a CARTON OF CIGARETTES on top of one pile -
BEN
Shit...
- and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF
OUT. - JANINE P.S. I WANT A DIVORCE.
Ben slumps down, devastated.
DISSOLVE TO:
A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades
out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.
116
7/20/7
117.
GIGI (V.O.)
Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing
up. If a guy punches you, he likes you.
Never try to trim your own bangs.
Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get
closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even
closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He
escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat -
is a TINY WEDDING. About six guests. And Neil, waiting
for Beth at the altar.
GIGI (V.O.)
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending.
From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we
can see the living room of the lower apartment. Boxes
fill the room - clearly a new tenant moving in.
Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and
pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).
GIGI (V.O.)
And ultimately, we're not taught the one
thing that could save ourselves, our
friends, our families countless hours of
confusion, despair, and speculation.
She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She
steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk
two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.
We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear
it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an
awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -
NEW GUY
It was nice meeting you.
Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna
watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.
GIGI (V.O.)
That sometimes the happy ending...is just
moving on.
Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in
front of her.

He's Just Not That Into You
