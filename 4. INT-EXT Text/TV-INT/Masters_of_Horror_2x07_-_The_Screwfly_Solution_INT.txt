  A MOP sits in a bucket of BLOODY WATER.  On the floor nearby, 
    red-soaked rags are piled atop open sections of newspaper.  
  Joe is down on his knees with a dishcloth and a bottle of 
  Formula 409, trying to scrub crusted blood off the oven door.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 3.

  Problem is, it s stuck in the seams between the glass and the 
  metal housing.  With a sigh Joe gets up, trudges down the 
  hall, and returns with a TOOTHBRUSH.

  The toothbrush seems to work much better than the dishrag.  
  Joe is making excellent progress, whistling happily to 
  himself, when the DOORBELL RINGS.


  Joe opens his front door.  There are two police cars parked 
  outside.  Three armed STATE TROOPERS are standing on his 
  front porch and a fourth is waiting out at the curb.

                              TROOPER I
                Mr. Spriggs?

                              JOE
                  Officers!  What can I do for you?

                              TROOPER I
                Well, sir, we had a call that there 
                was a ... would you mind if we took a 
                quick look around?

                              JOE
                      (genuinely mystified)
                Please do.  I apologize for the mess.  
                I was just tidying up ...


  The bed has been stripped.  TROOPER II crouches beside a 
  laundry hamper and uses a pencil to lift out a flowered 
  sheet.  It s sticky with blood.


  TROOPER III has a discovery of his own.  The shower curtain 
  has been ripped off its rod.  It s neatly folded up in the 
  corner with a bloody bath mat and a bloody throw rug.


  At the rear of the garage a door bursts open, and Troopers II 
  and III enter with guns drawn, ready to shoot.  They work 
  their way around opposite sides of a gigantic SUV and 
  discover, in the spot where the second car would usually 
  park, a large, makeshift WORK TABLE resting on sawhorses.

  Atop the work table lie THREE BODIES wrapped in tarpaulins.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 4.

  The Troopers exchange a grim look and begin undoing the 
  canvases.  Within moments they ve revealed the faces of an 
  ELDERLY WOMAN, who is probably pushing seventy; a younger, 
  MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, mid-to-late forties; and a long-haired 
  TEENAGED GIRL, sixteen, maybe seventeen.


  At a desk sits ANNE ALSTEIN, a youthful 37, lanky, athletic 
  and quite lovely, in a slightly androgynous way.  Just at the 
  moment, though, her face is pained.  The shades are drawn 
  behind her; just off-screen, someone is gently SOBBING.

                              ANNE
                It s the third time, Brenda.  This

                The kids do not need to see their 
                mother looking like this.

  ANGLE WIDENS, and we get our first look at BRENDA: housewife, 
  early forties, her face a swollen purple mass of bruises and 
    abrasions.

                                BRENDA
                I have no one.  No one to turn to ... 
                but you.

  Anne takes her hand as she breaks down crying.

                              ANNE
                And we ll always be here.  But the 
                shelter is a stopgap solution.  You 
                need to make a real change.
                      (beat)
                Your sister.  In Florida.  Didn t she

                              ANNE

                                BRENDA
                I call.  Nick answers.  He says, 
                 She s out.   I say, where?  He says, 
                 I don t know.   I say, have her call 
                me.  And he says he will   but she 
                never does.

                              ANNE
                Does she have a cell?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                            "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 6.

                Yes.  She doesn t answer it.  I ve 
                left a dozen messages.  This has been 
                going on for a week.
                      (beat)
                The thing that scares me ... her 
                daughter lives there in town ... I 
                was worried, so I called her ...

                              ANNE
                And?

                                BRENDA
                And her husband answers.  He says, 
                 She s out.   I say, where?  He says, 
                 I don t know. 

  Anne seems to find this story rather unnerving herself.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  TIGHT ON a small television mounted under a cabinet.  It s

  adorable toddling PENGUINS.

  Amy is busy decorating a cake that says  Welcome Home, 
  Daddy.   She looks up at the screen and scowls.

                I just wish we could nuke those 
                fucking rag heads.

                They can t control their own urges, 
                Amy, so they try to control us 
                instead.  It s hardwired.  Women 
                nurture, men destroy.

                              ANNE
                Bella, that is steaming sexist 
                  bullshit.  My husband just spent five

                I love your husband!  He s a much

                      (winking at Amy)
                Never surrender.

  Anne rolls her eyes. Bella s attention returns to the TV 
  screen, where a troupe of gaunt, black-suited LOONIES   all 
  men   are waving protest signs:

                                ANCHOR
                  over 100 members of a religious

                Good God.  There s your  fucking rag 
                heads. 

  Anne stares at the screen; a graphic identifies the site of 
  the protest as  JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. 

                              ANNE
                  Jacksonville, Florida.  That s weird.  
                My client today was just saying  

  She never finishes the sentence.  Amy s heard a car pulling 
  up outside. She runs to the window.

                DADDY S HOME!!


  Amy races to the door and flings it open.  DR. ALAN ALSTEIN, 
  39 and deeply tanned, takes her in an embrace so tight it 
  nearly squeezes the breath out of her.

                              ALAN

                as your  

  He looks up, sees Anne in the hallway behind his daughter.  
  His face goes slack with joy.

                              ANNE
                Oh, Alan.

                              ALAN
                I can t believe how beautiful you 
                are.

  They fall into each others arms, and for a few blissful 
  moments they don t even notice anyone else.  Not Amy, not 
  Bella   who s standing there with the cake in her hands   and 
  not DR. BARNHARD BRAITHEWAITE, sixtyish and gay, who s 
  stranded on the front porch, luggage piled all around him.

                              AMY
                Hi, Uncle Barney!  Welcome home.

  As Barney gives Amy a hug and smooch, he makes eye contact 
  with Bella   his natural adversary of many years  standing.

                you in five months.

  Realizing that Anne and Alan have no immediate plans to 
    disentangle, the three of them head for the kitchen.


  Dinner is over, and the entire group is wolfing down Alan s 
    welcome-home cake (with generous helpings of ice cream).

                Bella doesn t have children.

  Bella sputters at this seeming non sequitur.

                              ANNE (CONT'D)
                You re in a clinic, in Colombia, like 
                Alan was, and there s a child, or a 
                baby, in agony, screaming ... facing 
                death, or paralysis, from these 
                  parasites.
                      (beat)
                Do you look at her mother and say 
                 It s okay, we re the pest ?

                              BELLA
                Look.  We mess with nature simply 
                because we can.  And it will catch up 
                with us.  And I do sometimes hope we 
                wipe ourselves out before we destroy 
                the entire planet.
                      (beat)
                But to answer your question, yes, I 
                would save the baby.

  Bella s cell phone rings.  When she sees the caller ID on the 
  display, a troubled look crosses her face.

                              BELLA (CONT'D)
                I m really sorry, but I have to take 
                this.

  She excuses herself from the table.  Anne and Alan exchange a 
  look of mild concern as Barney gathers dishes.

                              AMY
                Wow.  She s bugging tonight.

                                BARNEY
                Good old Bella.  The only 
                  epidemiologist who roots for the 
                disease.


  The Alsteins and Barney are in full cleanup mode when Bella 
  returns.

                              BELLA
                Afraid I have to do you the favor of 
                cutting this delightful evening 
                short.  That was the National 
                  Institutes of Health.  I m on a plane 
                tomorrow morning.

                              ALAN
                What s going on?

                              BELLA
                The bird flu has finally arrived.  
                Whole town s going under quarantine.

  There s something odd in her manner.  Barney shoots her a 
  skeptical look.

                              ALAN
                What town?

  Bella glances at Anne.  She hesitates before answering.

                              BELLA
                  Jacksonville, Florida.


  Amy in bed with her IPod, reading a paperback.  When she 
  pulls out her earbuds she hears RHYTHMIC MOANING from down 
  the hall.

  She immediately reaches for a cell phone on her night stand.

                              AMY
                Hi, it s me.  They re doing it.


  A noisy simultaneous orgasm   after which Anne, who s on top, 
  collapses into Alan s arms, smiling.  She makes a little 
  animal noise, rubs her face against his chest hair, buries 
  her nose in his armpit.

                              ALAN
                What are you doing?

                              ANNE
                I m smelling you.  I haven t smelled 
                you in five months.

                God, I missed you.  I d go to the 
                shelter, talk to the women there ... 
                I could just feel myself turning into 
                Bella.

                              ALAN
                I got back just in time.

                              ANNE
                Were you surrounded by native girls?

                              ALAN
                Yeah.  They were all nineteen.  I had 
                to teach  em to wear shirts.

  Smiling crookedly, she punches him in the chest.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                Now Barney made out okay.  He found a 
                couple of big strapping research 
                  assistants who received many a lavish 
                gift ...
                      (beat)
                I kept hoping to meet a bony-assed 
                blonde with a PhD. in romantic 
                poetry. They re kinda scarce there.

                We re so lucky, Alan.  When I m with 
                you it s like the whole ugly world 
                just goes away.

  Barney sits at a desk littered with printouts and news 
    clippings.  On the screen of his laptop is a news story: 
   FOURTH MULTIPLE HOMICIDE IN HOUSTON. 

  Beside the laptop is an open map of the U.S.  Barney makes a 
  red  X  over Houston.  There are five little x s in a neat 
  row running from Florida to Texas.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  TWO UNIFORMED MILITARY MEN in the front.  In the back, a 
  couple of (male) SCIENTISTS   and Bella.

  Bella is leafing through a dossier containing documents and 
  photos.  We see pictures of a young street preacher (labeled 
   RODNEY BEARDEN ) and a grinning G.I. ( PFC. WILLIAM  *
  HOLICKY )   and beneath those two, grisly crime-scene photos 
  of DEAD WOMEN on the floor of a bar.

  The car slows at a roadblock.  The DRIVER rolls down the 
  window and hands a sheaf of papers to an ARMED SENTRY.  *

  The Sentry examines the paperwork, then glances into the back  *
  seat and spots Bella.  His eyes bug out. *

  He signals for the driver to wait and vanishes with the sheaf  *
  of papers.  A moment later, we hear LOUD CURSING O.S.: *
                                                                                          *

                Step outside, please. *

  Bella climbs out of the car -- and realizes that the Sentry  *
  is already removing her bags from the trunk.  Maj. Heinz  *
  slaps the roof of the car, waves it through the checkpoint. *

                                BELLA *
                I'm here on orders from Washington, *
                D.C.  You have no authority to detain  *
                me here. *

                              MAJOR HEINZ *
                Do you understand the situation here,  *
                ma'am?  As of this afternoon we have  *
                eleven hundred homicides ... *

                              MAJOR HEINZ *
                ... all of them women.  Like you. *

  Before Bella has a chance to digest the news, Maj. Heinz  *
  turns away.  The Sentry grips her elbow -- firmly -- and  *
  steers her toward a STAFF CAR idling nearby. *

                                BELLA *
                Major?  I'm an epidemiologist.  I  *
                need to take blood samples.  Air  *
                samples.  Water samples. *

                              MAJOR HEINZ *
                We're talking murders, ma'am, not  *

                                BELLA *
                The two are related.  What do you  *
                think -- 1100 women all got a little  *
                too "mouthy"? *

  With a snort of resignation, Bella climbs in.  As the Major  *

  Bella is escorted down a long hallway by SGT. WILLARD MEWS.  
  They pass two men headed in the opposite direction: MAYOR 
  BLOUNT (mid-40 s, portly) and a PASTOR clutching a bible.

                              SGT. MEWS
                Mayor Blount.  Father.

  The two men DO A TAKE at the sight of Bella.  They seem 
    astonished   it s as if they ve just discovered a live 
  stegosaurus in the powder room.

  At the end of the hallway is a holding cell, and in the cell, 
  sprawled on his bunk, is PFC HOLICKY, looking rather less 
  jolly than in his photo.  His ribs are bandaged and his right 
  arm is in a sling.

                              SGT. MEWS (CONT'D)
                Private.  This is Dr. Sartiano.  You 
                are to answer her questions and 
                  cooperate with her in any way she 
                  requires.  Do you understand?

                              PFC HOLICKY
                I don t owe her any explanations.

  Sgt. Mews starts to go off on him, but Bella quiets him with 
    a gesture.  She unfolds a chair alongside the cell, pulls a  *
  notepad and micro recorder from her shoulder bag.

                              BELLA
                You re the one that killed the 
                dancer. *

                              PFC HOLICKY
                Well, ma am, I can t say for certain 
                who killed who.  I did my bit.

                              BELLA
                You regret it?

                              PFC HOLICKY
                Regret being in here.

                              BELLA
                Did you know this street preacher, 
                this Rodney Bearden ... ? *

                              PFC HOLICKY
                Never seen him before that night.  We 
                sure noticed him, though.  An 
                oddball.  Kinda stood out.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 18.

                In what way?

                              PFC HOLICKY
                Seemed unusual, that s all.  Fella 
                goes to a titty bar, and tries not to 
                look at the girls ... ?


  Sgt. Mews is on sentry duty outside.  He s reading a 
  religious tract, Back to Eden, when Mayor Blount takes a seat 
  on the bench beside him.

                              MAYOR
                Reading the book, I see.  What do you 
                think of it?

                              SGT. MEWS
                It s interesting, sir.  It s ... 
                deep.

  The Mayor claps an avuncular hand on Sgt. Mews s knee.

                              MAYOR
                Have you ever seen an angel, 
                  Sergeant?

                              SGT. MEWS
                No, sir, I haven t.

                I ll tell you something ... they re 
                not at all what you d expect.


  TIGHT ON THE SCREEN of Bella s laptop.  She s just Googled up 
  a news dispatch from India, and she s reading it so raptly 
  she barely notices that Mayor Blount has entered.

                              MAYOR
                Dr. Sartiano.  Did you find what you  *
                needed?

                Yeah, thank you, Mr. Mayor ... have a  *

  The jovial Mayor strolls behind the desk, looks over Bella s 
  shoulder at the screen.

                              BELLA (CONT'D)
                New Delhi.  A raft of corpses in the 
                river, so many the boats couldn t 
                pass ... all women.
                      (shaking her head)
                It s not just here.  It s global.  
                  Something s ... happened.

                              MAYOR
                  Something glorious has happened.

  Bella turns, suddenly alert, and stares up apprehensively at 
  the beatific under lit face of the Mayor.


  Sgt. Mews hears MUSIC coming from outdoors.  He gets up to 
  open a window.

  Just off the parking lot, under a tree, there s a whole group 
  of men   cops, soldiers, guardsmen   SINGING in eerie, 
  beautiful harmony.  They re led by the pastor we saw earlier 
  in the hallway, who is strumming his guitar under the big 
  elm.

  Sgt. Mews seems absolutely transported.  A look of blissful 
  calm spreads across his face as he HUMS ALONG.  He hears a 
  CRASH, a piercing SCREAM, and the sound of a scuffle in the 
  office behind him   but his only reaction is irritation.  The 
  noise is drowning out his beautiful melody.

    Eventually the Mayor emerges from the office behind him.

                              MAYOR
                I took care of that for you.

  The Mayor s face is covered with scratch marks.  His zipper 
  is open.  His crotch and his hands are covered with blood.  
  He gestures for Sgt. Mews to follow him into the office.


  Neither man shows any trace of emotion as the Mayor gestures 
  toward his handiwork on the floor.

                              MAYOR
                She was one of those crypto-females.  
                That s the worst kind.

  The doorbell is ringing frantically.  A groggy Alan stumbles 
  down the stairs in boxers, pulling a bathrobe around him.  He 
  opens the door and finds TWO FEDERAL MEN holding up ID badges 
  for his inspection.

                About ten minutes before she died.

  Anne stumbles down just in time to catch the tail end of the 
    conversation.  She and Alan exchange a look of shock.

  The Feds march down to a town car idling at the curb.  Barney 
  waves to Alan from the back seat.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  On a large projection screen, INSECTS swarm in profuse 
  numbers.  A series of progressively larger magnifications 
  bring us closer to the bugs, until a single pair of SPRUCE 
  BUDWORM MOTHS fills the screen   male and female locked in 
  what is obviously a MATING DANCE.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 25.

                This is the normal mating behavior of 
                the spruce budworm moth.  Now watch 
                what happens when we expose them to 
                the enzyme we developed.

  The onscreen video CUTS TO another pair of moths.  Instead of 
  moving behind the female, as in the previous shot, the male 
  budworm remains in front of her   and attempts to MATE WITH 
  HER HEAD.

                              ALAN [O.S.] (CONT'D)
                The male connects with the female, as 
                before, but the turning instinct is 
                now artificially blocked.  He s 
                  forgotten how to do it; he attempts 
                to mate with ... her head.
                      (beat)
                Needless to say, the moth pregnancy 
                rate goes drastically down.

  Now Alan steps in front of the screen.  He signals to Barney, 
  who s manning a laptop/projector combo at the back of the 
  room, and the lights come up.  The two of them are giving a 
    presentation to an roomful of openly impatient SCIENTISTS, 
  MILITARY BRASS, and POLITICIANS.  SUPER TITLE:

                  pornography has to do with our 
                current predicament.

  MILD CHUCKLES from the group.  Alan forces a smile.

                We believe, sir, that the recent

                Orlando, Shreveport, El Paso, 
                  Scottsdale, and elsewhere ... may be

                cycle.

  A HUBBUB in the room.  This appears to be a new idea.

                No.  It s tailored to one species.  
                To work on us, someone would have to

                In human, in most mammals, the male 
                sexual urge has always been closely

  CLOSEUP - MAP3535

  SLOW TRACK along a Mercator map of the world, with red lights 
  blinking on all along the horse latitudes: 30 degrees north, 
  30 degrees south.


  The entry of the shelter is jammed with women   a couple 
  dozen at least.  Most of them have a couple of hastily-packed 
    suitcases; they wear loose, shapeless clothing (hooded sweat 
  gear, etc.) that downplays any hint of sex.

  Trying to work her way through this mass of humanity is Anne.  
  She s on her cell phone, shouting over the din.

                              ANNE
                We can t take another busload!  We

                Flint? ... Fine, then.  We ll do what 
                we can, all right?

  Anne s client Brenda comes down the stairs and scans the 
  group: black eyes, bruised faces, an arm in a cast.

                                BRENDA
                Where s this batch from?

                Alabama, I think.  Know where we can 
                rustle up a couple of hundred spare 
                  blankets?

                                BRENDA
                      (chuckling)
                You know, Anne, all those months, I 
                thought you were normal, and I was 
                odd.  But now you see, don t you: I m 
                the normal one.  I was the normal one 
                all along.


  Anne pulls out of the parking space, so rattled she barely 
  notices the CONVERTIBLE speeding past -- nearly sideswiping 
  her.  The chortling FRAT BOYS in the back seat chuck a half-
  empty beer can onto the hood of Anne s VW.

  Anne hits the brakes; the ragtop cuts in front of her.  Three 
  or four REFUGEES are in the crosswalk up ahead, but the 
  convertible shows no sign of slowing even though the light 
  has just turned red.  In fact ... it ACCELERATES.

  SCREAMS from the intersection.  Anne and Amy watch in  *
  disbelief as the convertible screeches off, taking the corner  *
  at full speed.  PEDESTRIANS are already clustering around two   *
  refugee women lying motionless in the crosswalk. *

                              AMY
                Mom!  Oh, God!  Did you SEE THAT?

  Unable to take her eyes off the intersection, Anne hugs Amy 
  tightly.  She has a sudden sinking feeling ...


  A ROW OF VOLUNTEERS, all crewcut military types, strapped 
  into telemetric chairs separated by cardboard dividers.  Each 
  volunteer has his own individual TV, and the images we see as 
  we track past include:

      Cinemax-style soft-porn, with glistening bodies and lots of 
    dry-humping;

    Two female boxers duking it out in the ring; *

    A beer commercial, with a group of giggling bikini babes 
  playing volleyball as two nebbishy men look on;

    A Renaissance painting of Adam, Eve, and the serpent;

    Footage of a basketball game (for control purposes);

    An L-Word excerpt of two women deep-kissing romantically;

    B&D porn, in which a leather-clad dominatrix rides a masked 
  sub like a pony, smacking his ass with a riding crop.

  The volunteers wear huge helmets, like hair dryers; their 
  noses and mouths are covered with scuba-style breathing 
    apparatuses.  WIRES trail from sensors attached to their 
  temples, throats, chests, wrists, palms, and crotches.


  Watching the volunteers through a glass panel is Barney, 
    surrounded by monitors, printers, telemetric readouts.  He 
  makes a note on his clipboard and nudges a LAB ASSISTANT:

                I m sorry, sir.  The 7:40 is full.  
                It s already closed out.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 33.

                I need to be on that flight.

                                FEMALE AGENT
                You re late.  We might be able to 
                squeeze you on a nine AM tomorrow  

  Alan fumbles in his briefcase for a CDC ID badge.

                              ALAN
                Please.  I m with the Centers for 
                Disease Control.  We re trying to 
                keep this fucking thing from 
                  spreading and I need to be on that 
                flight, all right?

                                FEMALE AGENT
                Sir  

                              ALAN
                WHAT DON T YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND?

                                FEMALE AGENT
                I ll get my supervisor.

  The agent is obviously rattled   afraid of Alan in some deep 
  way   and the other women in line at the desk are all staring 
  at him with apprehension.  He stares sheepishly at the floor 
  and eavesdrops on the conversation one desk over:

                              AGENT II
                We have the seats, ma am, but it is a 
                mixed flight.  The next all-female 
                flight is tomorrow.

                              WOMAN PASSENGER
                      (staring directly at Alan)
                Then we ll wait.

                              WOMAN IN LINE
                WE LL TAKE IT!  WE LL TAKE IT!

  The SUPERVISOR   6 4  and burly   arrives to help Alan.

                                SUPERVISOR
                CDC?

  Alan nods yes, shows his badge again.  The supervisor 
  examines it, taps on a keyboard, and prints out a fresh 
  boarding pass, which Alan pockets.

  As he turns toward the gates, two AIRPORT SECURITY GUARDS  *
  pass, with an EXTREMELY LARGE WOMAN struggles in their grip:  *

                              LARGE WOMAN
                That plane is full of men.  You want 
                my gun, you re gonna have to take it 
                from me, bitch!


  Alan, settling into a seat in the back, phones home as other 
    PASSENGERS file into the cabin.

                              ALAN
                We get in at 9:12, so I should make 
                it home by ten.  Can t wait to see 
                you two.  I love you ...

  He snaps the cell phone shut.  A FLIGHT ATTENDANT   part of 
  the all-male crew   brings him a Coke and two little bottles 
  of rum, both of which he empties into the cup.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  Alan and Anne tucking Amy in for the night.  Anne gives her a 
  quick peck on the cheek.  Then Alan sits on the edge of the 
  bed and hugs her tightly. She gets him in a headlock and 
  plants smooches all over his face, refusing to let go.  
  Before long all three of them are giggling.                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 35.




  The grownups emerge from Amy s room and pull the door shut 
  behind them.  Alan starts to say something, but Anne shushes 
  him.  With one finger she pushes him back against a wall, 
  kisses him deeply, nuzzles his throat, his chest hair, 
  luxuriating in his scent.

  Their legs intertwine.  She opens her shirt, exposing one 
  breast, then clasps his head in both hands and forces his 
  mouth to her nipple.


  Not much foreplay tonight.  Anne topples backward onto the 
  bed, still only half-undressed, and Alan comes hopscotching 
  after her, one leg still in his trousers, boxers down around 
  his shins.  A moment or two of frantic kissing and he s 
  inside her.

  For an instant time seems to freeze.  All the frenzy 
    dissolves.  The awfulness of the last few weeks is forgotten.  
    Everything is back to normal.  Anne shudders.  A tear rolls 
  down her cheek.

  Alan wipes it away.  Smiles tenderly at her.  She meets his 
  gaze and chuckles slightly, surprised at the depth of her own 
  emotion.

  He begins to thrust rhythmically.  Anne lets out what is 
  obviously a loud moan (although we can t hear it), and   with 
  a quick glance toward Amy s room   Alan shushes her.

  But she s off in another world now.  She moans again, and 
  Alan,  with an indulgent grin, lays one hand gently across 
  her mouth.  She bites the heel of his hand.  Not too hard at 
  first   but after a few seconds, her teeth are really sinking 
  in.

  Alan winces.  Yanks his hand away.  Keeps thrusting.

  The next time Anne moans, his hand closes around her throat.

  Her eyes open suddenly.  She gazes up, more in confusion than 
  alarm, at his weirdly impassive face.  She tries to speak, 
  but his hand is jammed too tightly under her chin.

  Alan thrusts away.  With his free hand he fishes around in 
  the bedclothes and finds   God knows how it got there   an 
  enormous CLASP KNIFE.  He flicks it open, holds it up so that 
  Anne can see its enormous glinting blade.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 36.

  Her arms and legs flail, but she s pinned underneath him, 
  helpless . . . .

                              VOICE [O.S.]
                Oh, shit!

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:


  ALAN AWAKENS SUDDENLY.  Still in his seat, still in the 
  airplane, but utterly disoriented.  Just a nightmare.  Just a 
    nightmare.

  He glances down, realizes he s clutching a soda can.  In fact 
  he s crushed it in his fist   just as easily as if it were a 
  woman s throat.

  With a gasp he opens his hand and lets the can drop to the 
  floor of the plane.  His face grows pale, and sweat begins to 
  bead on his forehead.  He wants to cry.

  He s infected.

                              VOICE [O.S.]
                Shit!  Gimme a hand back here!

  Now he notices the MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS hurrying past his 
  seat.  There appears to be some sort of commotion in the rear 
  of the cabin.  He leans out of his seat, cranes his head, and 
  sees  

  A MALE PASSENGER, who is apparently having some trouble 
  entering the aft lavatory.  Mainly because the previous 
  occupant is sprawled half in the aisle, half in the john, 
  blocking the door.

  A WOMAN.  Obviously dead.  Obviously murdered.

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                What happened?  Did you see  

                              MALE PASSENGER
                Not my problem, man.  I m just trying 
                to take a fucking piss.

  The male passenger steps over the dead woman and locks 
  himself in the lavatory.  By now most of the people on the 
  plane are staring at the two attendants as they drag the 
  corpse to the rear of the aisle.  Several have gotten out of 
  their seats.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 37.

    CONTINUED:4747


  A WOMAN near the front of the plane begins screaming 
    hysterically.  Then another.  Then another.

  One of the flight attendants grabs a P.A. mike:

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                CLEAR THE AISLES.  Everyone.  Please.  
                STAY IN YOUR SEATS with your SEAT 
                BELTS FASTENED.  We re about to start 
                our descent and we need everyone to 
                REMAIN CALM.

  This advice only serves to agitate the screaming woman in the 
  front.  The man in the aisle seat directly across from her is 
  covering his ears with both hands.

                              AISLE PASSENGER
                Shut up, will you?  SHUT UP.

  He leans over and rabbit-punches her in the face.  If you 
  thought the screaming was bad before ....

  A third FLIGHT ATTENDANT leans over the sobbing woman and 
  tries to calm her.

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                Ma am.  Please.  I need you to 
                control yourself.  You re alarming 
                the other passengers.

  She screams again and starts batting at his face.  Losing 
  patience, he grabs her head between both hands and TWISTS IT 
    VICIOUSLY, snapping her neck.

  She slumps forward in her seat, silent at last.  The flight 
  attendant wipes his hands on the vest of his uniform.

                              AISLE PASSENGER
                Thank you.

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                Christ!

  As he strides toward the rear of the craft he spots another 
  WOMAN PASSENGER a couple of rows back, standing up, staring 
  at him in abject horror.  He points a finger at her  

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3 (CONT'D)
                BUCKLE THE FUCK UP!

  The woman passenger   who does, after all, want to survive 
  the flight   sits meekly and does as she s told.  The flight 
  attendant proceeds down the aisle ...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 38.

  CONTINUED: (2)4747


  ... passing ALAN, who s frozen in his seat, sweaty, glassy-
  eyed, clutching the armrests with white-knuckled hands: the 
  last semi-rational man in an airborne insane asylum.


  Amy is smearing icing on a freshly-baked welcome-home cake; 
  Anne is fixing dinner when the phone rings.  Her heart leaps.  
  She s almost afraid to pick it up.

                              ANNE
                Hello?

                              ALAN [O.S., FILTER]
                Honey ... ?

  She lets out an audible sigh of relief.

                              ANNE
                Oh, baby.  Oh God.
                      (covering the mouthpiece)
                Amy.  It s Daddy!
                      (into phone)
                Where are you?

  The remainder of the conversation is INTERCUT WITH:


  Alan, clutching his cell, stumbles forlornly away from the 
  other deplaning passengers.

                              ALAN
                I m at the airport.

                              ANNE
                Are you all right?

                              ALAN
                It was a ... strange flight.

                              ANNE
                Honey, I m so happy to hear your 
                voice. Amy s here. Let me put her on 
                 

                              ALAN
                No.  Anne.  Listen to me.
                      (beat)
                I m not coming home yet.  I m going 
                to the lab.

                              ALAN
                I m not coming home.

  Anne clutches the phone, ashen-faced, fully aware that 
  something has gone very, very wrong.  Amy grabs for the 
  receiver  

                              AMY
                I want to talk to him!

  -- but Anne pushes her brusquely away.

                              ALAN
                Two things.  I want you and Amy to 
                pack your bags, get in the car, and 
                go as far north as you can.

                              ANNE
                But  

                              ALAN
                I mean now, honey.  And the other 
                thing.  I want you to get a gun.

                              ANNE
                Alan, I don t know how to

                house before you leave   if I try to 
                follow you   I want you to shoot me.  
                  Understand?

  As Alan watches, an AIRPORT SECURITY TEAM hurries past, 
  carrying a pair of covered stretchers.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                Do you understand??

                              ANNE
                So it s here?  It s here already?

                              ALAN
                I love you, Anne.  I ve always loved 
                you.  But the next time I see you I 
                won t be me.

  A long silence.  Both of them are crying now.  They realize 
  this may be the last conversation they ever have.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 40.

  Shell shocked, Anne hands the phone over ...

  A snaky mountain road.  Anne in the passenger seat; Amy 
  driving, clutching the wheel unsteadily in both hands.

                              ANNE
                Don t ride the brake, honey.  Left 
                foot stays on the floor, okay?

                You keep saying I have to grow up and 
                you treat me like an infant.

  Amy takes a turn a little too sharply; the car skids toward 
  the shoulder, but she rights the wheel just in time.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                Sorry.

  Anne s foot is jammed against the imaginary passenger brake.  
  She exhales sharply, but somehow manages to keep her mouth 
  shut.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                We re not gonna go home, are we.

                me like one!

                              ANNE
                      (coolly)
                We re not going home.    Here s the 
                turn.

  A glum AMY turns the car onto a steeply angled dirt road, 
  barely wider than a footpath, that leads to a small cabin up 
  in the woods.  Anne s mood darkens visibly at the sight of 
  it.

  SMOKE is pluming from the chimney.

                              ANNE (CONT'D)
                Stop the car, Amy.

                              AMY
                What is it?

                              ANNE
                I think there s someone in Uncle 
                Barney s cabin.


    A breathless Anne bursts into the cabin and sees her daughter 
  standing before the fireplace   arms wrapped tightly around 
  Alan.

                              AMY
                Oh, Daddy, we ve missed you so much.

  Anne tenses, holding the gun behind her back, out of sight.  
  She can t shoot with Amy in the way.  Alan catches her eye, 
  raises a hand as if to say: stay calm.

                              ANNE
                Amy ...

                              AMY
                It s okay, mom.  Everything s going 
                to be okay.  We can go home.

                              ANNE
                Alan?

                              ALAN
                We ve had a little breakthrough, 
                honey.  Barney and I.  We think we 
                can get it under control.

                              ANNE
                Is that true?  -- Why haven t we 
                heard that from Barney?

                              ALAN
                I don t know.  I d thought he 
                would ve called you.

                              ANNE
                He told you we were here?

                              ALAN
                Why wouldn t he?

  Anne swings the gun around into full view.  With her free 
  hand she pulls a cell phone from her pocket.

                              ANNE
                Amy, step away from your dad.

                NO!!  What are you DOING?  Are you 
                crazy, or  

  Anne speed dials Barney, holds the phone to her ear.

                              ANNE

                Why didn t you call us?

                              ALAN
                I wanted to see you.  In person.  I 
                haven t seen you for ... weeks.

                Anne, I ve just come to take you 
                home.  That s all.

                              AMY
                I m going with Daddy.  You can t stop 
                me.

                              ALAN
                  Sweetheart ...

  She wraps herself even more tightly about Alan.  Anne stares 
  at HIS HAND as he runs it down his daughter s back.  There s 
  something distinctly unfatherly about the caress.  Not to 
  mention the weird cast of his eyes   the sudden shortness of 
  his breath ...

                              ANNE
                Let go of her, Alan.

                              AMY
                Let s go, Daddy.  Let s just leave.

                              ANNE
                Alan ... listen to me.  It s your 
                  daughter.  It s Amy.  It s your own 
                  daughter.

  After a moment Alan s face contorts horribly.  In a sudden 
  fit of contrition he FLINGS AMY to the floor.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 45.

                OH CHRIST.

  Anne s hands tremble.  She wants to pull the trigger and 
  can t.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??

  He charges toward her in a hideous rage.  She drops the gun 
  slightly and shoots him in the leg.

  He crumples to the floor, with Amy shrieking uncontrollably 
  in b.g.  Writhing in pain, he takes a vicious swipe at her; 
  she sidesteps it and shoots him in the other leg.

                              ANNE
                There s a first aid kit under the 
                sink.

                              AMY
                Daddy ... !

  Amy rushes to her father s aid.  Anne literally KICKS HER 
  AWAY.  She grabs her squealing daughter by the shirt, lifts 
  her off the floor, and backhands her across the face.

                              ANNE
                Get in the car.  I mean it.  GET IN 
                THE CAR.

  She shoves Amy out the door as Alan drags himself to the 
  kitchen, trailing blood across the floor.


  The little yellow bug careening through the mountains.  Anne 
  is paying no attention to the posted speed limit.

                              AMY
                How could you DO IT?  ... He didn t 
                do anything wrong.  He was just

                Thanks to you he s probably bleeding 
                to death on the floor right now.

                going on.

                Amy.  Understand something.  A long  *
                time ago your daddy told me what  *
                might happen to him.  He told me what  *

                The man I shot was not Daddy.  The  *
                man who pushed you out of the way so  *
                I could do it -- that was Daddy.  He  *
                did that because he loved you.  And I  *

                Oh, thank you, mommy.  Is that what  *
                you want me to say? *


    A deserted stretch of highway.  Anne's been driving for a  *
  long stretch with no break.  She slows the car, pulls over  *
  onto the shoulder of the road, and stops. *

  Amy is huddled in her seat, legs clutched to her chest,  *
  seemingly asleep.  Anne gives her a little shove, but the  *
  inert lump in the passenger seat doesn t stir.   *

  She reaches into the back seat for a BOX OF TISSUES and  *
  quietly opens the car door.  Before she steps out onto the  *
  deserted road it occurs to her that it might be wise to take  *
  the gun.  She silently opens the glove compartment and slips  *
  her .38 into a jacket pocket. *

  Anne closes the car door gently.  Amy doesn't move -- but her  *
  eyes pop open.  She hasn't been asleep after all.  She stares  *
  at the CAR KEYS dangling from the ignition ...  *
                                                                                          *

  Barney is sitting on the edge of the bed, scissors in hand.  
  The sound of screaming and crying brings memories flooding 
  back into Anne s head; she sits up, gasps, begins to cry.

                              ANNE
                Amy.  He was there -- he --

  Barney wraps his arms around her, pats her back.

                Shhhhh.  That's all over now.  We 
                have to get you out of here.

                              ANNE
                How did I get here?  I don't  

                                BARNEY
                  I brought you here.  Three days ago.  
                I'm afraid things have deteriorated.

  He adjusts the knit cap.  Then he reaches into his pocket, 
  pulls out a handful of dirt, and begins dabbing it around her 
  cheeks and chin.

                              ANNE
                What is that?

                                BARNEY
                Five o clock shadow.  Young man.

  He tips her chin back a little so he can inspect his 
  handiwork in the light from the lamp.  In dim light, if you 
  didn t look too closely, she could almost pass for a man.

                                BARNEY (CONT'D)
                Close enough for government work.  
                Can you pull on some pants?

  She swings her legs over the side of the bed and makes a 
  groggy attempt to stand   almost yanking over the IV DRIP 
  tethered to her arm.  Barney grips her arm, gently removes 
  the tape and the needle.  Then he throws her a pair of 
  coveralls from a gym bag.

  As she pulls them on we notice, for the first time, the 
  BANDAGES wrapped about her wrists.


  Barney leads the unsteady Anne, now dressed in coveralls, 
  flannel shirt, watch cap, and a long, heavy topcoat, into the 
  hallway.  Just outside the door to her room is an abandoned 
  gurney, the sheets soaked with blood.  A red trail runs along 
  the linoleum floor to a point eight or nine yards away, where 
  a FEMALE PATIENT lies motionless.

  Just across the hall, a dead NUN lies slumped in the doorway 
  of a patient s room.  Anne GASPS.

                                BARNEY
                Close your eyes.  Just follow me.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 50.

  She closes her eyes.  Barney keeps one hand on her arm and 
  another about her waist to guide her.  Random SCREAMS and 
  WAILING in B.G. as they proceed shakily down the hall.

  They almost collide with a PRIEST, who emerges from a nearby 
  room carrying a bible and a bloody scalpel, MUTTERING last 
  rites.  The Priest stops in his tracks   gives Anne the quick 
  once-over ...

  Nodding politely, Barney and Anne move on.  The Priest lets 
  them pass   and enters a nearby room, where a woman is CRYING 
  softly.  A moment later the crying abruptly stops.

                              ANNE
                Barney.  I can t  

                                BARNEY
                Shut up.  Keep moving.

  Barney leads Anne to the end of the corridor, and they turn a 
  corner, passing what appears to be the observation room of a 
  maternity ward.  There are no babies on display, but there 
  are bloody handprints on the inside of the glass.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INSERT   TELEVISION SCREEN6262

  An NFL game is in progress.  It is, after all, Sunday 
    afternoon, and even at the end of the world certain rituals 
  must be observed.  A linebacker makes an especially vicious 
  hit, and ONLOOKERS WHOOP APPRECIATIVELY.  SUPER TITLE:

                            Stewart, British Columbia*
                                        OCTOBER

  The onlookers   all male   are watching the game in:


    A cracker-barrel establishment: groceries, dry goods, 
    hunting/fishing gear, etc.  A geezer (NED) applauds the TV: *

                              NED *
                You see that hit?  Damn, you could 
                  practically hear the bones crunching 
                on that one!

  TWO HUNTERS enter with a 14-year-old, BILLY, in tow.  
  Greetings all around as the newcomers grab beers from the 
  cooler and settle in to watch the game.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 51.

                  a liberated zone!

  This brings high-fives and shouts of  Praise the Lord.

                And that s nothing.  Billy here saw 
                an angel of the Lord.

                              BILLY
                Two of  em!  Followed a deer down to 
                the creek by Humpback Rock and there 
                they were.

                              ONLOOKER
                What d they look like, Billy?

                              BILLY
                They got a glow to 'em.  They don t 
                look anything like their pictures!

  Listening to this conversation with some interest is a quiet, 
  lanky CUSTOMER who has been gathering up provisions in B.G. 
    throughout   salt, flour, kerosene, and a wide array of 
  medicines including aspirin, cough medicine, cold remedies.  
  In fact the stranger seems to be scooping up as much medicine 
  as he can carry to the counter.

  But he s not a  he.   He s Anne, in a shapeless down parka, 
  hair tucked under a wool cap, face covered with grime   a 
  slightly refined version of her hospital disguise.

                              OWNER
                One to a customer, sir.

  Anne replies in a breathy rasp, attempting to sound like a 
  man with laryngitis.

                              ANNE
                Look, I need the ... I ll pay.

  He points to a sign on the register:  One to a Customer. 

                              OWNER
                Smart people stock up for winter 
                before winter.

  He glowers at her.  She theatrically shoves the excess 
    medication to one side of the counter.  The owner rings up 
  what s left   a grand total, for one bag, of $329.40.                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 52.




  An 8x8 frame tent illuminated by a lantern.  Anne enters with 
  her newly purchased provisions.  She kneels to light a tiny 
  kerosene camp stove and sets a teakettle on it.

  Barney stares up at her weakly.  He s on his back in a mummy 
  bag, shivering, sweating, COUGHING violently.

                              ANNE
                I got what I could.  They wouldn t 
                sell me much ...

                                BARNEY
                Did they catch on?

                              ANNE
                I tucked my head and tried not to say 
                much.  Here, drink this.

  Leaning on one elbow, he downs a plastic capful of Nyquil.  
  Then he flops on his back, out of breath, wheezing.  With a 
  towel she mops his feverish brow.

                              ANNE (CONT'D)
                I m going to build a fire.

                                BARNEY
                No.  It ll draw the hunters.

                              ANNE
                Barney, we can t go like this all 
                winter.  In December it gets down to 
                thirty below.

                                BARNEY
                I won t make December, Anne.

                              ANNE
                Barney  

                                BARNEY
                Gotta face facts, Anne.  You have to 
                keep going.  As long as you re alive 
                the human race has a chance.

                              ANNE
                I need you, Barney.  I can t do it 
                alone.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 53.

                                BARNEY
                It s all right, honey.  I m an old 
                man.  I m ready.  Only wish I knew 
                who did this to us ...

                              ANNE
                You really believe that?  You think 
                it was deliberate?

                                BARNEY
                Oh, yes ... someone watched us, saw 
                the worst in us ... decided the world 
                would be a nicer place without us.  
                Maybe it will be.
                      (smiling weakly)
                Like Bella said.  The earth is a 
                garden, and we re the pest.  Well, 
                somebody finally called in the 
                  exterminator.


  Anne, nondescript in her cap-and-parka drag, wanders past 
  bare shelves, finding nothing on her shopping list.  In B.G. 
  NED THE GEEZER is hovering over the TV set, adjusting the  *
  rabbit ears, trying to find a watchable image:

                              OWNER
                Dammit, Ned.  You wanna watch TV?  
                Sit down and watch it.  That s all 
                the picture you re gonna get!

  TWO HUNTERS enter   both of them familiar from the previous 
  scene in the store.

                              OWNER (CONT'D)
                Howdy, boys.  Where s Billy?

  Hunter I, looking mildly stricken, pretends not to have heard 
  the question.  Hunter II shoots the owner a look which lets 
  him know he has committed a grave faux pas.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 54.

  Naturally the owner decides to take it out on the stranger.  
  He glowers at Anne as he shakes loose tobacco from a pouch 
  into a cigarette paper:

                              OWNER (CONT'D)
                You looking for something?

                              ANNE
                      (in her usual rasp)
                Ammo?

                              OWNER
                Gone.

                              ANNE
                  Fishhooks?

                              OWNER
                I ll see what I got in back.

  He steps through a door.  Anne, meanwhile, eavesdrops on the 
    conversation of the two hunters, who have just pulled a 
  couple of beers from a cooler.  One of them   Billy s dad    
  seems to be almost on the verge of tears:

                                HUNTER I
                It s a bitter thing, Carl.  I can t 
                grasp it.  I mean, Janet ... I 
                  understood the need for that, but  

                                HUNTER II
                Don t blame yourself. Remember 
                Abraham and Isaac.  It s the Lord s 
                will.

  By now Anne just wants to leave.  She glances down at the 
  counter, and notices the owner s tobacco pouch.

  There s a nipple on it.

  Suppressing a gasp, Anne looks up   and realizes that the 
  owner has returned with her fishhooks.  In fact, he s been 
  staring at her as she s been staring at the pouch.  She 
  glances over her shoulder, realizes that the hunters are now 
  giving her the stinkeye as well.

  She almost jumps at the DING! of the cash register ...

                              OWNER
                Forty.                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 55.




  As she drives away from the Red Deer General Store, Anne 
  happens to glance into the rearview.  She sees a RED PICKUP 
  TRUCK pulling out of the store lot behind her.

  It doesn t bother her at first, but when she checks the 
  mirror again she realizes the truck is speeding toward her, 
  pulling closer.  And when she squints to get a better look, 
  she realizes that the fellow in the passenger seat is 
  watching her ... with binoculars.


  The HUNTERS from the store, with a pair of panting BEAGLES on 
  the seat of the cab between them.  HUNTER I, riding shotgun, 
  lowers his binoculars:

                                HUNTER I
                Oh, she seen us, all right.

  In response to which, HUNTER I steps on the gas.


  It s almost dark.  Anne sees the headlights of the pickup 
  bearing down on her in the mirror.  Terrified, she reaches 
  over and turns her own headlights OFF   which makes the road 
  ahead almost invisible, impossible to navigate.


  Still clutching the wheel, Anne stares back over her 
  shoulder.  On the main road, the headlights of the pickup 
  streak past.  Her head sags and she sighs in relief.

  Then she hears brakes squealing in the distance.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 56.

  Within seconds the lights reappear.  The truck is backing up 
  slowly.  She knows the skid marks won t be hard to spot.

  She flings the door open, sprints off into the woods.


  ANNE sitting crosslegged near the entrance to a cave.  She s 
  in a heavy parka, wrapped in blankets to ward off the cold.  
  If not for the shotgun and the rifle at her side, she d look 
  like something from the Paleolithic era.

  A gust of wind blows out the tiny fire she s built for 
  herself.  She fumbles for a match to reignite the tinder.  
  There are three matches left in the box.

  She manages to get the fire going again, which gives us just 
  enough light to see her harrowed face as she recalls a VOICE 
  from that distant era when humanity ruled the roost:

                                BARNEY [V.O.]
                Like Bella said.  The earth is a 
                garden, and we re the pest.  Well, 
                somebody finally called in the 
                  exterminator.

  Anne s reverie is suddenly interrupted by ...
