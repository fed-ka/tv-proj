It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.
A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials.
MOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila.
MOCO
(into phone)
We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you a call, amigo.
AZUL (V.O)
That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money.
MOCO
(into phone)
Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime.
AZUL (V.O.)
I could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if I were to get out. So, yes, I want you to help me... my friend.
MOCO
(into phone)
Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you some people in a few days to get you.
AZUL (V.O.)
Really? Well, that's more like it. Just like the Moco I used to know.
Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in.
MOCO
(into phone)
Just hang in there my friend. I won't forget that you have been a big part of our success. What's wrong.
A large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the police car. Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach into the cab and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly towards the jail.
Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and enter the jail.
Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up.
A blue truck races towards the jail.
Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits patiently for his blue truck.
As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away. Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.
Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money, as if complaining.
Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand.
CREDIT SEQUENCE
The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing in the sun with a thumb in the air. The truck passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is carrying a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other. He is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera pans to a sign that reads "ACUA 18 miles".
Mariachi is walking around downtown Acua. He notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on the building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.
Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides to walk south.
As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar.
Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer him.
MOCO
(into phone)
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, ANSWER ME!!!
... and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of Azul walking away smiling as the image fades out.

Same low-angle shot of the outdoor sign displaying the name Hotel Coahuila. Mariachi walks into frame, and pulls out his wallet. Mariachi pulls out a few measly bucks then seems to be considering what to do next.
Mariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet. As he is walking away he notices the Pit Bull and he bends down for a closer look.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into phone)
Don't worry, Moco. We'll find him, and we'll mess him up real good.

CLOSEUP of Mariachi tapping.
Mariachi enters Domino's bar. DOMINO is waiting on a few bar bums that are nursing their jaws. Mariachi sits with them, asks for a refresco, He gets looks again. Domino serves him and he asks to see the owner. She says he's looking at the owner. He then asks her for work as a mariachi. She says she has no money to pay him. He looks arund the classy joint and knows she's lying (it turns out to be true, she has no money). When he asks how a girl can take care of herself in a town like this she stuffs a gun barrel in his mouth. He nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others laugh.
MARIACHI CHECKS IN TO HOTEL - DAY
Mariachi enters the run-down lobby of the motel. The Viejo Clerk at the counter is reading his yellowed newspaper. Mariachi sees the Pit Bull laying by the counter.
MARIACHI
Pit bull.
VIEJO CLERK
Yeah, pit bull.
MARIACHI
I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd prefer to pay you in a few days, after I've found some work.
VIEJO CLERK
S, later...
MARIACHI
Thank you...
The Old Man hands Mariachi a key for the second floor.
MARIACHI
Thank you, friend.
As Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him.
VIEJO CLERK
(different tone of voice)
Uh, excuse me seor? I forgot, I need a small deposit...
Mariachi stops in his tracks. He turns back to the Clerk slowly... thinking.
MARIACHI
(walking back slowly)
You can trust me.
VIEJO CLERK
I am very sorry, seor. But... how much can you spare?
The dog is watching the event.
MARIACHI
(disappointed)
I've only got a few pesos... I plan on finding work in town.
VIEJO CLERK
(grabbing money)
Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and... enjoy your stay.
The Clerk deposits the money, slams the register shut, and continues reading his yellow paper. Confused, Mariachi pockets his empty wallet and turns to find his room. The Clerk peeks over his paper, eyeing the guitar case as Mariachi goes. He hears the sound of Mariachi's footsteps trailing off. The old man drops the paper and bolts silently to the phone as he dials El Moco's phone number...
The Mean Dudes jump out of their truck and rush into the hotel, guns drawn.
The Mean Dudes run up the courtyard stairs and kick open the first door they come to and start blasting into the room. Screams are heard. The men stand back, and finally look down the steps at the Viejo Clerk who is waving his arms frantically.
VIEJO CLERK
127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!!
They run to the room numbered 127 and cautiously stalk towards it as they reload their guns.
Shot of men still stalking, cocking pistols.
POV shot of what men see, as camera nears the door.
Men kick open the door and burst into the room.
Mariachi runs out of the room and jumps off the stairwell onto the courtyard in front of the Clerk.
MARIACHI
(pointing to his room)
Cuidado, viejo!
Mariachi darts out into the lobby. The old man watches him go then turns his attention back to Mariachi's room.
VIEJO CLERK
(pointing in Mariachi's direction)
Pendejos!!!
The Mean Dudes run out of Mariachi's room, dart down the stairs, passing the old man who is telling them where to go.
Mariachi runs atop the Mean Dudes' parked truck then jumps into the bed of a passing truck. Mean Dudes run outside. The Dudes hve their hands up as if they don't know what to look for.
MEAN DUDE #5
He wears black!
Shots of lots of people walking around, wearing black items.
The truck turns a corner and the driver halts, comes out with a gun and tell Mariachi to get the hell out of his truck. Mariachi leaps out. He is about to continue running, but he stops, clenches his fists, and turns slowly as the camera dollies into his face.
Mariachi runs back in the direction of the hotel, but as he turns the corner he has to slow down for the Mean Dudes are everywhere. Each one has his gun out and is looking around for the man in black. Mariachi walks slowly, whistling and nodding to everyone as they pass. A few look suspiciously at him but continue searching. Mariachi ducks inside the hotel.
Mariachi rushes out the door, he looks down and sees the Mean Dudes entering the courtyard. He ducks his head back just as they look up to see him. Mariachi runs up a smal flight of steps, where he then tosses his guitar onto a balcony, which he then jumps over to himself.
The men rush up the steps shooting at the balcony. Bullets narrowly miss Mariachi as he climbs over the balcony to safety.
The Mean Dudes are climbing over the balcony like spiders. Mariachi runs back and slams his guitar into the first guy to make it over the balcony. His dummy falls down the stairs and over the narrow railing. The Dude splats on the ground in gruesome CLOSEUP.
The old man looks over at him as he dies, then turns back as if nothing happened. Mariachi bolts back down the hill.
Mariachi is looking down the balcony trying to find a way to escape. Mariachi looks behind him.
Mariachi flings his mace over an electric cable, then stands on the balcony lip, placing his guitar between his legs.
Mariachi is sliding down the cable and turns back to see Mean Dudes firing guns at him. Bus stops in traffic and Mariachi grabs his guitar and jumps onto the hood of the bus.
Mariachi jumps onto another car and then down into the street.
Mean Dudes exit the hotel and chase him on foot while a few get in the truck and chase him. The truck takes a short cut.
Mariachi is running through the sidewalks and streets in front os curioso shops, jumping small carts and children and cars to escape the two men behind him. He enters a small cutoff where the truck tries to stop him by heading off. The bad guys stick their heads and guns out of their windows and laugh as they ready to shoot him. Mariachi, though, already having built momentum, runs right up the front of the trucks as the guys try to shoot him but not succeed in only shooting each other as he runs up and over the cab, into the bed, and onto the street. He swings his guitar case into another guy's groin and grabs is gun, reaiming it to shoot Mean Dude #5. Mariachi shoots him in the arm, and Mean Dude #5 drops his gun and cowers away in pain. Mariachi then turns the guy's gun on him and shoots him in the chest. Mariachi grabs his case and as Mean Dude #5 turns to get s look at him, all he sees is the case coming into his face. Mariachi heads back for Domino's.
Moco is sitting in his pool. A swimming WAITER is bringing him drinks.
MOCO
(into phone)
Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've not answered all day. Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming!
AZUL
(into phone)
Six.
MOCO
(into phone)
What?
AZUL
(into phone)
I've only killed six! You were always bad at maths, Moco. I guess that's why you never paid me half of the money. You thought it all belonged to you.
MOCO
(into phone)
I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my friend. It's my nature. But you!!! You are modest! You've killed ten of my men!! I know, because I'm having them buried in my yard right now. With my dogs and cats.
AZUL
(counting on his fingers, into phone)
I killed six. But don't bother counting so soon. The number will triple by tomorrow.
MOCO
(into phone)
I'm sorry things turned out this way. My friend. I got greedy. I should never have tried to kill you. It would have been cheaper for me to pay you. Now I've got to find ten new men.
AZUL
(into phone)
Six.
MOCO
(into phone)
Ten.
AZUL
(into phone)
I tell you what. You give me my money, and I won't kill any more of your men... And I won't kill you.
MOCO
(takes a sip, into phone)
No, it's too late for that. We're going to have to see this through.
AZUL
(into phone)
Just like the Moco I used to know. Still wearing white?
MOCO
(looking down at his clothes, into phone)
What do you think?
AZUL
(into phone)
I think you should change clothes. I'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood.
Azul hangs up. He gets dressed and leaves. The little Rats are about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look at the girls. The girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away.
Moco answers the phone. Towel around his neck, wet hair.
Mariachi is out on the streets, returning to Domino's.
As he crosses the street he notices Azul leaving the saloon with a guitar case. Mariachi runs into the saloon.
Azul is walking to his truck when he turns to a corner and Mean Dude #4 sticks his gun in his face. Two more guns appear, pointed at the back of his head.
MEAN DUDE #10
Is this the guy?
MEAN DUDE #5
I'm not sure...
The two Rats are in the blue truck half a block away. One hits the other to look at what's happening to Azul.
POV of Rats seeing Azul with three guys around him with guns. They look at each other, start the truck and speed away.
MEAN DUDE #5
What's in the case?
AZUL
My guitar.
MEAN DUDE #5
Yeah? You're one of those old-time mariachis, huh?
AZUL
(pause)
Yes.
MEAN DUDE #5
OK, let's take a look.
Mean Dude #4 takes the case and lays it flat in Azul's palms.
MEAN DUDE #5
If it's a guitar like you say it is, we'll never bother you again...
Mean Dude #4 unsnaps two of the latches, SNAP SNAP.
MEAN DUDE #5
If it's not...
He unsnaps three more... SNAP... SNAP... SNAP!
MEAN DUDE #5
... then we'll spray paint this street with your brains.
He points the gun deep into Azul's face and cocks it. Azul closes his eyes. Mean Dude #5 lifts the lid. Azul hears a faint strumming sound, followed by the sound of the Mean Dude slamming the case shut. Azul opens his eyes. The Mean Dude resnaps the latches. SNAP... SNAP... SNAP-SNAP-SNAP!!!
MEAN DUDE #5
(walking away)
Sorry....
They walk away leaving Azul wondering what happened.
Azul watches the Mean Dudes go and when tey turn the corner he puts the case on the ground to open it.
The Mean Dudes are rounding the corner, but Mean Dude #5, who is last, snaps his fingers and motions to the others to keep quiet and to watch Azul
Mean Dudes are watching Azul unsnap his case.
Azul opens the lid, revealing Mariachi's guitar.
MEAN DUDE #5
That's him...
The Mean Dudes start walking towards Azul as the camera tracks back with them. Azul slams the case shut, wondering what the hell is going on. He looks up and notices the Mean Dudes walking towards him. He stands up and slowly walks in the other direction.
Mariachi is running through the streets and onto the sidewalk.
The bad guys are pulling out their weapons.
Mariachi bolts around the corner. Now everyone is on the same sidewalk. Mariachi and Azul are on each end of the street with the Mean Dudes in between them.
Azul turns and sees Mariachi with his guitar case. Mean Dude #5 turns and sees Mariachi, too.
MEAN DUDE #5
That's him...
The two other Mean Dudes exchange glances. Mean Dude #5 stalks after Mariachi, so the other two follow. Mariachi looks to Azul for help. Azul tips the imaginary hat to Mariachi and walks away.
Mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit. Bullets are flying as the Mean Dudes are firing at him as they run.
Mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end. He turns around, drops the case on the ground and opens it. A million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it. He is frantic. He grabs a small gun, shakes it in his hand, doesn't like the feel. He tosses it back in.
The Mean Dudes are barreling down the street. One turns towards the dead end.
Mariachi pulls out the MAC-10 and blasts the first Mean Dude he sees. He grabs the case and runs out into the street, jumping onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up there. He sees Mean Dude #5 run away.
Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion. Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the killer. Mariachi walks straight to the bar. A BOY is bouncing a ball on one of the sidewalks.
Mean Dude #5 comes in and approaches Moco.
MEAN DUDE #5
He got away... but I got a good look at him.
Moco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth.
MEAN DUDE #5
Coca, Caca, Beto were killed.
Moco takes out a match.
MEAN DUDE #5
He won't get away again, Moco. I promise.
Moco lights his match across Mean Dude #5's face and lights his cigarette. Mean Dude #5 walks away, as Moco flicks his match at him in slow motion.
Mariachi walks down the sidewalk, passing curioso shops. The camera is low and zoomed in all the way. Mariachi stops by one of the window that has a guitar in the glass. He pulls his money and counts it. He stops after he notices someone's reflection in the window. He turns around and sees it is Mean Dude #5 right across the street. He meets up with another Mean Dude. They are standing right behind Mariachi. Mariachi is pretending to still look at the window. The Mean Dudes walk past Mariachi so Mariachi walks in the opposite direction. Mean Dude #5 stops and then turns around slowly. Far zoomed shot of Mariachi walking down the street with guys behind him. They start after him.
MEAN DUDE #5
That's him...
Tracking shot following Mariachi.
Tracking shot in front of Mean Dudes walking at Mariachi.
Mean Dude #5 pulls out a small walkie-talkie and calls his buddy in the truck a block away.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Loco, he's headed your way... black pants, white shirt.
IN A TRUCK DOWN THE STREET
LOCO starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the street. As he turns on the corner, Mariachi sees the truck and casually climbs inside and hides in the back. Mean Dude #5 turns the corner when whispers into walkie-talkie.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Where did he go, Loco?
LOCO
(laughs, into walkie-talkie)
He got in my truck.
Mean Dude #5 laughs.
MEAN DUDE #5
(into walkie-talkie)
Take him around the block.
Mean Dude #5 taps his buddy and they start running down the block.
Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon. The truck stops. Mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his head.
POV Mariachi sees the two Mean Dudes walking at him. Mariachi turns and Loco is there to knock him in the face with the rifle butt. Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from his dizzying head. He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in the truck now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard... Blackout.
DUSTY ROAD TO MOCO'S
Mariachi is unconcious in the back of Loco's truck. Mean Dude #5 and other Mean Dudes are riding in back with Mariachi.
The above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of Loco. Loco arrives at the gate, Mean Dude #5 opens the gate, they drive through. The truck is facing Moco so he can't see Mariachi yet. Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to the truck, opens the back door, and calls Moco over. Moco walks over to the truck and looks inside.
Mariachi is laying there unconcious, Moco puts his arm around Mean Dude #5, who is looking very proud, and Moco pulls out a cigarette and a match.
MOCO
That's not him.
Moco strikes the match behind Mean Dude #5's head. Mean Dude #5 stops smiling.
Azul walks into frame, looks around then proceeds into the bar.
Mariachi is still in Loco's truck.
MARIACHI
Stop here.
Loco stops the truck and Mariachi gets out. Loco drives back when Mariachi motions for him to leave. Mariachi watches him go then dashes around the corner to the saloon.
Moco is walking away from the bodies.
MOCO
Bring that musician out here so he can be reunited with my Domino.
Some men go to check.
Cut back and forth with Mariachi coming.
MEN
He's gone, sir.
MOCO
Find him!!
Mariachi rides through the semi-open gate... stopping at the bodies. He dismounts the bike and holds Domino.
He has the gun in the back of his pants. You can see it while his back is to the camera and men are approaching him. Moco comes for the show.
MOCO
(good shot)
So you're the little mariachi that came to town, killed my men, and stole my girl...
Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.
MOCO
You are very talented.
Mariachi stands, hands up.
MOCO
I bet you play the guitarra real well, huh?
Mariachi says nothing.
MOCO
(raising gun)
Not anymore.
Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces, crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand. When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole.
MOCO
Now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you!!!
Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no one else laughs. Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back. When he rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots Moco in the chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard. He gasps for air...
Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to check Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He turns and walks away. The others follow.
Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.
MARIACHI ON THE ROAD
He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on the motorcycle to drive off. We notice the metal brace on his hand.
Mariachi rides into the sunset road. He speeds pas a sign: "ACUA 18 miles"
"Coming soon
