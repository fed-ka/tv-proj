      Bursting out of the shadows, the motorcycle rockets into an 
      alleyway. Despite the wind at his ears, Isaac s hearing 
      focuses, other sounds fading under--

      Movement. Feet pounding pavement.

                                  ISAAC
                    I hear someone. Someone s coming.

      The Girl responds fast, cutting a corner and heading for--


      An empty street. Open road ahead. As the Girl increases the 
      speed, Isaac glances back. SOMEONE races after them. 
      Incredibly fast, eyes GLOWING RED. It s an ALPHA. And, most 
      astonishingly, he s catching up to them.

                                  ISAAC
                    Faster!

      The Alpha moves to their right and a strikingly handsome face 
      comes into view. A clawed hand rises to attack when--

      HE DISAPPEARS, falling back, as if swallowed up by the 
      shadows.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Look out!

      The Alpha HURTLES in from the left, CLAWS swiping out. The 
      motorcycle BUCKS, back tire kicking up gravel. Then, just as 
      suddenly, the Alpha vanishes back into the shadows.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/123.

      With a SNARL, he appears on the right, hurtling at the bike 
      to swipe at it again. But the Girl BRAKES hard, letting the 
      Alpha surge ahead. She pulls into a turn and--

      CLAWS LASH OUT, cutting at the back of the motorcycle, nearly 
      crashing it.

      The Alpha appears on the left. Then on the right. Bursting in 
      and out of the shadows from each side, as if he s somehow 
      everywhere.

      But when Isaac looks back again, the truth is revealed. There 
      are TWO PAIRS of RED EYES following them.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Two of them.

                                  GIRL
                    Twins.

      Equally handsome. Equally terrifying. They fall back as the 
      Girl makes a desperate turn off the street.


      BRAKES SQUEALING, the motorcycle comes to a halt. The 
      alleyway ends in a wall. Isaac and the Girl are locked in. 
      She quickly spins the bike around to turn back.

      But the Twin Alphas appear at the other end of the alley. 
      Catching their breath. Taking their time to approach.

                                  GIRL
                    Remember what I said before?

                                  ISAAC
                    Hold on?

                                  GIRL
                    Hold on.

      She REVS the ENGINE just as one Twin charges forward while 
      the other bends down. The first puts his foot on the second s 
      back and pushes off.

      FLIPPING UP with acrobatic grace, the Twin launches toward 
      the Girl and Isaac to attack.

      But the motorcycle BLASTS forward, SMASHING RIGHT THROUGH THE 
      DOORS OF THE BUILDING and--     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/124.



      Doors flung open, Scott and Stiles jump from the Jeep. They 
      race to the other car where Lydia and Allison stumble out, 
      glass fragments falling from their clothes.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                  LYDIA
                    It came out of nowhere--

                                  STILES
                    Are you hurt?

                                  LYDIA
                    --ran right into us--

                                    ALLISON
                    --I m okay, I m all right.

      Catching her breath, she looks into Scott s eyes, both of 
      them noticing his hands on her arms, the kind of touch that 
      could easily become an embrace.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, I m not okay. I m completely 
                    freaked out. Why the hell did it do 
                    that?

      Letting Allison go, Scott cautiously approaches the deer now 
      lying still over the crumpled hood of Lydia s car.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I saw its eyes right before it hit 
                    us. It s like--like it was crazy.

                                  SCOTT
                    No. It was scared.

      He places a gentle hand on the animal s body.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      Actually... terrified.

      Slowly gazing up to the surrounding woods, he searches the 
      shadows, trying to find whatever it might have been that 
      literally scared this animal to death.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1213.



      A sea of backpacks flooding the school lot on the first day 
      of class. RACING past buses and cars, a student hurtles in on 
      a beat-up, used MOTOCROSS BIKE. 

      As he parks, the helmet comes off to reveal Scott, wearing a 
      proud smile at his upgrade from bicycle.    TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1218.

      Until he looks over to see a jet black, clearly very 
      expensive MOTORCYCLE next to his. And, interestingly, the 
      same exact motorcycle parked right beside it.

      Unnerved, Scott gazes about, trying to spot the owners. But 
      all he sees are ordinary teenagers hurrying inside an 
      ordinary high school.
