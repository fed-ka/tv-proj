      FEDERAL MARSHALS stand guard outside an Incredible Home as 
      they monitor MOVING MEN load a few boxes into a small Moving 
      Van.  The Marshals escort AMANDA (30 s), her two children 
      WILL (14),SARA (15), and their PeekapooGIDGET to their SUV.  
    The SUV and VAN pull away from their Federally-seized home.

                                  WILL
                    Mom, I can t believe they took my 
                    PlayStation!

                                  SARA
                    And my doll collection!

                                  AMANDA
                    They re just things, honey.

      ESTABLISH AMANDA S SUV DRIVING ON I-10

    The SUV passes the sign  You re leaving California!   Gidget, 
    on the console next to Amanda, barks.  

                                  AMANDA
                    The important thing is that we have 
                    each other.

      Will and Sara look at each other, not convinced.


      Sara whines at the dumpy  MOTEL 4  as they pull up.

                                  SARA
                    4?  We can t even afford Motel 6?

                                  AMANDA
                    Things will be better when we get to 
                    Dallas.  I promise.

      ANGLE ON AN ELEGANTLY MANICURED HAND with a big-ass diamond 
      pulling back a drape inside Darlene s house.


      Amanda s mother GIGI (sexy 50 s) comes out, yells. 

                                  GIGI
                          (to the dogs)
                    Tony!  Get down!  Romo!Behave.

      DARLENE S POVFROM HER LIVING ROOM WINDOW

      It s MAYHEM.  Sara s on the roof of the car clutching the 
      insanely yapping Peekapoowhile Gigi and maid LUPEwrangle 
    the Dobermans and Amanda protects Will from the dogs.


      Dogs calmed.  Amanda s greeting her estranged mother.  Gigi s 
      meeting her grandchildren for the first time since they were 
      babies.  Years of emotion flow.

                                  AMANDA
                    Mom.  This is Sara.  And Will.  All 
                    grown up.

                                  SARA/WILL
                    Hi/Hey Grandma.

      Gigi, overcome by this, breaks down into tears.    

                                  GIGI
                    No one s ever called me Grandma...

      This sets off the emotional waterworks in Amanda.  They all 
      hug. Then Gigi finishes her thought.  

                                  GIGI (CONT D)

                    Wow.  She had that body in high 
                    school?

                                  GIGI
                    Yep.  But now there s a lot more of 
                    it.


      Heather s FACE is on all signagefor SAPPINGTON REALTY.  She 
      strides into her building.


      Gigi leads a reluctant Amanda, Will and Sara to the church 
      entrance.  Amanda continues her protests.

                                  AMANDA
                    We didn t raise the kids with any 
                    particular religion, I encourage them 
                    to find their own spirituality.                                                                                        14.

                    are going to church so they can go to 
                    heaven.  End of story.  Amen.

      Gigi opens the church door.  They enter.


      Amanda, Gigi, Will and Sara leave.  

    As Amanda walks to the car, she can t help but notice the 
      Bulletin Board on the church lawn that announces today s 
      sermon topic -- YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.  Will questions the 
      phrase.                                                                                        19.


                                  WILL
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  AMANDA
                    That s Texan for Karma.

      Digesting the simple but potent theme, Amanda has a 
      revelation.  The light bulb goes on.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    You know what, mother? I think I just 
                    figured out why I m here.


                                                                                FADE OUT.                                                                                        20.


    ACT TWO


      Sara s scream was inspired by a big MERCEDESparked in the 
      driveway with an enormous bow on its hood.

      Gigi sees the car and gets even more excited than Sara.

      Amanda is dumbfounded.  She opens the card addressed to 
       Amanda .   From a Secret Admirer .  


      ANGLE ON THE CORNER OF THE QUAD where loner Will skateboards 
    to a solitary spot with his lunch.

      A FOOT deliberately trips up Will, sending him sprawling.  
      It s Darlene s son Landry with Sharon s spawn Bozeman.

                                  WILL
                    Not cool.

    As Will picks himself up, dusts himself off...

                                  LANDRY
                    Definitely not as cool as the way your 
                    Daddy bought it.

                                  BOZEMAN
                          (high fives Landry)
                    Ouch!

      Will can t keep a lid on it.

                                  WILL
                    Don t you redneckshave a lunch date 
                    with some sheep or something?

                                  BOZEMAN
                    Tell you what -- I d definitely meet 
                    your mamabehind the barn.                                                                                        27.


      That s it.  They throw down.

      ANGLE WAY ACROSS THE QUAD

      Sara, Alexandra and McKinneynotice the scuffle.

      Alexandra tsksher disapproval.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Bullying.  Such a scourge.  Putting a 
                    stop to it is so important.

                                  SARA
                            (recognizing Will)
                    Wait!  That s my brother.  Will!

                                  MCKINNEY
                          (an idea)
                    I m chairman of the Student Harassment 
                    Committee.  You should join.  

    As Sara runs away toward the scuffle, McKinneycalls...

                                  MCKINNEY (CONT D)
                    We have a zero tolerance square dance 
                    once a month.


    As Amanda blasts out the front door, a lottaactivity in 
      front of Gigi s house.

      A NEIMAN MARCUS delivery truck is delivering half the store, 
      stacking the boxes at the front door.  Gigi is ecstatic.  
      Lupehangs onto the Crazy Dogs.  Sara s joined the fray.

                                  GIGI
                    Look at all this!

      JOBETH MARIE presents herself to Amanda.

                                  JOBETH
                    Amanda Vaughn? I m Jobeth Marie, your 
                    personal NeimanMarcus shopper. So 
                    nice to meet you.

                                  AMANDA
                    Likewise, Jobeth but this is a 
                    mistake. I m not shopping...

                                  JOBETH
                    Well, someone is.  This is all for 
                    you. 

                                  SARA
                    Secret admirer strikes again.                                                                                        33.


      A DELIVERY GUY rolls a rack of clothes past Gigi. 

                                  GIGI
                    Ooo.He s got good taste.

                                  AMANDA
                    What?  Take it all back.  

      Gigi snags a little black Chaneloff the rack.

                                  GIGI
                    Not this one.

      Amanda instructs Gigi re: the NM boxes.

                                  AMANDA
                    Mother, this is unacceptable.  

                                  JOBETH
                    But...

      Gigi slips inside with the black Chaneldress.  

                                  AMANDA
                    No buts.  Back.  All of it.

      ESTABLISH EVENING OVER GIGI S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

    The NeimanMarcus delivery truck is pulling away.


      Heather sees something floating in the pool.  She gets a pool 
      hook and fishes out a bra. Heather is reeling from what 
      must vegone on here.  

      Then she s startled when a BIMBO in a towel rushes up, 
      snatches the bra from Heather with a relieved...

                                  BIMBO
                    There it is!

                                  HEATHER
                    Uh... is... isTom here?

      A beat of recognition flashes across the Bimbo s face.  She 
      scurries and yells up the stairs.

                                  BIMBO
                    Tom!  His name was Tom!

      Another BIMBETTE bounces down the stairs buttoning up, 
      remembering...

                                  BIMBETTE
                    I told you his name was Tom or Tim or 
                    something like that.

    The Bimbette takes the panties from a stunned Heather with a 
      perky,  Thanks .

    The two girls scamper out of the mansion leaving Heather 
      trying not to hyperventilate.                                                                                        42.


      ESTABLISH NORTHPARK SHOPPING CENTER - MORNING


      Sharon runs and dives into Darlene s car, ducks down.

                                  SHARON
                    Drive it like you stole it.


      Amanda, with portfolio, is dressed for her first job 
      interview.  She strides in with confidence.


      Sara walks with McKinneyand Alexandra.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    So.  What are your ambitions?                                                                                        44.


                                  SARA
                    Ambitions?

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Yeah.  You know... cheerleader?  Pep 
                    squad?  

                                  SARA
                    That s considered an ambition?

                                  MCKINNEY
                    Is your Mom cool?

                                  SARA
                    We re not going to the Longhorn Ball.

      Alexandra and McKinneyreact with shock then sympathy.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Then you have to tell everyone you re 
                    going to Europe for the weekend.

                                  SARA
                    That s stupid.  We re not going to the 
                    ball, that s all.  Besides, Mom wants 
                    to focus on her new job.

                                  MCKINNEY
                    Oh, that s so great.  What s her job?

                                  SARA
                    She s consulting for some thing called 
                    the Hill Country Hotel Group.

      Alexandra s eyes brighten.  This is scoop for her mom.

                    I d forgotten how amazing this party

                    Best meat market in the world.
                          (sincerely)
                    Amanda Vaughn - can I just tell you 
                    how happy I am that you re back in 
                    Dallas. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Honestly?

                                  HEATHER
                    I hadn t realized how boring things 
                    had become since you left. 

      Amanda hugs her.

                                  AMANDA
                      Sweetheart, that s the nicest thing 
                    I ve heard in a long time. I needed 
                    that. Thank you.

      Heather spies Tom Harrington over Amanda s shoulder. 

                                  HEATHER
                    Excuse me...

      ANGLE ON TOM as Heather approaches.

                    I m sorry the house didn t work for

                          (blushes)
                    I, gosh, I should probably explain 
                    what happened.  I invited over my COO 
                    and he was with some cheerleaders...

                    looking.  There are other things I

    She walks off.  Tom s POVof Heather walking away.  Her 
      outfit is basically backless.  He gets the message.

      ANGLE ON THE MECHANICAL BULL where Alexandra is riding it.  
      Sara and McKinneycheer her on.  Suddenly, on a particularly 
      violent buck, Alexandra s wardrobe malfunctions.  Her NEW 
      BOOBS pop out of her bustier.

      Cricket and Blake rush up as Sara and McKinneyhelp Alexandra 
    off the bull.  Blake throws a horse blanket around his 
      mortified daughter.

                    I told you.  Didn t I tell you?  
                    They re too big.  Aren t you glad you 
                    didn t get the 36 s?

      ANGLE ON THE BIG STAGE where the live auction  Let  Er Buck 
      Chuck  is about to begin.

                    This most generous item is donated by 
                    Sharon Peavy.

    ON THE SCREEN the MUG SHOT of Sharon that Amanda got at 
      Neiman spops up.  (It s a still from the NM security footage 
    at the moment Sharon was asked for her ID.)  Her mouth and 
      eyes are wide open.  It s a horrid picture.   

    ON AMANDA S triumphant look to mortified Sharon.  She 
      saunters to her as BIDDING BEGINS on the gift card.

                                  AMANDA
                    To err is human, and I m divine for 
                    forgiving you, Sharon.  Besides.  I 
                    wouldn t want to see you in jail.  
                    Orange jumpsuits aren t slenderizing.

      Sharon yanks Darlene over. 

                                  SHARON
                    She made me do it.  Darlene made me do 
                    it.

                                  DARLENE
                          (to Amanda)
                    Darlin .We were simply trying to 
                    ease your suffering by finding out 
                    who s been stalking you with gifts.  

      Cricket has joined the GCB s.                                                                                        55.


                                  CRICKET
                      Congratulations, Amanda. Blake just 
                    told me he hired you on as a marketing 
                      consultant. He always did have a soft 
                    spot for you. 

                                  AMANDA
                    I think he has a soft spot for all 
                    women, Cricket. But you re the one he 
                    fell in love with. 

    She takes their hands.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Ladies, I just want to tell you how 
                    sorry I am for how I behaved all of 
                    those years ago. I had a mother I 
                    couldn t stand, a daddy who spoiled me 
                    too much and a princess streak a mile 
                    wide. I know I didn t treat you all 
                    with the kindness and respect you 
                    deserved - but I m back home now, and 
                    I hope you ll let me prove to you that 
                    I ve changed. And can be a good 
                    friend. Will you at least let me try?

    The women look at Amanda, then each other. They nod.

                                  SHARON
                    Of course sweetheart.

                                  CRICKET
                    Yes.

                                  DARLENE
                    I ve been praying for this moment for 
                    a long time.

      They fall into a group hug. 

      Sharon sees a waiter go by with a passing tray.

                                  SHARON
                    Oh lord, there go the deep fried 
                    twinkies.I only eat them once a year.

    She runs after them. The BAND begins to play Donna Summers, 
       BAD GIRLS . Blake approaches Cricket.

                                  BLAKE
                          (excited)
                    Cricket, babe - I think they re 
                    playing our song.

      Cricket takes Blake s hand as he pulls her onto the dance 
      floor. We can see the fun and delight she takes in this part 
    of her marriage.

    Now it s just Amanda left with Darlene.                                                                                        56.


                                  AMANDA
                    How lucky for Cricket. A husband that 
                    likes to dance.

      Darlene narrows her eyes at Amanda.

                                  DARLENE
                      Sweetheart, don t think I m buying 
                    this redemption story for one second.

                                  AMANDA
                    Excuse me?

                                  DARLENE
                    I saw you kissing Sharon s husband at 
                    the car dealership. Breaking # 7 and # 
                    10. And God knows what else you ve 
                    been up to since you ve arrived in 
                    town. You may think you re good. You 
                    might pretend to be a Christian. But 
                    honey... I think you re a bitch.

    AT THAT MOMENT, a very SMALL KID (5) dressed in chaps runs to 
      Amanda and hands her a gift box.

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    This is for you.

      EVERYONE, including Darlene is interested and gathers around 
    as Amanda opens the box with dread.

      It s a GIANT CROSS PENDANT encrusted with diamonds and 
      matching earrings.  Gigi sighs.

                                  GIGI
                    Dear God.  Another present?

      Amanda looks around for the Little Cowboy.  He s vanished.  
    She sprints through the THRONGS, finds him.

                                  AMANDA
                    Hi.  Listen.  Who gave you this box?

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    I dunno.

                                  AMANDA
                    Well, then.  Can you remember anything 
                    about how he looked?

    The Little Cowboy thinks, then beams.

                                  LITTLE COWBOY
                    Yeah.  They was wearing a cowboy hat.

    The Little Cowboy runs off into the crowd, disappears.

    ON AMANDA looking around.  In a WIDE SHOT WE SEE she s in the 
      middle of a SEA OF 2000 COWBOY HATS.

      ESTABLISH GIGI S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                                                                                        57.
